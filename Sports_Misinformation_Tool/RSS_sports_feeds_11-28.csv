The rivalry between No. 24 Kansas State and No. 18 Iowa State is one of the longest continuously played series in college football. The two schools have played each other every year since 1917, making this the 108th straight season and the eighth-longest uninterrupted active series in the FBS. The Wildcats travel to Ames, Iowa, on Saturday with plenty on the line for both teams. Kansas State still has a slim chance to reach the Big 12 Championship Game and a possible berth in the College Football Playoff. The Cyclones have an even better shot at the conference championship game. K-State (8-3, 5-3 Big 12) is coming off a convincing 41-15 victory over Cincinnati. They need a win on Saturday and a combination of several other outcomes to make that league title game berth possible. To reach the title game, Iowa State (9-2, 6-2) needs a little help. The Cyclones require a win and losses by two of the other three teams in the four-way tie at 6-2 in league play: Arizona State, BYU and Colorado. ""I'm really excited about this week, getting an opportunity to go play Iowa State,"" Kansas State coach Chris Klieman said Monday. ""It will be a great environment, a great atmosphere. The game has meaning. ""Going back and looking at film, I thought our guys played great in all phases. Getting off to a fast start was important."" Kansas State fans are lamenting back-to-back losses earlier this month at Houston and at home to Arizona State. With just one of those going the Wildcats' way, they would control their destiny. But Klieman and his team are proud of the stability the Cats have showed in winning at least eight games in each of the last four seasons. ""It's hard to win college football games,"" Klieman said. ""It's expected, and you want to win every game. (But) it's difficult to win. The stability and success that our staff has brought here tells a lot about the players they have brought here and the men who are leading these guys."" Iowa State has won four of the last six games in the series after stopping a 10-year Kansas State streak. Iowa State leads 53-50-4 in the all-time series. Iowa State is looking to reach 10 wins for the first time in the program's 133-year history. They've won nine games for the fourth time, but just the second time (1906) that they've done it prior to a bowl game. Amazingly, Iowa State last won a conference championship in 1912 when the Cyclones captured their second straight Missouri Valley title. Now, the opportunity to change that stat is there for the taking. But head coach Matt Campbell is not looking past Kansas State. In fact, he said at his Tuesday press conference that he hasn't even looked at the tiebreakers. ""That's a question for a wise football coach,"" he said. ""I don't have much wisdom for that one. All my belief is that if our football team takes care of us, then we will put ourselves in the best position to be successful. We'll tell our story at the end of the season."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

No. 8 Kentucky has a brand new roster, led by a brand new coach. Six games in, it hasn't seemed to matter at all. The Wildcats have are off to a 6-0 start ahead of Friday's home meeting with Georgia State. Under first-year head coach Mark Pope and an entirely revamped team, Kentucky is off to its best start since the 2016-17 season, when it won its first nine contests. Last time out, the Wildcats pulled away from Western Kentucky, earning an 87-68 home win on Tuesday. Otega Oweh and Andrew Carr, transfers from Oklahoma and Wake Forest, respectively, led Kentucky with 18 points apiece in the victory. The Wildcats shot just 40.3 percent from the field, but attempted 42 free throws, making 29 of them. For Pope, it's important for his team to learn how to win defensive battles. ""We weren't functioning great on offense, but we were finding joy on the defensive side of the ball,"" Pope said. ""That is a winning formula. We're going to have games that we have to win on defense. If we can really find joy there, and keep going back to that well over and over, we have a chance to win a lot of games."" Kentucky's 95.3 points per game rank second in the nation through Wednesday's play. The Wildcats are led by Oweh's 16.5 points per contest, followed by Dayton transfer Koby Brea's 14.8. Former San Diego State star Lamont Butler adds 11.7 ppg, while Carr and BYU transfer Jaxson Robinson add 10.8 each. ""It's fun to know we can win games in different ways,"" Pope added. ""That's really important. It bodes well for our guys and our team."" Georgia State enters play on the heels of Wednesday's 74-71 win over Tulsa in the Jacksonville Classic. After falling to Austin Peay on Tuesday, the Panthers (4-3) salvaged their trip to Florida as Zarique Nutter converted a three-point play with two seconds left to ice the win. Nutter leads Georgia State with 17.2 points per game, and paced the Panthers with 22 on Wednesday, none more important than his final three. ""We were just trying to put the ball in his hands,"" Georgia State head coach Jonas Hayes said. ""We were going to run a high ball screen and allow him to operate and make decisions. ... We tried to play with a lot of poise and we were able to do that on a neutral court. I thought we had enough togetherness to withstand runs (Tulsa) went on. We were able to respond and escape with the win."" Hayes' group will prepare on short rest for its toughest test of the season at Kentucky. It's their second of three matchups against Southeastern Conference teams, as the Panthers fell 101-66 at Mississippi State on Nov. 8, and will travel to No. 4 Auburn on Dec. 17. Following Nutter, Toneari Lane adds 15.3 points per game, while Cesare Edwards chips in 11. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The streak matches the franchise record established during their first season in Detroit in 1934. The Lions snapped a seven-game losing streak in their annual Thanksgiving Day game. Goff passed for 221 yards, while David Montgomery had 124 scrimmage yards. Jahmyr Gibbs added a combined 104 yards for Detroit (11-1), which owns the best record in the NFC. Caleb Williams threw for 256 yards and three second-half touchdowns for the Bears (4-8), who have lost six straight. DJ Moore caught eight passes for 97 yards and a touchdown. Chicago's poor clock management on its last possession allowed Detroit to hold on. The Lions outgained the Bears 279-53 in the first half and grabbed a 16-0 lead. Detroit controlled the ball for nearly eight minutes after the opening kickoff but settled for a 30-yard Jake Bates field goal. The Bears went three-and-out on their first possession. The Lions then methodically moved 90 yards down the field in 10 plays and scored on the first play of the second quarter, a 3-yard pass from Goff to LaPorta. The Lions added 36 and 48 yard field goals by Bates. The Bears got on the scoreboard on the opening possession of the second half. Williams finished off the 74-yard drive with a 31-pass to Keenan Allen. The Lions answered with a touchdown. That drive was completed by Goff's 1-yard toss to LaPorta to make it 23-7. Chicago cut the deficit to 23-13 on Williams' 9-yard scoring pass to Allen with 13:40 remaining. Williams threw an incompletion on the 2-point try. Bates missed a 45-yard field goal try with 8:42 left. The Bears then made it a three-point game with 5:36 remaining on Williams' 31-yard scoring pass to Moore. The Lions were forced to punt on their next possession but it was downed on the Bears 1-yard line. A pass interference penalty against Detroit on fourth-and-14 allowed Chicago's drive to continue in the final minute. After a sack left the ball on the Chicago 41-yard line with 32 seconds left, the Bears failed to call a timeout on third down and the clock ran out on a Williams incompletion. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

That didn't happen. Leading 2-1 as the clock wound down and the visiting net was empty, Philadelphia's Morgan Frost chipped in the tying goal with only a dozen seconds left. Flyers captain Sean Couturier, who assisted on the equalizer, put the game away in overtime with a similar chip shot on the other side of goaltender Juuse Saros. ""We've developed some resiliency, but we've had too many of these kinds of games,"" Nashville coach Andrew Brunette said of his club, which is 4-6-3 this month. ""The devil is in the details, and we missed a few details. ""It'll be a big test on Friday."" With physical defenseman Jeremy Lauzon injured, the Predators recalled blue-liners Adam Wilsby and Nick Blankenburg from their AHL affiliate Milwaukee Admirals and inserted them into the lineup. ""I thought he was really good -- kind of what I had seen in camp,"" Brunette said of the 24-year-old Wilsby's NHL debut. ""I thought he had really good mobility and was firm on the puck in his battles. I thought both guys played well."" Two nights after hitting the net five times in the opening 20 minutes in a home win over Colorado, the Lightning continued their torrid first-period scoring by getting two past Washington Capitals goalie Charlie Lindgren. However, the Capitals, playing their fourth game without star sniper Alex Ovechkin (fractured fibula), battled back three times to tie the contest before Tom Wilson put the win away with a power-play tally with 3:26 left in regulation. A bit worse than Nashville in the final frame, the Lightning surrendered a pair of one-goal leads in the third to lose for the third time in four outings (1-2-1). Brayden Point crafted the fifth hat trick of his career, though the third tally occurred in strange fashion. The center was the last home player to touch the puck before Lindgren inadvertently backhanded the puck into his own net without a defender anywhere nearby. Lightning center Anthony Cirelli, whose six-game goal streak ended, committed a double-minor high-sticking penalty late in the tie game -- a four-minute power play with 4:03 left in regulation. Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper said the puck entering the zone was offside. However, the play continued as normal with Cirelli soon committing the infraction. ""It's tough, but it's the way the rules are,"" said Cooper. ""If a goal is scored, it'll come off the board. But a penalty taken does not come off the board. ""It's kind of an unfortunate circumstance ... but in the end you've got to kill it off, and we didn't kill it off."" The Lightning won the first meeting against the Central Division club 3-2 in overtime on Oct. 28 in Tampa. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Los Angeles, which gave up five third-period goals in an embarrassing 7-2 loss to the last-place San Jose Sharks on Monday, rebounded with a 4-1 home victory over the NHL points-leading Winnipeg Jets on Wednesday. Anaheim, a 3-2 loser to visiting Seattle on Monday, took the second half of the home-and-home series with the Kraken after a convincing 5-2 road victory on Wednesday.   The Southern California rivals will try to build on their momentum in the second of their four meetings this season. The first one, played at Anaheim on Oct. 20, was tied 0-0 heading into the third period before the Kings scored four times, including a pair of empty-netters by Kevin Fiala and Mikey Anderson, to defeat the Ducks 4-1.   David Rittich needed just 13 saves, including only two in the third period, in the Kings' win over the Jets on Wednesday en route to his 100th career NHL win. Anze Kopitar and Adrian Kempe each had a goal and an assist and Alex Laferriere added two assists as third-place Los Angeles moved to within four points of Pacific Division-leading Vegas with the win.   ""It's an example maybe of how good we can be,"" Kings coach Jim Hiller said. ""It's hard to be really good like that night after night. It's an 82-game season, but it gives us an example of what is possible if we all play together in a certain style of play.""   Said Kings left wing Trevor Moore: ""It's a great win. That's the best team in the league. We wish we could play like that every night, and that's on us. We have to bring that type of intensity and work ethic. We really committed to the forecheck tonight and I think that paid off for us.""   Anaheim won its third straight road game at Seattle with John Gibson making a season-high 42 saves to improve to 4-0-1 on the season. Trevor Zegras, Cutter Gauthier and Alex Killorn each has a goal and an assist for the Ducks, who were a perfect 5-for-5 on the penalty kill.   ""It's pretty simple for us,"" Anaheim coach Greg Cronin said. ""If we put the pucks deep, you saw it was a physical style to start the game, and then I thought we sustained it for 60 minutes. I've been saying all year when you get good sticks and finish checks that means you're skating, and I thought we did a good job of that for 60 minutes.""   Gibson, who missed the first month of the season after undergoing emergency appendectomy surgery on Sept. 25, has yet to lose in regulation in five starts while compiling a .919 save percentage and 2.57 goals-against average.   ""I feel pretty good with my reads,"" Gibson said. ""Just feel like I'm reading the play well and staying square and staying calm and just having fun.""   The win snapped an eight-game losing streak against Seattle for the Ducks.   ""We played really well,"" Gibson said. ""We did a lot of good things offensively, getting pucks to the net, bodies to the net, and found a way to get some greasy goals. It was a big team win. It'll be nice to have a day off and enjoy Thanksgiving and then we've got a big one against the Kings."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

While the Flames are challenging the Pacific Division-leading Vegas Golden Knights despite a recent 0-1-1 fall from a four-game win streak, this one has deeper meaning as the two teams that Johnny Gaudreau played for during his 11-year NHL career meet for the first time since his tragic death in August. ""Honestly, I don't want to look too far ahead. I'm just gonna try to get through the game -- to go there will be hard,"" Flames defenseman Rasmus Andersson said. ""Seeing the banner (at Nationwide Arena featuring Gaudreau's name and No. 13), that kind of stuff will be tough. There are probably going to be a lot of emotions, and rightfully so."" Andersson considered Gaudreau -- who began his NHL career as a Flame from 2013-22 before electing to sign closer to his native New Jersey with the Blue Jackets for the next two seasons -- one of his first close friends in the NHL. Many other players also share similar sentiments, adding emotion to both Friday's game and the return game next Tuesday in Calgary which the Gaudreau family is expected to attend. Among those players is Columbus center Sean Monahan, a former Flames player who expected to reunite with Gaudreau on the ice after signing as a free agent in July. The 30-year-old has still made a huge impact with his new team, including netting seven points during a three-game win streak that was snapped with a 4-3 overtime loss on Wednesday to the visiting Montreal Canadiens. Monahan's 20 points in 21 games are tied for second on the Blue Jackets and trail only defenseman Zach Werenski, who logged a goal and an assist against Montreal to extend his point streak to six games. ""Just to have a veteran presence, obviously with his connection with Johnny, was something we all were excited about seeing back together,"" Blue Jackets coach Dean Evason said. ""Obviously, and, unfortunately, that didn't happen. ""(Monahan) is the consummate pro. He's a stabilizing figure on the ice and in our locker room."" The NHL's First Star of the Week, Werenski's surge has been especially important with captain Boone Jenner injured (shoulder). The Blue Jackets' lineup also missed center Cole Sillinger (upper-body) on Wednesday. ""I think I have to (be a leader) with some guys out, but I'm also at the age (27) where I feel more comfortable doing it,"" Werenski said. ""I feel like I can get a pulse on the room, what needs to be said in certain situations, and I've enjoyed it."" The Flames also suffered an overtime loss on Wednesday. After Connor Zary's power-play goal with 2:48 left in the third period tied the score, the host Detroit Red Wings bounced back to take a 2-1 result. Zary and fellow center Yegor Sharangovich each ride four-game point streaks into Columbus. Sharangovich had scored in three straight contests prior to Wednesday. Zary's man-up goal was the sixth for the Flames in a five-game span. Calgary is 3-4-4 on the road, while Columbus -- which swept last season's head-to-head matchups -- is just 2-6-2 at home. Something has to give on Wednesday, and Flames coach Ryan Huska hopes that his team can stick to what makes it successful regardless of the place. ""There's things that make our team a good hockey team, and if those things are present, it gives us a chance to win,"" Huska said. ""It doesn't guarantee wins, but we feel we're going to be in games and now our power play can help us out and win us close games."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Hepburn's three-point play with 2:20 remaining in overtime gave the Cardinals the lead for good at 70-67. He finished 14-for-17 on free throws during a game when his impact was huge at both ends of the court. Reserve Reyne Smith added 15 points and Kasean Pryor provided 13 points and eight rebounds for the Cardinals (5-1). Terrence Edwards Jr. chipped in 10 points. Javon Small drained four 3-point shots on the way to 26 points to lead West Virginia (4-2). Amani Hansberry's 19 points and Toby Okani's 12 also boosted the Mountaineers, who shot 44.1 percent (26 of 59) from the field but were hurt by Louisville's 14 offensive rebounds. The Cardinals, who trailed by as many as 11 points in the first half, will face either No. 24 Arizona or Oklahoma in the tournament championship game Friday. West Virginia meets the loser in the third-place game. Late in the second half, Hepburn scored nine points and made three steals during Louisville's 14-2 run that produced a 59-52 lead. But West Virginia stormed back in the next two minutes with eight straight points before Edwards' basket put the Cardinals back in front. Small scored on a drive, and then Hepburn made it 62-62 by making one of two free throws at the 31-second mark. West Virginia botched the final play of regulation. In overtime, the Mountaineers were held to two field goals and committed two turnovers. Small, who shot 10-for-19 from the floor, led West Virginia with seven rebounds and seven assists. The Mountaineers got only three points from their bench players. Louisville held a 24-9 scoring advantage on free throws despite missing nine attempts from the line. Both teams upset nationally ranked teams a day earlier, with Louisville beating No. 14 Indiana and West Virginia upending No. 3 Gonzaga. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Hill redeemed himself for turning the ball over, leading to a dunk by Brennan Rigsby with 13.5 seconds remaining in OT that tied the game 66-all. Hill drove to his left on the next possession and was bumped by Frank Mitchell on the wing. The Golden Gophers (5-2) went for the win on their last possession, but Rigsby's double-clutch 3-pointer rattled around the rim and fell out as time expired. Four players scored in double figures for the Shockers (6-0), led by Harlond Beverly with a game-high 16 points. Corey Washington added 13 before fouling out, while Hill and reserve Xavier Bell each scored 11 points. Lu'Cye Patterson scored 14 points for Minnesota, while Femi Odukale added 13. Parker Fox came off the bench to tally 12 points and Mitchell hit for 10. Gophers leading scorer Dawson Garcia managed just four points before he fouled out in overtime. Wichita State forced overtime when Beverly drilled a 3-pointer from the left wing with 1.2 seconds left in regulation. Minnesota had a last chance to avoid the extra period but turned over the ball. The Shockers will meet either No. 18 Florida or Wake Forest in Friday's championship game, while the Gophers will play the loser of that game for third place. Each team had one major shortcoming in a slow-paced, low-scoring first half. Minnesota turned the ball over nine times, while Wichita State was outrebounded 18-12. Neither team established more than a four-point lead in the half, with the Shockers taking a 13-9 advantage at the 11:56 mark on a 3-pointer by Bell. The Gophers rallied for a 20-19 edge with five minutes left on a corner 3-pointer by Isaac Asuma. Minnesota went scoreless for the final 2:38 and Wichita State capitalized just enough for a 25-24 cushion at halftime when Hill sank a foul shot with 1:04 remaining. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Pacheco, Kansas City's starting running back, sustained a broken fibula is his team's victory over the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 2. Omenihu, a defensive lineman, has yet to make his season debut. He has been recovering from a torn ACL sustained in last season's AFC Championship Game victory against the Baltimore Ravens. The Chiefs (10-1) also ruled out rookie kicker Spencer Shrader (right hamstring) and listed linebacker Cam Jones (illness) as questionable after he missed practice Tuesday and Wednesday but was a full participant Thursday. Game-day elevations were kicker Matthew Wright and tight end Anthony Firkser. Pacheco, 25, rushed for 135 yards with a touchdown and caught seven passes for 54 yards in two games before the injury. He has accumulated 2,328 yards from scrimmage with 15 touchdowns in 33 games (26 starts) since Kansas City drafted him in the seventh round in 2022. Omenihu, 27, had seven sacks in 11 games (one start) in his first season with the Chiefs in 2023. He has 18.5 sacks in 72 career games (11 starts) with the Houston Texans (2019-21), San Francisco 49ers (2021-22) and Kansas City. He was a fifth-round pick by Houston in 2019. Shrader, 25, did not practice this week. Formerly with the Indianapolis Colts and New York Jets this season, he has played in two games for the Chiefs as a replacement for injured starter Harrison Butker (knee), who is on IR, and was 3-for-3 on field-goal attempts and 6-for-6 on extra-point attempts. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

They'll look for more thrills when the reigning Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers pay a visit on Friday afternoon in Raleigh, N.C. ""Right back to work, looking forward to it,"" Hurricanes rookie Jackson Blake said. ""It's always fun playing these teams. They're so good."" Carolina racked up a total of seven goals in the third period across the past two games as the Hurricanes rallied to beat Dallas and the New York Rangers. Blake scored the winning goal on a power play Wednesday night against the Rangers. ""We made a couple of plays that we were able to score on,"" Hurricanes coach Rod Brind'Amour said. The Panthers haven't been nearly as productive as Carolina across the past couple of weeks, but they posted a 5-1 home victory against the Toronto Maple Leafs on Wednesday. That marked Florida's second win in its last eight games. ""We're not as strong defensively from our net to our forwards as I would like us to be,"" Panthers coach Paul Maurice said. ""We look like there's potential there to get better."" The Hurricanes have won nine straight home games since losing their opener to Tampa Bay. The home-ice streak matches the second-longest in franchise history. Carolina has produced at least one power-play goal in five consecutive games. ""The power play is about execution,"" Brind'Amour said. ""You always have a plan, but they executed."" Hurricanes forward Martin Necas moved into the NHL points lead with 37 by notching two assists Wednesday night against the Rangers. Forward Seth Jarvis has two goals and two assists in two games for the Hurricanes since returning from an injury. Defenseman Dmitry Orlov, who's in his 13th NHL season, has a career-high six-game points streak and ranks second among defensemen on the team with 14 points. Carolina needs to maintain high offensive production with uncertainty at the other end. Goalie Spencer Martin has been pressed into duty as the Hurricanes wait to see how long Pyotr Kochetkov will be in the concussion protocol. Martin has played in four consecutive games. ""We put him into a bit of a tough spot, obviously,"" Brind'Amour said. ""Throw to the wolves a little bit, but he's handling it. That's crucial."" The Panthers have offensive sources that will be challenging to contain. Sam Reinhart leads the NHL with 17 goals, including four short-handed tallies. About a quarter of the way through the season, trends start to be established, Maurice said. The Panthers still have the components of an elite team, but it's a matter of smoothing out certain areas. ""The challenge for this season is finding that energy source,"" Maurice said. ""Now we feel we're a pretty good team. ... You got a puzzle every day. You've got a puzzle every year and you've got to try to solve it."" Maurice had two stints as Carolina's coach. His visit comes just two days after another ex-Hurricanes coach, Peter Laviolette, was in town with the Rangers.

Jason Edwards had 26 points but also five turnovers in a game in which Vanderbilt's offense often looked disjointed against the Bulldogs' defense. ""Obviously we did some good things, (going) 2-1 against a good field,"" Vanderbilt coach Mark Byington said. ""This is a setback ... but setbacks are learning opportunities that really help us. Drake played great. They're a well-tuned machine, well-coached. They out-physicaled us, they did a lot of things that kind of took us back.""

Ovechkin will be out for another 3-5 weeks after the superstar forward sustained a fractured fibula on Nov. 18. Washington lost its first two games in Ovechkin's absence but rebounded with a pair of wins in the Sunshine State -- a 4-1 result over the Florida Panthers on Monday and a wild 5-4 comeback victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning on Wednesday. Despite trailing three different times against the Lightning, the Capitals continually fought back and finally took the lead on Tom Wilson's power-play goal at 16:34 of the third period. ""When stuff happens and there's ups and downs, you find a lot out about your team and your teammates,"" Wilson said. ""And I couldn't be more proud of the group and proud of our goalie (Charlie Lindgren) and just everybody stepping up. A pretty gutsy, gutsy effort tonight."" New York's own comeback effort in Wednesday's 6-3 loss to the Boston Bruins was undermined by another late breakdown. The Islanders twice came back to equalize after falling behind in the first two periods, but Boston then scored three unanswered goals over the final 10 minutes of play. The Islanders have allowed a league-high 36 goals in the third period this season. Despite just two wins in the Islanders' last nine games (2-4-3), head coach Patrick Roy feels his team's results don't reflect the quality of play. ""We're not giving (up) 40 shots, we're giving 21 (against Boston),"" Roy said. ""We're not giving up 22 scoring chances, we're giving 10 or 12. So, we do a lot of good things. ... But I realize that we're making mistakes at key times that cause goals."" New York's struggling special-teams units rank 31st in the NHL in both power-play percentage (12.5) and penalty-kill percentage (70.2). The latter statistic is particularly frustrating since the Islanders have taken the fewest penalties (56) and served the fewest penalty minutes (121) of any team in the league. Washington's penalty-kill percentage (84.7) is the fourth-best in the NHL. The Capitals' 6-2-1 record in their last nine games has been aided by a resurgent power play. Washington is 8-for-20 on power plays over that stretch, after going just 4-for-46 with the extra attacker in their first 13 games. Per Washington's usual goalie rotation, Logan Thompson should start Friday since Lindgren faced the Lightning. Thompson is 9-1-1 with an excellent 2.44 goals-against average and .917 save percentage in 11 starts this season. Since the Islanders also play Saturday at home against the Buffalo Sabres, goalies Ilya Sorokin and Semyon Varlamov are expected to split the back-to-back starts in some order. Varlamov could be in line to face the Capitals after Sorokin allowed five goals on 20 Bruins shots Wednesday. After collecting just 10 points (seven goals, three assists) in the Islanders' first 20 games, Brock Nelson has tallied three goals and four assists in New York's last three games. Dylan Strome leads the Capitals with 31 points (seven goals, 24 assists). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Detroit has won three of its last four games while giving up just six total goals during that span. Now the Red Wings will host the New Jersey Devils on Friday afternoon. Detroit needed overtime to pull out a 2-1 victory over the Calgary Flames on Wednesday night. Lucas Raymond extended his goal streak to four games by scoring on a power play during the extra session. Cam Talbot didn't allow a goal until a Flames power play late in regulation. ""We've shown that we can play these games. We knew coming into this game with Calgary -- they're an aggressive team, they forecheck hard. They tend to just outwork the opponent and grind them down,"" Talbot said. ""We bent but we didn't break for the most part all night.  ""If anything, we kind of took it to them for most of the game. Gave up that late one and you can do one of two things -- either fold and give the game back to them or you can go out in overtime and get the game winner. We did a good job mentally of not letting that get to us and finishing the win."" Detroit had surrendered 15 goals while losing all three games of a West Coast trip prior to its improved four-game stretch. ""Our D zone has been unbelievable as of late,"" Talbot said. ""Guys are doing a good job of clogging up the middle and making the other team give up the puck coming into the zone. Once we clean up the (penalty kill), you'll see that number come down even more. But 5-on-5 our team has been pretty dialed in in the defensive zone."" Raymond has been dialed in on the offensive zone. ""I felt like it was a matter of time,"" coach Derek Lalonde said of Raymond's hot streak. ""It's a good sign. I'm not surprised."" New Jersey, one of the top offensive teams in the league, continued its odd habit of getting shut out in its losses. The Devils were blanked at home 3-0 on Wednesday by the St. Louis Blues. New Jersey has scored an average of 4.6 goals per game in its 10 victories since late Oct. 27. In their four losses during that stretch, the Devils have been shutout each time. The Devils surrendered all three Blues goals Wednesday in the first period. ""It's tough against any team when you spot them a lead like that,"" Devils coach Sheldon Keefe said. ""They're parking the bus, clogging it up, making it hard to get to their net. They're not taking any chances on offense. You have to find your way through that. Clearly, it was a struggle for us.""   New Jersey squeezed off 31 shots on goal against St. Louis goaltender Jordan Binnington and wound up frustrated. ""Lots of looks, lots of chances, posts, one of those nights it didn't go in for us,"" Devils forward Stefan Noesen said. Detroit won the first meeting this season with the Devils 5-3 on Oct. 24. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The University of Alabama, where Battle played for Paul ""Bear"" Bryant from 1960-62 and served as AD from 2013-17, confirmed his passing on Thursday. Battle compiled a 59-22-2 record over seven seasons with the Volunteers from 1970-76 and went 4-1 in bowl games before being replaced by Johnny Majors. The Birmingham native won a national championship in 1961, playing as an end for Bryant's Crimson Tide. Before returning to Tuscaloosa in 2013 to lead the athletic department, he founded the Collegiate Licensing Company in 1981 and served as its president and CEO until 2002.

The Canucks look to dust themselves off on Friday afternoon when they visit the Buffalo Sabres for the fourth leg of their six-game road trip. Vancouver dropped a 5-4 decision to the Pittsburgh Penguins on Wednesday, marking their first loss away from British Columbia since a 4-1 setback to the Tampa Bay Lightning on Oct. 15. The Canucks limped out of the blocks and surrendered four goals in the first period on Wednesday, much to the chagrin of head coach Rick Tocchet. ""The first period, obviously, we gifted the goals,"" Tocchet said. ""Seemed like anything they shot went in, but we also gifted some goals. Then you're behind 4-1."" Vancouver allowed another goal at 3:40 of the second period before Pius Suter responded 10 minutes later. Defenseman Quinn Hughes and Elias Pettersson each tallied in the third, however the Canucks could not complete the comeback. ""I liked the battle back from us,"" Pettersson said, ""But we can't come out with an effort like that to start and expect to win a game."" Hughes collected a goal and two assists on Wednesday to boost his point total to 15 (three goals, 12 assists) in 12 games this month. Pettersson, in turn, scored and set up a goal versus the Penguins to give him 12 points (five goals, seven assists) in his last nine contests. Conor Garland notched an assist to extend his point streak to six games (two goals, five assists). Kevin Lankinen is expected to return to the crease following a night off on Wednesday. He owns a sterling 10-3-2 record and has won all eight of his starts on the road this season. The Sabres returned home from a successful four-game road trip (3-1-0) only to be shut out for the first time this season in a 1-0 setback to the Minnesota Wild on Wednesday. Buffalo's Tage Thompson told reporters that he didn't think his team had reason to hang its head, however, especially after matching a season high with 39 shots on goal. ""Honestly, I think we played a really good game (on Wednesday). I don't think we can let that discourage us,"" Thompson said. ""Obviously, it stings when you lose, especially one like that where you feel like you outplayed them most of the night. Sometimes you run into a hot goalie and (there is) not much you can do. You've just got to find ways to get one."" Thompson recorded six shots on goal in his return from a five-game absence due to a lower-body injury. ""Felt great,"" Thompson said. ""Obviously, you miss that much time, lungs are burning a little bit, legs are a little heavy first few, and then you get into a rhythm and start to feel good. I felt I got better as the game wore on."" Despite missing time, Thompson still leads the Sabres with 11 goals on the season. His 18 points are three shy of the club lead held by Alex Tuch, who also has a team-best 14 assists. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Both teams won Wednesday, albeit in vastly different fashion. The Wild won on the road for a league-leading 10th time this season by blanking Buffalo 1-0. Chicago, which had lost four of five games, got a much-needed win at home in a 6-2 rout of Dallas that featured a couple of key players ending lengthy droughts. The Central Division matchup features second-place Minnesota, which has the league's third-best record overall, against the Blackhawks, who are tied with division rival Nashville with the fewest points in the league. Minnesota played, arguably, its best defensive game of the season Wednesday. Filip Gustavsson made 39 saves for his second shutout of the season and his teammates blocked 32 shots, one shy of the team record set 13 years ago against San Jose. Wild coach John Hynes told reporters afterward that he likes the maturity his team is showing. ""I liked the fact that it was a tight game, and I thought that we continued to push for offense, even the third period,"" Hynes said of his team, which registered 25 of its 29 shots after the first period. ""We didn't just check the whole game. I thought when we had to defend hard, we did, but I also thought we pushed."" Kirill Kaprizov continued his campaign for the Hart Trophy by scoring the game's lone goal in the first period. The 2021 Calder Trophy winner is now tied for second in the NHL with 35 points. Chicago's victory came thanks in large part to a turn-back-the-clock game for Taylor Hall. The 33-year-old went into the Dallas game with just two goals and six points in 20 games, but he finished it with his first hat trick in nearly 11 years. The 2018 Hart Trophy winner is the sixth player in league history to go 10 years or longer between three-goal games. Hall's breakout game came less than two weeks after Chicago coach Luke Richardson made the veteran a healthy scratch in a game versus Nashville. The move stunned the left wing, yet both said they were on the same page after discussing the benching. After Wednesday's win, Richardson raved to reporters about a play Hall made midway through the third period -- when Chicago led 6-1 -- that prevented a Stars goal. ""I think that's just as important as the others, and that's the professional he is,"" Richardson said. ""He played a complete game. He wasn't just happy with his three goals. He played hard for (goalie) Petr (Mrazek), backchecking hard and helping the defense out. That's a good example for everybody."" The mix of experienced players, like Hall and Teuvo Teravainen, with several youngsters, led by last year's Calder winner Connor Bedard, has yet to pay dividends on the rebuilding club. Even after Wednesday's outburst, Chicago is tied for 27th in the league, averaging just 2.5 goals per game. Bedard also scored his fourth goal of the season, and first since Oct. 26, in the win. Friday's game is the second of four the teams will play this season. Chicago beat the Wild at home 2-1 in overtime on Nov. 10. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Philadelphia hopes to ride the momentum from an exciting win when it hosts New York in a Black Friday matinee. The Flyers were outplayed by the Nashville Predators for most of Wednesday's contest before Morgan Frost scored with 12 seconds left to force overtime. Sean Couturier's deflection found the back of the net in the extra session, securing one of the Flyers' more improbable wins in recent memory. ""There were a lot of minutes that it just was not good for us tonight,"" Flyers coach John Tortorella said. ""I readily admit that. But I just like the way they just stayed with it and tried to plug along."" Philadelphia has won two of its last three games (2-0-1) with the only defeat in that stretch coming Monday. That night, the Flyers held 3-0 and 4-3 leads versus the Vegas Golden Knights before suffering a bitter defeat in a shootout. ""Just staying with it, staying patient,"" Flyers defenseman Travis Sanheim said Wednesday. ""It wasn't our best effort. Find a way to stay in the game and get one late and end up probably stealing two points. But you look at (Monday) night, probably a game that we should've had and end up losing it. That's the way hockey is sometimes. We'll take the two points and move on."" The Rangers wish they could have escaped with two points Wednesday against the Carolina Hurricanes. They led 3-2 midway through the third period before allowing two goals in 2:07 to fall behind in an eventual 4-3 defeat -- the team's fourth straight setback. ""The effort was good, (but) nobody feels good,"" New York coach Peter Laviolette said. ""We ended up losing a hockey game we were winning going into the third period."" Brett Berard scored his first NHL goal for the Rangers, while Jonny Brodzinski and Adam Edstrom also tallied. The team has been outscored 18-9 during its current skid. ""We did enough to put ourselves in position to win tonight. Sometimes it just doesn't work out,"" New York forward Reilly Smith said. Friday's matchup will pit one of the league's premier goalies -- the Rangers' Ilya Shesterkin -- against one of the Flyers' backup netminders, unless Philadelphia starter Samuel Ersson is ready to return from a lower-body injury. There has not been a recent update on Ersson (who has not played since Nov. 11), while Ivan Fedotov and Aleksei Kolosov have essentially split time in the Philadelphia net. Regardless of Friday's starter, New York certainly will look to come out aggressively against a team it has dominated in recent years. Over the previous three seasons, the Rangers went 9-1-1 against the Flyers. This is their first meeting this season. ""We're going through a little bit of adversity as a group,"" Rangers captain Jacob Trouba said. ""Everybody knows it's probably a better effort for us, but there aren't really any moral victories at this level. So keep grinding, keep putting the work in and turn this thing around as a group."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Jacob Meyer, who averages a team-best 15.2 points, scored 14 on Saturday.  Conor Enright, who was playing with a mask after breaking his nose in practice, collected 13 points, seven rebounds and four assists against the Huskies.

The Utes' offense scored one touchdown while the defense and special teams each contributed one, including an interception returned 87 yards by Lander Barton. Friday, it will be the tale of the immovable object against the unstoppable force, with Utah's defense sitting tied for third in the conference in points allowed (21.3) and giving up the third-fewest yards per game (325.2).

But through the team's first 19 games this season, the trio has found itself on the floor at the same time on only three occasions. The last gathering came in the Grizzlies' 25-point home victory over the Portland Trail Blazers Monday night. In Wednesday's 20-point home win over the Detroit Pistons, Morant was missing, the victim of a knee injury that Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins didn't deem too worrisome. At some point, Jenkins and the Grizzlies would like to see how the team operates Morant, Bane and Jenkins Jr. operating together for a lengthy stretch of games. Perhaps that run will begin Friday when the Grizzlies meet the visiting New Orleans Pelicans in an NBA Cup game. The Grizzlies - with or without their core three - have been on a recent roll. Wednesday's victory over the Pistons was the team's fourth straight and its eighth in the past 11 games. Morant returned Monday after an eight-game absence due to a hip injury to join Bane, who had missed several games earlier this month with a strained right oblique, and Jackson, the team's leading scorer.  In the lopsided win over the Trail Blazers, Morant played as if he hadn't missed nearly a month. He directed the Grizzlies to a wire-to-wire victory, scoring 20 of his 22 points in the first half. He finished with 11 assists. Jenkins is expecting Morant back soon. ""His engagement, even when he's out, you all don't get to see the work that he's putting in,"" Jenkins said. ""This past week was some of the best work I'd seen from him via the return-to-play process because he wants to be out there so badly. His engagement with his teammates, his voice in the locker room, film sessions, and on the sidelines, he was champing at the bit to get out there."" Without Morant, the Grizzlies have held their own by relying on a deep bench led by the play of backup point guard Scotty Pippen Jr. In last weekend's road win at Chicago, Pippen Jr. scored a career-high 30 points and added 10 rebounds. In Wednesday's victory, Pippen finished with 19 points and seven rebounds. The Memphis bench players scored 71 points. ""[We're] still learning a lot. I've been really impressed with Scotty's development, playing some lineups with Des and Luke [Kennard] together,"" he said. ""Playmaking through Jaren, we wanted to create an offense that has five creators out there at all times that are in attack mode."" Against a struggling, injury-plagued New Orleans team, Memphis will be seeking its first NBA Cup victory in the two years of the in-season tournament. The Pelicans are 2-12 in November and have lost six straight. In Wednesday's 119-93 home loss to the Toronto Raptors, the Pelicans were booed by their fans in the third quarter when they fell behind by 30. ""We allowed a team to come on our home floor and make us look soft,"" New Orleans coach Willie Green said. ""I told our group that can't happen. That was a lack of competition.""

This case is an important reminder for tennis players of the strict liability nature of the World Anti-Doping Code and the importance of players carefully considering the use of supplements and medications."" Swiatek, 23, admitted the rule violation to the governing body on Wednesday and accepted her penalty.  ""It was a blow for me. I was shocked and this whole situation made me very anxious,"" the Poland native said Thursday in a video on social media. ""At first I couldn't understand how that was even possible and where it came from. ""It turns out testing revealed historically lowest levels of trimetazidine, a substance I've never heard about before. I don't think I even knew it existed. I have never encountered it, nor did people around me. So I had a strong sense of injustice and these first few weeks were really chaotic."" Swiatek already was provisionally suspended from Sept. 22 to Oct. 4 and sat out the Korea Open, the China Open and the Wuhan Open. She will now serve the remaining eight days of her suspension and be cleared to play as of Dec. 4. Swiatek also was fined $158,944, her prize money earned during her semifinal run at the Cincinnati Open in August. That tournament came on the heels of her positive test. Without playing on the tour's Asia swing, Swiatek lost the chance to earn rankings points and eventually was overtaken as World No. 1 by Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",High-scoring Ohio State primed to test Pitt,https://deadspin.com/high-scoring-ohio-state-primed-to-test-pitt/,2024-11-28T15:32:52.404Z,"After routing three straight mid-major opponents, Ohio State moves up a weight class to host Pittsburgh on Friday.,The Panthers (6-1) will play in Col","After routing three straight mid-major opponents, Ohio State moves up a weight class to host Pittsburgh on Friday. The Panthers (6-1) will play in Columbus without one of their key players in guard Damian Dunn, who underwent surgery Monday to repair a right thumb injury, according to the school.  Dunn has started every game and is averaging 11.1 points and 2.1 rebounds per game while shooting 49 percent from the field and making 52.6 percent of his 3-pointers. He was injured early in the Greenbrier Tip-Off against No. 15 Wisconsin on Sunday. The loss of his playmaking and veteran leadership may have factored in the Panthers blowing a 14-point lead in 81-75 defeat. Panthers coach Jeff Capel is pleased with his team's early season effort for the most part. ""I feel really good about where we are,"" he said. ""We had an opportunity to win a championship against a top-20 team. We were right there. We had a big lead in the first half. We weren't able to sustain it. ""Our first half defense was really good. To give up 54 in the second half was really disappointing."" Focusing on defense will be crucial against the Buckeyes (5-1), who have been ruthless the past three games against Evansville (80-30), Campbell (104-60) and Green Bay (102-69). John Mobley Jr. and Bruce Thornton share the team scoring lead at 15.2 points per game but five Buckeyes are averaging at least 10.5 ppg this season. Ohio State topped the 100-point mark in consecutive games for the first time since the first four games of the 1990-91 season. The Buckeyes against Campbell had seven players in double-figures for the first time since exactly 34  years earlier against Bethune-Cookman on Nov. 25, 1990. Ohio State had 20 assists on 38 field goals. ""This was another game where we shared the ball at a high level,"" Ohio State coach Jake Diebler said. ""Our assist total to made field goals was north of 50 percent. That speaks to our combined growth offensively. ""To have seven guys in double figures, it's hard to key in on one guy when you have that versatility."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

You have a big ol' turkey sandwich in front of you.  You finished your Christmas shopping on Black Friday, and now you're ready to win the money to pay for all those gifts by betting on a few college football player props from one of the many intense rivalry games on the schedule. The million-dollar question is, of course, which ones do you bet on? To help you get started, we've compiled a list of our 10 favorites for Rivalry Weekend. Rivalry Weekend: CFB Player Props Odds via FanDuel unless otherwise stated: --The Game: Michigan vs. Ohio State TreVeyon Henderson, RB, Ohio State, O/U 49.5 rushing yards at -114/-114 Michigan's run defense is supposed to be decent, but it will be on the field so much that it won't matter. The Wolverines' defense might slow down Henderson in the first quarter/half, but it will tire out by the second half, and the run lanes will get nice and wide. As a senior who has never beaten Michigan, Henderson will be motivated and could get more garbage time in the fourth quarter. Take the OVER. Will Howard, QB, Ohio State, O/U 251.5 passing yards at -114/-114 Howard has gone over 251.5 yards passing just once in his past five games (vs. Purdue). Last week, against Indiana, he only had 201 yards in a dominant Ohio State offensive performance. His total wasn't that low because the Hoosiers defense was playing tough. No, it was because the team didn't need him to take to the air for prolonged drives. Four of the Buckeyes' six scoring drives were shorter than 50 yards. A similar scenario could present itself this weekend. Take the UNDER. --Palmetto Bowl: South Carolina vs. Clemson Lanorris Sellers, QB, South Carolina, O/U 198.5 passing yards at -114/-114 Sellers had some struggles during the first month of the season, which is not unusual for a freshman quarterback. But when South Carolina played Alabama, things started to click. Since then, including the Alabama game, he has thrown for more than 198.5 yards in five of his past six. Clemson's pass defense is good but not great. It might slow Sellers down at first, but not for the entire game. He'll clear 200 yards passing before the fourth quarter. Take the OVER. Lanorris Sellers, QB, South Carolina, O/U 37.5 rushing yards at -114/-114 As for his rushing total, Sellers went over 37.5 yards in his past four. A legitimate dual threat, he averages 14 carries per game this season. Clemson allows 4.57 yards per carry, so as long as he gets nine carries and takes what the Tigers allow, he'll have a nice day on the ground. Take the OVER. Phil Mafah, RB, Clemson, O/U 96.5 rushing yards at -114/-114 Mafah has been a workhorse for Clemson this year in the backfield, running for 100-plus yards in six of his first nine games. He struggled against Pitt, gaining just 17 yards on 17 carries. He'll likely get around 20 carries, and if he can match his season average (5.6 yards per carry), he'll easily go OVER his total. But the South Carolina run defense is pretty strong against the run (No. 12 in the country, allowing just over 100 yards per game). Since he'll get the bulk of touches in the backfield, he'll have a shot at going over the total. But the day will belong to South Carolina. Take the UNDER. --Battle for the Jeweled Shillelagh: Southern California vs. Notre Dame Jayden Maiava, QB, USC, O/U 235.5 passing yards Maiava has done a solid job in his two starts since taking over as QB1 for the Trojans, throwing for 259 yards and three touchdowns (and an interception) in one game and 221 yards and a touchdown in the other. But neither Nebraska nor UCLA have a strong pass defense. Notre Dame has the No 1 pass defense in the country. Take the UNDER. --Lonestar Showdown: Texas vs. Texas A&M Marcel Reed, QB, Texas A&M, O/U 180.5 passing yard at -114/-114 On paper, it doesn't look like Texas A&M will move the ball at all, with Texas having the No. 2 pass defense and No. 13 run defense. But the Longhorns played the easiest schedule in the SEC, so you have to take those numbers with a grain of salt. Since taking over as QB1 for the Aggies, Marcel Reed has been electric. He is a dual threat with a strong arm and quick feet. In his past three games, vs. South Carolina, New Mexico State and Auburn, Reed has passed for over 200 yards in each. Texas might slow him down, but the Longhorns will not contain him for the whole game. Take the OVER. Marcel Reed, QB, Texas A&M, O/U .5 passing touchdowns at -220/+162 If you think Texas will dominate this game, then take the UNDER. However, if you believe the Aggies will be competitive in this game, then take the OVER. We're taking the OVER. Jaydon Blue, RB, Texas, O/U 45.5 rushing yards -114/-114 The Texas A&M defense is good on paper, but the numbers are a little misleading. Often, the Aggies' defense gets gashed by the running game in the first half and helps the opposing team get out to a nice lead. But then it makes some adjustments at halftime and controls the line of scrimmage in the second half. Blue is good enough to go for 45 yards in the first half, even if he ends up splitting carries with Quintrevion Wisner. If he doesn't, he'll get close and then finish the job in the second half. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Currently holding the ninth spot in the Eastern Conference standings, Atlanta has knocked off the top two teams in the league on the road.  Without point guard Trae Young on Nov. 12, the Hawks shocked the defending champion Boston Celtics 117-116. On Tuesday, Atlanta handed the Cleveland Cavaliers their first home loss of the season -- and second overall -- battling back from a 19-point deficit to earn a 135-124 victory. The Hawks are out to deliver again Friday when they host the Cavaliers in NBA Cup play. Atlanta is 2-1 in East Group C action, while Cleveland has split its two pool play games. The Cavaliers looked to be on their way to an 11-0 record at home Wednesday night, jumping out to a 30-11 first-quarter lead. From there, the Hawks finished the opening quarter on a 24-5 run in what proved a statement from Atlanta. The Hawks outscored Cleveland by 14 in the second half thanks to Young's 20 points and 22 assists -- the most in the NBA this season and just one shy of Mookie Blaylock's franchise record of 23. ""After our start to the game, there was frustration from Trae and our whole team,"" Hawks head coach Quin Snyder said. ""Probably the most significant thing for me was the way we responded to being down, and Trae in particular. That's been something that's been a point of emphasis for him, just keeping his poise. He gave guys opportunities to make plays in the open court, and he trusted his teammates."" Young improved his NBA-lead in assists per game at 12.5.  De'Andre Hunter (26 points) and Jalen Johnson (22) led the scoring.  ""My teammates made shots and I got them the ball in the spots that they like,"" Young said. ""They made the plays. That's how you get assists. It's teamwork."" Young leads Atlanta with 21.8 points per game, followed by Johnson (20.1) and Hunter (17.6). First-year head coach Kenny Atkinson couldn't have asked for a better start to his time in Cleveland, winning 17 of his first 19 games. However, Atkinson knows games can't always go according to script. The Wednesday game against the Hawks proved that. ""We hadn't had a stinker yet this year,"" Atkinson said. ""That was a stinker. It happens in the NBA. It's unfortunate that it happened in front of our home crowd but we kind of deserved what we got tonight. ... Our communication has got to be better, our physicality has to be better. I thought we were better in the second half, but by that time (Atlanta) was rolling."" Donovan Mitchell's 30 points led Cleveland, which made just 15 of its 48 (31.3 percent) 3-pointers, opposed to Atlanta's 47.6 percent (20-for-42) mark from outside. ""It was bound to happen that we had a bad shooting night,"" Atkinson added. ""It's about your character; do you really stick your nose in there and get stops when you're not making shots, and that was probably the most disappointing thing about tonight."" Mitchell's 24.7 points per game lead the Cavaliers, while Darius Garland adds 20.2.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Cavaliers (4-2) got back in the win column with a wire-to-wire 74-65 home win against Manhattan on Tuesday. Five players scored in double figures for interim coach Ron Sanchez's work-in-progress squad.   ""We're not the most experienced age-wise or experienced as having a large number of games together, so we are learning each other,"" Sanchez said after the victory over the Jaspers, which followed lopsided losses to Tennessee and St. John's in the Bahamas last week.   Isaac McKneely led Virginia with 18 points against Manhattan and is the team's only double-digit scorer, averaging 13.3 points and shooting 54.5 percent (18 of 33) from 3-point distance.   McKneely is one of just four players returning from former coach Tony Bennett's final Virginia team, and one of two returning starters along with Andrew Rohde (9.4 points per game).    ""A lot of guys new to the system,"" McKneely said. ""And it's still early in the season, so you know I'm hoping that by January, February we'll have it figured out.""   Virginia is 3-0 at home heading into the meeting with Holy Cross (4-3), which fell to 1-3 in road games Sunday with an 80-55 setback at Maine.    Freshman and leading scorer Max Green (12.6 points per game) was held to three points on 1-of-8 shooting by the Black Bears. Holy Cross missed 17 of its 20 3-point attempts and turned the ball over 15 times. DeAndre Williams led three Holy Cross players in double figures with 12 points off the bench.   The Crusaders of the Patriot League are in their second season under coach Dave Paulsen. They have surrendered at least 80 points in all three of their losses.   ""We have to hang our hat on defense if we want to have a chance,"" Paulsen said earlier this month. ""The amount of energy and effort and focus we have to sustain on the defensive end just has to get better.""   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Tigers (8-3, 4-3 SEC) are 6-0 at home this season, including one-possession victories in each of their last four contests at Memorial Stadium.    Adding to the atmosphere, the forecast calls for temperatures in the 20s with potential snow on Saturday.   ""There are some things as a staff that we've already put in place to prepare for (the weather), but the reality is that's just part of the game,"" Missouri coach Eli Drinkwitz said.   The Tigers scored a 39-20 victory at Mississippi State in which Marcus Carroll ran for three touchdowns and Brady Cook completed 75 percent of his passes with a TD and no interceptions.   ""He's a really good player,"" Arkansas coach Sam Pittman said of Cook. ""What he brings to the team with his legs and his arm and his leadership - he's won a lot of games as the starting quarterback at Missouri.""   Already bowl-eligible, Arkansas (6-5, 3-4) is focused on finishing the season with a winning record. The team disposed of Louisiana Tech 35-14 its last time out as Taylen Green threw for two touchdowns and ran for two more.   The Razorbacks are attempting to win at Missouri for the first time ever. They are 0-6 all-time, although their last two visits resulted in a pair of two-point defeats.    ""I think Missouri is right up there at the top of rivals for us,"" Pittman said. ""Anything that you think of (like the Razorbacks' record at Missouri) can be a little bit more of a motivator.""   In theory, Arkansas players should be able to use the memory of last season's meeting as an incentive. The Tigers pounded the Razorbacks 48-14 in Fayetteville, although year-to-year motivation doesn't always translate in the modern world of college athletics.   ""They beat the hell out of us last year,"" Pittman noted. ""That should motivate us, but the problem is a lot of the kids that are on the team and playing weren't here last year. So you have to find different ways to motivate (them). That's my job.""   For his part, Drinkwitz isn't particularly concerned with generating momentum with a win Saturday. He's more interested in the bragging rights.    ""I don't know if it's really that big of a deal - the momentum piece,"" he said. ""I think it's more about a legacy piece for this senior class and for this year's team.""   This will be Arkansas' national-leading seventh game against a Top 25 opponent this season. The Razorbacks are 1-5 against ranked foes to this point, only defeating then-No. 4 Tennessee back in early October.   Arkansas held the Volunteers to 14 points, not to mention strong defensive efforts against Auburn (24-14 win) and Texas (20-10 loss) at various points this season. Even last week, the team allowed just 229 total yards of offense against Louisiana Tech.   ""I do think the defensive identity under Coach Pittman has been consistent (over the years),"" Drinkwitz said. ""Relentless pursuit to the football."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",No. 10 Indiana resumes playoff push with Purdue duel on tap,https://deadspin.com/no-10-indiana-resumes-playoff-push-with-purdue-duel-on-tap/,2024-11-28T14:22:25.459Z,"In the final analysis, last week's 38-15 loss at No. 2 Ohio State was no death knell at all for Indiana. ,The chaos that enveloped last week's top 12","In the final analysis, last week's 38-15 loss at No. 2 Ohio State was no death knell at all for Indiana.  The chaos that enveloped last week's top 12 in the College Football Playoff enabled the Hoosiers to stay inside the playoff field. They dropped from No. 5 to 10th.  That means a win Saturday night at home in their regular-season finale with in-state rival Purdue would bring another layer to Indiana's historic season -- a spot in the 12-team playoff. And should the Buckeyes stumble at home in their rivalry game against 6-5 Michigan, Indiana could also earn a spot in the Big Ten Conference championship game Dec. 7 against top-ranked Oregon. ""We're sitting in a good spot but we've got to take care of business,"" said first-year Hoosiers coach Curt Cignetti. While the overdogs from Ohio State poked fun at Cignetti's brashness after Saturday's game, there's no question he's the odds-on favorite for national Coach of the Year. A program that's run pretty brutal for generations, aside from a scattered good season or two along the way, has risen from 17th place in preseason Big Ten predictions to controlling its destiny to get into the playoff. The two things Indiana (10-1, 7-1) wants to do in the season finale are fix concerns that ropped up last week and not take the Boilermakers (1-10, 0-8) for granted. Indiana was installed as a four-touchdown favorite to pound Purdue. They'd like to get their offense going again after a couple of weeks where they've struggled. Ohio State's physical defense limited them to 151 total yards, most of those coming on two touchdown drives. In a 20-15 win over Michigan Nov. 9, Indiana managed just 246 yards of offense. ""We've got to get back in sync offensively and get our rhythm back where we're playing with a lot of confidence,"" Cignetti said. While the Hoosiers aim to return to form, the Boilermakers embrace the role of spoiler to end a forgettable season with a memorable upset. One way or the other, changes are coming to a program that's gone backwards in coach Ryan Walters' second year. Walters is reportedly safe win or lose to return for a third season.  ""I'm looking forward to Saturday. That is what I am focused on right now,"" he said. ""Those are the things that are right in front of us right now. After Saturday, I'll look forward to the next wave of things."" Since opening the year with a 49-0 blanking of FCS opponent Indiana State, the Boilermakers have been mostly pummeled. There have been close games, like last week's 24-17 setback at Michigan State, but they have been outscored 411-130 since the opener. If Purdue is to give itself a chance at the upset, it will probably need a big game from quarterback Hudson Card (1,606 yards, 9 touchdowns). It will also need some big plays from defenders like linebacker Kydran Jenkins, who has 6.5 sacks this season and 23 in his career. The Boilermakers own a 77-42-6 lead in the all-time series, which awards the winner the Old Oaken Bucket. Purdue has won the last three matchups, including a 35-31 victory last year on Card's 10-yard touchdown run with 2:39 left.                      --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Now you have the type of Detroit team Barry Sanders wished for during his stellar career. The Lions take on the Chicago Bears, while the stinker game of the day is between the New York Giants and Dallas Cowboys. Nobody anywhere wants to watch a game in which the starting quarterbacks are Drew Lock and Cooper Rush. Repeat, nobody. We will dissect the nighttime contest between the Miami Dolphins and Green Bay Packers. Miami has won three straight games as it recovers from a brutal start, while the Packers are part of a tough NFC Central topped by the Lions and Minnesota Vikings. Also on our slate is No. 17 Tulane, a school very much in the College Football Playoff mix. We also will look at college hoops between USC and Saint Mary's. One thing we know about the Dolphins is that they continue to fold when the weather gets cold. Quarterback Tua Tagovailoa is 0-7 as a starter when the weather is 40 degrees or colder, and guess what? The temperature at kickoff is forecasted to be 27 degrees and will drop during the night. Tagovailoa is again saying the temperature doesn't matter. Of course, Tua said that before the playoff game in Kansas City last season, the temperature turned out to be minus-4 (feels like minus-27) at kickoff, and the Dolphins looked frigid throughout the uncompetitive 26-7 setback. The Packers have won two straight games and six of their past seven, with a showdown against the Lions coming the following week. Green Bay looked great last week while routing the battered San Francisco 49ers 38-10 as Josh Jacobs churned out 106 yards on the ground for his third 100-yard outing of the season. Jordan Love wasn't intercepted last week after being picked off at least once in the first eight appearances of the season. If Love can take care of the ball and the Green Bay defense keeps reminding Tua that it is cold (brrrr), the Packers should be fine.

The Green Wave would also have to beat Army in next week's Athletic American Conference title game and get help along the way. Tulane (9-2) has outscored its last three opponents 121-9 and has allowed 10 or fewer points on six occasions. Standout running back Makhi Hughes has seven 100-yard outings and has churned out 1,291 yards and 15 touchdowns on the ground. Memphis (9-2) is looking to post a second straight 10-win season, but its defense can be shaky. The Tigers allowed a total of 100 points in their two setbacks (56 to Navy, 44 to UTSA) and it would be no surprise to see Tulane top 40. How about some love for Memphis quarterback Seth Henigan? He is 10 yards away from his fourth straight 3,000-yard passing season, and he has exactly 100 career passing scores against just 31 interceptions.

Father LeBron would be in the stands in Palm Desert, Calif., with the NBA off. But instead, that much-needed second college season for Bronny didn't happen, and we still don't know whether the kid can play or not. It would have been interesting to see how Bronny developed under first-year coach Eric Musselman, who helped players improve at Nevada and Arkansas. The Trojans are 5-1 but have played a light schedule. Their setback was to former Pac-12 partner Cal. Saint Mary's is off to a 6-0 start with a neutral-court victory over Nebraska serving as its best victory. The Gaels have been more offensive by scoring at least 76 points in every game but have allowed 66 or more in five of six games.  The Gaels still have big man Mitchell Saxen around from their recent high-achieving clubs.

But stability remains elusive as ever for the Knicks as they conclude the trek Friday afternoon with a visit to the Charlotte Hornets in NBA Cup Group A.  Both teams were off on Thanksgiving after losing Wednesday night. The Knicks fell to the Dallas Mavericks, 129-114, while the host Hornets saw their furious fourth-quarter comeback bid come up short as they were edged by the Miami Heat, 98-94. The loss continued a frustrating pattern of wins followed by losses on the road trip for the Knicks. New York has lopsided victories over a pair of contenders in the Phoenix Suns and Denver Nuggets but also endured a 121-106 loss last Saturday to the Utah Jazz, whose 4-14 record is the second-worst in the Western Conference. The Mavericks are in a virtual tie for seventh place with the Nuggets in the West but seemed vulnerable Wednesday without superstar Luka Doncic (right wrist), starting small forward Klay Thompson (left foot plantar fasciitis) and center Daniel Gafford (illness). But Dallas led for the final 43-plus minutes Wednesday and maintained a double-digit advantage throughout the final three quarters against the Knicks, who shot just 46.5 percent from the field (40-of-86), including 24.1 percent (7-of-29) from 3-point land. New York shot a blistering 60.9 percent (56-of-92) in Monday's 145-118 rout of the Nuggets, including 52.8 percent (19-of-36) from beyond the arc. ""We got in such a big hole and then by the time we got a rhythm offensively in the second half, we were in too big of a hole,"" Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""It's what the league is. That's our challenge, We've been on the road a long time. Early start (Friday), got to be ready to go."" LaMelo Ball is on a heater of late and averaging 31.1 points, 6.9 assists and 5.4 rebounds per game this season. He drilled seven 3-pointers against Miami and scored 32 points after dropping 44 against Orlando and 50 at Milwaukee. In the process, Ball attempted 113 shots in three games and leads the league in personal fouls with 70.  When he's not in the game because of foul trouble, the Hornets lose a big part of their offensive identity. The Hornets remained persistent Wednesday night. Charlotte, which is in 12th place in the East with a 6-12 record, is one of just four teams in the conference that's not within two games of sixth place and the last guaranteed playoff spot. The Heat seemed to take control building a 20-point lead with a 31-11 run bridging the second and third quarters. The Hornets overcame a 17-point fourth-quarter deficit and took a 94-92 lead on Tidjane Salaun's 3-pointer with 42 seconds left. Tyler Herro responded with a 3-pointer for the Heat before forcing a turnover by Brandon Miller with six seconds remaining. Herro split a pair of free throws but Cody Martin missed two free throws two seconds later for the Hornets, who have dropped three straight and five of six. Four of the losses have been by 11 points or fewer. ""We are never out of a game because of our fight, because of our talent,"" Hornets coach Charles Lee said. ""I loved the effort of that group."" The Knicks are 2-0 in Group A action following a 111-99 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Nov. 12 and a 124-122 victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Nov. 15. New York is slated to complete Group A play Tuesday against the Orlando Magic, who are also 2-0 heading into Friday's game against the Nets. The Hornets are 0-2 in Group A play after a 114-89 loss to the Magic on Nov 12 and a 116-115 loss to the Nets on Nov 19. Charlotte hosts the 76ers in the final Group A game for both teams Tuesday night. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Last Sunday blessed us with exhilarating endings in games that were supposed to be blowouts. The Dallas Cowboys special teams came up huge against the Washington Commanders. The Kansas City Chiefs barely beat the lowly Carolina Panthers. The Tennessee Titans beat the Houston Texans in their own building. We can never judge matchups on paper. It’s the reason the games are played between the four lines. But this Thanksgiving Day lineup of games is pretty atrocious. It's hard to ignore. Imagine your family just finished indulging in a turkey dinner surrounded by so many side dishes that there’s hardly any room on the table. You flop into the living room and see Cooper Rush starting for the 4-7 Cowboys against the 2-9 New York Giants. Give me a break. The slate starts with Chicago Bears rookie sensation Caleb Williams against the Detroit Lions, who are one of the NFL’s best teams. Sounds like a good game, but the Lions are -9.5 favorites. The Bears are, week in and week out, one of the most inept offensive football teams in America. This one could get ugly quick. The Giants are so bad that they haven’t even named a starter for this game yet. A right forearm injury has Tommy DeVito unlikely to play on Thanksgiving, which is a major disappointment to Italian families everywhere. Instead, we get to see Drew Lock battle Rush and the Cowboys. (Screw you, Daniel Jones, who could’ve somehow signed with Dallas and played his former team on Thanksgiving.) The nightcap should at least be watchable. Maybe? You probably at least have a few fantasy football players suiting up in this game as the Miami Dolphins will travel to Lambeau Field to play the Green Bay Packers. The Packers are just -3.5 favorites in this game, but it feels difficult to envision a path where the Dolphins travel all the way up to Wisconsin and pull off an upset. The 8-3 Packers are sitting pretty after dismantling the San Francisco 49ers 38-10 on Sunday. It’s probably time to stop treating Thanksgiving like some great sports holiday. On the Fourth of July, we at least get some highly anticipated divisional MLB games. On Christmas Day, the NBA always comes through with intriguing matchups, and now the NFL has their own lineup of games, too. This Christmas, the NFL games are on Netflix, so let’s hope they figure out some issues from the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight. It sounds like this Thanksgiving, we’ll all be forced to hear our family members recap the results of the election while we watch bad football. Copyright 2024"

That's because Nebraska (6-5, 3-5 Big Ten) is bowl-eligible and headed for the postseason for the first time since 2016 after beating Wisconsin in its home finale.   The Cornhuskers had lost nine consecutive games when trying to clinch bowl eligibility, including season-ending losses to the Hawkeyes in 2023 and 2019. ""I don't think there's been a game where they weren't dying to win,"" second-year Nebraska coach Matt Rhule said. ""This is really hard, this has been hard. It requires really tough people to do the stuff that we've been trying to do to get over that hump."" Iowa (7-4, 5-3) is trying to clinch an eight-win season for the fourth year in a row and ninth time since 2015. The Hawkeyes are 5-1 at home this season, winning their three Big Ten games by an average of 27.3 points while scoring at least 40 in each. At 29.4 points per game, Iowa is averaging nearly twice what it did in 2023 (15.4) and its most since averaging 31.8 in the COVID-shortened 2020 season.  ""I think our older guys have really done a good job of playing well and giving us leadership,"" said Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz, who is 203-123 in 26 seasons at the school including 9-6 against Nebraska. Nebraska's 44 points last time out were its most since a 56-7 win over Northwestern in 2021. That came in the second game with former West Virginia and Houston head coach Dana Holgorsen calling plays for the Cornhuskers. ""I think Dana has done an amazing job,"" Rhule said. ""You hear Dana on the headset the whole time and he's just talking about execution."" Iowa's Kaleb Johnson leads the Big Ten in rushing yards (1,492) and touchdowns (21), the latter a school record. The Doak Walker Award finalist is 358 yards shy of Shonn Greene's single-season mark in 2008.  The Hawkeyes could also be getting back quarterback Cade McNamara, who has missed the last three games due to a concussion.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",Ryan Day’s Legacy Hinges on Ending Michigan's Streak in ‘The Game’,https://deadspin.com/ryan-days-legacy-hinges-on-ending-michigans-streak-in-the-game/,2024-11-28T13:35:59.428Z,Ryan Day and the Ohio State Buckeyes have their legacies on the line for their rivalry against the Michigan Wolverines on Saturday November 30th.,"The questions persist every time Ryan Day appears on TV or social media. Does he or doesn’t? How can a 45-year-old coaching in one of sports hottest pressure cookers maintain that coal black hair and beard? If it’s natural, congratulations to him. If not, the entire world may get to see the start of the graying transformation come Saturday afternoon in Columbus if heavily-favored No. 2 Ohio State (10-1, 7-1 Big Ten) is upset by Michigan in The Game, the title given to one of the fiercest rivalries in sports. Michigan (6-5, 4-4 Big Ten) has not only won the past three meetings, but those wins led to three straight conference titles and, to the dismay of Buckeye fans everywhere, the 2023 national championship. Now, Day faces the biggest game of his career since replacing Urban Meyer after the 2018 season. Meyer, by the way, was 7-0 against Michigan. Those numbers are smack dab in the middle of the logo for his restaurant outside Columbus. No one is ready to build an eatery, much less a statue for Day, although his coaching résumé would make most fan bases envious. Not in Ohio’s capital city. Forget Day’s 66-9 record (.800), a 46-4 mark in the Big Ten; his 11-8 record vs. top-10 teams while going 4-6 against top-5 opponents; a 47-0 record vs. unranked teams; two Big Ten titles; and three College Football Playoff appearances (2019, 2020, 2022). After benefiting from about $20 million in NIL money to entice standout transfers such as safety Caleb Downs, quarterback Will Howard, running back Quinshon Judkins and center Seth McLaughlin, as well as using funds for a dozen players who decided to stay for another crack at the Wolverines instead of entering the NFL draft, Day has to, no, must beat Michigan. “I'm excited about this game,” Day said Tuesday. “I'm excited about this team. I love the look in their eye. I love coming to work every day. But this is not about me. It's about these seniors that decided to come back. … They want to have hardware. That's what motivates me. I'm excited for them to go out and play this thing and go win it.” The fear of Buckeye fans is falling back to the John Cooper era from 1988-2000, when Michigan owned a 10-2-1 record. He was followed by Jim Tressel and Meyer, who combined to go 16-2. Day, many forget, added a win in his first try in 2019 against Jim Harbaugh. The following season, The Game was cancelled at Michigan’s request because of the COVID-19 pandemic, although any diehard Ohio State fan will tell you Harbaugh was ducking playing a Buckeye team led by Justin Fields that reached the national title game. That means the last win by Ohio State was five long years ago. Don’t think Day feels the strain? On his Game Time with Ryan Day weekly TV show on Monday, he said the three straight losses are among the worst things that ever happened to him, including his father committing suicide when he was young. “Other than losing my father and a few other things, like it's quite honestly, for my family, the worst thing that's happened,” he said. “So, we can never have that happen again ever. And that's been the approach all season.” Roger Harper, an Ohio State safety who went 0-3-1 vs. Michigan from 1989-92, recounted in the most recent issue of the periodical Buckeye Sports Bulletin a meeting Day had in the offseason with him and other former Buckeyes. “He had us all together,” Harper said. “And he said, ‘Hey, fellas, you guys know that O-H-I-O chant we say? Those last two letters—I owe you guys. This is going to be a differ­ent year for us.’ ” Harper said he appreciated the gesture, but actions speak louder than words. “Ryan Day has told us, he stated him­self, I owe you guys,” he said. “So, we’re going to see come (Saturday) where we are at on that. Be­cause if he doesn’t win, it’s going to be ugly. They’re going right for his head.” Copyright 2024"

While Hopkins is getting close to returning from the injury he suffered last January, the Friars remain uncertain if he will suit up Thursday night against Davidson in the consolation round of the Battle 4 Atlantis in Paradise Island, Bahamas. Before Providence (5-1) started the tournament with a 79-77 loss to Oklahoma on Wednesday, Hopkins was a game-time decision in the return from his knee injury. After Jayden Pierre missed a 3-pointer right before the horn, coach Kim English remained coy about Hopkins returning. ""It's probably me more than him, honestly,"" English said. ""It's me making sure he's right. I can look in his eyes and tell when he's ready. ""He's been great in practice. He's getting close. We want to make sure everything is right. And if we are a couple of games or halves too late, I think that's OK."" Wesley Cardet Jr. scored 17 points and Pierre and Bensley Joseph each added 16 for the Friars. Providence, however, surrendered 23 points off 16 turnovers, allowed Oklahoma to shoot 51 percent from the field, and was unable to overcome a nine-point deficit in the final minute. Davidson (4-1) hopes to avoid a second straight dismal showing after starting the tournament with a 104-71 loss to No. 24 Arizona on Wednesday. Davidson took a quick seven-point lead but could not keep pace and trailed by 12 at halftime before getting outscored 55-34 in the second half. Connor Kochera scored 20 points and Bobby Durkin had 15, but the Wildcats were pushed around in the paint by a 50-28 margin and were outrebounded 47-31. ""We were spinning in circles defensively,"" Davidson coach Matt McKillop said in his postgame radio interview. The schools are meeting in a multi-team event for the second time in five seasons. Providence held on for a 63-62 victory in the 2020 Maui Invitational when it nearly squandered a 19-point lead.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Cardinal may have to start three freshmen in the secondary after injuries ravaged their depth during last Saturday's 24-21 Big Game loss to California. Stanford coach Troy Taylor, finishing his second year on the job, is hopeful experiences like last week's and the one his team may endure this week will strengthen his defensive backs room in years to come. ""You gain stuff from experience,"" Taylor said. ""These (freshmen defensive backs) went through trial by fire. Maybe a little more seasoning would've been in their best interest but they knew they had to step up because of injuries."" Those fresh faces may have to endure their toughest on-the-job training yet. Nash, a finalist for the Biletnikoff Award given to the nation's best wide receiver, caught a touchdown pass in the team's first 10 games. He was kept out of the end zone during last week's 27-16 loss by a combination of good UNLV defense and horrific weather that made throwing a sub-optimal option. Nash has 1,291 receiving yards and 14 touchdowns, one shy of the school's single-season record for receivers. He leads FBS in catches and touchdowns while ranking second in yardage. The former quarterback still appears to have plenty of ceiling, too, as he's only played receiver for two years. ""I think I'm an underdog,"" he said. ""I wasn't majorly recruited and then seeing where I am now and always believing in myself. ... I worked so hard to get to this point."" Nash's work has helped the Spartans (6-5) qualify for a bowl in coach Ken Niumatalolo's first season. Meanwhile, the Cardinal (3-8) can only hope to jump into the offseason with a win that would snap a stretch of seven losses in eight games. Stanford leads the teams' all-time series 52-14-1, although they haven't played since the Cardinal's 34-13 victory in 2013. This will be the first time San Jose State has hosted this game since 2006. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Elvis was part of Dayton's team that faced Arizona in the second round of the NCAA Tournament last season. He had 13 points in the Flyers' 78-68 loss. In Oklahoma's 79-77 win over Providence on Wednesday in the opening round of the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament, he had 26 points on 10-of-14 shooting from the field -- including 3 of 5 from 3-point range. ""I was able to take good shots when they came to me,"" Elvis said. ""I was just playing off my teammates, that sort of thing."" Freshman guard Jeremiah Fears finished with 20 points for the Sooners (5-0). He was 12 of 14 from the free-throw line and had seven assists to offset his eight turnovers. Oklahoma almost squandered an eight-point lead with 32 seconds left. The lead was cut to 79-77 after two free throws by Jayden Pierre with three seconds left following a technical foul called on Oklahoma for six players on the court. A reserve walked on the court without the horn sounding to allow him in the game after Elvis made two free throws. Providence gained possession after Pierre's free throws, and Pierre's 30-foot shot at the buzzer missed off the rim. ""There's a lot to unpack,"" Oklahoma coach Porter Moser said of the last sequence. ""At the end of the day, our philosophy is when you make a free throw late like that, you sub in. You have him sitting at the scorer's table. ""You go in so ... Providence was trying to boat-race it up the court. We sub so we can set our defense. I'll take it. We have young kids ... if they don't understand to check in before going in, that's on me."" Arizona (3-2) bounced back after Tommy Lloyd experienced consecutive losses for the first time in his four years as the Wildcats' head coach. Arizona defeated Davidson 104-71 on Wednesday behind a shooting performance of 56.5 percent (39 of 69) from the field and 50 percent (11 of 22) from 3-point range. Anthony Dell'Orso, a Campbell transfer, was one of five players who finished in double-figures scoring with 21 points. Dell'Orso was 5 of 7 from 3-point range and 8 of 11 overall from the floor. Caleb Love finished with 20 points, five rebounds and four assists. Love was 1 of 15 from 3-point range in consecutive losses to Wisconsin and Duke this month. He made 3 of 7 from beyond the arc against Davidson and was 7 of 13 overall. ""Caleb got downhill, he got to the lane, got to the paint, got to the rim, finished, and that kind of gave him some rhythm,"" Lloyd said. ""After that, he was able to knock down some 3s.""

Buffalo (9-2) has won six straight games and is on the verge of a fifth straight AFC East crown. If the Miami Dolphins lose to the Green Bay Packers on Thursday night, then the Bills would wrap up the division by defeating the 49ers. Buffalo will be up against a San Francisco squad that may not have quarterback Brock Purdy for the second straight week. Purdy was a limited practice participant on Wednesday with the majority of his workload consisting of handoffs due to his ailing right shoulder. The 49ers (5-6) have lost back-to-back games entering a pivotal contest. Buffalo had a bye last week following an impressive 30-21 home victory over the Kansas City Chiefs. ""To be at the bye week ... at 9-2 and obviously feeling confident about what we got going on here and the guys that we have in this locker room, it's a great feeling,"" Bills quarterback Josh Allen said. Allen said it's too early to assume a playoff spot, while Buffalo cornerback Taron Johnson wants to prevent a letdown. ""I love where we're at, but at the same time, we just got to make sure that that we keep that same fire and not get complacent and just continue to play our best ball moving forward,"" Johnson said. ""So even though we have a good record, we still have things we have to clean up and things we got to get better at."" Buffalo has scored at least 30 points in five consecutive games. Allen has passed for 18 touchdowns against five interceptions this season after throwing a career-worst 18 picks last season. San Francisco got walloped last week without Purdy, falling 38-10 to the host Packers. Brandon Allen started at quarterback and completed 17 of 29 passes for 199 yards with one touchdown pass, one interception and one lost fumble. Allen is 2-8 as an NFL starter. He is again getting heavy work in practice in case Purdy's shoulder doesn't significantly improve. The 49ers could use a big performance from running back Christian McCaffrey, who had just 31 yards on 11 carries and caught three passes for 37 yards against Green Bay. McCaffrey missed the first eight games of the season with an Achilles tendon injury and has struggled to run the ball in his three appearances. He has 149 yards on 43 rushes for a paltry 3.5-yard average. ""When you lose and maybe you don't jump out on the stat sheet, your failures are highlighted,"" McCaffrey said Wednesday. ""I'm happy I'm out here playing football and I just know with time it will come."" San Francisco tight end George Kittle had six receptions against the Packers to move into third place on the club's all-time list with 509 receptions. He passed franchise legends Dwight Clark (506) and Roger Craig (508). Star defensive end Nick Bosa (hip, oblique) didn't practice Wednesday, nor did left tackle Trent Williams (ankle). Both players missed the game against Green Bay. Linebacker Dre Greenlaw, who tore his left Achilles tendon during last season's Super Bowl, was back on the field as a limited participant. Star linebacker Fred Warner wasn't listed on San Francisco's injury report but said he fractured a bone in his ankle on Sept. 29 against the New England Patriots and has been playing through the injury. ""I get on that table before every game and get it shot up every single game just to be able to roll,"" Warner said. ""But it's not an excuse. It's just what it is. That's the NFL."" Bills tight end Dalton Kincaid (knee) sat out practice on Wednesday. Linebacker Matt Milano (biceps) was a full participant and could be activated for the contest. Milano was hurt during the preseason. Buffalo averaged 39.5 points while winning the last two meetings with the 49ers, in 2016 and 2020. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

But they didn't think it would come in the cons,"No. 3 Gonzaga and No. 14 Indiana anticipated a second-round clash in the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament. But they didn't think it would come in the consolation round. That's where the two traditional powers landed after both suffered upset losses in the opening round on Wednesday.   After Louisville manhandled the Hoosiers 89-61, West Virginia recorded an 86-78 overtime victory over the Bulldogs. As a result, the two ranked squads will match up on Thanksgiving afternoon in the tournament in Paradise Island, Bahamas.  The Hoosiers were out of sync from the start against the physical Cardinals, committing 23 turnovers and making just 33.3 percent of their shots from the field.  It was the most lopsided result in the 22-game history of the series and ended Louisville's 16-game losing streak against ranked teams.  Despite the 28-point margin, the final score didn't fully indicate the Cardinals' dominance, as they pushed the lead to as many as 38 points.     ""They came out at the very beginning and they punched us and we didn't respond,"" Indiana coach Mike Woodson said. ""I gotta get this team more ready to go. I'm talking about from the beginning to the end.""  Malik Reneau provided 21 points, seven rebounds and four assists, all team highs. His frontcourt mate, 7-foot Oumar Ballo, contributed 11 points on 5-of-8 shooting from the field. The rest of the Hoosiers made just 9 of 43 shots. Indiana's top scorer this season, Mackenzie Mgbako, had a season-low eight points. Myles Rice missed 10 of 11 shots and scored three points. The Hoosiers' defense similarly was ineffective as Louisville shot 56.9 percent from the floor.     ""Defensively, it's always kind of been our signature, and we just didn't have it tonight,"" Woodson said. ""From ball screens to ball movement, we just took nothing away, and we'd been pretty good in those areas."" While Indiana lost to a team that went 8-24 last season, Gonzaga fell to a West Virginia squad that was 9-23.  The Bulldogs seemed to have the game under control as they led 43-33 early in the second half. But the Mountaineers responded with a 17-2 run. Gonzaga answered the spree and had a five-point lead with 25 seconds left as Ryan Nembhard made two free throws. But the Bulldogs surrendered the lead again. Then in the extra session, Gonzaga hit just 2 of 10 shots from the floor and was outrebounded 8-3. ""They bogged down some of our actions,"" Nembhard said. ""They tried to deny our actions a little bit. We just gotta be better at getting to that second action and being able to play through that."" Braden Huff hit 9 of 14 shots and finished with 19 points. Khalif Battle scored 16 points but only two came after intermission. Nembhard had 12 assists but was only 1-for-10 from the floor. ""That game came down to execution at the end,"" said Gonzaga coach Mark Few, who blamed himself for failing to call a timeout at the end of regulation when West Virginia's Tucker DeVries made a key steal that allowed the Mountaineers to take the game to overtime. ""That one's on me,"" Few said.  Indiana and Gonzaga have split their four meetings all-time, with the Hoosiers winning the last matchup in 2008.     --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Now they'll try to gain more momentum in Thursday afternoon's semifinals. While it's no surprise that they're meeting on the tournament's second day, it wasn't supposed to be on the winners' side of the bracket. Both teams posted upsets Wednesday to improve their records to 4-1 this season. Louisville hammered No. 14 Indiana 89-61, and West Virginia took down No. 3 Gonzaga 86-78 in overtime. ""Obviously, the caliber of teams in this tournament, you can enjoy the win for about one minute and 47 seconds,"" Louisville coach Pat Kelsey said. ""We'll turn the page to get ready for our next opponent."" Javon Small's 31 points propelled West Virginia, which shot 41.3 percent from the field but sank 23 of 26 free throws. ""I thought I had a pretty good game,"" Smalls said. ""But like I said, the win is more important."" For the Mountaineers, there was a sense that they hit their stride in clutch moments. ""I thought they were very composed and we had terrific senior leadership from our guys in the huddle,"" West Virginia coach Darian DeVries said. ""Very poised, confident and matter-of-fact in what we needed to do."" An area that could be of concern for the Mountaineers is depth, as only three players were used off the bench -- and only one of them logged double-digit minutes. So there could be stress after Small, Tucker DeVries and Sencire Harris were on the court for 42 minutes in the opening round. Louisville, which played in the first game, didn't have a player log 30 minutes of court time. Much of that came from the lopsided score, with the Cardinals extending a 37-29 halftime lead. ""I'm so proud of our guys, their defensive effort,"" Kelsey said. ""I just thought they played with such tenacity and grit, so much activity."" Wednesday's result was the first time the Cardinals had defeated a ranked opponent since January 2021. Noah Waterman and Chucky Hepburn each scored 16 points for Louisville, which shot 56.9 percent from the floor. This is West Virginia's first visit to the Bahamas for regular-season games. The Mountaineers were supposed to visit the islands in 2020, but that trek was nixed by the COVID pandemic. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Los Angeles Rams are inconsistent. Both teams face an uphill climb to get into the playoffs and have little margin for error left as they prepare to meet Sunday afternoon in New Orleans. The Saints (4-7) have won both games they have played since interim head coach Darren Rizzi was promoted from special teams coordinator to replace Dennis Allen, who was fired Nov. 4 after a seven-game losing streak. New Orleans comes out of its bye sitting in third place in the NFC South, two games behind the Atlanta Falcons and one game behind the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. ""The one thing that I have been most proud of is the guys have done a phenomenal job of keeping their focus on that particular game,"" Rizzi said. ""It's easy to get caught up in all the stuff that's been going on with all the changes. ""The biggest thing is keeping the focus on the week and not getting caught up in the big-picture stuff. If we keep the focus on the next opponent, that other stuff will take care of itself."" This will be the third straight home game for Rizzi as interim head coach. The Saints beat the Falcons 20-17 in his debut and followed that with a 35-14 victory over Cleveland in which they outscored the Browns 21-0 in the fourth quarter. A series of significant injuries contributed to the losing streak, but New Orleans has gotten progressively healthier in recent weeks. Quarterback Derek Carr improved in each of the last three contests after returning from a three-game absence caused by an oblique strain. The return of center Erik McCoy from groin surgery after a seven-game absence was a boost against the Browns, though he sat out part of the second half due to soreness and missed practice on Wednesday. Guard Lucas Patrick (calf) also sat out practice. New Orleans tight end Foster Moreau (shoulder) and running back Jamaal Williams (groin) were limited in practice on Wednesday. The Saints' signing of veteran receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling on Oct. 22 with top receivers Chris Olave and Rashid Shaheed injured has given Carr a much-needed big-play threat. In the past two games, Valdes-Scantling has three touchdown receptions and has averaged 39.2 yards on five catches. The Rams are coming off a 37-20 home loss against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday night, their second defeat in three games after a three-game winning streak. They are tied with the San Francisco 49ers for last place in the NFC West, but they're just one game behind the first-place Seattle Seahawks and Arizona Cardinals and have one game remaining against each of the three rivals. ""It's still wide open,"" Los Angeles safety Kamren Curl said. ""We're all still stacked on each other. We play everybody again, so I feel like in terms of the division race, we've still got our fate in our hands."" Rams coach Sean McVay called the loss to the Eagles ""a humbling night"" after his team struggled on both sides of the ball. The defense allowed Saquon Barkley to rush for a career-high and franchise-record 255 yards as well as two touchdowns, and Los Angeles quarterback Matthew Stafford was sacked five times. Rams wide receiver Demarcus Robinson, who had a touchdown catch against the Eagles, was arrested on suspicion of DUI early Monday morning, but McVay said Wednesday that Robinson would be available Sunday. Los Angeles left tackle Alaric Jackson (foot) missed practice Wednesday, but right tackle Rob Havenstein (ankle), who missed the past three games, practiced fully. Tight end Tyler Higbee (knee) and cornerback Charles Woods (ankle) were limited in practice. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Under the guidance of offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury, Washington rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels looked sharp over the season's first half but hasn't led his team to a win since Nov. 3. Meanwhile, Tennessee (3-8) is coming off a 33-27 upset of the Houston Texans that featured one of Will Levis' best starts of the season. Washington has lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys the past three weeks and enters Week 13 two games behind the NFC East-leading Eagles. After sputtering for three quarters against Dallas, Washington scored 17 fourth-quarter points in a wild 34-26 loss last week. Daniels completed 25 of 38 passes for 274 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions, but 86 of those yards came on a late catch-and-run score by Terry McLaurin. In the three recent losses, Daniels has a 61.5 completion percentage, three touchdowns, three interceptions and a 77.7 passer rating while being sacked 10 times. Daniels did have his best rushing day since Week 1 when he gained 74 yards against Dallas. Until the fourth-quarter touchdown, McLaurin had just four catches for 16 yards after making one grab for 10 yards in the loss to the Eagles. ""I want to get the guy the ball as much as possible,"" Daniels said. ""Terry's a dynamic player, but the defense dictates where the ball goes. So I've got to go out there and do my job."" Commanders head coach Dan Quinn wants his team to rediscover its direction. ""I want to see this identity just reveal itself about how we play,"" Quinn said. ""And those things will play out as we're going and that's what I want to see from the guys -- that the speed, the effort, the finishing, and if we do those things right, the score will certainly take care of itself, but that's what I want to see."" That goal will be difficult against a Titans defense that ranks second in the NFL behind the Eagles, giving up just 276.4 yards per game. On the other side of the ball, the Tennessee offense is improving since Levis returned from his right shoulder injury. In their first six games, the Titans averaged 135 passing yards, with five touchdowns and seven interceptions. Since then, the Titans have averaged 224.3 passing yards per game, with nine touchdown passes and six interceptions. ""Putting together some good performances on all sides of the ball, and improving,"" Levis said. ""Feel like we're putting more consistent ball on tape. But the exciting thing is there's still a lot to get better at, and a lot to clean up to put us in a better opportunity to win games."" Running back Tony Pollard had his best game of the season against Houston, rushing 24 times for 119 yards and a touchdown. ""His physicality and toughness stands out,"" Titans coach Brian Callahan said. ""He's been incredibly productive."" On the injury front, Tennessee cornerback Chidobe Awuzie (groin) was moved to the designated to return list and practiced on Wednesday for the first time since September. However, linebacker Luke Gifford (hamstring), edge rusher Arden Key (back), cornerback Roger McCreary (knee), receiver Calvin Ridley (ankle) and tackle Leroy Watson IV (back) did not practice on Wednesday. Washington also got good news as cornerback Marshon Lattimore (hamstring) practiced for the first time since he was acquired from the New Orleans Saints on Nov. 5, though he was limited. Running back Austin Ekeler (concussion) and tackle Andrew Wylie (concussion) did not practice on Wednesday, and running back Brian Robinson Jr. (ankle) was limited. The Commanders placed kicker Austin Seibert on injured reserve with a hip injury after he missed two extra-point attempts and a field goal attempt on Sunday. Zane Gonzalez replaced Seibert in two games he missed previously, and he could be elevated from the practice squad. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Star running back Breece Hall sat out practice earlier this week with a knee injury, and it was uncertain if he would play Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks in East Rutherford, N.J. ""We're going to protect him from himself a little bit, but we'll see how the week goes along,"" Jets interim head coach Jeff Ulbrich said of Hall, who has 632 yards rushing along with 46 catches for 401 yards and six total touchdowns this season. ""Still hopeful that he's going to play for us, but we'll see."" Ulbrich said Hall injured his knee in a 28-27 loss to Indianapolis on Nov. 17, though he was able to finish the game. The Jets (3-8) had a bye last week. In addition, veteran offensive tackle Tyron Smith, an eight-time Pro Bowl selection, remains out for New York due to a neck injury. Ulbrich admitted Smith, who sat out the Indianapolis game, could be headed to injured reserve. ""Just not enough improvement at this point,"" Ulbrich said of Smith. The Jets hope to get linebacker C.J. Mosley (herniated neck disk) back after he was sidelined the past four games. Wide receiver Malachi Corley (illness) didn't practice on Wednesday. New York quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who turns 41 Monday, wasn't among those listed on the injury report Wednesday for the first time since late September. There have been questions about whether Rodgers wants to play next season, and if so whether he'd return to the Jets. ""Football life is interesting because there's no guarantees,"" Rodgers said. ""Even with injuries, obviously, with contract situations, with age, with coaching changes, new scheme possibly, new system. There's a lot of unknowns, so that stuff is out of my control. ""I'm just going to enjoy these times here and let the future take care of itself."" Ulbrich is sticking with Rodgers. ""Definitely, as long as he's healthy, my plan is to play him,"" Ulbrich said. ""And I know talking to him, that's the way he wants to do it, too."" The streaky Seahawks (6-5) are back to their winning ways and are tied with the Arizona Cardinals atop the NFC West. After opening the season by going 3-0, Seattle lost five of its next six games before winning its past two against division rivals. Coach Mike Macdonald's defense has been much improved since a bye in Week 10, as the Seahawks defeated the host San Francisco 49ers 20-17 and visiting Arizona 16-6 over the past two weeks. ""Three games in a row now we played pretty decent on defense,"" Macdonald said. ""There is an expectation and standard here throughout the course of our Seahawks history that we're trying to live up to and build on. So that's the idea."" Coby Bryant returned an interception 69 yards for a touchdown and Leonard Williams had 2 1/2 sacks against the Cardinals. Williams said a team leadership meeting during the Seahawks' bye week altered the players' mindsets. ""I think that made it just crunch time for us,"" Williams said. ""We just understood the urgency of getting the job done."" Williams (foot) was one of four Seahawks to miss practice on Wednesday due to ailments, though he has been on the injured list most of the season and he has sat out just one game. Also sidelined were receivers DK Metcalf (shoulder) and Tyler Lockett (knee), as well as recently acquired safety AJ Finley (knee). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Emanuel Sharp's 17 points led the Cougars (4-2), who got 13 points from Terrance Arceneaux plus 10 points and nine assists from Milos Uzan. Tae Davis finished with 22 points and eight rebounds for the Fighting Irish (4-3). Braeden Shrewsberry added 16 points. Notre Dame is 0-2 in Las Vegas this week and will play Creighton, which has also lost twice in the Players Era event, for seventh place of eight teams on Saturday morning. Houston is 1-1 and will play San Diego State for third place. Houston went ahead by 10 early in the second half, but Notre Dame closed the deficit to 45-44 thanks to a hot start to the half for Shrewsberry, who hit three 3-pointers and another basket. Davis made a layup with 13:41 to play to cut Houston's lead to one. The Cougars later went almost four minutes without scoring a point, but Notre Dame couldn't take advantage. The drought ended on a shot from L.J. Cryer, which gave Houston a 52-45 lead at the 7:14 mark. J'Wan Roberts drove to the basket for a layup, giving the Cougars a 56-47 lead with 3:52 left. The clinching basket came from Sharp, who banked in a 3-pointer from well beyond the arc as the shot clock ticked down for a 59-49 Houston lead with 1:43 to go. The Irish got only as close as seven points behind after that. Notre Dame did get some good news before the Wednesday game. Leading scorer Markus Burton, who sustained a knee injury early in the Irish' overtime loss to Rutgers on Tuesday, is expected to return this season. Burton is due for an MRI when the Irish get back to Indiana from Las Vegas. He watched from the bench wearing a leg brace on Wednesday. Arceneaux made all six of his first-half shot attempts, including back-to-back jumpers to give the Cougars a 27-18 lead. He made another jump shot with eight seconds to play in the half to give Houston a 39-31 lead at the break. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Maye, the third overall pick in this year's draft, has made it clear that he isn't intimidated by the ""rookie wall,"" a phenomenon that states that first-year players begin to drop off at a certain point in the season. The 22-year-old is set to make his ninth appearance (eighth start) of the campaign here in Week 13. ""As a starting quarterback, I don't really think a rookie wall is going to hit me,"" Maye said. ""I think by this time, everybody is going through some type of injury, tired or something like that. So, what an opportunity to be the starting quarterback for the New England Patriots. ""So, really no rookie wall for me."" However, Maye did struggle for a good portion of the Patriots' 34-15 loss to the Miami Dolphins last Sunday. He finished with 222 yards, one touchdown and one interception on 22-of-37 passing. New England coach Jerod Mayo knows that facing Indianapolis (5-7) won't be any easier for the young signal-caller. ""The Colts, it's going to be a huge challenge for us,"" Mayo said. ""I would say defensively, this is one of the better fronts, more disruptive fronts that we have faced this year."" It was the offense that let down Indianapolis last Sunday, as quarterback Anthony Richardson and Co. collected only 11 first downs in a 24-6 loss to the Detroit Lions. Richardson completed 11 of 28 passes for 172 yards. He was also the Colts' leading rusher (10 carries, 61 yards). Star running back Jonathan Taylor was held to 35 yards on 11 carries against Detroit, but Indianapolis coach Shane Steichen is hopeful that he will do more damage against the Patriots (3-9). ""We wanna be efficient running the football,"" Steichen said. ""We gotta get those 3, 4, 5 yards a pop and then hopefully hit the big ones this week."" Getting the run going could become even more important if wide receivers Josh Downs, Alec Pierce and Ashton Dulin aren't able to take the field. All three wouldn't have practiced on Wednesday had the Colts not opted to simply do a walkthrough. Downs' absence could end up hurting Indianapolis the most. The second-year man has a team-leading 53 catches for 594 yards and four TDs. ""I think it's going to be tough for him this week,"" Steichen said of the possibility of having Downs ready to go. ""Not ruling him out, but could be tough for him this week."" Joining Downs (shoulder), Pierce (foot) and Dulin (ankle) as a would-be spectator at practice was center Tanor Bortolini, who is dealing with a concussion. Twelve players with injury designations were limited during New England's practice on Wednesday, including receiver Demario Douglas (ankle), linebacker Anfernee Jennings (knee) and safeties Kyle Dugger (ankle) and Jabrill Peppers (knee). Peppers returned to the team this week after a stint on the commissioner's exempt list that stemmed from an Oct. 5 arrest. He was allegedly involved in a domestic dispute and charged with assault and battery on an intimate partner, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, strangulation and possession of a Class B drug.

Atlanta (6-5) still holds a one-game lead over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFC South, despite dropping its past two games. The Falcons are seeking their first winning season and playoff appearance since 2017. A win Sunday would go a long way in accomplishing both. Two weeks ago, Atlanta lost 38-6 on the road to the Denver Broncos. The offense managed just 226 total yards, while producing its lowest point total of the season. The Falcons' defense didn't fare much better, as the unit was gashed by rookie quarterback Bo Nix, who threw four touchdowns. After a much-needed bye week, quarterback Kirk Cousins and the rest of the Falcons understand what's ahead. ""We've all had a great chance to recharge and refill the tanks for this stretch run here,"" Cousins said. ""You have six games left and we have to earn the right to go play a seventh. You talk about the ‘whys' behind everything. Why are we where we are, good or bad, and then how to fix it? ... It's one thing to talk about it, it's another thing to go do it. That's what's so important about the next six weeks, that we take what we gathered on the bye and put it to use."" Cousins, in the first year of a four-year, $180 million contract in Atlanta, has thrown for 2,807 yards -- good for fifth in the NFL. The 36-year-old veteran uses this part of the season as a time to examine where the team is entering the tail end. ""You certainly need to put yourself in a position before Thanksgiving to be playing for something meaningful after,"" Cousins said. ""We're in a place where we can control our destiny, and that if we go out and execute at a high level, we can go where we want to go. I've been on teams where you weren't in the hunt around Thanksgiving, and that's a tough place to be. But no one is going to give us anything, you've got to go earn it."" If the final six weeks go according to plan, Cousins would become the first Falcons quarterback since Matt Ryan in 2008 to lead the team to the playoffs in his first year. Standing in Atlanta's way are the Los Angeles Chargers, a team with its own postseason aspirations. Under first-year head coach Jim Harbaugh, the Chargers (7-4) hold the second AFC wild-card spot, sandwiched between the 8-4 Baltimore Ravens and 7-5 Broncos. Each team has an advantage over the 5-6 Miami Dolphins, who are out of the current picture. After starting the year 3-3, the Chargers won four games in a row before dropping their home game Monday to the Ravens, 30-23. In a battle between Jim and his brother John, Los Angeles squandered a 10-0, second-quarter lead. Making matters worse, starting running back J.K. Dobbins suffered an MCL sprain in his left knee in the loss, and is expected to be out this week. He is considered week-to-week beyond that. Chargers backup running backs Gus Edwards and Hassan Haskins will try to account for the absence of Dobbins, who's rushed for 766 yards and eight touchdowns this season. ""I like them a lot,"" Harbaugh said of Los Angeles' running backs. ""Gus is heating back up, great to have him in there. Hassan is really playing spectacular football, special teams, pass protection, he's had some crucial first-down pickups for us in short-yardage. ... I'm excited to see them out there."" The Chargers' defense has been outstanding this season, allowing an NFL-best 15.9 points per game. However, Harbaugh knows not to discount Cousins. ""(Kirk) is just the consummate pro,"" Harbaugh said. ""Consistently good every game. He's got a knack, a great feel for the game. He's super tough, competitive as they come. Nothing but respect."" Cousins' counterpart Justin Herbert has thrown for 2,404 yards, 13 touchdowns and just one interception for Los Angeles. Along with Dobbins, linebackers Khalil Mack (rest) and Denzel Perryman (groin), safety Alohi Gilman (hamstring), cornerback Cam Hart (ankle) and tight end Will Dissly (groin) did not practice Wednesday for the Chargers. For Atlanta, wide receiver Darnell Mooney (Achilles) and cornerbacks Dee Alford (hamstring) and Mike Hughes (neck) were among 12 players who were limited in practice Wednesday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The win was Dayton's first at the tournament, after losses by two points to No. 12 North Carolina and five points to No. 5 Iowa State during their previous two games. UConn (4-3) entered the event with a 17-game winning streak but came up short by two points in overtime against Memphis and by one point against Colorado.

"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",Vikings return home in search of 5th straight win,https://deadspin.com/vikings-return-home-in-search-of-5th-straight-win/,2024-11-28T08:12:24.029Z,The Minnesota Vikings will aim for their second five-game winning streak this season when they host the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday afternoon in Minne,"The Minnesota Vikings will aim for their second five-game winning streak this season when they host the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday afternoon in Minneapolis. Minnesota (9-2) is coming off a 30-27 overtime win on the road against the division rival Chicago Bears last Sunday. The Vikings have won each of their past three games on the road, and they return home for the first time since beating the Indianapolis Colts 21-13 four weeks ago. Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell said his players are eager to return to their home turf. ""When they hit the field, they're going to be jacked to be back in front of our fans,"" said O'Connell, whose team began the season 5-0. ""We know it'll be an unbelievable atmosphere. We've got to give them something to be excited about."" Arizona (6-5) will try to get back to its winning ways after losing 16-6 on the road against the Seattle Seahawks last week. The defeat snapped a four-game winning streak for the Cardinals, who started the season 2-4 but have gone 4-1 since then. Cardinals coach Jonathan Gannon knows that this game, followed by a rematch against Seattle, could prove pivotal for his team's postseason hopes. Two wins would put Arizona at 8-5; two losses put the team below .500. And in the tight NFC West, every game seems particularly critical from here on out. Despite sitting only one game above break even, the Cardinals enter Week 13 tied for the division lead with the Seahawks. The Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers each are a game back at 5-6. The Cardinals have one game remaining with each of the three teams. ""We're in playoff football right now, is what it is,"" Gannon said. ""We don't shy away from that. With the holiday coming up, you can be thankful we're playing meaningful games right now. Because we've earned that right. But it really doesn't mean you-know-what."" Kyler Murray owns a 98.0 passer rating, throwing for 2,343 yards, 12 touchdowns and four interceptions. He also has 380 yards and four touchdowns on the ground. James Conner is Arizona's top backfield threat with 705 rushing yards and five touchdowns. Tight end Trey McBride has a team-high 61 catches for 685 yards. For Minnesota, Sam Darnold has taken full advantage of his opportunity to show the rest of the league that he can be a capable starter. He has a 101.7 passer rating and has thrown for 2,717 yards, 21 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. But Darnold's recent performance is very much a mirror of the Vikings' play during their second month-long winning streak of the season -- not nearly as impressive as the first streak, but still good enough to win. The 27-year-old has thrown five interceptions during the four-game stretch (though none in the last two games). After throwing 11 TDs in his first four games, he has seven in his past four. And the Vikings have struggled to put teams away in November, winning by eight, five, 10 and three points. Against the Bears, Minnesota blew a 14-point, fourth-quarter lead -- including surrendering 11 points in the final 22 seconds of regulation before escaping in OT. Aaron Jones has 1,083 yards from scrimmage (798 rushing, 285 receiving) and four touchdowns (three rushing, one receiving) for the Vikings. Justin Jefferson leads the team with 61 catches for 939 yards and five touchdowns. The Vikings signed ex-New York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones this week. Jones provides the team with depth but the offense belongs to Darnold as the playoff push approaches. The Vikings will play without linebacker Ivan Pace Jr., who was placed on injured reserve this week because of a hamstring strain. Tight end Josh Oliver (wrist/ankle) is uncertain for this weekend. Safety Jay Ward (elbow) joined Oliver in sitting out practice Wednesday. The Cardinals had several players who were limited in practice to start the week. The group included safety Jalen Thompson (ankle), running back Emari Demercado (back) and offensive lineman Jonah Williams (shoulder). This will be the teams' first meeting since Oct. 30, 2022, when the Vikings won 34-26 at home. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Flyers (6-2) went on a 7-0 run, capped when Javon Bennett found Cheeks open in transition for a 3-pointer that extended Dayton's lead to 69-57 with 4:27 to go. Alex Karaban scored two of his game-high 21 points on the ensuing Huskies possession, but Dayton came right back with Posh Alexander feeding Cheeks on a lob pass. Cheeks was fouled as he dunked home the alley-oop, then completed the three-point play. After a Samson Johnson dunk on the other end, Nate Santos knocked down a 3-pointer, and Cheeks completed his pivotal outburst by sinking a jump shot off one of Alexander's six assists. The sequence blew the game open, giving the Flyers a win they took losses by two points to No. 12 North Carolina and five points to No. 5 Iowa State during their previous two games in the Maui Invitational. UConn (4-3) entered the event with a 17-game winning streak but came up short by two points in overtime against Memphis and by one point against Colorado. The three losses in Maui equal the total number of defeats the Huskies took in the 2023-24 season. Four players scored in double figures to buoy the Dayton offense. Santos finished with 18 points, Alexander scored 16 off the bench, and Zed Key added 15. Dayton shot 8-for-17 from 3-point range and an outstanding 27-for-30 from the free-throw line. UConn went just 8-for-29 from 3-point distance and 7-for-11 at the free-throw line. Fifteen of Karaban's 21 coming in the first half.

Robinson is in his ninth season in the NFL and has played for the Kansas City Chiefs (2016-2021), Baltimore Ravens (2022) and the Rams. He has played in 141 games (62 starts) and has 245 receptions for 2,892 yards and 26 touchdowns in his career. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Gaels (6-0) head into the two-day event seeking their first-ever win over USC (5-1). Saint Mary's is 0-10 against the Trojans all-time, though the programs have not played since December 2009. Saint Mary's heads into Palm Desert with four players averaging from 12.3 points per game to Augustas Marciulionis' team-leading 14.7 points per game. Among them is Paulius Murauskas, who is putting up 14.3 points and 10.3 rebounds per contest. The Gaels' most recent game was an 80-66 home win over Cal Poly on Saturday. Luke Barrett recorded 19 points and 10 rebounds for Saint Mary's, and Mitchell Saxen went for 13 points and 13 rebounds. Barrett is putting up 12.3 points and 7.5 rebounds per game, up from averages of 5.5 points and 3.5 rebounds per game in 2023-24. ""Number one is probably the cardio,"" Barrett said of what he worked on before the season to prepare for a more prominent role. ""I knew I'd be playing around double the minutes. (The coaching staff) made that clear to me that I had to get in really good shape. I was more of a spark guy last year."" Conditioning will be a factor for both Saint Mary's and USC throughout the weekend, with both teams set for back-to-back games. Arizona State and New Mexico meet in the event's other game on Thursday, with the two contests' winners and losers set to face on Friday. For USC, the Acrisure Classic marks the first games away from home under first-year coach Eric Musselman. The Trojans closed their season-opening, six-game homestand on Sunday with a late-game surge to hold off pesky Grambling State, 80-69. USC's Chibuzo Agbo shot 4-for-9 from 3-point range en route to 21 points, his second game of 20-plus points since being moved from the starting lineup to a bench role. Desmond Claude added 14 points, five rebounds and five assists while also playing in a reserve role for the first time this season. ""He is still such a young player developing so much of his game,"" Musselman said of Claude, a junior transfer from Xavier. The Acrisure Classic provides USC with a new measuring stick before the Trojans begin their first Big Ten Conference slate next week vs. Oregon. ""The biggest thing when playing on a holiday is to stay focused,"" Musselman said. ""We have a job to do. We have back-to-back games, so staying healthy is super important for back-to-back games."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The result came two nights after their coach, Mike Malone, called out their lack of effort and leadership following a 145-118 loss to the Knicks in Denver. Collin Sexton netted 26 points and Keyonte George scored 23 to lead the Jazz, who couldn't hold onto their early double-digit lead.

They are also unbeaten in their neutral-site games this season with Arizona State victorious against Santa Clara at Henderson, Nev., and Grand Canyon in Phoenix, and New Mexico with a win over UCLA at Henderson. They meet after playing in the doubleheader at Henderson on Nov. 8. The Lobos' 72-64 victory over a ranked UCLA team that night was their ""best performance"" of the season to this point, according to coach Richard Pitino. New Mexico played nine days later at St. John's in New York, where Pitino coached against his father Rick Pitino, and lost 85-71. The Lobos have defeated Grambling State 80-58 and Texas Southern 99-68 at The Pit in Albuquerque since that loss. Tru Washington led the Lobos with 19 points and 10 rebounds in the win over Texas Southern on Sunday night. Mustapha Amzil matched his career high as a Lobo with 18 points while Donovan Dent had 11 points and five assists. Filip Borovicanin tied his career high with 11 points off the bench, while Kayde Dotson added 10 points. ""I thought we played really well,"" the younger Pitino said of the win over Texas Southern. ""I think UCLA was our best performance, but all around we did a lot of great things. I thought we missed some open looks in the first half that we converted on in the second half. ""We continue to turn teams over at a high rate."" Texas Southern had 20 turnovers that led to a 30-2 edge in points off turnovers for the Lobos.

The Wildcats (5-1) and Bulldogs (4-1) open the three-day event Thursday afternoon in Tempe. The winner will claim its most significant victory so far this season and a chance to notch another Friday against either No. 25 Mississippi State (5-0) or UNLV (4-1).   Three of Northwestern's key players are still easing into the campaign after returning from injuries. Preseason all-Big Ten selection Brooks Barnhizer has played just two games after undergoing offseason foot injury, while Ty Berry (knee) and Matthew Nicholson (foot) missed the whole offseason.   ""It's not a work of art right now -- and I knew that coming into the year,"" Northwestern coach Chris Collins said. ""You have three starters who missed all summer and all fall. We're learning and putting together our team on the fly.""   Though mid-range master Nick Martinelli has stepped into the void -- his 23.8 points per game entering Thursday rank fourth nationally -- the Wildcats are still searching for their 3-point touch. They ranked seventh in the country last season at 39.0 percent, but they're hitting just 31.7 percent this year. That includes a 2-of-11 showing against Pepperdine in their most recent outing.   ""We've got to get in the gym and trust our work,"" Collins said. ""I tell the guys, ‘Just throw yourself in the competition.' And we've got good enough shooters. We've got guys I really believe in that will make shots.""   Northwestern's weakness is Butler's strength. Entering Thursday, the Bulldogs are tied for 12th in the nation in 3-point shooting accuracy (41.1 percent) and rank eighth in 3-point defense (24.3 percent). Butler hit 8 of 20 threes in its 78-39 home win over Merrimack on Friday. The Bulldogs outscored the Warriors 41-8 in the second half after holding just a six-point lead at the break.

With Anthony Cirelli off for a double-minor high-sticking penalty, Wilson broke a 4-4 tie by deflecting a shot by Jakob Chychrun for his seventh goal of the season. Wilson, Aliaksei Protas and Dylan Strome had a goal and an assist apiece, while Andrew Mangiapane and John Carlson found the net for Washington, which evened the season series with the Lightning at 1-1-0. Goalie Charlie Lindgren had 24 saves. Tampa Bay's Brayden Point collected his fifth career hat trick, Michael Eyssimont added a goal, and goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy stopped 27 shots. In his 13th season behind the Lightning bench, Jon Cooper became just the seventh bench boss in NHL history to coach 900 games with one franchise. Point was on the receiving end of a two-on-one rush pass by Jake Guentzel and lifted a quick backhander by Lindgren at 3:58 of the first period to open the scoring. The shifty center then moved up the Lightning career leaderboard at 12:27 of the first with his 97th career power-play goal -- snapping a tie with Martin St. Louis for third place all-time in the organization's history -- for a 2-0 lead. On a delayed penalty in the second, the Capitals set up a pass to Lars Eller, who one-timed a shot above the right circle. Mangiapane deflected it over Vasilevskiy at 10:31 to put Washington on the board. On its third power play, the Lightning saw the lead slip away when Wilson got a pass out to Protas, who beat Vasilevskiy on the near post at 12:29 with his eighth goal -- the first one short-handed of his career and the third by the Capitals this season. Eyssimont stole the puck from Martin Fehervary with a hard check behind Lindgren's goal and slipped in his second marker in as many games to put the home side back on top with only 44 seconds left in the frame. The Capitals tied it on Strome's seventh goal just 97 seconds into the third, but disaster struck on a harmless pass back to Lindgren. The right-handed shooting goalie attempted to clear the puck behind his net but backhanded it into the cage. He then retrieved the puck and flipped into the stands. Point touched it last for the Lightning, awarding him his third goal. Carlson's third tally at 10:30 tied it 4-4 and moved him into 10th all-time among goals scored by a U.S.-born defenseman. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Lizotte converted a sharp-angled offering for his third goal of the season in his first game after missing five outings due to a concussion. Raty put the Canucks on the board at 8:52 by snapping a second-chance shot from the slot for his second of the season. Rakell restored Pittsburgh's lead four minutes later by taking advantage of a loose puck at the doorstep for his eighth of the campaign. Hayes extended the Pittsburgh lead at 15:14 of the first by chipping a close-in chance on the power play for his fourth of the season. Rust made it a 4-1 affair 2 1/2 minutes later when he converted Crosby's pass on an odd-man rush. Rust then notched his second of the night and seventh of the season at 3:40 of the second period, snapping a top-corner shot from the top of the right circle. The Canucks did not pack it in. Suter made it a 5-2 game exactly 10 minutes later by blasting a shot from the left faceoff dot for his seventh goal of the season. Hughes made it a two-goal deficit 40 seconds into the third period with a coast-to-coast rush that ended by him slipping through a pair of defenders and burying his fifth goal of the season. Pettersson's seventh of the season with 106 seconds remaining in regulation, coming with the goalie on the bench for the extra attacker, pulled Vancouver within one, but it was too little, too late. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Sengun (22 points, 14 rebounds) and Amen Thompson (19 and 13) each registered a double-double for Houston, which completed a sweep of its brief two-game trip after defeating the Minnesota Timberwolves in overtime on Tuesday night.   Tyrese Maxey posted 39 points and 10 assists and Guerschon Yabusele chipped in 22 points for Philadelphia, which continued to play without Joel Embiid (knee), Paul George (knee) and Kyle Lowry (hip). Caleb Martin (back) also sat out as the Sixers fell to 3-14 this season despite rallying from an eight-point deficit late in regulation.   Philadelphia took a three-point lead early in overtime, but Green tied it with three free throws before Sengun took over. His tip-in gave Houston the lead, and then he made another tip-in and finally a spinning layup for a 117-111 advantage with 1:20 to play.   Sengun also had a key blocked shot on Maxey -- on a play that was originally ruled a goaltend -- that helped seal the win with 30.5 seconds left.   Maxey drained a 3-pointer with 3:27 left in regulation to bring the hosts within 104-100, but Sengun responded with two free throws and then found Thompson for a layup to give the Rockets an eight-point lead with 1:59 left. Philadelphia quickly whittled the deficit to 108-105 and then Maxey was fouled on a wild 3-point attempt (and made all three free throws) with 11.1 seconds remaining.   Houston drew up a play for Sengun to end regulation, but his isolation attempt was futile as the game went to overtime.   Green dominated the first quarter, scoring 18 points on 6-of-8 shooting, including three 3-pointers, as Houston sailed to a 35-24 advantage. He scored 14 straight points for Houston early in the game but was held to three points in the second quarter as the Sixers inched within 55-51 at the break.   The Rockets scored the final five points of the third quarter -- capped by Aaron Holiday's 3-pointer -- to carry an 88-82 lead into the fourth.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Two days after getting just one goal despite taking a season-high 44 shots in a loss to the Winnipeg Jets, the Wild matched that scoring output while putting 29 on net. Gustavsson also got some help from his teammates, who blocked 32 shots.   In doing so, they ended Buffalo's three-game winning streak and became the first NHL team this season to record its 10th road win.   Minnesota scored first less than seven minutes into the game. Brock Faber's takeaway near the Wild net created a four-on-one breakaway that ended with Kirill Kaprizov's goal. The Russian set up his 14th of the season after a give-and-go with Joel Eriksson Ek. Matt Boldy also picked up an assist.   Kaprizov, who did not record a point in their loss Monday, has now recorded at least one in 17 games of the 21 he's played this season and in 12 of the 13 road games. He's been held pointless in consecutive games only once this season.   The counterattack was one of the few chances the Wild had during the first period, as the Sabres outshot their guests 16-4.   Minnesota put more shots on Ukko-PekkaLuukkonen, who finished with 28 saves, in the remaining periods, but the fifth-year veteran kept the Sabres in the game by denying the Wild on quality chances. That included a pair of shots three seconds apart midway through the third period. After making the save on Jon Merrill's shot, Luukkonen recovered to keep Devin Shore from extending the Wild's lead.   Tage Thompson returned to the Sabres on Wednesday.

Moore scored 13 points and Freeman added 10 to help the Orange take a 39-28 lead at the break. Noard led the Big Red with eight points in the first half. Cornell had another quick start after halftime, going on an 8-2 run to trim their deficit to 41-38 with 17:35 left in the game on Noard's layup. The Big Red got within 51-49 after two free throws by Okereke with 12:31 left. But Syracuse responded with an 11-2 run, capped by Starling's jumper with 9:14 left, to push its lead to 62-51. Williams' jumper with 2:53 left trimmed Cornell's deficit to 73-69 with 2:53 left but the Big Red got no closer than that the rest of the way. The Orange committed a season-low six turnovers in the game and made 17 of 20 from the free-throw line. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Simas Lukosius had 16 points on four 3-pointers and dished out four assists for the Bearcats (6-0), who led by as many as 27 but shot below 50 percent (44.9) for the first time all season. Jizzle James (13 points, eight rebounds, five assists), Dillo Mitchell (10 points, eight rebounds) and Aziz Bandaogo (10 points, nine rebounds) rounded out Cincinnati's high-scoring group. Amarr Knox led Alabama State (3-4) with a game-high 24 points and added five rebounds. He was held to only seven second-half points as the Hornets shot 6-for-28 from the field after the intermission. Jalen Keago's 12 points came on the strength of three 3-pointers to shave 10 points off the Hornets' deficit in the final four-plus minutes. After Knox's opening jumper, James banged down a 3-pointer before connecting with Bandaogo connected for an alley-oop dunk to complete the Bearcats' initial 10-point swing. Knox scored 12 of Alabama State's first 19 points, first bringing the visitors within three after his triple with 12:38 left before halftime. Page's three-point play helped the Bearcats respond with a 5-0 spurt, but Ubong Okon and Knox hit consecutive shots to make it 23-19 at the halfway point. Cincinnati seized full control as Mitchell's first of two breakaway dunks fueled a 10-4 run. The Texas transfer's two layups in four seconds started the latter 10-0 outburst. Arrinten Page's slam with 2:05 left upped the Bearcats' lead to 18, but Knox's personal 5-0 run trimmed off five points in the final 54 seconds for a 46-33 halftime score. After Alabama State's TJ Medlock opened the second-half scoring with two free throws at the 18:36 mark, the hosts rattled off a 12-1 run. That stretch saw the visitors begin the latter period in a funk from the field, ending with a Knox layup with 11:42 to go. The Bearcats added to their lead after the 8:00 mark as Lukosius hit an open three to spark his 5-0 stretch before Bandaogo's quick pair of dunks. A second Lukosius trey with 4:21 remaining gave Cincinnati its largest lead. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

James said her brother had severe brain swelling and bleeding. WAFF-TV in Huntsville, Ala., displayed a video of the play in which he was hurt, though it is unclear exactly how he was injured so severely.

Oklahoma led by nine with 44 seconds left before Providence made a late push, taking advantage of some missed free throws by the Sooners. Corey Floyd Jr.'s layup with five seconds left after an Oklahoma turnover cut the Friars' deficit to two, 77-75. Providence forced a Sooners' timeout on the inbounds play, but Oklahoma eventually got the ball in and Elvis hit both of his free throws to extend the lead to four. But after Elvis' second free throw, the Sooners were called for having too many men on the floor when Oklahoma's Jacolb Fredson-Cole stepped onto the court to check in, expecting a stoppage. Officials never stopped play for the substitution, and not only was Providence's quick foul negated, but the Friars were awarded two free throws and the ball. Jayden Pierre hit both free throws, but his desperation 3-point heave at the buzzer hit off the back of the rim to allow the Sooners to escape with the victory. Pierre finished with 16 points and six rebounds for the Friars, who also got 16 points from Bensley Joseph and 17 from Wesley Cardet.

Crawford played 13 of his 14 major league seasons with the San Francisco Giants and won World Series rings in 2012 and 2014. He won four Gold Glove Awards during his career. Crawford's best season was 2021 when he finished fourth in National League MVP voting after batting .298 with 24 homers and 90 RBIs in 138 games. Crawford, 37, spent 2024 with the St. Louis Cardinals but will long be remembered as one of the top shortstops in Giants' history. He played a franchise record 1,617 games at the position, breaking the mark of Hall of Famer Travis Jackson (1,326 from 1922-36). ""Growing up in the Bay Area and going to games at Candlestick, I always dreamed of playing for the San Francisco Giants,"" Crawford wrote. ""Being drafted by my hometown team and spending most of my career with them far surpassed any dream I had as a kid. I definitely pretended to win a World Series in my backyard -- but winning two? That was beyond my wildest dreams. ""I always dreamed of being the shortstop for the Giants, but never could I have imagined breaking the team record for the most games played at the position."" Crawford first reached the majors in 2011 and was a key player on the title teams of 2012 and 2014. He was an NL All-Star for the first time in 2015. He also made the team in 2018 and 2021. ""Watching Brandon play was an absolute privilege for not only me but for Giants' fans everywhere,"" Giants CEO Larry Baer said in a news release.

No matter the records, the matchup between bitter NFC East rivals always draws national attention -- even if both teams are jockeying primarily for draft position.  The Giants (2-9) are expected to start their third different quarterback in as many weeks in an attempt to snap a six-game losing streak, while the Cowboys (4-7) will trot out their own backup signal-caller in search of their first home victory since 2023. ODDS & TRENDS The Cowboys are consensus 3.5-point favorites, which the public views as a big opportunity. Dallas has been backed by 83 percent of the spread-line money while its -200 moneyline to win the game outright has drawn 95 percent of the money.  This has also been the second most wagered-on Week 13 game at DraftKings, where the Cowboys' moneyline has drawn more money this week than every team other than Detroit. What oddsmakers don't expect is a high-scoring game between two backup quarterbacks. The low 37.0 total points line at BetRivers has seen the Over draw 65 percent of the money and 77 percent of the total bets. PROP PICKS --Giants RB Tyrone Tracy 70+ Rushing Yards (+100 at DraftKings): The rookie has taken over as the primary ballcarrier, and this prop will likely be determined by how long New York remains competitive on Thursday. After logging at least 16 carries in three consecutive games, Tracy was limited to 42 yards on nine carries in a blowout loss to Tampa Bay last Sunday. The Giants must run the ball effectively to stay in the game, and Tracy has at least 66 rushing yards in four of his past seven games. --Cowboys WR CeeDee Lamb Anytime TD (+155 at BetRivers): Lamb has been targeted 118 times this season -- 60 more than anyone else on the team. That includes 12 targets last week, when Lamb caught 10 passes but for only 67 yards. He hasn't scored since last month, however, a trend Dallas will look to break at home against a defense that has allowed 12 passing touchdowns this season. THE NEWS Cooper Rush helped the Cowboys return to the win column at Washington before the three-day prep for playing holiday host to the Giants, who have shuffled plans amid another potential quarterback switch.  ""The fight has definitely been there,"" Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy said. ""But we're still pretty far down in the valley of adversity right now. We've made one step in the right direction, so we've still got a lot of climbing to do."" The playoffs are an afterthought at the moment. Dallas is tied for 12th in the NFC and the Giants are dead last with the final third of the season ahead. Beating the Commanders 34-26 on Sunday helped the Cowboys exhale, if only briefly, and they will now try to win at home for the first time in six tries.  Last in the NFL in scoring (14.8 points per game) and 28th in passing offense at 187.9 yards per game, the Giants are devoid of highlighter-worthy names on the offensive scouting report. They traveled to Texas on Wednesday without last week's starting quarterback, Tommy DeVito, who was officially listed as questionable because of a forearm injury. The last win for the Giants, 29-20 at Seattle, came one week after losing 20-15 to the Cowboys in September. New York is 0-4 against the NFC East including two losses by a combined eight points to the Commanders.  Giants defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence and rookie wide receiver Malik Nabers are among those who have been publicly critical of the team's effort of late. ""When you lose a game like that, there's frustration,"" Daboll said of Sunday's loss to Tampa Bay. ""Certainly, you'd like to keep it in house. But you understand them, and I've been doing this for a while. There's conversations that you have to have if comments like that are made. I respect the opinions of the players and of the coaches. We'll work as hard as we can to get this fixed."" Extra blockers likely are mandatory to keep Cowboys pass rusher Micah Parsons from feasting. Parsons had two sacks at Washington, his second game with multiple sacks in three outings since returning from a high-ankle sprain. He had two sacks of Daniel Jones the last time the Giants visited for Thanksgiving in 2022. Nabers caught 12 passes for 115 yards from Jones in defeat against the Cowboys Week 4. That was before the QB switch. Nabers wasn't targeted in the first half last week.  Beyond their 0-5 home record, the Cowboys are 2-1 in the NFC East but have been outscored by 98 points on the season. The nine-loss Giants own a minus-89 scoring margin. Rush was not special at Washington, but he threw a pair of TDs, completed 75 percent of his passes and didn't throw an interception. He was limited Monday with a knee injury, but . Cowboys running back Rico Dowdle handled a career-high 19 carries, for a career-best 86 yards last week, erasing his previous best -- 12 carries for 79 yards and a touchdown -- against the Giants last season. He caught a 15-yard TD pass in the Cowboys' win over the Giants in September. New York gave up 156 rushing yards to the Buccaneers, the fifth consecutive game of allowing at least 140. INJURY REPORT Banged up in the aftermath, DeVito wasn't asked to complete a full practice the past three days but did throw a few times Monday and Tuesday. He didn't practice Wednesday and didn't accompany the team to Arlington, Texas, leaving Drew Lock to get the call for the Giants if DeVito doesn't get transportation to Texas and medical clearance by Thursday afternoon. Giants offensive tackle Jermaine Eluemunor (quad) was ruled out. Evan Neal (hip) was on the long list of injury concerns for the Giants but had no injury designation Wednesday. Eluemunor left last week's game in the first half and couldn't return. The Cowboys are hopeful for the return of key players, including tight end Jake Ferguson (concussion), guard Tyler Smith (ankle/knee) and No. 1 cornerback Trevon Diggs (groin/knee) after they sat out Week 12. Wide receiver Brandin Cooks (knee) is expected to be back for the first time since Week 4, but left guard Zack Martin (shoulder, ankle) won't play.  Cooks was activated to the 53-man roster on Wednesday, when the Cowboys moved rookie cornerback Caelen Carson (shoulder) and second-year offensive lineman Asim Richards (ankle) to injured reserve. Defensive backs Andrew Booth and Kemon Hall were elevated from the practice squad. KEY STAT Dallas was 8-0 at home in the 2023 regular season, then started a streak of six consecutive losses -- including the wildcard blowout by the Packers -- by an average of 22.3 points.

The newly named Crypto.com Showdown will see Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy of the PGA compete against Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau of LIV in an 18-hole event at Shadow Creek Golf Course in Las Vegas.  Per the sponsor's announcement, the match will feature ""a multimillion-dollar purse to be paid in CRO cryptocurrency."" It's unclear how much the winning and losing teams will receive. The prize money is more than most tournaments on the PGA Tour, other than majors and signature events, which are usually in the $8 million-$9 million range. The winners of PGA events often take more than $1 million. Per the FOS report, Crypto.com CMO Steve Kalifowitz said each of the four players will need to register with Crypto.com to be paid. Kalifowitz added that the players don't have to keep the cryptocurrency and can sell or trade their winnings. The contest, which will air on TNT at 6 p.m. ET, is lined up as a Ryder Cup-style event, with match-play rounds of four-ball, singles and alternate shot. In a similar event in 2018, Phil Mickleson beat Tiger Woods in the first edition of ""The Match"" and took home the entire $9 million prize. In February of this year, McIlroy won $2.4 million after beating Max Homa, Rose Zhang and Lexi Thompson. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

For the Lions, it's an opportunity to improve to 11-1 and stay atop the NFC standings. For the Bears (4-7), it represents a critical game to just stay in the conversation for a wild-card spot. ODDS & TRENDS The Lions are consensus 9.5-point favorites -- and popular ones at that. They have been backed by 71 percent of the spread-line money at BetRivers, while the Lions' -590 moneyline to win the game outright has been backed by 91 percent of the money. Of the three Thanksgiving Day games, Detroit's moneyline has been the most wagered-on play, followed closely by the Lions' spread line. DraftKings reported the Lions' to have drawn the most total moneyline bets and money among Week 13 games, while they have also been backed by the most Super Bowl winner bets since Week 12. The Over/Under for Thursday's game is at 48.0 at BetRivers, where the Over has been supported by 86 percent of the money and 83 percent of all bets. PROP PICKS --Lions RB Jahmyr Gibbs 70+ Rushing Yards (-140 at DraftKings): Gibbs is coming off a 90-yard game against the Colts when he logged a season-high 21 carries. With David Montgomery nursing a sore shoulder, a bigger workload could again fall to Gibbs to attack a Bears run defense allowing an average of 129.7 yards per game on the ground. --Bears RB Roschon Johnson Anytime TD (+225 at BetRivers): What inconsistent work Johnson gets in Chicago's backfield often comes near the goal line. He scored one a one-yard run last week for his sixth rushing touchdown of the season. That includes reaching the end zone in consecutive games. THE NEWS Riding a nine-game winning streak, their longest since a 10-game streak during their first season in Detroit in 1934, the Lions are burdened by losses in their traditional Thanksgiving Day game the past seven seasons. Three of the defeats are courtesy of Chicago. The Bears and Lions get together for the 20th time on Thanksgiving -- the Bears have 11 wins -- this week in the first of two meetings between the teams in a 25-day span. Detroit goes to Soldier Field on Dec. 22. ""I think there's two things,"" Lions coach Dan Campbell said of the Thanksgiving losing streak. ""No. 1 -- Get a W. And it's a division win that's why this huge. No. 2 is because the players are going to get a couple of days off. So, they have family, friends in, it'd be nice to feel good about it when you're with everybody because it's just not real fun. It's not real fun to be around."" Detroit owns the best record in the NFC but the Lions aren't even assured of a division title. Minnesota sits one game behind them and Green Bay is two games back. The Bears sit in last place and would likely need to run the table to have any chance of making the playoffs. The Lions have been dominant in all phases and haven't allowed a touchdown in the past 10 consecutive quarters.  Detroit's offense ranks first in points per game (32.7) and second in total yardage (394.3) The Lions defense has not given up a touchdown in the last 10 quarters.  The Bears are saddled with a five-game losing streak and Chicago's defense has been destroyed for nearly 2,000 total yards in the past four games.  The Bears failed to reach the 20-point mark four times in five outings since they last won a game. In their latest defeat, rookie quarterback Caleb Williams and the offense perked up but they lost to Minnesota in overtime, 30-27. ""We have to play complementary football for us to be able to win these games,"" coach Matt Eberflus said. ""The games we have won, we have done that. The games we have been close we've missed the mark a little bit. Over the course of the year, it's been one side or the other, this side or that side. In this league you have to be good on all sides to win. That's what we are searching for."" Williams threw for 340 yards and two touchdowns without an interception. The wide receiver trio of DJ Moore, Keenan Allen and Romeo Odunze combined for 21 receptions and two touchdowns while tight end Cole Kmet caught seven passes. INJURY REPORT The Lions put two defensive backs on injured reserve in the past week and top cornerback Carlton Davis isn't expected to play due to knee and thumb injuries. Detroit offensive tackle Taylor Decker (knee) and top returner Kalif Raymond (foot) are also expected to miss the game, though Campbell expressed optimism that running back David Montgomery (shoulder), formerly of the Bears, would play. Bears safety Elijah Hicks was listed as a DNP for Tuesday's walkthrough. KEY STAT Lions rookie placekicker Jake Bates has made all 16 of his field-goal attempts, including four from 50-plus yards over the past three games. THEY SAID IT ""What I've been impressed with is just how he has grown. He has grown every game but these last two I really feel like he's taken off and what they're doing with him has been really good for him and he just looks very composed. He doesn't get frazzled, plays pretty fast, and he's an accurate passer, big arm, and he's got some guys that can get open for him."" --Campbell on Williams PREDICTION The Lions have been putting their foot on the gas early of late, and refusing to back down. They've won their past two games by a combined 76-12 and have put up at least 42 points three times this season. The Bears' defense will pose a stiffer test than most, but Chicago's offense isn't ready to keep pace in a track meet. --Lions 30, Bears 20 --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Gapare made 7 of 9 shots from the floor -- including 3 of 4 from 3-point range. He highlighted his performance by unleashing a personal 10-point run in the second half to help send the Terrapins (6-1) to their third straight win. Gapare, who made one 3-pointer prior to Wednesday's game, was limited to just three minutes and was held without a point in Maryland's 76-75 victory versus Villanova on Sunday. Julian Reese scored 14 points for the Terrapins, who shot a robust 50.0 percent from the floor and scored 22 points off 20 turnovers. Selton Miguel drained three 3-pointers to score all 13 of his points in the first half. That effort came three days after being held without a point versus Villanova. Bucknell's Ruot Bijiek sank four 3-pointers to highlight his 20-point performance.  Josh Bascoe scored 10 points and Brandon McCreesh added nine off the bench for the Bison (4-4), who lost two in a row for the second time this season. Maryland answered Bijiek's layup by scoring 12 straight points to take a 15-2 lead.  Miguel keyed the spurt by draining two 3-pointers and a jumper. Bucknell tried to keep pace and trailed 25-12 after McCreesh's layup, but the Terrapins kept their foot on the gas to steadily build a 25-point lead late in the first half. The Bison made a modest charge to begin the second half, trimming the deficit to 16 at 58-42 on Bijiek's fourth 3-pointer of the game. Gapare singlehandedly halted the momentum by sandwiching 3-pointers around a layup and an emphatic dunk over the next five possessions. Reese sank a pair of free throws to cap the 12-0 run, extending Maryland's lead to 70-42 with 11:39 to play.

Then again, maybe not. It depends, Houston coach DeMeco Ryans said, if the Texans (7-5) are ""locked in"" and able to make a December push. ""I just look at it as being intensely focused on your job and being where you're supposed to be, executing the minor details of your job,"" Ryans said. ""It all comes down to minor, minute details that you get exploited if you don't do them the correct way and teams find those and they make you pay.  ""And a lot of the things, as I talked to our guys about, are things that we can control."" Jacksonville (2-9), sitting at the bottom of the AFC South, is coming off a humiliating 52-6 loss to the Detroit Lions. It marked the fourth straight setback for the Jaguars, who had dropped their previous three games by a combined 13 points. Jaguars coach Doug Pederson noted that changes are coming, although he opted not to show his cards.  ""I'm not going to get into the whole details of things, but there are things in the run game that we have to get back to,"" Pederson said. ""Even in the passing game, tweaking some things there. There are things that can, hopefully, help our production over the last six weeks."" One of those things could be the return of starting quarterback Trevor Lawrence, who has not played since Nov. 3 due to a left shoulder injury. Lawrence was a limited participant during practice on Wednesday, with Pederson telling reporters Monday that the signal-caller's status for Sunday would be determined as the week progresses.  Pederson has also had his eye on Houston quarterback C.J. Stroud, who has run into some struggles during his sophomore season.  Stroud has thrown nine interceptions in 12 games (all starts) after throwing only five as a rookie. He was picked off twice in the 32-27 setback against Tennessee, also throwing for 247 yards and two touchdowns on 20-for-33 passing.  Pederson still believes the 23-year-old can hurt the Jaguars, though.  ""Playing the quarterback position is hard,"" Pederson said. ""I don't know everything that goes on down there. I'm sure there's been injury, guys have missed (time). He's missed his playmakers from time to time. And then there's the film. There's the film out there."" The Texans have lost three of their past four games and four of their past six as defenses continue to solve Stroud. Defensive ends Will Anderson Jr. (ankle) and Denico Autry (knee) were among those who didn't practice for Houston on Wednesday, and safety Jalen Pitre is expected to miss several weeks because of a shoulder injury.  Linebacker Yasir Abdullah (hamstring) was the only Jaguar to miss practice on Wednesday. Cornerback Tyson Campbell (shoulder) joined Lawrence as limited.  Sunday marks the second meeting of the season between the teams. The Texans topped Jacksonville 24-20 back on Sept. 29. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

However, the opposite has played out as the No. 16 Sun Devils get set to square off with the host Wildcats for Saturday's Territorial Cup clash in Tucson, Ariz. Arizona was coming off a 10-3 season in which it beat Oklahoma in the Alamo Bowl, and new coach Brent Brennan and his staff managed to keep many of the top players -- including quarterback Noah Fifita and All-American receiver Tetairoa McMillan -- despite the departure of coach Jedd Fisch to Washington. Meanwhile, Arizona State went 3-9 last season in Kenny Dillingham's first year as a head coach. The Sun Devils were picked to finish last in the Big 12 media preseason rankings but have emerged as a playoff contender. Dillingham's team moved up five spots in the latest College Football Playoff rankings after last week's 28-23 win over then-No. 14 BYU at Tempe, Ariz. Arizona State (9-2, 6-2) is in position to play in the conference championship game next week, but the tiebreaking scenarios are complex with the Sun Devils atop the league standings with Colorado, Iowa State and BYU. Arizona (4-7, 2-6) is not bowl eligible amid a social media outcry of removing Brennan as head coach despite this being only his first year. Brennan was asked at his weekly press conference if the Wildcats are motivated to potentially spoil Arizona State's attempt to play in the Big 12 championship game and then possibly the CFP. ""Not really,"" Brennan said. ""I think it's more about the fact that we're playing ASU and what this game means to everybody here."" Dillingham and Brennan experienced the rivalry from a young age.  The former was raised in the Phoenix area and grew up an Arizona State fan before earning a degree at the school in 2012. Brennan was an avid Arizona supporter in the late 1990s when his brother Brad played against the Sun Devils as a receiver. Brent Brennan, who played at UCLA, is married to an Arizona graduate. ""The mindset is this is the biggest game of the year, every year, and that doesn't change,"" Brennan said. ""For us, whether we're bowl eligible or not, all that matters is we're playing the team from up north."" Dillingham must guard against his team feeling the pressure to advance to the Big 12 championship game, while Arizona is playing with nothing to lose. Cam Skattebo, one of the nation's top running backs, said the Sun Devils will be ready because of the ""brotherhood"" they have built under Dillingham. ""The culture has changed man and everybody loves each other,"" Skattebo said. ""We've turned this thing around. But it's not finished yet because there's still a process. There is still work to do in the process."" Skattebo will go against an Arizona defense depleted by injuries. Three of its best players -- linebacker Jacob Manu and safeties Treydan Stukes and Gunner Maldonado -- have been out most of the season with leg injuries. Skattebo has gained 1,221 yards on 226 carries with 14 touchdowns. Fifita and McMillan will test an Arizona State secondary that is 83th nationally, allowing 228.4 passing yards a game. McMillan became Arizona's career receiving yards leader with his 115-yard performance last week at TCU.  He has 3,355 career receiving yards, passing his current position coach, Bobby Wade (3,351 yards, 1999-02).  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""I'm hoping I'm back out there this week,"" Lawrence said Wednesday. ""It would be great. That's what I want. I want to be back on the field playing with my teammates and that's the plan."" Head coach Doug Pederson plainly laid out the other option on the table for Lawrence, who said he's still very much considering surgical repair of his non-throwing shoulder.  Lawrence, 25, said the operation is ""definitely something I'm considering and not off the table at all,"" and Pederson said he's ""not going to commit"" to Lawrence playing this week.  ""It has been pretty a difficult thing to gauge what's the best path forward,"" Lawrence said. ""Hopefully, I'm able to get back out there this week or as soon as possible, then it's going to be just every week kind of evaluating it, seeing where it's at. Up until this point, I've been doing everything I can to avoid that. I want to be back out there with my guys and finish the season. That's my goal. That's what I want to do. Beyond that, I don't know."" Lawrence was hurt in the Jaguars' Week 9 loss at Philadelphia. Jacksonville returned from a bye last week and Lawrence was able to practice on Monday, but said he felt the clear benefit of rest during the downtime.

""Well 1890 is the first time we played this football team coming up and this is what it's all about,"" Minnesota coach P.J. Fleck said of the rivalry. ""And you wouldn't want to have it any other way, being able to end the season with one of your biggest rivals. I know our guys will be ready to go, ready to play."" Wisconsin has 22 consecutive winning seasons since going 5-7 under Barry Alvarez in 2001, the longest active streak among Power 4 teams. The Badgers also have played in a bowl game in each of the last 22 seasons, the longest active streak in the Big Ten and third-longest in FBS. Wisconsin coach Luke Fickell is more concerned with the rivalry game than the winning season and bowl streaks.  ""I'm not downplaying it, I'm not saying it's not important, I'm not saying it's another thing that's on our plate,"" Fickell said Monday. ""But when it gets down to this last week, it's about one thing, it's about the rivalry. It's about preparing to play in the most important game of the year.""

Max Brosmer has completed 67 percent of his passes for 221 per game with 15 touchdowns and five interceptions. Daniel Jackson is the top target with 69 catches for 802 yards and three scores, and Darius Taylor is the top rusher with 730 yards at 4.8 per carry with nine touchdowns. One week after leading Oregon after three quarters, the Wisconsin defense was shredded for 473 yards and five touchdowns by Nebraska.

""Syracuse has a really good quarterback,"" Brown said of Kyle McCord, ""and Miami has a really good quarterback (Cam Ward)."" With a win on Saturday, the No. 6 Hurricanes (10-1, 6-1 ACC) can clinch a berth in the league championship game against SMU. Miami is a 10 1/2-point favorite for Saturday's game. Syracuse (8-3, 4-3) has reached eight wins for just the fourth time since 2002, going 8-5 in 2010 and 2012 and 10-3 in 2018. However, the Orange haven't defeated a Top-10 team since knocking off Clemson in 2017. Miami leads the nation in scoring (44.7), and the Hurricanes will count on perfect passing conditions in Syracuse's dome. That could be huge for Ward, who leads the nation with 34 touchdown passes, ranking second in passing yards (3,774) and fourth in passing efficiency. Ward's top target is wide receiver Xavier Restrepo, who needs just 21 yards to reach 1,000 for the second straight season. Restrepo also ranks tied for seventh in the nation with 10 TD receptions. Ward has some other top targets, including 6-foot-4, 245-pound tight end Elijah Arroyo, who is a walking mismatch because of his size and speed. He leads Miami with 18.5 yards per reception. Hurricanes wide receivers Isaiah Horton and Jacolby George have combined for 12 TD passes, and Sam Brown has added two more. Each of them has more than 500 receiving yards this season. Miami's running game features battering ram Damien Martinez (739 yards, 5.5 average, eight TDs); versatile Mark Fletcher Jr. (499 yards, 5.7 average, six TDs); and game-breaking freshman Jordan Lyle (361 yards, 8.6 average, four TDs). Defensively, Miami's big-play man is safety Mishael Powell, who ranks second in the ACC with five interceptions. ""He's all about winning,"" Miami coach Mario Cristobal said of Powell. ""He's a smart, self-starting team player."" On special teams, Miami kicker Andres Borregales ranks second in the ACC with 97 points. He is 52-for-52 on extra points and 15-for-16 on field goals. Meanwhile, McCord ranks No. 1 in the nation in passing yards (3,946) and tied for seventh in TD passes (26). McCord, a transfer from Ohio State, has also set Syracuse's single-season record for passing yards. In last week's 31-24 win over Connecticut, McCord passed for a career-high 470 yards. However, McCord is just 46th in the nation in passing efficiency, due in part to his high total of interceptions (12). Syracuse also has three of the top six pass-catchers in the ACC in terms of yards: tight end Oronde Gadsden II (810) and wide receivers Jackson Meeks (801) and Trebor Pena (743). Gadsden, who is from the greater Miami area, has had three straight 100-yard games. He is the son of former Miami Dolphins wide receiver Oronde Gadsden. Syracuse's run game is led by LeQuint Allen, who has rushed for 819 yards, a 4.3 average and 12 TDs. The issue for Syracuse could be its defense, which ranks 13th in the ACC in points allowed (27.8). Miami's defense is fourth (22.3). Even so, Syracuse coach Brown said he's excited about this matchup. ""I heard Miami is going to come deep,"" Brown said of Miami fans. ""It's going to be intense in the stands. It's going to be intense on the field. I think this is a game everyone wants to see."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Mustangs (10-1, 7-0 Atlantic Coast Conference), who checked in at No. 9 in the latest College Football Playoff rankings on Tuesday, would like to send their seniors off the right way. They would also like to complete a perfect regular season before appearing in the ACC title game in their first year in the conference. Most importantly, they want to continue to strengthen their playoff case. ""You've got the College Football Playoff, so every game matters. That's what's so cool about it now. The regular season is important,"" SMU coach Rhett Lashlee said. ""We'd like to finish well in everything we do, particularly on Saturday, to finish off the regular season, continue our momentum into the following week. Hopefully, continue to show the committee and others that we're worthy of continuing to play this year."" The Mustangs are a worthy playoff team to date. Kevin Jennings has established himself as one of the top quarterbacks in the country, throwing for 2,521 yards with 17 touchdowns and seven interceptions. He also has rushed for 315 yards and four TDs. Brashard Smith has been another standout, rushing for 1,089 yards and 13 TDs. Defensively, the Mustangs rank tied for 14th in the country with 20 takeaways. ""Obviously they've had a phenomenal season,"" Cal coach Justin Wilcox said of SMU. ""As soon as you turn the tape on, it doesn't take very long to see why their record is what it is. They're very, very good really in every phase of the game - extremely explosive and quick and fast. They've got a dominant D-line. We've got a lot of challenges in front of us and our guys are excited for that."" Cal (6-5, 2-5) is coming off an emotional win, defeating rival Stanford 24-21 on Saturday to secure a bowl berth. The Golden Bears will appear in consecutive bowls for the first time since 2018-19 and are now looking to clinch their first winning season since 2019. SMU is not overlooking Cal, as all five of the Golden Bears' losses have come by one score. ""You'd be hard-pressed to find a better 6-5 team in America,"" Lashlee said. ""I think you can conservatively say they very, very easily could be 9-2."" Cal is led by quarterback Fernando Mendoza, who has thrown for 3,004 yards with 16 touchdowns and six interceptions. Tight end Jack Endries leads the team with 555 yards receiving, while wide receiver Nyziah Hunter has caught a team-leading five touchdowns. Defensively, Cal has the ACC's top scoring defense (20.7 points per game) and is tied with Clemson for the ACC's best turnover margin (plus-13). Defensive back Nohl Williams is the star of the group -- he leads the country with seven interceptions. Even though oddsmakers are heavily favoring SMU, Cal is going into the game with a simple mindset. ""Our task at hand is to make the best bowl game right now,"" Mendoza said. ""And the way to do that is to go into Dallas, give it our best and ruin SMU's season."" Saturday will mark the first conference meeting between these ACC newcomers, and just the second meeting between the programs all time.

The NFC East-leading Eagles (9-2) have won seven in a row and play four of their final six games in Philadelphia, traveling only about 125 miles to visit the Ravens (8-4) this weekend and the Washington Commanders in Week 16.   Sunday's game features the NFL's two leading rushers. Barkley (1,392 yards) and Henry (1,325) are far ahead of Green Bay's Josh Jacobs (944) in third place. Henry leads the league with 13 rushing touchdowns. Barkley (10) is tied for fourth and Philadelphia quarterback Jalen Hurts (11) tied for second.   The matchup also features two of the top candidates for Most Valuable Player honors entering Week 13 in Barkley and Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson, who won his second MVP award last season. Their competition includes quarterbacks Josh Allen of Buffalo and Jared Goff of Detroit, with Allen widely considered the favorite.   ""Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry are phenomenal football players that help their team win football games, and Jalen Hurts and Saquon Barkley are phenomenal football players that help their team win football games,"" Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said.   ""Excited about the opportunity this week because it's our next one. It will be a really good opponent, really well coached, good players, good atmosphere that will be there. Excited about the opportunity this week. And we're going to have to be on it against a really good team.""   The showdown at M&T Bank Stadium also pits Baltimore's No. 1 offense (426.7 yards per game) and No. 2 scoring offense (30.3 points per game) against Philadelphia's No. 1 defense (274.6) and No. 6 scoring defense (18.1).   The Eagles have held seven consecutive opponents to under 300 total yards, while the Ravens have gained at least 329 yards of offense in all 11 games.   Philadelphia is coming off a 37-20 road win over the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday night in which Barkley smashed the franchise record with 255 rushing yards.   Baltimore also earned a prime-time win in Los Angeles, defeating the Chargers 30-23 in the ""Harbaugh Bowl"" on Monday night behind Jackson's three touchdowns (two passing, one rushing).   Jackson said he's looking forward to the Barkley and Henry show.   ""I've known Saquon from high school. We were in the all-star game together and he jumped over somebody's head,"" Jackson recalled Wednesday. ""So I've pretty much seen him before I even got to the league, college, anything. I've been knowing about Saquon, but Derrick Henry -- King Henry -- I'm with him every day and I'm seeing what he's capable of, so it's going to be a great matchup.""   Ravens linebacker Roquan Smith practiced Wednesday after sitting out Monday with a hamstring issue. Nose tackle Michael Pierce (calf) was designated to return from injured reserve. Tight end Charlie Kolar (broken arm) is out for several weeks and cornerback Arthur Maulet (calf) did not practice.   The Eagles lost veteran defensive end Brandon Graham to a season-ending triceps injury Sunday. Wideout DeVonta Smith (hamstring) missed the win over the Rams and did not practice Wednesday. Neither did cornerbacks Darius Slay (concussion) or Kelee Ringo (calf).   Philadelphia is 5-1 away from home this season -- 6-1 if you count their season-opening ""home"" victory against the Packers in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Baltimore is 4-1 at home.

Wednesday's practice was not the start to the NFL workweek head coach Kyle Shanahan had hoped after Purdy was unable to bounce back from a shoulder injury in Week 11. Brandon Allen started at Green Bay and the 49ers (5-6) lost 38-10 with the backup-turned-starter committing three turnovers. Williams was reportedly spotted in the locker room with a knee scooter and is experiencing pain walking. He played through an ankle injury against the Seattle Seahawks Nov. 17.  Defensive end Nick Bosa (hip, oblique) also missed practice Wednesday, leaving the 49ers to spend the holiday plotting to play the Buffalo Bills (9-2) without the three Pro Bowlers again. ""I don't know anyone who gets Thanksgiving off unless maybe you have a Monday night game. You just start a lot earlier and get the players out,"" Shanahan said. ""We cram everything in so the players get out, tries to be home with the family by 5. I usually get home by 7 and they're all mad at me, then get back to red-zone (installation)."" The 49ers are in danger of a three-game losing streak for the first time since Oct. 2021.  Injuries have been a common thread since September when running back Christian McCaffrey was a surprise scratch with an Achilles injury for the opener. Wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk (ACL) is out for the season at a position dinged from top to bottom. Star linebacker Fred Warner also is ailing and said Wednesday that he fractured a bone in his ankle on Sept. 29 against the New England Patriots. The game against the Bills will mark his eighth straight game playing with the injury.  ""It's something I deal with every game,"" Warner said. ""I get on that table before every game and get it shot up every single game just to be able to roll. But it's not an excuse. It's just what it is. That's the NFL. You're not going to be healthy. You've got to go out there, you've got to find ways to execute, to play at a high level and to win every single week."" Shanahan wasn't interested in injury talk. He said the 49ers have not played well in the past two weeks, and puts part of his focus on getting more out of the running game with snow in the forecast on Sunday night.  He's not in agreement with pundits who doubt McCaffrey's ability early into his return from injured reserve, with a per-carry average of 3.5 yards compared to 5.4 in 2023. ""The speculation on Christian is a little unfair to him,"" Shanahan said. ""Christian is playing very well. He's playing his ass off. To think a guy who misses the entire offseason is going to come back and be the exact same the day he comes back would be unfair to any player in the world."" San Francisco opened the 21-day practice window for linebacker Dre Greenlaw, who tore his Achilles in the Super Bowl in February. His return date is unclear. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

It's going to be a tough battle."" Few introductions are needed on Sunday, as first-year Panthers coach Dave Canales came to Carolina after serving as Buccaneers offensive coordinator a season ago. Canales' prized pupil last season, Tampa Bay quarterback Baker Mayfield was with the Panthers for part of the 2022 campaign.  ""There's some familiarity,"" Canales said of his connection to the Buccaneers. ""Knowing coach Bowles, he's got a really sophisticated system and he attacks each team with a specific game plan. There's some principles that carry over. I know that he's going to have some things up his sleeve."" The Buccaneers (5-6) playing a division opponent for the first time since an Oct. 27 loss to the Atlanta Falcons. The goal will be notching back-to-back wins for the first time since the first two weeks of the season.  Four different ball-carriers, including Mayfield, found the end zone on the ground during a 30-7 drubbing of the New York Giants last Sunday. Mayfield also completed 24 of 30 passes for 294 yards. ""For me, the biggest thing was blocking and tackling,"" Bowles said of what his team did well last weekend. ""We cleaned up the fundamental and technique part of it."" Star wideout Mike Evans was back in action for Tampa Bay following a three-game absence due to a hamstring injury. He finished with five receptions for 68 yards against the Giants and now gets a crack at a Carolina team allowing a league-high 30.9 points per game this season.  However, the Panthers have tightened up their play as of late, winning two games in a row before hanging with the two-time defending champion Kansas City Chiefs in a 30-27 setback last Sunday. The outing against Kansas City may have been the most efficient performance of Panthers quarterback Bryce Young's two-year career. Young completed 21 of 35 passes for 263 yards and one score without throwing a pick.  ""It's not all Bryce, it's the whole unit,"" Canales said. ""It's a collective effort, but he certainly needs to be the voice and driver of that."" Wide receiver Jalen Coker (quadriceps), tight end Ja'Tavion Sanders (neck) and safety Lonnie Johnson (personal) were all missing from practice on Wednesday for Carolina. Defensive end LaBryan Ray is dealing with a hand issue and was among those limited.  Safety Jordan Whitehead (pectoral) was one of four Buccaneers to miss practice on Wednesday.

Revenge may be on Oregon's mind when the Ducks host longtime rival Washington on Saturday in Eugene, Ore. Oregon (11-0, 8-0 Big Ten) would perhaps be closing in on its second straight College Football Playoff appearance had the Huskies (6-5, 4-4) not dealt the Ducks their only two losses last season. Washington edged Oregon 36-33 in Seattle last October, then slipped past the Ducks 34-31 in the Pac-12 title game to secure a playoff spot for the second time in school history. Both teams joined the Big Ten in August. Third-year Oregon head coach Dan Lanning is 33-5 leading the Ducks. But he remains winless against the Huskies (0-3). Oregon plots to sprint out of its late-season bye after using time to heal injuries, but Lanning doesn't believe the break should stall the flow of an undefeated season. ""It's always about what we're able to do on the field. Motivation is overrated,"" Lanning said. ""Our guys have to want to go out there and execute at a really high level. Since the beginning of the season we've talked about playing our best football at the end of November. We're there. This is our opportunity to go play our best football against a good team."" The Ducks could have star wide receiver Tez Johnson back from a shoulder injury this week. Johnson has missed the past two games.  That would be good news for quarterback Dillon Gabriel, who would regain the team's leader in receptions (64), receiving yards (649) and receiving touchdowns (eight). Washington, under first-year head coach Jedd Fisch, is 63-48-5 all-time against Oregon but is just 1-12-1 when facing the No. 1-ranked team in the country. The Huskies are led on offense by running back Jonah Coleman, who has racked up 1,008 yards and nine scores on the ground this season. Coleman averages 5.8 yards per carry and has 36 runs of at least 10 yards.  In the passing game, wide receiver Denzel Boston is tied for the Big Ten lead with nine in touchdown catches and ranks sixth in the conference with 764 receiving yards. Whom Boston will be catching passes from is not yet known, however. Washington has not revealed whether Will Rogers or Demond Williams Jr. will start at quarterback. Rogers has started every game for the Huskies but was benched in favor of Williams two weeks ago after throwing a pair of interceptions in a 31-19 win over UCLA. Fisch said he has a ""good idea"" of how he will use his quarterbacks on Saturday, and while he wouldn't go as far as to name a starter, he did say Rogers responded well in practices last week. ""On the same token, Demond's energy and Demond's confidence showed up. His ability to jump right in and feel really good about leading the group whenever it was his turn... he did a really nice job there as well,"" Fisch told Seattle Sports.  ""I think both guys responded well to the week of practice, and now, really, it's important for us that the guy we believe will start the game gets a significant amount of reps in practice week.

Pittsburgh rallied from an 18-6 deficit to take a 19-18 lead with 6:15 to go in the fourth quarter before the Browns scored what ended up being the game-winning points in the final minute. After the Steelers kicked a 15-yard punt following a three-and-out, their defense went on to allow Cleveland to convert on fourth-and-3, leading to Nick Chubb's 2-yard touchdown run with 57 seconds remaining in the contest.  ""We just didn't make enough of those critical plays in those moments,"" Pittsburgh defensive tackle Cameron Heyward said. ""We've stepped up in those critical moments. But on the flip side, those three losses we've had, we haven't had those moments. We're trying to change that where, no matter what team, we gotta have those winning moments."" All three of the Steelers' losses this season have come against teams that currently have a losing record. Pittsburgh also fell to the Dallas Cowboys and Indianapolis Colts. Still, the Steelers currently lead the AFC North, but the Baltimore Ravens (8-4) are right on their tail. It's a tight race in the division that Cincinnati (4-7) has slipped out of.  Even though the Bengals have been in a rut -- with three losses in their past four games -- Cincinnati coach Zac Taylor doesn't want his team to just throw in the towel.  ""This is December football,"" Taylor said. ""This is where it means something. Regardless (of) what our record is right now, you need to play your best football in December, and now, more than ever, we're going to need that from our guys, and they understand that. They subscribe to it, and we just keep ... moving forward from here."" The Bengals were on their bye last week, but before that, they were on the wrong end of a 34-27 decision against the Los Angeles Chargers on Nov. 17. Like Pittsburgh, Cincinnati came back from a sizable deficit only to lose. Joe Burrow threw three second-half touchdown passes against Los Angeles as the Bengals climbed out of a 27-6 hole, but Chargers running back J.K. Dobbins found the end zone from 29 yards out with 18 seconds left in regulation to break a 27-27 tie. Burrow went 28-for-50 passing for 356 yards and the three TDs.

Beating the Commanders 34-26 on Sunday helped the Cowboys exhale, if only briefly, and they will now try to win at home for the first time in six tries. The Cowboys are shooting for a season sweep of the Giants for the fourth consecutive season. ""It was great to get some wind under our wings, but this Thursday's game comes on you so fast. That's really where my mind is and my heart is, too,"" McCarthy said. Last in the NFL in scoring (14.8 points per game) and 28th in passing offense at 187.9 yards per game, the Giants are devoid of highlighter-worthy names on the offensive scouting report. They traveled to Texas on Wednesday without last week's starting quarterback, Tommy DeVito, who was officially listed as questionable because of a forearm injury. The last win for the Giants, 29-20 at Seattle, came one week after losing 20-15 to the Cowboys in September. New York is 0-4 against the NFC East including two losses by a combined eight points to the Commanders.  Rookie Giants wide receiver Malik Nabers flashes big-play ability. He's also not shy about sharing his opinion. Nabers received a good talking to from head coach Brian Daboll after he blasted the Giants' effort and felt New York was ""soft"" in a 30-7 whipping at the hands of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday. Defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence shared the sentiment only days after openly pondering why and how the Giants decided to hand the starting quarterback job to the undrafted DeVito at the expense of 2019 first-rounder Daniel Jones.  ""When you lose a game like that, there's frustration,"" Daboll said. ""Certainly, you'd like to keep it in house. But you understand them, and I've been doing this for a while. There's conversations that you have to have if comments like that are made. I respect the opinions of the players and of the coaches. We'll work as hard as we can to get this fixed."" In Sunday's loss, Bucs defensive tackle Calijah Kancey virtually folded DeVito in half on a first-quarter sack and staggered him again with a jarring hit in the fourth quarter as he released a pass.  Banged up in the aftermath, DeVito wasn't asked to complete a full practice the past three but did throw a few times Monday and Tuesday. He didn't practice Wednesday and didn't accompany the team to Arlington, Texas, leaving Drew Lock to get the call for the Giants if DeVito doesn't get transportation to Texas and medical clearance by Thursday afternoon. In front of DeVito, offensive tackle Jermaine Eluemunor (quad) was ruled out. Evan Neal (hip) was on the long list of injury concerns for the Giants but had no injury designation Wednesday. Eluemunor left last week's game in the first half and couldn't return. Extra blockers likely are mandatory to keep Cowboys pass rusher Micah Parsons from feasting. Parsons had two sacks at Washington, his second game with multiple sacks in three outings since returning from a high-ankle sprain. He had two sacks of Jones the last time the Giants visited for Thanksgiving in 2022. Nabers caught 12 passes for 115 yards from Jones in defeat against the Cowboys Week 4. That was before the QB switch. Nabers wasn't targeted in the first half last week.  Giants running back Tyrone Tracy enters the week in the proverbial doghouse because of another costly fumble, after his fumble in Week 10 at London gifted the Carolina Panthers a game-winning field goal in overtime. ""Blood is in the water now,"" Tracy said. ""You've got to understand this is the NFL and ball security is job security."" Beyond their 0-5 home record, the Cowboys are 2-1 in the NFC East but have been outscored by 98 points on the season. The nine-loss Giants own a minus-89 scoring margin. Dallas was 8-0 at home in the 2023 regular season, then started a streak of six consecutive losses -- including the wildcard blowout by the Packers -- by an average of 22.3 points. Rush was not special at Washington, but he threw a pair of TDs, completed 75 percent of his passes and didn't throw an interception. He was limited Monday with a knee injury, but McCarthy appeared confident the QB would be available over current backup Trey Lance. Cowboys running back Rico Dowdle handled a career-high 19 carries, for a career-best 86 yards last week, erasing his previous best -- 12 carries for 79 yards and a touchdown -- against the Giants last season. He caught a 15-yard TD pass in the Cowboys' win over the Giants in September. New York gave up 156 rushing yards to the Buccaneers, the fifth consecutive game of allowing at least 140. A win would bring the Cowboys' record to 5-7, good enough to find the fringe of playoff chatter.  The Cowboys are hopeful for the return of key players, including tight end Jake Ferguson (concussion), guard Tyler Smith (ankle/knee) and No. 1 cornerback Trevon Diggs (groin/knee) after they sat out Week 12. Wide receiver Brandin Cooks (knee) is expected to be back for the first time since Week 4, but left guard Zack Martin (shoulder, ankle) won't play.  Cooks was activated to the 53-man roster on Wednesday, when the Cowboys moved rookie cornerback Caelen Carson (shoulder) and second-year offensive lineman Asim Richards (ankle) to injured reserve. Defensive backs Andrew Booth and Kemon Hall were elevated from the practice squad. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Curtis Jones scored 19 points and Keshon Gilbert had 15 with six assists as the Cyclones (5-1) rebounded to win consecutive games after a heartbreaking defeat to No. 4 Auburn in the first round. Tamin Lipsey, Joshua Jefferson and Dishon Jackson each scored 10 points.   The matchup between Big 12 Conference programs served as a preview of league play. Colorado will make its Big 12 debut Dec. 30 when it plays host to Iowa State at Boulder, Colo., with the teams slated to play a third scheduled game in February.   Julian Hammond III scored 20 points and Andrej Jakimovski added 18 for the Buffaloes (5-2), who were coming off a victory over No. 2 UConn in the second round of the tournament Tuesday.   Iowa State shot 60.3 percent from the floor and forced Colorado into 18 turnovers that the Cyclones turned into 37 points.   The game was tied at 22-22 with 8:19 remaining in the first half when Iowa State began to pull away. The Cyclones finished off a 10-0 run to take a 30-22 lead and an extended 15-2 run to hold a 35-24 lead with 3:43 left in the half.

Still, it's coach Bret Bielema's experience to never say never. As they prepare for Saturday's game against struggling Northwestern at Chicago's Wrigley Field, the Fighting Illini (8-3, 5-3 Big Ten) carry optimism alongside their solid resume. Two of Illinois' losses came in road games to CFP No. 1 Oregon and No. 4 Penn State. The outlier? An eight-point home loss to bowl-eligible Minnesota to open November. ""What we've got to do is take care of Saturday, but the dialogue is out there and for that I respect,"" Bielema said. ""We, unfortunately, have three losses on the year, but it's happened before. I did tell our guys when it happened, it was something still in the bag of tricks."" Speaking of tricks, the Illini relied upon some savvy to shock host Rutgers 38-31 last week. Trailing 31-30 with 14 seconds left and zero timeouts and the ball on the Scarlet Knights' 40, Illinois appeared primed to try to improve upon a potential go-ahead field goal. Moments earlier, a missed attempt was waved off by a Rutgers timeout. Instead, receiver Pat Bryant rerouted after catching a pass from quarterback Luke Altmyer, spotted an opening and followed it to the end zone with just 4 seconds to go. Altmyer was 12-for-26 through the air for 249 yards and two scores. Outside linebacker Seth Coleman's status for the game is uncertain after the sixth-year senior was injured in the fourth quarter at Rutgers. Northwestern continues to fade, losing four of its past five games to likely tumble out of bowl eligibility. The Wildcats (4-7, 2-6) are coming off their most lopsided defeat of the season, 50-6 at Michigan last week. Northwestern trailed just 10-6 after Luke Akers connected on field goals of 28 and 26 yards in the second quarter, but the Wolverines scored 40 unanswered points to close out the game. ""I'm excited for our team to bounce back after a tough Saturday,"" Wildcats coach David Braun said. ""The product that we put on that field is not us. We have to be better. ... In our last guaranteed opportunity together, we have to send this team, this group, out the right way."" Increased development from quarterback Jack Lausch figures to go a long way to that end. A sophomore who took over for transfer Mike Wright in mid-September, Lausch is a mere 31-for-56 for 307 yards and two interceptions in the past two games -- against No. 2 Ohio State and at Michigan. Northwestern allowed nine sacks of Lausch in those contests after yielding 12 in his first seven games. ""I'll continue to be excited to be next to Jack as he continues to compete and put this team in situations to win games,"" Braun said. ""It can be really easy to point out issues at quarterback when the offense is not operating at the level you want it to. ... But offensive success, it's the beauty of football; it takes all 11 (players) to function at a high level to get results."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Notre Dame (10-1) climbed one spot in the CFP rankings after clobbering then-No. 19 Army 49-14 last week in New York. The Fighting Irish recovered from a confounding loss to Northern Illinois on Sept. 7 and have since ripped off nine straight wins. Only No. 1 Oregon has a longer winning streak among FBS programs, with 11 consecutive victories. Notre Dame's lack of a conference championship game leaves Saturday as the Fighting Irish's final opportunity to make a statement to the selection committee. With only eight teams remaining that have one loss or fewer, a win over the Trojans would all but cement Notre Dame into the 12-team field. ""This will truly be our biggest challenge to date for multiple reasons,"" Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman said. ""The things outside of this game that have nothing to do with this game, that's going to be a reason why it's a challenge. But because of how good this (USC) team is in relation to its record ... they're 3-1 in their last four games (and) they have one loss at home."" USC (6-5) reaches the finale of a trying first season as a member of the Big Ten, but the Trojans appear to be peaking at the right time. They fell to 4-5 after a 26-21 loss at Washington on Nov. 2 but recovered to win their final two conference games of the season and reach bowl eligibility. The loss at Washington dropped USC to 1-5 in one-score games. The Trojans lost five games by a total of 19 points.  Their last two wins against Nebraska and UCLA reversed the trend of losing tightly contested matchups. The victories also coincided with a move at quarterback from Miller Moss to Jayden Maiava. Maiava accounted for all four of USC's touchdowns against Nebraska, passing for three and rushing for one. The Trojans scored just one touchdown against rival UCLA, but it came by way of Maiava's 4-yard strike to Ja'Kobi Lane late in the fourth quarter. Notre Dame, meanwhile, has beaten every opponent it has played since Oct. 12 by at least 18 points. A 31-24 win over Louisville on Sept. 28 marked the Fighting Irish's last one-possession contest. A defense that ranks second nationally in points allowed at 11.6 per game and first in total turnovers forced with 26 has powered Notre Dame's lopsided winning streak. Safeties Xavier Watts and Adon Shuler have combined for seven interceptions to lead the Fighting Irish. Solving the Notre Dame defense is key to USC continuing the recent trend of the home team winning in this rivalry every year since 2019. What's more, the Trojans can spoil the Fighting Irish's postseason aspirations -- though coach Lincoln Riley downplayed the significance. ""It's always an important game,"" he said. ""There's a lot of history behind it. It's two great programs. ... When you come here, the history behind this game is so epic. It just is. No. 1, I think it would be disrespectful to not be as ready as you can be (to play Notre Dame)."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Crimson Tide might need a long shot of another variety this year. No. 13 Alabama stands on the outside of the 12-team College Football Playoff picture as it concludes its regular season against visiting Auburn of the Southeastern Conference on Saturday in the Iron Bowl at Tuscaloosa, Ala. The Crimson Tide (8-3, 4-3 SEC) can only get into the playoff as an at-large team after being walloped 24-3 by host Oklahoma last weekend. Speaking Monday, one day before the latest rankings were unveiled, Crimson Tide coach Kalen DeBoer said the focus would be on a huge rivalry with Auburn (5-6, 2-5). ""The state -- 365 days of the year. Ever since I've been here, I think I hear about it every day,"" DeBoer said of the need to beat the Tigers. ""So understand what it means. The excitement. We have to learn from last week and be better because of it and turn the page and get ready to practice and do everything we can to be successful on Saturday, find a way to win."" Last season, the Crimson Tide defeated Auburn 27-24 behind the ""Milroe Miracle."" The Tigers were one defensive stop away from a big upset before Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe delivered a dart of a throw to Isaiah Bond for a 31-yard touchdown with 32 seconds left. Auburn coach Hugh Freeze hasn't forgotten the bitter feeling of losing in such a manner. ""There is no bigger game on the schedule,"" Freeze said of playing the Crimson Tide. ""To sit in this seat and to lose one like we did last year still doesn't sit right. I know that the Auburn faithful had to endure that, and we want to change that feeling in this building and for our great fan base in this state. It's a tall task."" The Tigers are on a high note after a 43-41 four-overtime victory over then-No. 15 Texas A&M last weekend. Star running back Jarquez Hunter rushed for 130 yards and three touchdowns on 28 carries and has 1,145 yards for the season. Auburn has dropped four straight games against Alabama and 10 of the last 13. Freeze badly wants to see that domination end. ""You have zero chance of winning if you don't have a belief that you can do it,"" Freeze said. ""I think somewhere along the line in these difficult losses we started believing more, and hope has become a real thing that you can go on the field and be a good football team. You've played close games with them, but you can win them. ""It's going to take an amount of that belief going into Tuscaloosa to win. It's not an easy place to play. No road game is. Just look at the SEC every week. It's hard enough to win at home but you go on the road, it's really difficult."" Alabama saw that last week when they were anemic against an Oklahoma team struggling in its first season in the SEC. But the host Sooners easily handled the Crimson Tide on a day in which Milroe was just 11-of-26 passing for 164 yards and three interceptions and had 7 net rushing yards on 15 carries. ""It's simple things we need to execute as an offense,"" Milroe said of the Crimson Tide's issues. ""You can't just point out one person. It's all about collectively as a group being the best us and executing the simple things. That's what allows us to be the best offense we can be."" The Crimson Tide lost standout linebacker Deontae Lawson (76 tackles) to a season-ending leg injury against the Sooners. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Conference compatriots once more, the No. 3 Longhorns (10-1, 6-1 SEC) and the host No. 20 Aggies (8-3, 5-2) meet again Saturday night in College Station, with the winner advancing to play No. 7 Georgia in the SEC Championship Game next week in Atlanta.   The series went on hiatus when Texas A&M left the Big 12 for the SEC ahead of the 2012 season. Now it's back on in Texas' first season since duplicating that exodus.   ""When they made the decision to join the league,"" Aggies coach Mike Elko said of the Longhorns, ""you kind of always knew this day was coming.""   Texas defeated visiting Kentucky 31-14 last Saturday and Texas A&M lost at Auburn, 43-41, in four overtimes.   The Longhorns have won four straight since a 30-15 home loss to Georgia on Oct. 19. The Aggies have lost their last two SEC games, both on the road, starting with a 44-20 defeat against South Carolina on Nov. 2.   ""We have that opportunity to kind of right the last two wrongs in SEC play and go out with a bang and put ourselves in the SEC championship Game,"" Elko said.   A loss would certainly end Texas A&M's CFP chances, but Texas might be able to lose and still make the CFP for a second consecutive season, depending on what happens in other games.   ""Rivalries are great because of the buildup and excitement and all that, but at the end of the day, winning football games comes down to execution,"" Texas coach Steve Sarkisian said. ""This game comes down to playing with the right physicality, playing well in the critical moments, the special situations -- as they present themselves -- and you perform well in those situations through really good preparation.""   Longhorns quarterback Quinn Ewers was hobbled by an ankle injury suffered during the third quarter against Kentucky but is expected to start against the Aggies.   With Ewers limited, Texas leaned on the rushing attack and finished with a season-high 250 rushing yards. Quintrevion Wisner rushed for a career-high 158 yards and Jaydon Blue had 96.   Texas A&M has given up its two highest point totals of the season in its two SEC losses, which would have been true even without the overtimes last week. The score was tied at 31 at the end of regulation.   Elko said the Longhorns ""without question"" have the best offense the Aggies will have faced this season.   Aggies quarterback Marcel Reed, who has rushed for 441 yards and six touchdowns, has brought a dual threat to his team's offense since coming off the bench to lead a 31-6 second-half effort in a 38-23 win against LSU on Oct. 26.   Texas linebacker David Gbenda said the Longhorns ""embrace the environment"" when playing in hostile venues such as the one they'll face Saturday.

But a history lesson will help the Vols understand the minefield that is SEC road games this season.  Alabama and Ole Miss were double-digit road favorites at Oklahoma and Florida, respectively, and boarded their planes home with losses and a heaping helping of humble pie.  The Commodores have already won three times as double-digit underdogs -- Virginia Tech, Alabama, at Kentucky -- and also pulled an upset as a 7 1/2-point underdog at Auburn.  The Commodores can clinch their first winning season since 2013 with a victory on Saturday, one that would have a defining depth to Vandy in a momentous season under coach Clark Lea, a fullback for the Commodores in 2002-04. The Vols won all three games against Vandy when Lea suited up. ""The unique thing about this game is that it's extremely personal to me, because I grew up in this city, I grew up following the program, I played in this program -- as did (defensive line coach) Jovan Haye, as did some of our other staff members,"" Lea said. Tempo is a tug of war each side wants to gain control of in the first quarter.  The Vols average 74.1 plays per game, while Vanderbilt averages 61.0. The Vols' defense is on the field for 65.7 plays while Vanderbilt's averages 61.3 snaps.  That's a difference of 17.5 snaps between the teams. Lea has been clear in talks with his team and beyond that he believes controlling tempo will be critical Saturday.  ""For us offensively with where our program is right now, possession is the No. 1 priority,"" Lea said. ""We want to maintain possession of the ball, we want to extend drives, and that means multiple first downs and being able to flip the field and play a field-position game. So what we can't have is three-and-outs and pre-snap penalties that set us back, which happened twice against LSU."" Vanderbilt has turned it over just six times, which ranks second in the country. It has also excelled on special teams, where it ranks first in the country according to Bill Connelly's SP+ rankings.  The Commodores' plan also includes getting everything they can from dual-threat quarterback Diego Pavia, who's been playing at less that 100% for weeks.  Pavia has 2,029 yards passing, 16 touchdowns and three interceptions and rushed 165 times for 671 yards and six scores this season.  Points and yards will be tough to come by against the Vols, who rank fourth in the country in scoring defense (13.09) and sixth in total defense (284.3).  ""We have to be at our best on Saturday,"" Tennessee coach Josh Heupel said on Monday. ""You can look at how (Vanderbilt has) performed throughout the course of the season, how they've played at home, statistically what they're doing in all three phases. You've got to understand you're going to get their best and their best is really good."" The Vols' talented defensive line, led by Walter Camp player of the year semifinalist James Pearce Jr., will make containing Pavia a priority. Vanderbilt's last two opponents, LSU and South Carolina, got constant pressure on Pavia even if the sack totals didn't show it.  Tennessee's offensive game plan will be no secret: play fast and run Dylan Sampson (231 carries, 1,307 yards, 22 touchdowns) often. Sampson has rushed for over 100 yards in seven of the Vols' eight games vs. Power 4 opponents, and registered 92 yards rushing against Oklahoma. Heupel is 3-0 vs. Lea in the series, winning those games 45-21 (2021) 56-0 (2022) and 48-24 (2023).  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

For the first time since 2017, the 121st Palmetto Bowl will feature ranked teams. Clemson leads the all-time series 73-43-4 and won last year's meeting at South Carolina, a year after the Gamecocks ended the Tigers' 40-game home winning streak. The stakes are high for both, but especially for South Carolina, which is ranked 15th in the latest CFP rankings, released Tuesday night. South Carolina (8-3) is locked out from playing in the Southeastern Conference championship game with three conference losses. But a victory over their state rivals could boost the Gamecocks' chances of landing an at-large spot in the playoffs. The Tigers (9-2), ranked 12th in the latest CFP poll, can still clinch a berth in the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game and keep their hopes of securing an automatic berth in the CFP alive. But Clemson can't control its fate since that would only happen if Miami loses to Syracuse on Saturday. As the Gamecocks wrap up what's been an impressive regular season, with wins over Texas A&M, Oklahoma and Missouri, coach Shane Beamer spoke about the Clemson rivalry and how he expects it to have major implications for years to come. ""This is fun and exciting to be a part of. And to me, this is going to be a yearly occurrence. Like, we're not going anywhere, our program,"" Beamer said during his Tuesday press conference. ""We're only continuing to ascend. And (Clemson coach) Dabo (Swinney) and Clemson have shown they're not going anywhere."" Swinney talked about the importance of this year's matchup and how it had more at stake than the Iron Bowl between Alabama and Auburn traditionally has, appearing to take a jab at ESPN's ""College Gameday"" for not traveling to this year's game in the Palmetto State. ""The Alabama-Auburn game, my background, always had a little bit more of national implications than this game has had, from a national standpoint,"" Swinney said. ""But that's different this year. This is the game that's got a lot of national implications. You know, that one down there's just going to be bragging rights."" South Carolina enters the game on a five-game winning streak with a solid rushing attack and one of the top scoring defenses in the nation. The Gamecocks are ranked 14th in the nation in scoring defense (18.2 points allowed per game) and 12th against the run (103.4 yards allowed).  That unit will face a tough Clemson rushing attack, led by Phil Mafah (1,012 yards) and complemented by versatile quarterback Cade Klubnik. The Tigers have won three in a row since losing at home to Louisville, and their offense is ranked 11th in the nation in scoring (37.6 points), 26th in passing and 23rd in rushing. Clemson's defense has been vulnerable at times, both through the air and on the ground. Led by Raheim Sanders (821 yards, 11 TDs), South Carolina will try to exploit both areas. The Gamecocks are ranked fourth in the SEC in rushing offense. LaNorris Sellers leads the Gamecocks' passing attack (2,110 yards), which collectively ranks 14th in the nation in passer rating. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Head coach Kevin O'Connell confirmed the Vikings landed Jones after discussing the role of each of his quarterbacks already in the building with those players. Jones will need time to get up to speed in the system and can be placed on the practice squad with a chance to move up the depth chart as he absorbs the Vikings' offense. ""I've always been a fan,"" O'Connell said of Jones, a first-round pick in 2019 who worked out before that draft for the Los Aneles Rams and their offensive coordinator at the time, a then-33-year-old O'Connell.  ""Love, really liked the person, the human being, the makeup, and then the player, Daniel Jones. I think there's so much out in front of him that are going to be really good things that we get to personally be a part of, and I can't wait to work with him."" O'Connell said he took the approach of full transparency to communicate to the Vikings' current quarterbacks they still have his confidence. ""I think that's important,"" O'Connell said. ""I wouldn't be who I kind of claim to be and be authentically me if I didn't have a clear, open and honest communication with those guys, which in a lot of ways I hope they weren't surprised to hear my confidence level in them. My confidence level in our current quarterback room (is high), and I only think we're adding to it when Daniel arrives on Friday."" ESPN and NFL Network reported the value of the deal. Should another team want to sign Jones off of Minnesota's practice squad in the next three weeks, the Vikings reportedly would clear his path if it meant replacing an injured starter for that team, according to multiple reports. Jones would become an unrestricted free agent in March 2025. The Giants granted Jones' request for a release last week and he cleared waivers on Monday, leaving him free to sign with any team. With the Vikings (9-2), Jones would join a contending team and compete with journeymen Nick Mullens and Brett Rypien to back up starter Sam Darnold. First-round pick J.J. McCarthy is out for the season with a knee injury. NFL rules limit weekly pay of practice squad players with more than two years of experience to $21,300. New York was 2-8 with Jones as the starter this season (24-44-1 since 2019). He completed 63.3 percent of his pass attempts for 2,070 yards with eight touchdowns and seven interceptions in 10 starts. He also rushed for 265 yards and two scores. Jones, 27, was the No. 6 overall pick by the Giants in the 2019 draft. He suffered a season-ending ACL tear last season but returned in time to start this season as the No. 1 quarterback. He was benched last week with a record of 3-13 over his past 16 starts and was replaced by Tommy DeVito. Jones has 14,582 passing yards, 70 touchdown passes and 47 interceptions in 70 career games (69 starts). He has 2,179 rushing yards with 15 TDs. The Giants are on the hook for about $11.8 million owed to Jones for the rest of the season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

ESPN reported Wednesday that DeVito, elevated to No. 1 last week after the Giants demoted -- then released -- starter Daniel Jones, didn't even make the trip to Texas because of injury. After his first start of the season, a 30-7 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers last Sunday, DeVito said he wasn't feeling great after enduring four sacks. Coach Brian Daboll said earlier this week that the injury was to DeVito's forearm. ""My whole body is kind of sore. First time playing in a while, took a couple of shots,"" DeVito said Tuesday. ""I'm planning to play. See how I feel (Wednesday). Hopefully I feel a little bit better after some more treatment."" DeVito didn't practice Wednesday for the Giants (2-9). DeVito jumped Lock from No. 3 on the depth chart and started Sunday. He completed 21 of 31 passes for 189 yards.   Lock, who spent last season with the Seattle Seahawks, signed a one-year, $5 million deal with the Giants in the offseason. The 28-year-old has appeared in three games with New York, completing 4 of 9 pass attempts for nine yards. Lock has played in 31 career games (23 starts) with the Denver Broncos (2019-21), Seahawks (2023) and Giants. With a 9-14 record as a starter, Lock has completed 59.5 percent of his pass attempts for 5,292 yards with 28 touchdowns and 23 interceptions.

Their patience would almost certainly be rewarded if No. 4 Penn State (10-1, 7-1 Big Ten) beats visiting Maryland (4-7, 1-7) on Saturday in University Park, Pa. The Nittany Lions held their place in the latest CFP poll after escaping Minnesota with a 26-25 win last Saturday. They are currently projected to host Indiana in a first-round game as part of the inaugural 12-team playoff field, which will be finalized Dec. 8. A win would essentially clinch a playoff spot and could even propel Penn State to the Big Ten championship game if No. 2 Ohio State loses at home to Michigan on Saturday. That's a lot to look forward to, but all Nittany Lions coach James Franklin sees are potential distractions. Tripping up against the Terrapins on senior day could wash everything away. ""We want an opportunity to compete as many times as we possibly can this year. If that includes a conference championship game, we would be very, very excited about that opportunity,"" Franklin said. ""All we have to do is focus on playing Maryland this week, and if we're not focused on that, then a lot of these other things that everybody else wants to talk about, then those things become questionable. Those things become challenging."" Quarterback Drew Allar has been sharp for Penn State over his last three games, completing 77.3 percent of his passes with five touchdowns and no interceptions. He carved up Maryland's defense last season, tossing four touchdowns in a 51-15 road win. Allar's offensive line will look different on Saturday without star tackle Anthony Donkoh, who suffered a right knee injury against Minnesota. Wisconsin transfer Nolan Rucci will start in Donkoh's place. The Terrapins come in amid a down year that will end without a bowl appearance for the first time since 2020. Maryland has lost four straight, including a 29-13 home setback to Iowa last week. It remains uncertain who will be under center for the Terrapins on Saturday. Billy Edwards Jr., Maryland's regular starter, has regressed over the past few games and left last week's contest after taking a big hit in the third quarter. North Carolina State transfer MJ Morris entered for Edwards and completed 12 of 23 passes for 103 yards with two touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. Terrapins coach Michael Locksley said Edwards practiced on Monday but remains ""a little banged up."" ""He fought through all year with some of these (injuries), and I expect him to fight through, to try to make himself available this weekend,"" Locksley said. Whichever signal-caller takes the field will throw to one of the nation's top pass-catchers this year in Tai Felton, whose 92 receptions and 1,097 receiving yards rank second (tied) and fourth, respectively, in FBS. The senior needs 143 yards to eclipse Maryland's single-season receiving record. Despite the disappointing campaign, Locksley said Felton and the Terrapins' other veterans have needed no extra motivation ahead of what could be the final game of their collegiate careers.

After their third and disappointing defeat, the No. 14 Rebels will play Friday afternoon in their annual Egg Bowl matchup against rival Mississippi State in the intrastate series in Oxford, Miss. It will not be easy putting aside the catastrophic 24-17 loss at Florida last Saturday, a soul-crushing setback that all but ended any College Football Playoff aspirations for the most talented Rebels team assembled in a long time. Coach Lane Kiffin's team slid five spots to 14th in the latest CFP rankings. The offseason outlook was rosy when Ole Miss (8-3, 4-3 SEC) shelled out big NIL money and added the top portal class to fill a roster that won 11 games in 2023.  But the Rebels repeatedly shot themselves in the foot Saturday against the Gators. Ole Miss' high-powered offense turned the ball over three times, went 3 of 14 on third down, failed on two fourth-down attempts, dropped five passes and missed a field goal.  Before the game, ABC's broadcast noted that the Rebels had an 84 percent chance to make the CFP. Following the loss, that number dwindled to four percent. The only way the Oxford school gets in is if there is the repeated chaos of Week 13, one that talk show host Paul Finebaum called ""the most SEC carnage"" he had ever seen. The Egg Bowl has been played on Thanksgiving Day 23 times, including 2017 to last season, but Kiffin feels the afternoon start on Friday is an advantage.  ""It helps them to know that playoffs are still alive and they get kind of the first shot to show everybody on a national stage,"" Kiffin said Monday, ""as opposed to a Saturday game where these people that make the decisions don't necessarily see all the games because so many are going on.""   For the second time this month, Mississippi State coach Jeff Lebby will lead his last-place Bulldogs (2-9, 0-7) against a former boss. The 40-year-old head coach faced Tennessee and coach Josh Heupel, who had Lebby on his staff at UCF in 2018 and 2019, in a 33-14 loss on Nov. 9.  Now he will face Kiffin, whom he was paired with in 2020 and 2021 in their first two seasons at Ole Miss when the school led the SEC in total offense. A frequent social media user who enjoys trolling others, Kiffin took a jab at Lebby and Mississippi State when the first-year coach was hired.  ""We've traded texts throughout the season and had communication,"" Lebby said Monday. ""But no, not this week. He'll continue to find ways to have fun on social. That's who he's always been and who he'll always be."" Ole Miss owns a 65-46-6 series advantage and has claimed five of the past seven matches, including a 35-3 ""Egg Brawl"" victory by the Bulldogs in 2018 that was later vacated.  Another loss to the Rebels would give MSU its first winless SEC season since 2002.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The senior guard, who transferred from Wisconsin, scored 16 points on 7-of-10 shooting and added career highs of 10 assists and seven steals. He was one of four to score in double figures for the Cardinals (4-1). Despite fielding the smaller lineup, Louisville dominated the Hoosiers (4-1) throughout.  The Cardinals held the Hoosiers to just 31 percent shooting, including 2-for-10 on layups, in the first half. On the other end of the court, they shot 41.2 percent from beyond the 3-point arc, which allowed the Cardinals' lead to balloon to 10 points three times in the half. The second half started nearly the same way.  Louisville used an 11-0 run to take a 48-31 lead just three minutes in and did not take its foot off the pedal. The lead grew to 78-40 with 7:08 remaining as the Cardinals shot 66.7 percent in the half, eschewing 3-pointers to take advantage of open spaces in the lane. The Cardinals scored their first victory over a ranked team since beating then-No. 19 Virginia Tech at home on Jan. 6, 2021, a winless streak of 16 games. The last win over a ranked team away from Louisville took place on Jan. 18, 2020, at No. 3 Duke. By getting their fourth win in his fifth game as Louisville's coach, Pat Kelsey matched Kenny Payne's win total in his first campaign, 2022-23, when the Cardinals finished 4-28. Noah Waterman also scored 16 points in the win as he hit 4 of 8 3-pointers. Kasean Pryor added 14 points and seven rebounds, and Reyne Smith finished with 12. Malik Reneau led the Hoosiers with 21 points. However, Indiana's two leading scorers struggled.

In an exclusive interview with Deadspin, head coach Kenni Burns talks about where the progra","Just as Oregon stands as the unanimous choice as the nation’s No. 1 college football team, Kent State kneels as the unanimous choice as the nation’s worst Football Bowl Subdivision team. When the Golden Flashes lost 43-7 Tuesday night at Buffalo, they wrapped up FBS’ only 0-12 season and extended the program’s losing streak to 21 games. In many ways, Kent State achieved a perfectly imperfect season. They held two leads all year: one for 5 minutes and 31 seconds in the first quarter on Nov. 13 at Miami Ohio, then one for 9:16 in the first quarter on Nov. 19 versus archrival Akron at home. They were losing at the end of EVERY quarter EXCEPT Sept. 28 versus Eastern Michigan, when the Flashes forged a 7-7 tie in the first 15 minutes. Kent State finished the year averaging 13.9 points per game, which ranks next to last in FBS (only Houston’s 13.6 is worse). But that’s a triumph compared to the defense, which surrendered 44.1 points per game—four more per game than FBS’ next-worst team (Tulsa at 40.1). Kent State also ranks dead-last among FBS teams in total offense (233.3 ypg) and total defense (516.0 ypg), and the next-worst teams aren’t in the same zip code. The Golden Flashes were deemed so flaccid this season, Jeff Sagarin’s mathematical ratings of all 263 FBS and Football College Subdivision teams determined through last weekend’s games that Kent State ranks 224th. That means 90 of the 129 FCS teams are considered better than Kent State—and those teams are allowed 22 fewer scholarships than FBS squads. Now, you might be asking yourself: How does one program fall so far? Well, to paraphrase Hemingway, it has happened gradually and suddenly. “Kent State’s always been a really hard job,” 41-year-old head coach Kenni Burns said in an exclusive interview with Deadspin. “It’s never been really committed to football. When I took this job, I knew it was going to be a long process. To me, just to be able to do it the right way, you had to build it from scratch.  To Burns’ point, Kent State joined the MAC in 1951. Over the intervening 74 years, the Golden Flashes have played in five bowls. Since John F. Kennedy was elected, they’ve enjoyed 10 winning seasons—TEN!—versus five winless seasons. The current 21-game losing streak isn’t even the first 21-game losing streak in school history. At the same time, previous Kent State coach Sean Lewis led the Golden Flashes to two bowls in his five-year run before leaving in December 2022 to join Deion Sanders as Colorado’s offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach—a run that lasted a grand total of eight games before Sanders demoted one of the game’s brightest offensive minds. Lewis is now the head coach at San Diego State. “Sean Lewis did a great job of creating a scheme that created problems,” Burns said.  In Lewis’ final year at Kent State, the Flashes finished with a 5-7 record and ranked 105th in Sagarin’s ratings. Eight days after Lewis left for Colorado, Burns was introduced as Kent State’s new coach. The young and personable Burns was a hot hire after spending the previous six seasons working as P.J. Fleck’s right-hand man at Minnesota and Western Michigan. Now, you might be asking, how much can change at a place like Kent State in eight days? Well, have you met the transfer portal? Here’s where Hemingway’s ""suddenly"" comes into play: Quarterback Collin Schlee (UCLA), wide receivers Dante Cephas (Penn State) and Devontez Walker (North Carolina/2024 fourth-round pick), offensive linemen Savion Washington (Colorado), Jack Bailey (Northwestern) and Marcellus Marshall (UCF), two-time 1,200-yard rusher Marquez Cooper (Ball State/San Diego State), defensive tackle CJ West (Indiana) and cornerback Montre Miller (Mississippi State) hadn’t necessarily chosen their destinations by the time Burns got hired—but they definitely had decided they wouldn’t be spending another year in Kent, Ohio. Using Kent State’s final 2022 depth chart as a guide, exactly four starters stayed with the program in 2023: middle linebacker Khali Saunders, cornerback Alex Branch, kicker Andrew Glass and punter Josh Smith. “Sean’s last team, they had some really good players,” Burns said before chuckling. ""We did the math, and we had, like, 3 percent of our productivity back. It was crazy. It was nuts. I’d never seen anything like it before.”  This is not to suggest Burns was blindsided by this. He knew what was happening during the hiring process. But the portal departures reinforced his desire to build like an old-school program—through high school recruiting. One reason: The Golden Flashes have almost no NIL money. “It’s not enough to compete at a high level,” Burns said. “You can probably take care of one or two kids in that world. And when I say ‘take care,’ it’s give them enough to think about the idea (of attending Kent State).” To help remedy Kent State’s NIL shortcomings, athletic director Randale L. Richmond hired Malik DeVese—a recent Penn State Law School grad—last month to lead the athletic department’s NIL efforts. With so many other schools focused on the portal, Burns and his staff find it easier to lure high school prospects with the prospect of immediate playing time. Kent State entered Tuesday’s season finale at Buffalo with 15 freshmen on the two-deep and others helping on special teams. “We’ve played almost every freshman we’ve got,” Burns said. “We signed the best recruiting class in program history last year. This year, I believe we’re going to beat it. We think we’re ranked 2 or 3 on Rivals and 247.” As of Wednesday, Kent State’s 21 recruits rank second per Rivals’ total points method and fourth in 247’s average prospect measurement. Either way, that’s way better than being 12th like the MAC’s won-loss standings show. “We’re getting guys who are more talented than we probably should be getting,” Burns said. “We’re getting guys that probably back when I was at Western Michigan, we probably couldn’t touch. I think this is going to help us in the long run.” Burns takes heart in the examples set by MAC peers like Eastern Michigan’s Chris Creighton and Northern Illinois’ Thomas Hammock. Creighton posted a 3-21 record in his first two seasons, then earned six bowl bids in his next eight seasons. Hammock went 0-6 in Year 2, but 9-5 in Year 3. And, of course, Year 6 has featured the Huskies’ huge win at Notre Dame.  That’s the blueprint that Burns sold to Richmond after the 2023 season, which gave Richmond the confidence to extend Burns’ contract by one year (through 2028). “I learned this from P.J.,” Burns said. “You’re building a house. The first and second years, you’re laying the foundation. That’s when you play your youth. You let them get experience. They learn to do things at the level you want them to. Then, Year 3 is what I call the framework. You start to see the house being built. You see, ‘OK, there’s something happening over there.’  “That’s what I want Year 3 to be about. I want people to see what we’re building, and now you shoot up a little bit. Maybe you win some games you’re not supposed to. You’re a little more competitive. Year 4 is when you start competing for conference championships and put it all together—as those guys get into their junior and senior years.” That’s all well and good, but how long might this losing streak stay alive? This leads us to another part of the Kent State reality: Guarantee games. The Golden Flashes made $4.05 million this season to lose in September at Pitt (55-24), Tennessee (71-0) and Penn State (56-0). Next fall, Kent State has been hired to play at Texas Tech (Sept. 6), Florida State (Sept. 20) and Oklahoma (Oct. 4), so it’s going to matter which FCS team the Golden Flashes bring to Dix Stadium on Sept. 13.  If Kent State needs any help finding that team—and wants to garner some national attention along the way—may we suggest a phone call to Northwestern State? The FCS Demons just finished their own 0-12 season and carry a 20-game losing streak into next year. Copyright 2024"

The offense struggled in the first half but improved significantly after the break. The Bulldogs shot 32 percent from the floor in the first half and 53 percent in the second. They made just 23 percent of their 3-pointers in the first half, but 46 percent in the second. ""They stuck together,"" Jans said. ""The biggest difference in the second half is they just played together and shared the ball."" MSU had 16 offensive rebounds and a 16-5 advantage in second-chance points. The Runnin' Rebels have won three games in a row as they prepare to play away from home for the first time. They also finished strong in their most recent game, using a 9-2 run to complete a 72-65 victory against New Mexico State. ""Our talking to each other and problem solving was great,"" UNLV coach Kevin Kruger said. ""We had some really good plays late where we executed and got exactly what we were looking for.

Tage Thompson told reporters after practice Tuesday that he would be ""ready to go"" against the second-place team in the Central Division. The 27-year-old center, who scored 47 goals and 94 points two seasons ago, has not played since Nov. 11 due to a lower-body injury. Despite missing five games, his 11 goals still lead the team, and he ranks third in points with 18. Sabres coach Lindy Ruff confirmed Thompson's return to the lineup on Wednesday morning. Buffalo swept its California road trip, beating Los Angeles, Anaheim and San Jose in four days. The Sabres were off Sunday and Monday before returning to the ice Tuesday morning. The winning streak has Ruff's team tied for eighth place in the Eastern Conference. However, with three-quarters of the season remaining, Ruff -- who was in his first stint as the Sabres' coach when the team last made the playoffs in 2011 -- knows his team still needs to do more against tough competition. It did not help matters that Tuesday's practice could have started better, Ruff said. ""You come in off a road trip, and you're hoping that the team can be ready to exceed the intensity that we were able to bring on the trip,"" Ruff said. ""It's the only way to get better."" One area in which Ruff, whom the Sabres rehired in April, wants to see improvement is staying out of the penalty box. Out west, Buffalo gave opponents 12 power-play opportunities while only getting seven. Minnesota comes to Buffalo after falling at home 4-1 against Central Division leaders Winnipeg on Monday. It was the team's second straight defeat following a shootout loss to Calgary on Saturday. Monday's loss was not for a lack of effort. The Wild generated a season-high 44 shots on goal, with half of those coming in the first period. The 22 shots were the second-most of any team in one period this season and were the most in a period for the Wild in nearly seven years. Wild coach John Hynes felt his team played well but just could not get much past Jets goalie Connor Hellebuyck, a two-time Vezina Trophy winner. ""There's some things that we can grow from the game, but we got a lot of hockey this week too,"" Hynes told reporters after Monday's loss. ""So, we got to put this one behind us, grab what we can take out of it, and then we got to make sure that we're refreshed again (Tuesday) and we're ready to go against Buffalo."" Despite the mini losing streak, Minnesota's 30 points in 21 games is tied with the 2013-14 squad for the best start in franchise history. Left winger Kirill Kaprizov leads the Wild in both goals (13) and assists (21). His 34 total points entering Tuesday are tied for third in the NHL with Vegas' Jack Eichel and a point back from co-leaders Martin Necas of Carolina and Nathan MacKinnon of Colorado.

The Buckeyes (10-1, 7-1 Big Ten) are a three-touchdown favorite to clinch a berth in the Big Ten title game at The Horseshoe but its the Wolverines (6-5, 4-4 Big Ten) holding the psychological advantage. Michigan won the past three games in the bare-knuckles rivalry known as ""The Game."" Michigan coach Sherrone Moore, who as the interim head coach last season for the suspended Jim Harbaugh defeated the Buckeyes 30-24 in Ann Arbor, said the losses this season are precursor to playing Ohio State. ""I think we're not going to forget about what's happened. But I think we're going to use it as motivation for this game,"" said Moore. ""This game means a lot. Every year it means that much. Each team could be 0-11 or 11-0 and the records go out the window in this game and you really just care about winning the game."" The pressure is squarely on the Buckeyes. A win helps Ohio State attain the first of their three goals for the season: beating Michigan, winning the Big Ten and claiming the national title for the first time since the inaugural College Football Playoff in 2014. ""To say that this team and those leaders and those seniors want to win this game, it would be one of the biggest understatements of all-time,"" Ohio State coach Ryan Day said. ""They don't need any extra motivation. They have to do a great job of preparing themselves - their mind, their body and soul to go play the game - and then trust their training."" A victory over the Wolverines guarantees a rematch with Oregon next week in Indianapolis in the conference championship game. The Ducks, by virtue of a 32-31 home win over the Buckeyes on Oct. 12, have been ranked No. 1 in all four CFP rankings released with Ohio State maintaining the runner-up spot each week as of the most recent committee reveal on Tuesday. Ohio State has been in the pressure cooker before. By downing then-No. 5 Indiana 38-15 last Saturday, the Buckeyes moved to 2-1 in top-5 matchups this season with a 20-13 win at Penn State on their résumé. ""There's nothing quite like this game or this stage, but it has been good for us to get tested this year and to work through some of those issues,"" Day said. ""All of that adds to the character and resilience of your team that no matter what comes at us on Saturday, we'll know how to react. But this one's different."" Day helped Ohio State beat Michigan in 2019, but the Buckeyes haven't defeated the Wolverines since; the 2020 game was canceled due to COVID-19. The Wolverines are dealing with injuries to tight end Colston Loveland and cornerback Will Johnson.  Loveland sat the second half of the 50-6 win over Northwestern last Saturday while Johnson did not dress. Moore said Loveland is ""trending in a good direction"" to play but he was unsure about Johnson. Day said the Buckeyes will be ready for all situations. ""We're going to really focus on the process,"" he said. ""The same process that we've been working on all year, everything that we do in the off season, every decision that's made in terms of the coaching staff, the roster, how we practice schematics, is all working towards this moment right here."" Moore said this week is like no other. ""You can feel the energy. It's not something you can really describe,"" he said. ""It's just different. It's a different energy. It's a different moment. We all understand what it's about and what it feels like to be in The Game."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Gators (6-0) and Demon Deacons (6-1) will meet for the second consecutive season and the 14th time ever. Florida leads the all-time series 7-6 but lost to Wake Forest last November, 82-71, on the road at Winston-Salem, N.C. The teams would next take on either Minnesota or Wichita State on Friday. Florida enters the contest with its record unscathed thanks largely to one of the most potent scoring rosters in college basketball. The Gators have averaged 88.2 points per game so far and are shooting 48.2 percent from the field. Florida has four players with scoring averages in double figures, led by Alijah Martin (16.7 points per game) and Walter Clayton Jr. (16.5). The Gators have also been one of the better rebounding teams in the nation, averaging 42.8 per game thanks to their size. Martin, Thomas Haugh and Alex Condon are each averaging 6.3 or more rebounds. Martin had 32 points on 11-of-19 shooting, nine rebounds and five assists in Florida's most recent win, a 93-68 triumph over Southern Illinois. ""(We) had a good stretch back half of the first half where, you know, we kind of put it all together from the defensive side, clean rebounds, getting out and running in transition, obviously, shooting the ball well, and we're able to stretch that lead out pretty good in the first half,"" Florida coach Todd Golden said. ""I thought the second half, we played very well offensively. Again, we have not been able to play 40 complete minutes defensively or on the glass."" Wake Forest is in its fifth season under head coach Steve Forbes and is looking for a big early season victory to justify its NCAA Tournament expectations. The Demon Deacons have won back-to-back games since a disappointing loss to Xavier but will also take on their toughest challenge to date as they enter a daunting stretch, which includes a game Dec. 3 against Texas A&M. The Deacons, who were predicted to finish third in the ACC, just missed the NCAA Tournament last season and have not made it since the 2016-17 season. Wake Forest is hoping to secure wins over programs like Florida to bolster its resume. Wake Forest's defense, which has allowed 66.3 points per game, knows it will be put to the test by the Gators. Hunter Sallis, who scored a season-high 31 points in Wake's most recent win over Detroit Mercy, has paced the Deacons with 18.9 points per game as well as 4.3 assists. He eclipsed the 1,000-point mark for his career and was 12 of 18 from the field, including 5 of 9 from 3-point range. ""It was great to see Hunter break out from 3 and just overall, he looked really good,"" Forbes said. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

He helped to launch the breakaway golf circuit, backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), in October 2021.  Under Norman's watch, LIV Golf completed its third season in 2024. Massive prize pools and nine-figure contracts have lured superstars like Jon Rahm, Bryson DeChambeau, Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka and Cameron Smith away from the PGA Tour.  O'Neil most recently served as CEO of Merlin Entertainments Group, which operates amusement parks and resorts. Merlin announced Wednesday that O'Neil is leaving for ""another opportunity.""

It's the accepted name given to the annual Georgia-Georgia Tech rivalry with a recent feel of a Real One-Sided Feud.  Since Georgia Tech's win over the Bulldogs in 2000, Georgia won 16 of 19 over its in-state foes to dominate the Yellow Jackets since the turn of the century.  Much like previous seasons, Friday's meeting in Athens presents the Yellow Jackets a season-shifting opportunity replete with a bonus of sinking the No. 7 Bulldogs' postseason plans. Georgia (9-2, 6-2 Southeastern Conference) jumped three spots in Tuesday's College Football Playoff rankings and already clinched their fourth-straight SEC Championship Game appearance last week when upsets ruled the conference slate. Ranked Alabama, Ole Miss and Texas A&M all lost. Georgia head coach Kirby Smart said the Dec. 7 title game is far in the periphery for the Bulldogs. ""My thoughts are on Georgia Tech,"" Smart said. ""I mean, it's a great honor to be able to play in the SEC Championship game. It is probably one of the greatest events in all sports because the games that you play in are great matchups. But at this point in time, we don't even know who that is, nor do I care. My concern is 100-percent with Georgia Tech because of what that game means to so many in this state, so many on our team, and what it means to this season and these seniors playing at home. So that's the focus."" Georgia will play the winner of No. 3 Texas and No. 20 Texas A&M next week and even without knowing the other variables at play, the Bulldogs understand the treasure at stake for the SEC title winner. Last time out, the Bulldogs ran away from overmatched UMass in a 59-21 victory. Fifth-year quarterback Carson Beck threw for 297 yards and four touchdowns. Beck, who was picked off nine times in his previous four games, has thrown six touchdowns and no interceptions in Georgia's last two wins. A projected first-round draft pick, Beck has passed for 3,132 yards, 23 touchdowns and 12 interceptions.  As injuries pile up in the backfield around Beck, freshman running back Nate Frazier was the star of Saturday's win, rushing for career-highs of 136 yards and three touchdowns. Frazier, who leads the team with 537 rushing yards on the season, has handled the load due to Trevor Etienne's nagging rib injury. Georgia Tech (7-4, 5-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) has an emerging story of its own in recent weeks, with interest rising in the development of true freshman quarterback Aaron Philo. Thrown into action following starter Haynes King's shoulder injury suffered on Oct. 12 against North Carolina, the Yellow Jackets are deploying the tandem in a rotation. In Georgia Tech's last game - a 30-29 home win over North Carolina State - Philo orchestrated a 75-yard drive in the final minute, capped with his 18-yard go-ahead touchdown run. A Bogart, Ga., native, Philo grew up less than 20 miles from Athens. Georgia Tech head coach Brent Key is a former Yellow Jacket offensive lineman. A win Friday would have far more meaning than bragging rights. ""There's a reason why (Georgia) is a top-10 team,"" Key said. ""They've got really good players, they've got really good coaches and they're disciplined. They go out and they execute .they're especially hard to play at their home stadium at night time. So we're ready for a challenge. ... It's a big game. It's the last game of the season. It's a big game for a lot of people associated with both schools. You shouldn't have to light a fire under people when you're going into a week like this."" Georgia Tech has won two games in a row, and is headed to back-to-back bowl games for the first time since 2014. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

But as long as the No. 11 Broncos (10-1) are alert enough to bag a 10th straight victory when they meet the Beavers in a game that kicks off at 10 a.m. local time, Boise State would be on the doorstep of a first-round bye in the 12-team College Football Playoff. The Broncos would also need to win the Mountain West title game on Dec. 6 -- the opponent will probably be No. 22 UNLV -- to make sure it holds off No. 17 Tulane of the American Athletic Conference for the automatic spot that goes to a conference champion outside the power four leagues. A loss to Oregon State (5-6) would mean a devastating hit to a Boise State resume where the lone loss is to No. 1 Oregon on a last-second field goal in Eugene. The Broncos certainly rely on all-everything running back Ashton Jeanty against the Beavers. Jeanty, a top Heisman Trophy candidate, leads the nation with 2,062 rushing yards and 27 rushing touchdowns and is the fourth FBS player since 1956 to have 2,000 yards and 25 touchdowns through 11 games. The others are Oklahoma State's Barry Sanders (2,628 yards, 37 touchdowns in 1988), Texas' Ricky Williams (2,124, 27 in 1998) and Wisconsin's Melvin Gordon (2,109, 25 in 2014). He also ranks second in Boise State history with 4,230 career rushing yards. The leader is Cedric Minter (4,550 from 1977-80). Jeanty has racked up four 200-yard outings -- a school-record 267 against Georgia Southern, 259 against Washington State, 217 versus Hawaii and 209 against Nevada. Beavers coach Trent Bray marvels at the player who is a finalist for the Doak Walker Award (top running back), Maxwell Award (player of the year) and Walter Camp Award (most outstanding player). ""The kid is just, he's unbelievable,"" Bray said during a press conference. ""You watch the Washington State game, Washington State has him hit in the backfield a bunch, and he just breaks a tackle and creates an explosive run. He's just a really good player. Tough, physical. He's tough to stop and he's really what makes them go, there's no doubt about it."" Still, the Broncos could use a statement game after struggling with host San Jose State two weeks ago and rallying to beat host Wyoming 17-13 last weekend. ""Championship teams find ways to win, and they also learn from the wins,"" Boise State head coach Spencer Danielson said during a press conference. ""Our guys battled, and I'm proud of them. ""We know Oregon State is coming off a huge win against Washington State. ... They are playing their best football right now, no questions asked. They've had some guys hurt, some guys banged up, they're back healthy. You saw what they did against a really good opponent."" Oregon State snapped a five-game losing streak last weekend with a 41-38 home victory over Washington State. Everett Hayes kicked a 55-yarder with 20 seconds left to give the Beavers the victory. ""It kind of gets to a point in the game where you kind of look at the score and you realize, 'Wow, it's going to come down to me,'"" Hayes said. Ben Gulbranson returned from a one-game absence due to a concussion to pass for a career-best 294 yards. Trent Walker also stood out with 136 yards on a season-best 12 catches to raise his season totals to 77 and 849, respectively. Oregon State owns a 6-4 series lead over the Broncos. The Beavers won the most recent meeting 34-17 in 2022 at Corvallis. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Instead, he chose coach Danny Sprinkles' Huskies despite not having visited the campus. ""I just think the coaching staff and the style of play fit,"" Bundalo told 247Sports. ""For Coach Sprinkle the four-man plays the most minutes and he has one of the highest usage rates for his fours of any coach in the NCAA right now. I just think it's a great opportunity for me to go in there where Great Osobor is on his way out the door. He's a great player but him leaving and me getting a chance at that spot off the rip is a great opportunity for my development."" Bundalo said he was ""super impressed"" with what Sprinkle accomplished at Utah State in 2023-24, leading the Aggies to their first Mountain West regular-season title and first NCAA Tournament win since 2001. He finished with a 28-7 record in his first season with Utah State before taking the Washington job in March. ""I think Sprinkle sees a lot for me. Just getting the ball off the rim and doing things. We talk about me initiating sets and being a high-level passer off the dribble and off the catch in my zone and my spots,"" Bundalo said. ""I think with me and Coach Sprinkle it's going to be a relationship that's very fluid where I can do whatever it takes to win. Whether we need a scorer, a good screener, a good rebounder I feel like I have an opportunity to do it all.""

A rematch from the 2024 Final Four, the Boilermakers (5-1) and Wolfpack (5-0) meet Thursday afternoon in the Rady Children's Invitational in San Diego. Purdue defeated NC State in the national semifinals last spring before UConn downed the Boilermakers in the national title game. ""We have a tough stretch here, but that's what you want,"" Boilermakers coach Matt Painter said. ""You want that, whether it's game to game or practice to practice, just keep getting better."" Purdue is coming off an 80-45 whipping of Marshall one game after losing at Marquette. ""Our ability to shoot the basketball has to be in play,"" Painter said. ""If it's not, we have to be efficient at the rim, get to the free-throw line."" This will be a different venture for the Wolfpack, who are venturing away from home for the first time this season.  ""We've been ready,"" NC State guard Jayden Taylor said. ""Obviously, you've got to play who is on your schedule, but this is what we want. This is what you ask for, any high-major guy wants to play a ranked team in the tournament and have a chance to win the championship so yeah, we're ready."" NC State is aiming for its first 6-0 start to a season since 2018-19.  ""I love the way we're building with this group and I love their versatility,"" Wolfpack coach Kevin Keatts said. ""We just got to continue to get better.""  There are different combinations of players for NC State than at the end of last season, so it's about putting it all together.   ""I have seen tremendous growth in these guys every game,"" Keatts said. ""On any given night it could be someone else, we talk about who's the energy guy, who's going to bring the energy that everyone builds off."" Marcus Hill scored 17 points in the Wolfpack's 72-49 victory over Colgate on Nov. 18 and 19 in an 84-61 victory against William & Mary on Friday.  NC State has been able to flourish on offense by getting into the lane and racking up points in the paint against undersized opponents. So there could be different factors involved against the Boilermakers. The encouraging part for NC State is that five players connected on at least one 3-point shot in its most-recent game. ""We're still doing a great job,"" Keatts said. ""It's one of those things that everybody's like ‘Oh, man, you ain't really shooting a 3 well,' and I'm saying we're getting 46 points in the paint, maybe we shouldn't shoot the 3."" On defense, Wolfpack senior post player Ben Middlebrooks provided a career-high five blocked shots against William & Mary. Purdue junior guard Braden Smith was scoreless in a game for the first time in almost two calendar years in the Marshall game, but his nine assists allowed him to eclipse the 500-assist mark for his career.  Getting better with rebounding is an emphasis for the Boilermakers. ""We're not doing a good job boxing out, but we have some people who have done a better job of going to get the ball,"" Painter said. The opponent for each team Friday will be either Brigham Young or Mississippi depending on Thursday's results. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Its one loss was a three-point decision against a North Texas team that is off to a 5-1 start. ""We don't want to be in close games early on. But at the end of the day, it's giving us experience,"" forward Dawson Garcia said. ""We are a new team."" Garcia, a fifth-year senior, is scoring 22.8 points per game and adding 7.8 rebounds while hitting 56.0 percent of his shots. Meanwhile, the Shockers (5-0) come into this one fresh off a resounding 88-63 rout of Saint Louis on Friday night in the Hall of Fame Classic in Kansas City. They put four players in double figures, led by Georgia transfer Justin Hill with 17 points, and outscored the Billikens 48-26 in the second half. Second-year coach Paul Mills said this stretch of the season, which will see his team play either Wake Forest or No. 18 Florida on Friday, will make his team better regardless of the results. ""You have to play a challenging schedule and I'm excited to watch guys shoulder bigger loads and be able to take on more and be able to perform,"" he said. Hill is pacing Wichita State by averaging 17.4 points, 4.8 rebounds and 4.8 assists per game. This will be the first meeting of these teams since 1995. The Shockers own a 3-2 lead in the series. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Fresh off a Monday night mauling of Maryland-Eastern Shore, the No. 19 Razorbacks face a bigger test Thursday night when they face the Illinois Fighting Illini in the Thanksgiving Hoops Showcase in Kansas City, Missouri. Against the MEAC's Hawks, the Razorbacks (5-1) ran off on a 28-0 run in the opening half and got strong offensive contributions in a 109-35 win that turned rather historic. They led by 45 points at the break, tying the record for the largest halftime lead in school history. It was also the second-fewest points ever allowed by a team coached by Calipari. The defensive showing represented the third-fewest points against Arkansas in school history, and the margin of victory tied for third-highest ever by the SEC school. All five starters scored in double figures -- seven players did in all -- and the Razorbacks made 40 of 72 shots (55.6 percent). They hit 15 of 34 deep balls (44.1 percent). ""We don't skip steps,"" said Arkansas assistant coach Chin Coleman following the 74-point rout. ""We didn't jump these guys to think about (Illinois). We wanted to win the day. Right now, we're going to flip the switch. Once I leave here, I'm going to start working on Illinois. Coach (Calipari) is going to do that. Our whole staff, we're going to start working on Illinois. They're good."" Illinois (5-1) was the final ranked team in the poll before a lack of defense was exposed against another SEC foe, No. 8 Alabama in the C.M. Newton Classic last week. Undefeated Xavier, Ole Miss and Mississippi State all rushed by in the polls with 5-0 records to bump the Big Ten school. Following its 100-87 defeat against the top 10 Crimson Tide, Illinois raced away to its own massive win over Maryland-Eastern Shore and pounded Little Rock in a 92-34 walloping. Thursday's matchup with the Razorbacks, the first college basketball game broadcast by CBS on Thanksgiving Day, will conclude a stretch of four games in nine days. The conference opener against Northwestern looms on Dec. 6. Freshman forward Will Riley said taking care of the ball and valuing possessions at each end of the floor is a critical focus. Against Little Rock, Illinois dominated in the paint and crafted a 23-0 run over eight minutes in the first half. ""I feel like it was important to build team chemistry throughout the whole game,"" said Riley, who scored 13 points off the bench and canned three treys. ""We executed well on defense and hustled the whole game. It's important to keep your head up in those games."" It was the defensive effort that pleased head coach Brad Underwood most the last time out. The Fighting Illini held the Trojans to just 23.6 percent shooting (13 of 55), plus they won the rebounding edge 56-26. Little Rock's 34 points tied an arena record for the fewest netted by a visiting squad. ""Definitely the focus was defense,"" said Kasparas Jakucionis, who scored a career- and game-high 21 points. ""Execute on defense, share the ball and play the right way. I think we did a great job of doing this."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

It's a long shot, but it's possible as the No. 17 Green Wave (9-2, 7-0 American Athletic Conference) face Memphis (9-2, 5-2) on Thursday night in New Orleans. Tulane would have to beat the Tigers, top Army in the American title game on Dec. 6, and get some help. ""I don't understand all the formulas and scenarios,"" Green Wave first-year head coach Jon Sumrall said, ""but if you tell me this team losing helps Tulane, then I pull for them to lose."" But Sumrall, who was 23-4 in two seasons as head coach at Troy before joining Tulane, knows nothing else matters if his team doesn't take care of its own business. The Green Wave have won eight games in a row after consecutive September losses to Kansas State, which was No. 17 at the time, and then-No. 15 Oklahoma. ""We're in the middle of a pretty good run,"" Sumrall said. ""This game has a lot of meaning. At this point in November, every game is a playoff game. This game is the most important game of the year. But we can't focus on the implications of this game. It's so much more, how do you play a good game?"" Tulane needs a win Thursday in order to host the American championship game for a third consecutive season. The Green Wave split the previous two appearances, winning its first conference title of any kind since 1998 in 2022 before coming up short last season. The Green Wave have allowed a total of just nine points in their last three games, including a 35-0 victory at Navy in their most recent game on Nov. 16. ""The cohesion (on defense) has kicked in as time has gone on,"" Sumrall said. Tulane, which has tied a league record with 17 consecutive regular-season wins against American Athletic Conference opponents, is one of the most balanced teams in the country. The Green Wave have two shutouts, have held four opponents to single-digit scoring, and lead the country with six defensive touchdowns. Tulane averages 227.1 rushing yards behind Makhi Hughes, who is eighth in the country with 1,291 yards, and averages 207.3 passing yards behind efficient redshirt freshman Darian Mensah. Memphis, which is coming off a 53-18 victory over UAB on Nov. 16, has one of the most experienced quarterbacks in the country in Seth Henigan, whose four touchdown passes against UAB gave him 100 in his four seasons at the school. ""It's been fun to stick with a young man who has stuck with our program,"" Tigers coach Ryan Silverfield said. ""He had opportunities to go other places. It's been a win-win for everybody. That loyalty is rare in this day and age of college football."" A victory over Tulane would give Memphis back-to-back 10-win seasons for the first time in school history. ""Winning 10 games in college football is very, very difficult,"" Silverfield said. ""I don't care where you're at. I don't care if you're at Oregon, Ohio State, anywhere. Winning 10 games is very hard, and doing it two years in a row means you're sustaining success."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Giants granted Jones' request for a release last week and he cleared waivers on Monday, leaving him free to sign with any team. With the Vikings (9-2), Jones would join a contending team and compete with journeymen Nick Mullens and Brett Rypien to back up starter Sam Darnold. First-round pick J.J. McCarthy is out for the season with a knee injury. New York was 2-8 with Jones as the starter this season (24-44-1 since 2019). He completed 63.3 percent of his pass attempts for 2,070 yards with eight touchdowns and seven interceptions in 10 starts. He also rushed for 265 yards and two scores. Jones, 27, was the No. 6 pick by the Giants in the 2019 draft. He suffered a season-ending ACL tear last season but returned in time to start this season as the No. 1 quarterback. He was benched last week with a record of 3-13 over his past 16 starts and was replaced by Tommy DeVito. Jones has 14,582 passing yards, 70 touchdown passes and 47 interceptions in 70 career games (69 starts). He has 2,179 rushing yards with 15 TDs. The Vikings are likely to pay Jones $375,000 for the remainder of the season, the prorated portion of the minimum salary of $1.125 million. The Giants are still on the hook for about $11.8 million for the rest of the season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Coming off a 99-97 overtime loss in Monday's opening-round matchup with Memphis, UConn (4-2) got the early jump on Colorado in Tuesday's consolation-bracket contest. The Huskies built an 11-point lead but could not hold on as the Buffaloes rallied to a 73-72 victory. ""We didn't expect to find ourselves in this position based on where we've been,"" head coach Dan Hurley said, alluding to UConn's 0-2 showing despite coming in as the two-time reigning national champion. ""We've been bad out here defensively.""  Before heading to Maui, the Huskies had not given up more than 56 points in any of their first four games.  ""Coach definitely talks about putting more pressure on an offense and not just letting them do what they want,"" UConn guard Solo Ball said.  Ball cited the Huskies allowing opponents to find soft spots in the coverage as hurting the team in this tournament. The Flyers (5-2) weren't shy about scoring in each of their first two Maui Invitational contests, putting up 90 points on Monday versus No. 12 North Carolina and 84 points against No. 5 Iowa State on Tuesday.  Malachi Smith scored 22 points on 7-of-9 shooting from the floor versus Iowa State and added nine assists. That came one night after his 12 points made him one of six Flyers to score in double digits against North Carolina.  Surrendering 92 and 89 points cost Dayton, however, relegating it to Wednesday's seventh-place game. In their five games prior to the tournament, the Flyers did not allow an opponent to score more than 69 points.  Smith cited Iowa State's physicality as causing matchup problems for Dayton on the defensive end and resulting in foul trouble. Zed Key, who fouled out on Monday vs. North Carolina, Enoch Cheeks and Nate Santos all had four personal fouls on Tuesday.  Foul trouble was a recurring theme for UConn in its two Maui losses, as well, with Samson Johnson and Tarris Reed Jr. each fouling out on Tuesday. Johnson was limited to 13 minutes, during which he scored eight points on 4-of-5 shooting from the floor.  UConn is the third straight opponent ranked in the top 12 of the Associated Press Top 25 poll that Dayton will see in as many nights. Having come within a few possessions against both North Carolina and Iowa State, Smith said the Flyers have made a statement despite having yet to secure a win in Maui.  ""We've proved that we're a top 25 team. We can handle anybody. I think we were in control both games,"" Smith said. ""We learned about ourselves, (and) it's looking good. We took some (losses) but we'll turn it into lessons.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The sixth-ranked Cougars and Notre Dame are in familiar moods Wednesday night as the hoops festival continues. Both teams lost in overtime Tuesday night, and Notre Dame lost its top scorer to injury. No. 9 Alabama toppled Houston 85-80 in a close game between two teams with big aspirations for the NCAA Tournament. The Cougars rallied from eight points down in the second half to lead by three with a minute to play, but the Crimson Tide forced overtime and outscored the Cougars 7-2 in the extra session. L.J. Cryer's 30 points led Houston, which tied a career high for the fifth-year guard.  Houston (3-2) entered Tuesday's game having allowed 45 points or fewer in all three of its victories. The Cougars' scoring defense had been allowing 50.8 points per game, but that went up by nearly seven points after the loss to Alabama. Houston is 0-2 on neutral courts this season, having lost to then-No. 11 in its second game of the season. On Tuesday, the Cougars had a chance to win in regulation time, but Cryer, who'd played 37 minutes of game time before overtime, missed a jumper with two seconds left that would have broken a 78-78 tie. ""We've got a lot of guys who can play better than they're playing,"" Houston head coach Kelvin Sampson said. ""Look, we had a chance to win the game. If the ball goes in it's over, we win the game, It's a good shot."" Cryer is averaging a team-leading 15 points per game., and Joseph Tugler is the leading rebounder at 6.2 per contest. Notre Dame, facing Rutgers on Tuesday night in the nightcap of the first day of the Players Era Festival, survived almost five minutes without a point and got a 3-pointer from Matt Allocco with 8.4 seconds left in regulation time to force overtime. Allocco had a chance to hit the winning shot as the buzzer sounded, but the shot went off the side of the rim and the Fighting Irish fell to Rutgers 85-84 late Tuesday night.  Notre Dame lost its leading scorer, Markus Burton, to a knee injury early in the first half, and Allocco tried to fill the void with 24 points, including six 3-pointers. Burton could be unavailable for the game against Houston, and Notre Dame would miss his 18.2 points per game. The reigning ACC Rookie of the Year was considered doubtful. ""I don't have any updates,"" Fighting Irish head coach Micah Shrewsberry told the South Bend Tribune after the game. ""I don't know what's going on. We're just going to put this in God's hands and let him handle it. Whatever happens next, we'll let him handle it.""

The Las Vegas Raiders would be happy with any type of victory since they are winless since Sept. 29. But the Raiders (2-9) are hoping to pull another holiday surprise in an AFC West battle on Black Friday after Las Vegas spoiled Christmas Day 2023 at Arrowhead. Kansas City (10-1) is tied with the Detroit Lions for the top record in the NFL. But the Chiefs haven't been racking up victories in the dominant fashion they did in past seasons. Five of Kansas City's victories this season have been determined on the final play of the game -- two made field goals, one rushing touchdown in overtime, one blocked field goal and one opponent touchdown overturned. Mahomes said the close wins are a product of the club's studying during the week. ""Being prepared for the moment,"" Mahomes said Tuesday of the team's methodology. ""Obviously, you want to do it throughout the entire game but when it's do or die time and you have to make it happen, guys go out there and make it happen."" The latest close call was nearly even more of a stunner as Kansas City needed a 31-yard field goal from Spencer Shrader to post a 30-27 road victory over the Carolina Panthers, one of the NFL's worst teams. The Chiefs led by 11 points in the fourth quarter before blowing the lead and getting rescued by Shrader, a fill-in for injured regular kicker Harrison Butker. Kansas City coach Andy Reid had to give a pep talk in the down winner's locker room following the escape. Mahomes explained why the mood was downcast. ""I think we hold ourselves to an extremely high standard,"" Mahomes said. ""So unless we felt we play our best, guys are itching to get back out there and go for more. I felt there were times we played good football ... and we were able to find a way to win at the end of the game. ""Unless we play the way we expect to play, we're going to strive to be better every time we step on the football field."" The Chiefs registered a 27-20 road win over the Raiders in Week 8 when they didn't need late-game heroics or good fortune to win. Las Vegas has dropped seven consecutive games and is tied with the Jacksonville Jaguars and New York Giants for the worst record in the NFL. Five of their losses have been by double digits, including the past three. The Raiders lost 29-19 to the visiting Denver Broncos last weekend. Las Vegas also lost quarterback Gardner Minshew for the rest of the season with a fractured left collarbone. Aidan O'Connell, who broke his right (throwing) thumb in Week 7 against the Los Angeles Rams, returned to practice this week and is expected to start. He was a full practice participant on Tuesday. Desmond Ridder, who replaced Minshew after the injury against Denver, will be the backup. ""We've got a short week, so obviously, the timeline is kind of sped up,"" Raiders interim offensive coordinator Scott Turner said. ""We're going to evaluate those guys. Ultimately, Coach (Antonio Pierce) will make the decision on who we're going with. You've just got to get somebody ready to play in a short period of time, but there's nothing you can do about it."" Ridder joined the Raiders one day after O'Connell's injury. ""I've been here almost a month and now I feel comfortable with the offense,"" Ridder said. ""I'm ready to go."" Cornerbacks Nate Hobbs (ankle) and Jakorian Bennett (shoulder) and running back Zamir White (quadriceps) missed practice Wednesday for Las Vegas. Shrader (right hamstring) and linebacker Cam Jones (illness) were the only Chiefs to miss practice Tuesday. Kansas City signed kicker Matthew Wright to its practice squad and he will handle the duties if Shrader can't go. The Chiefs have won 17 of the past 20 meetings. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""I thought the biggest thing was our guys playing unselfishly,"" Washington State coach David Riley said in his postgame radio interview. ""And it wasn't like we were playing selfishly in the first half, because I thought we got good shots -- but they were kinda like funky, out-of-rhythm, early good looks that they were kinda baiting us into.

His big game was supplemented by a big showing on the glass by the Crimson Tide, highlighted by Mouhamed Dioubate's 16 rebounds. ""It really showed when we went to overtime,"" Sears said. ""We had so much depth in the game. We were able to really push the pace and they really kind of couldn't handle it."" Rutgers rebounded from shooting 39.4 percent in Sunday's 79-77 loss at Kennesaw State by Harper's masterful showing in its 85-84 win over Notre Dame. Harper made 12 of 22 shots from the field, sank 10 free throws and also contributed six rebounds and six assists while constantly attacking the rim. Harper's game was his fifth with at least 20 points. ""He just showed the kind of player that he is,"" Rutgers coach Steve Pikiell said on his postgame radio interview. ""His best days are ahead of him but proud of our guys. They played so hard the whole night."" Rutgers also bounced back after Pikiell tweaked the starting lineup by replacing Jordan Derkack and Zach Martini with Jeremiah Williams and PJ Hayes IV. Derkack added 16 points while Williams joined Ace Bailey in scoring 10. ""We play a monster team, Alabama,"" Harper said on his postgame radio interview. ""The bounce back was a key thing for us and we did that perfectly."" The schools are meeting for the first time since Dec. 27, 1969 but an added storyline is Clifford Omoruyi facing Rutgers for the first time since transferring following four seasons. Omoruyi might be among the few rested players since he played 17 minutes against Houston due to Dioubate's strong performance. ""Hopefully (it's) Cliff's night,"" Alabama coach Nate Oats said. ""Who knows, but he should have fresh legs."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Columbus comes in off a 5-4 shootout victory over Carolina on Saturday. It marked the first time since March 11-16, 2022, that the Blue Jackets put together three consecutive wins. This year's streak started with a 5-1 victory at Boston on Monday and then a wild 7-6 overtime win over Tampa Bay on Thursday. Zach Werenski, named the NHL's No. 1 Star of the Week on Monday, scored in overtime vs. the Lightning to cap a five-point performance (two goals, three assists).  Two nights later, Kirill Marchenko scored a goal with 1:06 remaining in the third period and Columbus went on to pull out the shootout win over Carolina.  ""I think we're learning,"" said center Sean Monahan, who scored the shootout winner. ""Slowly, we're finding ways to win games, coming back and getting one late and finishing it in the shootout. It's a start, so that's a good sign.""  ""I think the last two games are prime examples of sticking with it and being together,"" Columbus defenseman Dante Fabbro added. ""We're playing a fun brand of hockey right now. I think everyone is working for each other, and you can tell everyone wants to win games right now. It's definitely a good feeling in the locker room.""  The winning streak began after the Blue Jackets held a team meeting following a 5-1 loss at Montreal on Nov. 16. Captain Nick Suzuki scored what proved to be the game-winner late in the second period, and the Canadiens pulled away with three goals in the third. ""Up to that point, we were playing well,"" Columbus coach Dean Evason said. ""We talked about playing winning hockey. Yeah, we had made mistakes, but we were competing and we were doing a lot of really good things. In that game, we didn't. We didn't seem like we were together. That's what really bothered us, is there was no cohesiveness, there was no pushback, there was no stand-up for each other."" Since that meeting, the Blue Jackets have bounced back to win three games against playoff teams from last season. Next up are the Canadiens, who have defeated Columbus six straight times. Montreal will play the second half a back-to-back set that began with a 3-2 overtime loss to the visiting Utah Hockey Club on Tuesday. Defenseman Mikhail Sergachev scored the winner 27 seconds into overtime for Utah, which finished with a 29-13 edge in shots on goal. ""I don't think the shots were a true reflection of attempts or chances, but it was one of those nights for us,"" Canadiens forward Alex Newhook said. ""Overtime is overtime,"" forward Brendan Gallagher said. ""It was a pretty even game. ... We'll take the good with the bad and hopefully respond with a win (Wednesday) night."" The contest with the Blue Jackets marks the start of a three-game road trip for Montreal that also includes games with the New York Rangers and Boston Bruins. The Canadiens are just 2-6-1 on the road this season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

While the Spartans (5-2) and Tar Heels (4-2) fell short of reaching the championship game in a tournament field featuring four top 10-ranked teams, Wednesday's winner and third-place finisher leaves the island above .500 against a treacherous field.  North Carolina, which advanced to the semifinal after overcoming a 21-point deficit against Dayton on Monday, could not replicate the comeback the following day versus Auburn. The Tar Heels again fell behind by double digits, trailing the Tigers by 15 points before trimming it to four just before halftime.  An Auburn run coming out of intermission, and Johni Broome's monster performance of 23 points and 19 rebounds, proved insurmountable in an 85-72 loss by North Carolina. ""For us to be good, we have to dwell in the trenches ... those toughness plays,"" Tar Heels coach Hubert Davis said following Tuesday's game. ""Early in the season, we've had spurts. The next step for us is to start that and there for a full 40 minutes.  ""We have to be able to rebound the basketball. We have to be able to get loose balls. We have to play with composure in situations and games like this.""  Michigan State gave up an 11-0 run midway through the second half that doomed the Spartans in their 71-63 semifinal loss to Memphis on Tuesday.  Jase Richardson came off the bench to score 18 points, knocking down 3-of-5 from 3-point range. The freshman's career-high scoring effort came on the heels of a 13-point effort in Michigan State's 72-56 win over Colorado on Monday.  Richardson struggled at the free-throw line by making 5 of 8 attempts The Spartans as a team left almost as many points at the foul line as the margin of defeat, going 12 of 19.  ""Jase did some really good things. He was so mad at himself for missing those free throws, but it is what it is,"" Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said. ""For a guy (that) has the (lack of) experience that he has in college so far, I thought he played very well.""  Richardson is one of the new faces playing on Wednesday that was not part of the matchup between Michigan State and North Carolina eight months ago. The two teams faced in the second round of the NCAA Tournament, a game the Tar Heels won, 85-69.  RJ Davis scored 20 points to lead North Carolina in the matchup on March 23. A 2023-24 All-American, Davis erupted for 30 points as the Tar Heels edged Dayton, 92-90, on Monday. He scored a season-low 12 points on 5-of-11 shooting in Tuesday's loss. Seth Trimble, who scored 27 points against Dayton, finished with a team-high 17 points versus Auburn.  Michigan State's top returning scorer from last season's matchup with North Carolina is Jaden Akins. He notched 11 points in that game and had 12 against Memphis.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Thanks to Tuesday's 2-0 victory over the Boston Bruins in the second clash of a six-game road swing, the Canucks have won eight consecutive road games. It is an impressive run for a Vancouver squad that has a substandard 3-5-3 home record, which is why coach Rick Tocchet was not about to spend too much time picking apart his team's win in Boston. The Canucks were outshot 32-15 by the Bruins and benefited from a spectacular 32-save performance from goaltender Kevin Lankinen to pull off the win. ""We're 8-1 on the road, so I've gotta give the guys a lot of credit grinding out some wins,"" Tocchet said. ""They're not all pretty ... but we'll take it."" Despite Lankinen's efforts in Boston, the Canucks likely will turn to goaltender Arturs Silovs in Pittsburgh. Unlike Lankinen, who has a 10-3-2 record and has won all eight road starts this season, Silovs has one victory in five starts (1-3-1) and has allowed 20 goals in those games. Between Silovs' struggles and the knowledge they stole a win in Boston, it wouldn't be a surprise if the Canucks put forth a stronger game against the Penguins despite having played the previous night. ""We had the lead and played a one-goal game and were able seal it,"" said forward Jake DeBrusk, who scored the winning goal in his return to Boston. ""It wasn't pretty, but we got the win, and that's the thing that matters most."" The Penguins are not only well rested but also are on a quest for redemption after their last outing.  The Penguins had plenty of time to digest a humbling 6-1 home loss to the Utah Hockey Club on Saturday, one night after losing 4-1 at home to the Winnipeg Jets. Pittsburgh has only one win in seven games (1-4-2) and is ahead of only the Montreal Canadiens in the Eastern Conference standings. In fact, the Penguins possess the only sub-.400 winning percentage in the conference, have the league's worst goals-against mark and worst goal differential at minus-34. ""It doesn't take a lot to play the right way, to play smart, to play with some detail,"" goaltender Alex Nedeljkovic said. ""It doesn't take talent, doesn't take skill. You don't have to be the strongest guy, the smartest guy, the most fit, whatever. All it is is just an attitude and a mindset. I think we have that at times. ... I think we just need to put it together more consistently."" The game will mark the Pittsburgh debut of forward Philip Tomasino, the 2019 first-round draft choice of the Nashville Predators who on Monday was acquired for a fourth-round pick in 2027. Tomasino scored 11 goals in his rookie season but has only 12 in his last two seasons while tumbling down the Nashville depth chart. He practiced on Tuesday with Evgeni Malkin, which is a golden opportunity to get his career back on track. ""The last two years for me haven't been what I wanted it to be in a perfect world,"" Tomasino said. ""But all I can look forward to is a future here, and I think it's going to be really good, a really good group.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Malone, whose Nuggets host the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night in Salt Lake City, called out everything from his team's leadership to what he perceived as the players' lackadaisical and lethargic play. ""Regardless of who's in, who's out -- who do we want to be as a team?"" Malone said while lashing out in his postgame interview. ""Leadership would be great. Toughness would be great. Physicality would be great. Playing like you actually care would be great. We didn't do that tonight."" Denver didn't play much defense, either. The Knicks outscored them by 12 points in the first quarter, built a 23-point halftime lead and burst ahead by as many as 30 points while dominating every statistical category. New York shot 60.9 percent, recorded a franchise-record 45 assists (to Denver's 23), outrebounded the Nuggets 43-33 and tallied 16 more points in the paint (62-46) and on fast breaks (24-8). Russell Westbrook led Denver with 27 points, while Nikola Jokic contributed a below-average 22 points, seven rebounds and seven assists. Jamal Murray added 20 points. Malone lamented the lopsided loss, but he's even more concerned that the Nuggets are trending in the wrong direction. ""Russell Westbrook is vocal, but we need more than Russell Westbrook. I need Nikola Jokic. I need Jamal Murray. I need guys that have been here in that starting lineup to be vocal,"" Malone said. ""... We got embarrassed. What just happened -- let's be honest, it happened tonight for four quarters, but it happened in the first half against Dallas. We're 16 games in and we're talking effort, we're talking about toughness, we're talking about physicality."" The Jazz beat the same Knicks squad in Utah on Saturday but fell apart in the fourth quarter of their 128-115 setback against the visiting San Antonio Spurs on Tuesday night. They'll be on a back-to-back for this one against Denver. After trailing by just one point early in the fourth quarter, Utah was outscored by 10 points the rest of the way while only scoring 22 points in the final stanza. It was the Jazz's fifth loss in six games. The most glaring stat: the Jazz turned the ball over 21 times leading to 33 points for the Spurs. San Antonio only had 10 turnovers. ""I really do think that ultimately tonight we beat ourselves,"" Jazz coach Will Hardy said. ""Close game at home going into the fourth. They have eight offensive rebounds in the fourth quarter alone, and another night where we have 20-plus turnovers. It's just hard to win."" Utah was eliminated from the NBA Cup with the loss in which Victor Wembanyama scored 34 points with six 3-pointers on 13-of-23 shooting. Keyonte George led Utah with 26 points and hit 9 of 16 shots. Collin Sexton scored 20 with four assists. Lauri Markkanen had 14 points, but he injured his knee when he collided with Wembanyama and didn't return. The Jazz called the injury a left-knee contusion. Denver won the first game against the Jazz, 129-103, at home on Nov. 2. That was the final loss in Utah's 0-6 start. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Phoenix is 9-1 this season when Durant has been on the floor. The Suns will look to add another victory to the ledger when they host the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday night. The Suns went 1-6 with Durant sidelined for seven games due to a strained left calf. Bradley Beal also returned from a five-game absence because of his own left calf strain. Phoenix lost all five games he missed. But the duo teamed up with Devin Booker to score 72 points in Tuesday's 127-100 whipping of the visiting Los Angeles Lakers. Booker had 26 points and 10 assists while Durant and Beal each poured in 23 points. ""I like our work ethic,"" Durant said afterward. ""I like the process were taking right now. Every day means something to us. As long as we continue to be healthy, we'll be fine."" The victory was the first for Phoenix since it defeated the Utah Jazz on Nov. 12. The energy level was higher in the eyes of Suns coach Mike Budenholzer. ""They are two great players,"" Budenholzer said of Durant and Beal. ""For them to miss a significant period of time and come back and play the way they did, it's a credit to them and their professionalism, skill and talent."" Booker was happy to see the other two players of Phoenix's ""Big Three"" back on the court. He said their presence makes it easier to attack defenses. ""I try to pride myself on making the right plays, reading the defense and try to see what the defense is giving up,"" Booker said. ""When you have a super talented team with a lot of options, we get clean looks every time. There are spots in the game where I can facilitate and that opens up more opportunities to score."" Phoenix outscored the Lakers 65-40 in the second half. The Nets have won two straight games and three of their past four. Brooklyn notched one of its most impressive victories of the season on Monday when it rallied for a 128-120 victory over the host Golden State Warriors. The Nets trailed by 18 points in the third quarter before dominating the rest of the contest. ""It was a complete team effort, short-handed,"" Brooklyn coach Jordi Fernandez said afterward. ""And these are amazing games."" Cam Thomas scored 23 points before injuring a hamstring in the third quarter that will cause him to sit out against the Suns. Cam Johnson hurt his ankle in the first half and is questionable to play against Phoenix, his former club. Dennis Schroder, who was questionable to play against Golden State due to a right ankle injury, had 31 points and seven assists to lead the charge. ""I think the league knows when they play against us, it's not going to be sweet,"" Schroder said. ""So at the end of the day, we're going to compete. It don't matter who's on the floor. We respect everybody, but when we get between those lines, we want to compete on the highest level. ... That's how we are going to win games."" Ziaire Williams (19 points, 10 rebounds) and Jalen Wilson (18 points, seven rebounds) also delivered strong outings. Phoenix has won five of the past six meetings. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Memphis awakened the masses by dropping two-time defending national champion UConn in the Maui Invitational, an overtime win that certainly will push the Tigers into the Top 25. Where they wind up in the latest poll Monday might depend on how they wrap up business on the islands Wednesday in the championship game of the tournament against Auburn. No. 4-ranked Auburn (6-0) expected a stiff test from guard-oriented North Carolina, but the Tar Heels had no answer for lefty big man Johni Broome (23 points) and Bruce Pearl’s team is among the national team leaders with 18 assists per game, a sign of crisp ball movement and willingness to spread the wealth among scorers. Memphis has one of those, too. PJ Haggerty ranks 19th in the nation at a 21.3 points-per-game average. He put up 16 and 9 in the 71-63 semifinal win over Michigan State. Memphis also shoots the 3 at a serious clip, averaging nine made 3s per game. But the difference on a multi-day tournament event stage is often depth and quality of talent beyond the core lineup.

That's just one more thing potentially to fret for the New York Islanders and Boston Bruins. Both teams have been worrying about the state of their offenses long before anyone started thinking about carving a turkey. The Islanders and Bruins both will look to earn a key victory on Wednesday night when they meet in Elmont, N.Y. The Islanders were idle on Tuesday, one day after continuing a three-game homestand with another third-period collapse in a 4-2 loss to the Detroit Red Wings.  The Bruins will complete a back-to-back, home-and-away set after dropping a 2-0 decision to the visiting Vancouver Canucks on Tuesday night. The Bruins' loss kept the Islanders within two points of Boston and the Buffalo Sabres, both of whom have 23 points and are tied for the last wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference. But the Islanders and Bruins are struggling to figure out their goal-scoring woes. The loss Monday was the fourth in five games (1-3-1) for the Islanders, who held a third-period lead in all four defeats. New York has allowed one goal or less through two periods in 14 of its first 22 games but is just 5-5-4 in those contests. The Islanders, who rank 27th in the NHL with 54 goals but are eighth in shots at 659, know many of their issues over the final 20 minutes stem from failing to pad their leads. ""They're not going in for us right now at times, and we've just got to push through it,"" captain Anders Lee said after the Islanders were limited to three goals or less for the fifth straight game and the 14th time this season. ""And obviously, we've got to find a way to keep the puck out of the net in the third period."" The frustration continued building Tuesday night for the Bruins, who fell for the first time in three games under interim head coach Joe Sacco despite outshooting the Canucks 32-15.  Boston, which ranks 30th in the NHL with 50 goals and 16th with 633 shots, has three goals or less in each of its last eight games and 18 times overall in just 23 games. The Bruins had three power-play chances after former Boston forward Jake DeBrusk scored 5:53 into the second period Tuesday night. Canucks right winger Conor Garland iced the victory by scoring into an empty net with 13 seconds left. ""We just have to start burying our chances,"" said Sacco, who took over for the fired Jim Montgomery on Nov. 19.  ""I think that we're giving ourselves a chance to compete in games now. The guys are defending hard, like I mentioned before, but offensively, we have to get some guys going and find their scoring touch.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Those games aren’t the problem. It’s the middle game I’m here to warn you about. I refuse to watch the Dallas Cowboys face the New York Giants, and if you’re honest with yourself, you know you should skip it too. I know I can’t sway families in Texas for whom Cowboys football is the backbone of the holiday. If you’re from any other state in the union, why are you signing yourself up to watch Cooper Rush vs. either Tommy Cutlets or Drew Lock?  The Giants are achieving new levels of embarrassment every week, and the Cowboys would be on a six-game losing streak if not for a Washington missed PAT and a couple of kick return touchdowns Sunday, which they won’t replicate. You may be wondering how to spend the time between the good games this Thursday. Lucky for you, I’ve assembled a list of five superior options so you don’t have to sit through the most miserable slog at AT&T Stadium since Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson. This one should be getting good just as the Lions and Bears are wrapping up. It’s a rematch of last year’s Final Four game between a No. 1 seed and a team that got really hot at the right time. Zach Edey and DJ Burns are no longer with these respective programs, but your sleepy uncles don’t need to know that when you change the channel. Purdue and NC State are a combined 10-1 to start the season; the Giants and Cowboys have six wins between them. We won’t know the matchup until Wednesday’s games, but this ought to be No. 24 Arizona vs. Oklahoma unless Providence finds a way to beat the favored Sooners. Arizona has a couple early losses this season, but Caleb Love is the kind of boom-or-bust college star who could go for 30 when you aren’t ready for it. There will be real stakes to this game.  The only stakes in Cowboys-Giants have to do with draft order. I’d have preferred “Miracle on 34th Street,” but as far as black-and-white holiday flicks go, this is still a great movie. Frank Capra, 1946. If you just want to make fun of Jimmy Stewart’s voice the whole time, I’m not stopping you, but it can also be a vehicle to get into the Christmas spirit. “But Adam, you can watch that movie anytime!” Guess what? If the Cowboys-Giants game is remotely good and you miss it, NFL Network will start airing reruns by Saturday. This new show looks like the perfect thing you can turn on in the background while your family is over the house, and Food Network will air reruns of four hour-long episodes starting at 5. Don’t tell me you’ve never seen one of these novelty baking shows advertised and haven’t been a little bit curious. Thanksgiving is your opportunity to zone out on the couch and watch chocolate wands get made, not to watch six punts in a row. I mean, really talk with them. Not about sports. Definitely not about politics. How are they doing? How often do you see them these days, anyway? This is your chance to be present at the dinner table, to get your eyes off your fantasy team or betting app. Be good to your loved ones this Thanksgiving. Don’t watch Cowboys-Giants. Copyright 2024"

The game will be the second in a back-to-back set for the teams, with San Antonio traveling from Salt Lake City and the Lakers playing in Phoenix on Tuesday.  The Spurs head home after a rousing 128-115 victory over the Utah Jazz on Tuesday for their season-high fourth straight win. It's the first time San Antonio has won four in a row since the 2021-22 campaign.  Victor Wembanyama scored 24 of his 34 points in the first half to lead San Antonio on Tuesday in the NBA Cup game. Stephon Castle added a career-high-tying 23 points, and Julian Champagnie scored 15.  San Antonio improved to 2-1 in Group B play, staying alive for a chance to advance to the West quarterfinals.  ""Every team's good. People know your stuff, tendencies for individuals, plays that you run, all those types of things,"" Spurs interim coach Mitch Johnson said. ""So you just kind of need a consistency of your identity to do the job, and I thought in the second half we did a good job of that."" San Antonio was up just 103-100 midway through the fourth quarter but reeled off a 13-3 run capped by a 3-pointer from Champagnie. After the Jazz cut the lead to single digits, Chris Paul's pullup 3-pointer with 2:08 left gave San Antonio a 12-point edge and all but iced the game. ""Tonight we had to just play a little harder and be a little more assertive late, and that made the difference in the fourth quarter,"" Champagnie said after Tuesday's victory. ""We kind of had to match (Utah's) energy if we wanted to win this game. That was kind of the only way we could get things going."" The Lakers limp into San Antonio after a 127-100 loss to the Suns. Los Angeles dropped its third straight game and fell into a tie with Phoenix and San Antonio in the West Group B standings; all three teams have a game left to play. Tuesday's game went back and forth through the first half before the Lakers surrendered a 14-2 run in the middle of the third quarter. Los Angeles never threatened again. Even though the first tiebreaker in the NBA Cup is point differential, the Lakers fell further behind in the game, trailing by as many as 27 points with 4 1/2 minutes to play. Anthony Davis recorded 25 points and 15 rebounds for the Lakers in the loss. LeBron James collected 18 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds while D'Angelo Russell had 16 points off the bench and Austin Reeves added 15. Russell continues to draw praise from Los Angeles coach JJ Redick for his contributions, which have become more consistent since Russell moved from the starting lineup to lead the reserves. ""(Russell) has been great for us, orchestrating defensively and his activity,"" said Redick, who emphasized that Russell's play is more important than just his scoring. ""That stuff does not go overlooked."" The Lakers posted a 120-115 victory over the host Spurs on Nov. 15 in the NBA Cup opener. After Wednesday, the teams will play twice more this season, in Los Angeles. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",Why the New York Knicks Are Cheering the Return of Kristaps Porzingis,https://deadspin.com/why-the-new-york-knicks-are-cheering-the-return-of-kristaps-porzingis/,2024-11-27T14:18:45.703Z,Kristaps Porzingis’ journey from the Knicks to the Celtics was complicated. How can his health and performance impact Boston and the Knicks' NBA Final,"Kristaps Porzingis made quite a splash in his return to the Boston Celtics’ lineup Monday night. Oversized wave-benders tend to do that. That applause you heard came from high atop the Rockies. No, not from the Nuggets, who are looking less and less like a potential NBA Finals opponent for the defending champs.  But from the visiting Knicks, who know Porzingis a whole lot better than the Celtics. The enigmatic 29-year-old carries a lot of baggage wherever he goes. He needs it to haul all his loot. Rest assured: The suitcases have wheels. His back can’t handle the weight of $177 million in career earnings, let alone the expectations of a desperate NBA franchise. Or two. Or three. Or now four. Make no mistake, the Knicks were exactly that when they made the generally unknown Porzingis the No. 4 overall pick of the 2015 draft. And they still are today, no thanks to the Latvian Lightweight, who sat next to Spike Lee about as often as he lined up next to Carmelo Anthony and Derrick Rose in 3 1/2 dreadful seasons. The problem with Porzingis’ wasn’t his attitude. It was his body. Bean poles tend to snap in the NBA. Ask Ralph Sampson. And has anybody seen Chet Holmgren recently? Luckily for the Knicks, the winds of desperation also blow through Central Texas, so they were able to extract two first-round picks from the Mavericks as a Porzingis parting gift. Unfortunately, the proverbial door appears to have hit Porzingis in the back side on his way through the exit, because he's still limping today. It didn't take Mark Cuban long to learn a little something about NBA economics: What doesn’t sell in New York often doesn’t sell in Dallas, either... especially at five times the price. Three years later, the Mavs accepted a gym bag full of used scorebooks in order for the Wizards to take the now-journeyman off their hands. Only to suffer the same fate. Three strikes and... Porzingis appears to have hit a home run. Last June, the big oaf was moved once again and now wears an NBA crown atop his head.  Apparently it must be heavy.  After missing many of Boston’s most important games last season, Porzingis watched the first 17 this year. Even Celtics fans have stopped counting. The tin man just can’t stay upright. The funny thing is: The Knicks wish their old pal the best of health. Their spot in the NBA Finals might depend upon it. Like 28 other teams in the NBA, Knicks management has identified the Celtics as the team to beat en route to the 2025 championship. Unlikely the other 28, the Knicks have done something about it. Actually, they’ve done a lot about it. With Mikal Bridges and OG Anunoby, they now have the shackles to lock down Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Not that Tatum, one of the worst shooters in postseason history, and Brown, on record pace for most missed 3-pointers, will stop jacking. And with Karl-Anthony Towns, they have more than just the complementary piece needed to take the offensive weight off Jalen Brunson. They have the perfect matchup for Porzingis. The best way to attack the Boston defense is with a floor-spacing big man. Enter Towns, whose 2-for-2 night shooting threes in Denver on Monday were just enough to pull Nikola Jokic from the basket, clearing space for the normally offensively challenged Anunoby to sneak in and score 40 points. That’s what they’ll need to do against the Celtics, who can lock down three positions with the best of them. But Tatum doesn’t like to guard anybody, and without Porzingis around to protect the basket, Boston’s vaunted defense all of a sudden becomes vulnerable.  Anunoby is already licking his chops. And at the other end of the floor, Porzingis doesn’t have that kind of perimeter prowess. So while Towns anchors in the key, cutting off Tatum’s deadly ventures into the defensive belly, the Knicks can let Boston’s vaunted 36-percent 3-point-shooting big man fire away.  That is, if he’s even still a 36-percenter. His trumpeted debut Monday featured 1-for-6 shooting from deep, something with which the Knicks became quite familiar when the tallest man on the court at all times connected on 33 percent from deep as their marquee rookie. Hey, it could have been worse. In a Giannis Antetokounmpo impersonation, he slumped to a downright embarrassing 28 percent that got him fired by Cuban. In a merciful twist of fate, the Knicks are praying Porzingis is still celebrating a healthy honeymoon come May. Ten years later, he just might lead them to a championship. Copyright 2024"

Los Angeles saw its five-game winning streak snapped Monday in the second date of its road trip, falling 126-94 to the reigning NBA champion Boston Celtics.  Monday's loss marked a rare defensive lapse for the Clippers this season. They held each of their previous four opponents to less than 100 points, including the high-scoring Golden State Warriors in a 102-99 win on Nov. 18.  ""I told our guys (Boston is) a great team, but to not let go of the rope. Keep building on what we've established, and that's playing hard. That's competing. Not complaining to the officials, and doing things the right way,"" Los Angeles coach Tyronn Lue said Monday. ""That's all you can ask of your guys. ... continue to play with good habits and composure and not let it take away from what we've built.""  What the Clippers have built thus far in 2024-25 is one of the top defenses in the NBA, holding opponents to the league's fourth-lowest yield at 107.5 points per game. Los Angeles has been exceptional in defending the 3-pointer, limiting opponents to 34.1 percent shooting from beyond the arc.  After surrendering 22 of 51 shots from deep to Boston, the Clippers will look to regroup against a Washington offense that has been among the NBA's worst in a variety of categories, including 3-point shooting.  The Wizards shoot 32.5 percent from 3-point range and average just 108.5 points per game. Washington's 127-108 loss to the Bulls on the first leg of this week's back-to-back set marked the Wizards' 12th consecutive defeat.  Rookie Alexandre Sarr put together consecutive strong games in Washington's past two, however. He followed his 17-point, 14-rebound effort in a 115-103 loss to Indiana on Sunday with 20 points, seven rebounds and 4-of-5 shooting from 3-point range on Tuesday.  ""He's starting to slow down and really find his touch behind the 3 (-point line),"" Malcolm Brogdon said of Sarr to The Washington Post. ""And he's also learning to roll a little bit, to mix it up, to keep the defense on their toes."" Sarr's emergence came with Washington's leading scorer, Jordan Poole at 21.2 points per game, sidelined with a hip injury. Poole's availability for Wednesday is questionable.  The Clippers' Norman Powell, averaging a career-best 23.3 points per game, has missed the past four games with a hamstring injury. His status for Wednesday is uncertain.  Amir Coffey has started in Powell's place over this stretch, which he kicked off with 18 points in a Nov. 20 win over the Orlando Magic. Coffey's scoring production has declined each game he has been in the starting lineup, bottoming with four points on Monday against the Celtics.  James Harden picked up the scoring slack in the Clippers' first three games without Powell, going for 24, 22 and 23 points in the wins over Orlando, the Sacramento Kings and Philadelphia 76ers. Ivica Zubac led Los Angeles in Boston with 23 points, and his 10 rebounds gave him his fourth consecutive double-double.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Instead, a fan base giddy over the Bears’ appearance on a certain HBO-NFL Films collaboration merely three months ago is repeating an unwanted, unscheduled lesson at The School of Hard Knocks. The Bears drag a five-game losing streak into Thursday’s Thanksgiving Day matinee at league-leading Detroit, baggage that continues to cloud a 4-2 start. If there’s optimism, it’s the cautious kind, and it has nothing to do with 2024—just the man who wears jersey No. 18. Bears rookie quarterback Caleb Williams shined during his team’s latest defeat Sunday, passing for 340 yards and two touchdowns in an overtime loss to the NFC-contending Minnesota Vikings. As conventional wisdom suggests another coaching change may be afoot, at least the Bears know the new guy will have an improving and exciting Williams in tow. Chicago trailed by 14 points entering the fourth quarter against Minnesota and was down 11 with 1:56 to play, but Williams rallied the team to force OT, making gutsy throws to lead two scoring drives down the stretch. “He had me nervous a little bit,” Vikings wide receiver Jordan Addison said. “I’ve seen him do some crazy things, so I was just crossing my fingers, hoping that it went our way.” Indeed, Addison played alongside Williams at USC, where the quarterback won the 2022 Heisman Trophy to bolster a reputation and resume that helped him get drafted No. 1 overall in April. As such, Chicago traded another would-be, franchise-resurrecting QB in Justin Fields to clear a path for Williams while acquiring and drafting a stable of skill position players. Keenan Allen. D’Andre Swift. Rome Odunze. That the bumbling Matt Eberflus remained the coach that shepherded Williams into the organization didn’t seem to matter to Bears brass. As with “Hard Knocks,” though, reality ultimately unspooled. Chicago lost in Washington in Week 8 on a Hail Mary at the gun and had a potential game-winning field goal blocked as time expired on a Week 11 loss to Green Bay. In between, amid fans’ calls for his own dismissal, Eberflus (14-31 in two-plus seasons) fired offensive coordinator Shane Waldron after a 19-3 home loss to once-punchless New England. In stepped Thomas Brown, whose alliance with Williams has harbored hope. After compiling a passer rating of 81 during Waldron’s nine games as OC, Williams has a rating of 95 in two games under Brown’s tutelage, narrow losses to the Packers and Vikings. “He has a certain aura to him that he just allows you to play free,” Williams said of Brown. “He knows what he wants. You know he knows what he wants. Whether it’s checks, alerts, all of that, we still have a bunch of those, all these different things. Being able to play free.” Suppose the success continues against a rugged schedule that still has road stops against every team in the league’s toughest division, the NFC North? What if there’s a new regime this offseason? What if Brown isn’t someone a new Chicago coach wants on his staff? Bears fans—the ones dressed in Mike Ditka cosplay and otherwise—might be wise to let those questions slide for now. Many know all too well where pondering the future gets them. Copyright 2024"

Memphis (6-0) entered the event unranked but beat No. 2 UConn 99-97 in overtime in the first round Monday and Michigan State 71-63 in Tuesday's semifinals.  Memphis coach Penny Hardaway said he likes the extra attention his team has received following those two wins. ""It feels good,"" he said. ""As a competitor, a former basketball player (and) now a coach, you want to be a part of the rare air in the NCAA. You want to be part of that group they mention with Duke, Kansas -- you want Memphis' name to be there. That's why we play one of the top non-conference schedules every year, because we want to play those guys to show who we are.   ""That's just all a part of it for us. It's a journey, always trying to fight to get our respect, and little by little hopefully we're getting there. We want that attention because we work so hard.""   Auburn (6-0) advanced to the Maui final by defeating No. 5 Iowa State 83-81 in the first round and then No. 12 North Carolina 85-72 in Tuesday's second semifinal.   Johni Broome has been a dominant force for Auburn. He had 21 points and 10 rebounds against Iowa State and 23 points and 19 rebounds vs. North Carolina.  Broome made 9 of 18 field-goal attempts against the Tar Heels.   ""I think you've got to remember where he came from, and that just doesn't get talked about enough,"" Auburn coach Bruce Pearl said. ""He was a three-star (recruit). ... He's not fast enough, not good enough. All he's done his entire career is prove people wrong.""   Auburn's Chad Baker-Mazara added 14 points and seven rebounds against North Carolina, and Chaney Johnson came off the bench and finished with 11 points and eight rebounds. Auburn had six players who scored at least 10 points.   ""Having six guys in double figures was really, really good,"" Pearl said. ""The guys shared the ball really well. (Johnson is) a nightmare to match up with, because he can do things on the perimeter.""   Tyrese Hunter was Memphis' leading scorer in each of its tournament victories. The senior made 5 of his 10 3-point attempts and scored 23 points against Michigan State, and he had seven 3-pointers and 26 points during Monday's victory over UConn.   Hunter began his career at Iowa State and also played at Texas before he transferred to Memphis. Hunter helped Iowa State beat Memphis when he was a freshman.   ""He demolished us,"" Hardaway said. ""He really had an unbelievable game as a freshman (nine points, five assists), and I was a fan from that point on. When he got in the (transfer) portal, he was a guy I targeted. I was like, ‘We need him.'""   Hunter said the team knows what it will take to defeat Auburn.   ""Just stay locked in like the last two games,"" he said. ""Just go out and be us.

Then again, so are the Sacramento Kings.  One of the teams will get their way when the Timberwolves host the Kings on Wednesday night in Minneapolis.  The Timberwolves have lost three straight games, including a 117-111 overtime defeat at home against the Houston Rockets on Tuesday night. Anthony Edwards had a chance to win the game at the end of regulation, but his bank shot rimmed out, and the Rockets prevailed by outscoring the Timberwolves 15-9 in the extra session.  The Kings also are aiming for a victory after losing their past four games. Their latest setback was 130-109 at home against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday.  Kings guard Malik Monk said he and his teammates likely would have a meeting before they face the Timberwolves.  ""We're going to say something,"" Monk said. ""I feel like we always say something after every loss, so ... we'll probably say something when we get to Minnesota.""  The Timberwolves are talking about how to break out of a disappointing start. They reached the Western Conference final last season but have lost nine of 17 games to begin the 2024-25 campaign.  A toe injury to veteran point guard Mike Conley has tested the Timberwolves.  Rookie Rob Dillingham earned praise for his effort to fill Conley's void on Tuesday night. Dillingham finished with 12 points and seven assists off the bench.  Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said Dillingham's speed helps to set him apart.  ""He's giving us a lot right now with his ability to get by people,"" Finch said. ""... He plays with a ton of confidence, and he plays hard on defense.""  Overall, Finch said he wants to see a better effort from his players on the second night of a back-to-back set at home.  ""I didn't really like our effort and energy in the first half,"" he said after the loss to the Rockets. ""Found it in the second half, but we kept giving it back ... trying to do too much by ourselves with the ball offensively.""  DeMar DeRozan will look to stay hot for the Kings after scoring a team-high 30 points on 13-for-21 shooting against Oklahoma City. DeRozan is averaging 22.6 points per game this season while shooting 50.8 percent from the field and 29.4 percent from 3-point range.  De'Aaron Fox leads Sacramento with an average of 28.1 points per game on 50.4 percent shooting overall. Domantas Sabonis is averaging a double-double with 20 points and 12.9 rebounds per game, and Keegan Murray is scoring 13.2 points per game.  Edwards paces the Timberwolves with an average of 28 points through 17 games. He scored 29 on Tuesday night as he shot 8 of 22 from the field overall, 3 of 12 from beyond the arc, and 10 of 10 from the free-throw line.  This will be the third of four meetings between Minnesota and Sacramento during the regular season.

The Rockets will look to sweep their two-game road trip Wednesday night when they visit the scuffling Philadelphia 76ers.  Houston improved to 13-6 with a hard-fought, 117-111 overtime win against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Tuesday. The Rockets rallied from a five-point deficit with just under two minutes left in regulation before storming in front in the extra session.  Fred VanVleet recorded 27 points and 11 assists and Alperen Sengun notched a triple-double for Houston, which squandered an 18-point lead before prevailing against a tough opponent.  ""So, I said to the team, ‘That was probably one of the sweetest wins of the year, for those reasons,'"" Rockets coach Ime Udoka said, adding that ""a lot of teams would fold when you let a big lead like that go away. We had to find a way to get it back.""  Houston finished with 31 assists on 45 buckets and knocked down 15 of 37 3-pointers (40.5 percent), including six by VanVleet and four by Dillon Brooks.  ""It was poppin' around, and you've got to make shots, obviously, to take advantage of that,"" Udoka said. ""We didn't really get bogged down too often tonight.""  The Rockets are 8-2 in their past 10 games as they continue to climb in the Western Conference standings.  ""When we play like this, it's really hard to play against us,"" Sengun said. ""We played hard. We shared the ball. ... That's the game we are playing lately, and everybody enjoys it. We look different this season.""  Meanwhile, the Sixers look different as well -- but not in a good way.  Philadelphia snapped a five-game losing streak Friday against the Brooklyn Nets, but the momentum didn't last through the weekend, as the 76ers were pounded by the Los Angeles Clippers 125-99 on Sunday.  Nick Nurse's team fell behind by 19 points in the first quarter and allowed the Clippers to shoot 58 percent from the field for the game.  ""I think there's several things, but the biggest thing was just lack of keeping the ball in front of us, really, from the defensive end,"" Nurse said. ""They just drove it to wherever they wanted to to start the game.""  Philadelphia continued to play without Joel Embiid and Paul George, both of whom are nursing knee injuries, as well as Kyle Lowry (hip). All three will miss the matchup with Houston, the team announced Monday.  In the meantime, the Sixers have one of the league's worst records at 3-13 amid a slew of key injuries. One positive has been the play of rookie guard Jared McCain, who is averaging 16.6 points this season, although he was just 3 of 15 from the field in Sunday's setback.  ""I don't know,"" McCain said. ""I mean, I think we've just got to come up with more energy. It's something that we can control. We can always control our effort and energy, but we're not right now. ... So I feel like we've just got to talk about that and make sure we just adjust.""

He kept the answer simple and to the point. ""We have to play better basketball,"" Young told reporters. Nineteen turnovers did not help the Hokies' cause Monday.  ""You can't turn the ball over 19 times,"" Young said. ""I don't care what level you are at, or what league you are in.

That's a great quality to have,"" South Carolina head coach Lamont Paris said, according to the Lexington County Chronicle. Jacobi Wright and Jamarii Thomas are each scoring 12.5 points per game for the Gamecocks, who are looking to get back on track and build on last season's success when they won 26 games and played in the NCAA Tournament. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

But that will be a tall task for the Bluejays (4-2), who have dropped games at home to in-state rival Nebraska and, on Tuesday, to San Diego State. The latter was a 71-53 setback on the opening day of the Las Vegas event. Pop Issacs paced Creighton with 18 points in the loss, with Jackson McAndrew adding 12 points and 14 rebounds and center Ryan Kalkbrenner scoring 11 points while recording a season-best five blocked shots.  Creighton played without starting point guard Steven Ashworth, who was injured in Friday's loss to Nebraska. The Bluejays shot just 33.9 percent from the floor and missed eight of their 13 free throws.  ""We made some mistakes a few times going under some screens when we weren't supposed to,"" Creighton coach Greg McDermott said. ""When we got a little bit aggressive, our rotations weren't where they needed to be."" ""And, again, maybe sounds like a little bit of a broken record, but we built this team on shooting, and we're not shooting it very well now at all. We've been a great free-throw team all season, and today we couldn't do that, either.""  The Bluejays led 8-4 early in the game before allowing San Diego State to reel off a 21-8 run to fall behind 25-16. Creighton battled back to within four points at the break but trailed 52-40 seven minutes into the second half and never made a serious run down the stretch.  ""It's really important that we don't enter a finger-pointing phase when we go through a tough time here,"" McDermott said. ""We try to help each other, try to look in the mirror and figure out what we can do better to try to correct it and then move on from there and get ready for the next one.""  The Aggies (4-2) also head to the second-day Las Vegas matchup with a loss after falling to Oregon 80-70 on Tuesday. Zhuric Phelps' 20 points paced A&M while Wade Taylor IV had 15. The duo combined to go 10 of 34 from the floor, shooting as many shots as the rest of the team combined.  Texas A&M led by three at the break and by 10 after a Jace Carter 3-pointer with 10:58 to play but trailed by two after the Ducks went on a 14-2 run to take a 60-58 lead A&M tied the game at 70 on a free throw by Taylor with 2:21 to play, but that would be its final points. The Aggies went the last 4:41 without a field goal while missing their final 11 shots and went just 10 of 37 (27 percent) from the floor after halftime.  Phelps, a transfer from SMU, had the game's high-point output in the loss to Oregon.  ""My teammates and coach and the staff have instilled so much confidence in me,"" Phelps said. ""They still talking to me, trusting me. you know, to play those minutes and, you know, help the team win."" Texas A&M and Creighton have played just once, with the Bluejays winning 100-77 in 1971. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

San Diego State (3-1) defeated No. 21 Creighton 71-53 before Oregon (6-0) beat No. 20 Texas A&M 80-70. The Aztecs, Ducks, Bluejays and Aggies comprise the ""Power Group"" of the eight-team format of the Players Era Festival. A win on Wednesday, signifying a 2-0 start in the event, would send either San Diego State or Oregon to the championship game on Saturday. The four teams in each group are seeded based on performance after the first two games. Each of the eight schools are guaranteed at least $1 million for NIL purposes, with additional bonus money distributed based on teams' results. BJ Davis notched a career-high 18 points and Miles Byrd contributed 16 for the Aztecs against Creighton. Davis, a sophomore, never reached double figures last season, but he has at least 11 in all four games this season. He is averaging a team-best 15 points a game while shooting 62.2 percent (23 of 37) from the field, including 50 percent (8 of 16) from 3-point range. ""All the work that we put in as a collective, and just for me to be able to go out there and perform, it feels great,"" said Davis, who was a reserve last season. ""Just going to keep working and keep trusting the coaches, keep trusting my teammates."" Oregon went on a 16-0 run in the second half to take a six-point lead over Texas A&M, but the Aggies bounced back to lead 69-68 with 4:41 to go. The game was tied 70-70 with two minutes remaining before the Ducks scored the final 10 points -- eight from the foul line. The Ducks sank 12 consecutive shots from the field at one point in the second half, with nine of them layups or dunks. Oregon made 45.5 percent of its field-goal attempts overall, the first team to shoot better than 40 percent against Texas A&M. The Ducks were led by TJ Bamba's 18 points, while Brandon Angel and Jackson Shelstad each added 16. ""He's got a lot of experience,"" Oregon coach Dana Altman said of Bamba, a senior captain. ""He did some real good things, started getting to the basket, and that made a big difference."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Colorado's official debut Big 12 game still is scheduled to take place Dec. 30 at home against Iowa State. But the teams will face off for a preview from paradise in what will be the first of three games between the programs in the regular season. The Buffaloes earned the honor with a signature victory Tuesday when they held off two-time defending champion UConn 73-72 in the second round in the Maui event. Julian Hammond III scored 16 points for the Buffaloes (5-1), while Andrej Jakimovski added 12 points and 10 rebounds. No. 2 UConn led by as many as 11 points in the first half and was up 46-37 with 17:36 remaining before Colorado went on an 11-0 run to take a two-point lead with 14:02 left. The Huskies appeared to wrest control by taking a 70-65 edge with 3:28 to go before the Buffaloes scored eight of the final 10 points. UConn played the final 4:40 after 6-foot-10 center Samson Johnson fouled and the final 2:04 after 6-10 center Tarris Reed Jr. also departed. One of the best victories for Colorado's Tad Boyle in 19 seasons as a Division I coach came after he lost five double-digit scorers from last season's 26-11 team. ""I mentioned that we are going to learn a lot about (our) team in this tournament, and we learned from (Monday) night,"" Boyle said, referencing a loss to Michigan State in the first round. ""The biggest thing I was disappointed in (against the Spartans) was our fight and our shot selection. We challenged (the team). I'm really proud of them."" Iowa State (4-1) fought to the end to secure its spot in the fifth-place game by holding off pesky Dayton 89-84. Iowa State trailed 78-77 with 3:33 remaining before the game was tied 81-81 with 1:20 to go. The Cyclones scored six of the next seven points. Iowa State went 10-for-10 on free throws over the final 3:23 as it rallied from a nine-point, first-half deficit. Keshon Gilbert scored a season-high 24 points for the Cyclones by going 6 of 8 from the floor and 12 of 14 from the free-throw line. Curtis Jones added 19 points, while Dishon Jackson scored 12 points and grabbed a team-high six rebounds. ""This is such a great tournament,"" Iowa State coach T.J. Otzelberger said after his team shot a season-best 51.7 percent from the floor.. ""I'm not sure there's ever been a stronger field here. And you know every game is gonna be a war -- and we've already had two."" The victory came after Iowa State blew an 18-point lead and lost in the first round to No. 4 Auburn on Monday. ""Our bench, I thought, was the best it's been so far this year,"" Otzelberger said after the reserve unit outscored Dayton's 30-12. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Wagner has averaged 27.6 points, 5.8 rebounds and 7 assists over the past 10 games and will try to stay in the zone Wednesday night when Orlando collides with the visiting Chicago Bulls.  The Magic have gone 9-1 during Wagner's stupendous run, most recently beating the Charlotte Hornets 95-84 on Monday night. Wagner put up a team-high 21 points to go with seven assists, but it was the bench that carried Orlando to victory.  Reserves Moritz Wagner (16 points), Cole Anthony (16), Jonathan Isaac (11) and Anthony Black (10) scored in double figures as the second unit accounted for 55.8 percent of the Magic's points.  Orlando coach Jamahl Mosley hopes his team can continue to thrive in the face of adversity. Banchero hasn't played since Oct. 30 due to a torn right oblique, and the Magic also were missing Jalen Suggs (hamstring) and Wendell Carter Jr. (foot) on Monday. Guard Gary Harris logged only seven minutes of action before going down with a hamstring injury.  ""Gutsy win -- gritty and gutsy win,"" Mosley said of Monday's performance. ""Bodies down and we didn't make excuses. This group doesn't make excuses. That's the second game where we found a way to win. Guys stepped up, stepped in.""  Suggs and Carter are expected back on Wednesday, but Harris already has been ruled out.  Despite not being nearly as banged-up as Orlando, Chicago hasn't been able to find a groove, going 5-9 since the start of the month. The Bulls did, however, come away with a win last time out, topping the Washington Wizards 127-108 on Tuesday night.  Coby White was one of seven Bulls scorers in double figures with 21 points. He also had eight rebounds, and Nikola Vucevic, who was with Orlando from 2012-21, chipped in 19 points and 12 boards.  It was an impressive performance for Chicago, but it came against a Washington team that is 2-14 this season. Bulls coach Billy Donovan now wants to see what his group can do against the surging Magic.  ""I think you have to play who is in front of you, and you look at it as, ‘Did we do the things we've talked about doing?'"" Donovan said. ""No question there was growth. Coming out of this game (against Washington), it's not like, ‘Oh, wow, everything is fixed.'  ""My thing is, can we do it (Wednesday) night against a team that's bigger, stronger, more athletic?""  Like Orlando, Chicago could get some extra help on Wednesday, as guard Lonzo Ball hopes to make his return following a 15-game absence caused by a right wrist injury. Ball came off the bench in three games earlier this season and averaged 4.7 points.  ""In terms of his workout and whatever (the medical team) has to do, as long as there's no setbacks, there's a strong possibility he'll play,"" Donovan said. ""He has been doing some contact one-on-one, some shooting, catching, shooting off the dribble -- he's doing all that stuff.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Heat lost 106-103 on Tuesday night at home against the Milwaukee Bucks. The result prevented Miami from notching a three-game winning streak for the first time this season and left the Heat all but eliminated from contention for the NBA Cup. ""It's disappointing,"" Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""We've had two ridiculously close games. We wanted to be there in Vegas (for the NBA Cup semifinals), but that's behind us now, and we'll focus on getting ready for Charlotte."" Miami's Tyler Herro and Terry Rozier had chances to hit game-winning or game-tying shots at the end against Milwaukee. ""I saw open looks. I saw in and out,"" Spoelstra said. ""Terry's was like a 27-foot shot so that's different, but it's open. That's all you can (ask for)."" Miami's point total Tuesday night was its third lowest of the season. Almost half of Jimmy Butler's team-high 23 points for the Heat came via his 11 free throws. Miami lost despite Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo sitting out due to a knee injury. The Hornets, meanwhile, are miffed about losing four of their past five games. LaMelo Ball poured in 50 and 44 points in the past two games, but Charlotte lost them both. Ball had more than half of the Hornets' points in a 95-84 home loss to the Orlando Magic on Monday. ""Defensively the guys did a really good job of executing the game plan,"" Charlotte coach Charles Lee said. ""To give up 95 points and we were fouling toward the end of the game, I think just shows the effort and the competitiveness and togetherness."" By committing 27 turnovers, the Hornets put themselves in bad situations. ""We got ourselves in trouble with some of our turnovers,"" Lee said. ""I thought most of it is self-inflicted again. Things that we can control. I would love to just see us to fix some of our transition turnovers that we have right now."" The Hornets have been out of balance on offense for much of the past few weeks, making adjustments because of injured post players. They are relying even more heavily on Ball and Brandon Miller for scoring. That could pay off in the big picture. ""I see two guys who are very talented, work extremely hard, care very much about the game, their teammates and the process they have to go through every day to continue to get better,"" Lee said. Rozier, a former Hornets guard, will be back in Charlotte with the Heat. He scored 17 points off the bench Tuesday night against Milwaukee. ""He's a competitor and X-factor player,"" Spoelstra said. ""He's in this role for us now."" Miami is making its second visit of the season to Charlotte, where the Heat won 114-106 on Oct. 26 behind Butler's 26 points and eight assists. Ball scored 27 points in the game, but Miller didn't play because of an hip injury. The Hornets committed 20 turnovers. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Omot (10.8 points per game) is reportedly week-to-week with a wrist injury, but both Blacksher (16.3) and Campbell (8.8) are day-to-day and could return Wednesday. Cal (5-1) aims to match its best seven-game start since the 2016-17 season. Even if Blacksher and Campbell don't log typical starter's minutes should they play Wednesday, the Golden Bears have ample depth. Freshman guard Jeremiah Wilkinson had 16 points off the bench Sunday in an 83-77 win over Sacramento State after netting a career-high 23 in 78-69 victory over Air Force on Thursday. Rytis Petraitis added 13 points and five assists on Sunday in his second straight start, while regular starter Andrej Stojakovic has scored 21 points (a career high) and 20 in Cal's last two games. ""We believe in strength in numbers,"" Madsen said. ""We have a deep roster. We can play 11 or 12 guys. ... You have players getting experience in tough situations where momentum is changing back and forth. ... This is only going to make us a stronger team going forward.""

Ottawa edged the visiting Calgary Flames 4-3 on Monday night to snap a five-game skid (0-4-1). Captain Brady Tkachuk and Drake Batherson each had a goal and an assist against the Flames, while Cole Reinhardt scored his first NHL goal. Adam Gaudette had the other Ottawa goal. The Senators were outscored 21-11 during the winless stretch. ""I mean, when you've lost a few in a row, and there's been a lot of talk around Ottawa about losing a few in a row, it's nice to get a win,"" Senators coach Travis Green said.

Ottawa goalie Linus Ullmark, who is 4-7-1 with an .881 save percentage and a 3.10 goals-against average in 13 games this season, is 5-0-0 in five career appearances against the Sharks, posting a .932 save percentage and a 1.82 GAA. Tkachuk has a team-leading 11 goals this season, while Tim Stutzle paces Ottawa with 16 assists and 25 points. On Tuesday, the Senators recalled defenseman Donovan Sebrango from AHL Belleville and placed Artem Zub (foot fracture) on long-term injured reserve. It would be Sebrango's first NHL game if he plays on Wednesday. The Senators and Sharks split a pair of games last season, with Ottawa winning 5-4 on its home ice on Jan. 13 and the Sharks prevailing 2-1 on March 9 in San Jose. The Sharks snapped a three-game skid on Monday, defeating the Los Angeles Kings 7-2. Rookie Macklin Celebrini registered his first career three-point game, scoring twice in the third period after an earlier assist. Celebrini became just the second 18-year-old in team history with a three-point game, joining Patrick Marleau, who accomplished the feat in 1998. Fabian Zetterlund, Alex Wennberg, Luke Kunin, Timothy Liljegren and Nico Sturm also scored for the Sharks. Will Smith and William Eklund recorded two assists each. The contest was tied 2-2 before the Sharks scored five time in the final period. ""I thought we had a pretty solid hockey game,"" Sharks coach Ryan Warsofsky said. ""Obviously, (there are) some things we have to look at and get a little bit better in certain areas, but credit to the guys. If you look back, the third period has probably been our best period consistently all year. To put a couple of goals in the back of the net was important for our group."" Mikael Granlund, who has a team-leading 24 points in 23 games, missed a game for the first time this season due to an upper-body injury on Monday. Givani Smith replaced Granlund on Monday. Granlund, Zetterlund and Tyler Toffoli have nine goals each to pace the Sharks this season. Goaltender Yaroslav Askarov, who made 22 saves for his first win of the season on Monday, was reassigned to the AHL's San Jose Barracuda on Tuesday. In a corresponding move, the Sharks recalled defenseman Jack Thompson, who has two goals and three assists in 13 NHL games this season. San Jose goaltender Mackenzie Blackwood is 4-7-3 with a 3.07 GAA and a .907 save percentage in 14 games this season.

The Seattle Kraken gave Shane Wright a chance at the latter over the past week and it paid off Monday in Anaheim. Wright, who had been a healthy scratch in the previous three games, returned with a goal and an assist in a 3-2 victory against the Ducks in Anaheim. The teams will complete their home-and-home series Wednesday in Seattle. ""I kind of realized I have a little more time with the puck than I think I do,"" Wright, the No. 4 overall pick in the 2022 NHL Draft, said about what he learned from watching from high above the ice in the press box.  ""Just being able to hold on to those pucks, rather than kind of throwing it away or making a play with someone else. Just holding on to it, skating it and then trying to make a play with it,"" Wright said. Wright scored the game's opening goal, outmuscling a defender in front of the net to redirect Oliver Bjorkstrand's shot from the left point past Anaheim goaltender Lukas Dostal. With the score tied early in the third period, Wright won a faceoff in the offensive zone back to Brandon Montour, whose slap shot from the right point proved to be the winning goal. ""It was great to see Wright get on the board early,"" Kraken coach Dan Bylsma said. ""I thought he played really well all game long. The faceoff win (setting up the winner) is just another example of what he can add."" The Kraken, who snapped a five-game road losing streak during which they were outscored 17-5 and shut out twice, also got a boost from Andre Burakovsky's first goal of the season. Burakovsky scored from the top left of the goal crease after a back-to-the-net, backhanded pass from Jared McCann from the opposite faceoff circle. The goal forged a 2-2 tie 46 seconds into the third period, and Montour tallied just 24 seconds later. ""It's been a while,"" said Burakovsky, who last scored April 9 against the Arizona Coyotes, a franchise that has since moved to Utah. ""It's been a lot of games. It hasn't come easy, so definitely nice to see it going in. Maybe not the prettiest one I've scored in my life, but it will count."" Trevor Zegras and Frank Vatrano tallied for the Ducks, who had a four-game point streak (3-0-1) come to an end. ""This time of year is when teams start separating themselves,"" said Ducks forward Troy Terry, who had a pair of assists. ""As a team, getting experience in those types of games ... you could tell the intensity was higher. We'll learn from it. I think we did a lot of good things, and we did enough good things to maybe even win the game. A few errors cost us."" Ducks coach Greg Cronin had no qualms about his team's play through the first two periods. ""We were playing our game. We just got off it,"" Cronin said. ""It happens. It's not complicated. We've just got to play to our structure, play to our system, and then when you do that, you're connected and you can anticipate and play faster."" Ducks forward Leo Carlsson, the No. 2 pick in 2023, was injured late in the second period when he crashed into his own net after being checked by Seattle's Tye Kartye, who was penalized for interference on the play.

The Jets will try to maintain their momentum when they visit the Los Angeles Kings on Wednesday night. Winnipeg has won two of the first three games on the six-game trip, most recently defeating the Minnesota Wild 4-1 on Monday. The Jets won 15 of their first 16 games this season, but they had lost three of five heading into their matchup with the Wild, who entered the game four points behind Winnipeg for first place in the Central Division. ""Yeah, it's a big, big step, but obviously we've got to work on some things,"" said Winnipeg forward Alex Iafallo, who scored twice at Saint Paul, Minn. ""But, going forward, I think it's a big win for us, and especially on the road. Finishing off that third period is huge for us -- and building that momentum of hard plays and doing it right to the end."" Iafallo, who spent his first six NHL seasons playing for the Kings, has found a home on Winnipeg's fourth line with Rasmus Kupari and Morgan Barron. Kupari is a former first-round pick of the Kings who spent his first three seasons in Los Angeles. The Jets welcomed back defenseman Ville Heinola on Monday after he missed 22 months while recovering from two ankle surgeries. He put two shots on goal and contributed a hit in 12:14 of ice time against the Wild. ""There were a lot of things that I liked,"" Jets coach Scott Arniel said of Heinola's play. ""He has patience and poise. We know that. Especially on the breakouts and things like that."" The Kings should be itching to get back on the ice after losing 7-2 to the host San Jose Sharks on Monday night. The score was tied 2-2 entering the third period, but the Kings surrendered three goals in the first four minutes. ""We completely fell apart in the third period,"" Kings coach Jim Hiller said. ""That's just unacceptable, what happened in the third. So we can talk about the first 40 (minutes), but it's washed away with that third period."" Two of the Sharks' five third-period goals came on the power play. The Kings have allowed 16 goals overall on their penalty kill, which is tied for fifth most in the NHL. ""We went through this at the beginning of the year,"" Hiller said. ""We took too many penalties. The coach doesn't have too many options but to take ice time away, that's basically it. We had got ahold of it pretty good; we've had a pretty good run of not giving up a lot of power plays. (On Monday), we were careless, but it just goes with our mindset, particularly in the third period."" Los Angeles will look to some of its most veteran players to help turn things around against Winnipeg. Anze Kopitar has 10 points (one goal, nine assists) in his past seven games.

Allocco forced overtime by making a 3-pointer with seven seconds remaining.  With the Fighting Irish ahead by one, Harper tossed a pass to Jeremiah Williams for an open corner 3 that made it 75-73 at the 2:53 mark. Rutgers poked the ball free and Jordan Derkack scored on the fast break for a two-possession game.   Notre Dame had no choice but to foul Rutgers, and Allocco drilled three 3-pointers in a 26-second span. The third, as he leaned into his defender, tied it at 84 with 15 seconds left.   But Irish freshman Cole Certa, unaware of the tie score, then fouled Harper, who sank 1 of 2 free throws. Notre Dame drew up one last look for Allocco, whose 3-pointer at the buzzer just missed.   Rutgers (5-1) will face No. 9 Alabama and Notre Dame (4-2) will take on No. 6 Houston on Wednesday before the championship day matchups can be set.   Harper had six rebounds, six assists and just one turnover in the highest-scoring game by any freshman this season. Derkack had 16 points, and Williams and Ace Bailey each scored 10 for Rutgers.   Notre Dame played most of the game without leading scorer Markus Burton, who hobbled off with a right leg injury less than four minutes in. Rutgers center Emmanuel Ogbole fell onto Burton's legs during a play for the ball.   Allocco stepped up. The only player for either team to play all 45 minutes, he finished with 24 points, six 3-pointers, 10 rebounds and five assists.

Shrewsberry countered with his third 3-pointer of the contest, igniting a 9-1 spurt for Notre Dame's biggest lead at 25-15.   Derkack scored eight points in the final 5:13 of the half, and his tough layup in the final minute cut Rutgers' halftime deficit to 35-34.

North Carolina (4-2), which rallied from down 21 points in the second half in its win over Dayton on Monday, cut the deficit to four points shortly before halftime. The Tigers went on a run from that point that carried over into the opening minutes of the second half, outscoring the Tar Heels 16-2. Auburn's lead swelled to as many as 19 points before North Carolina briefly threatened. Seth Trimble scored six of his team-high 17 points on back-to-back 3-pointers that pulled the Tar Heels within 75-66 with 3:17 to go, but they could get no closer. Denver Jones quickly snuffed out the rally attempt with a 3-pointer on the other end, part of his 10 points. Six Tigers scored in double figures, including Miles Kelly, who shot 3-for-7 from 3-point distance en route to 15 points.

Lankinen made 13 saves in the middle frame and another 11 in the third en route to his second shutout of the season. The 29-year-old goaltender was supported by a defense which blocked 26 shots. DeBrusk's game-winning goal against his former team marked his third tally in two games for Vancouver, which has now banked consecutive wins and won each of its last eight on the road. Conor Garland added an empty-net tally with 12.5 seconds left to finish with a goal and an assist. Jeremy Swayman stopped 13 of the 14 shots he faced for Boston, which was unable to stretch its win streak to three games for the first time this season and lost for the first time under interim coach Joe Sacco. The Bruins had a 32-15 edge in shots on goal but finished 0-for-3 on the power play compared to the Canucks' 1-for-2. DeBrusk gave the Canucks a 1-0 lead on a power-play goal at 5:53 of the second. Quinn Hughes had his shot from the high slot deflected off Conor Garland in front and right to DeBrusk at the right crease, where he corralled it and slid home the rebound on the backhand.

Stephen Curry hit seven 3-pointers to account for the majority of his 36 points when the Warriors found some extra energy at the end of a five-game road trip to thump the host Thunder 127-116 earlier this month. Two things figure to be different about the rematch 17 days later. Making his first start as a Warrior, De'Anthony Melton contributed 19 points and 10 rebounds, but Melton suffered a knee injury in his next game and likely won't play again this season. Meanwhile, the Thunder were playing their 10th game of 15 consecutive without big man Isaiah Hartenstein, a key offseason acquisition who began the season with a broken left hand. He made his Oklahoma City debut on Nov. 20 against the Portland Trail Blazers and has recorded double-doubles in a pair of Thunder wins, averaging 15.0 points and 12.0 rebounds.  The emergence of Hartenstein is a welcome addition for the Thunder, who are currently without Chet Holmgren, out with a pelvic fracture that occurred just over five minutes into the earlier Golden State game. ""We knew as a group and the world kinda knew there was a hole in us as a team last year,"" Oklahoma City star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said of the need for a powerful interior force to complement the young Holmgren. ""I think Isaiah fills that hole very well. (General manager) Sam (Presti) did a good job filling it."" Gilgeous-Alexander (65 points) and Jalen Williams (58) have joined with Hartenstein to lead the way during the two-game winning streak. They totaled only 44 points in the loss to the Warriors back on Nov. 10. Golden State enters Wednesday saddled with its first losing streak of the season. The Warriors blew a 17-point lead in a 104-94 loss against the San Antonio Spurs on Saturday, then watched an 18-point advantage slip away in a 128-120 home defeat at the hands of the Brooklyn Nets on Monday. The Warriors haven't won since clinching a quarterfinal berth in the NBA Cup with a win over the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday. Golden State coach Steve Kerr acknowledged after Monday's loss that his team could use a break, one it will get when getting Thanksgiving and Friday off before a short trip to Phoenix on Saturday. ""It's just, you can feel it,"" Kerr said. ""You can tell we had a lot more energy a couple weeks ago, so maybe it's just the schedule catching up to us a little bit. We know we got to find that energy again."" Both teams could be without key reserves for Wednesday's game. The Thunder's Alex Caruso has already been ruled out due to an ailing hip, while the Warriors' Jonathan Kuminga is questionable because of an illness. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Packers' Thanksgiving night home clash with the Miami Dolphins offers a chance to be equally efficient. Just don't expect Love to scale back his approach in the meeting of playoff contenders. ""I definitely am a guy who always wants those big plays, want to put that pressure on the defense and take some of those shots,"" Love said. Love threw for a season-low 163 yards on 13-of-23 passing to go with two touchdowns against the 49ers. Still, with Josh Jacobs (26 carries, 106 yards, three touchdowns) wreaking havoc in the running game, Love found opportunities to strike a balance. ""Those are the lessons that I had to learn last year and I'll continue to learn: just when the right time (is) to take those shots,"" he said. ""If guys get a step or we're in the right coverage versus just finding those completions. Because these check-downs and just finding those completions turn into big plays, as well, sometimes."" Green Bay (8-3) is third in the rugged NFC North but holds a two-game lead in the loss column for the No. 6 seed in the conference playoff race. Winners of three straight, the Dolphins (5-6) are 1 1/2 games behind the Denver Broncos for the seventh seed in the AFC. ""I think this is an awesome opportunity,"" Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa said. ""Being able to play Thursday night football, prime time on Thanksgiving."" Tagovailoa continues to surge since returning from injured reserve in Week 8. With four touchdown passes during a 34-15 home win against the New England Patriots on Sunday, he has 11 TDs through the air against just one interception in his five games back. Tagovailoa dismissed the notion that chilly temperatures in Green Bay on Thursday could be enough to cool him. The Hawaiian-born signal-caller is 0-7 when the temperature is 40 degrees or lower. ""To me, it's just a mindset,"" he said. ""That's really all there is."" Added Miami defensive coordinator Anthony Weaver: ""I've never lost a game and thought, 'Guys, it was too cold outside.'"" Miami boasts a versatile set of playmakers for Green Bay to defend. Running back De'Von Achane also is active in the passing game, as he made two touchdown receptions against New England. Among the Dolphins' receivers, wideouts Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle and tight end Jonnu Smith each have at least 41 receptions and 535 yards. The three have combined for nine TDs. Green Bay is hoping for another jolt from second-year linebacker Lukas Van Ness, whose strip-sack against the 49ers was the big play he said he needed for his confidence. It led to Jacobs' third TD.

Georgia Tech (2-3) is playing its sixth of a seven-game homestand. The Yellow Jackets fell at home to North Florida 103-95 on Nov. 10, before rebounding with a 19-point win over Texas Southern. Since then, Georgia Tech has dropped games to Georgia and Cincinnati, most recently an 81-58 defeat to the Bearcats on Saturday. Doryan Onwuchekwa's dunk in the opening minutes gave the Yellow Jackets their first and only lead, before Cincinnati pulled away for a 16-point halftime advantage. Georgia Tech trailed by double digits from the 6:17 mark of the first half on. ""From the jump, Cincinnati did a good job of bringing the game to us,"" Georgia Tech coach Damon Stoudamire said. ""I didn't think that we matched any of their energy. I thought we played hard in the first half in spurts, but we couldn't put enough good minutes together."" Georgia Tech got just five points apiece from its two leading scorers, Baye Ndongo (13.6 points per game) and Javian McCollum (12.8). Stoudamire's team is looking to sweep a pair of nonconference home contests this week, as Central Arkansas comes to Atlanta following Wednesday's game. The road will then become much more difficult, when the Yellow Jackets prepare for games at Oklahoma, at North Carolina and on a neutral court vs. Northwestern. Before then, the Buccaneers (1-6) try to improve on their 1-8 all-time record against Georgia Tech. Led by coach Saah Nimley, a former Charleston Southern player who grew up in nearby Lawrenceville, Ga., the Buccaneers are still searching for their first Division I win of the year. Wednesday marks their third power conference game of the year, following losses at Clemson and LSU. Last time out, the Buccaneers fell behind early in a 67-46 home loss to Furman. Senior Taje' Kelly, also an Atlanta native, leads the team with 14.1 points and 7.4 rebounds per game. Nimley knows that his group will go as far as Kelly takes them. ""(Taje's) perimeter skills have impressed me so much,"" Nimley said. ""His ability to put the ball on the floor in open space has come a long way from his first two years. His development in that area has impressed me the most."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Bruins (6-1) faced little resistance in their wire-to-wire win, staying perfect at home for the season and scoring their fifth consecutive victory overall. The first 13 minutes of the second half marked one of UCLA's stingiest defensive stretches of the campaign, as the hosts allowed Southern Utah just four points. The Thunderbirds (6-2) struggled to mount any offensive attack while repeatedly coughing up possession against an aggressive Bruins defense. UCLA converted Southern Utah's turnovers into 34 points. Skyy Clark and Trent Perry led the Bruins with three steals each, while Eric Dailey Jr. and Sebastian Mack each swiped two. Aday Mara contributed to the defensive effort with three blocked shots. Mara also grabbed a game-high eight rebounds off the bench. Mara's dunk off of a lob from Dailey was part of a 12-2 UCLA run midway through the first half that effectively ignited the onslaught. That spell opened up a 13-point lead, and UCLA almost doubled the margin before halftime. The Bruins held Southern Utah without a field goal for a stretch of almost six minutes late in the first half -- and then the Thunderbirds had an 8:20 field-goal drought early in the second half. Xavier Sykes led Southern Utah with 10 points on 4-of-6 shooting from the floor. He hit 2 of 3 from 3-point range on a night the rest of the Thunderbirds went just 2 of 13. All 12 UCLA players who saw the court made a field goal. Dailey shot 6-for-8 from the floor for 15 points, and Dylan Andrews finished 5-of-8 for 11 points. Perry added nine points, five rebounds and a game-high five assists. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Villanova allowed Maryland to go 17-for-29 (58.6 percent) from the field in the second half. At the other end of the floor, Dixon poured in a career-high 38 points on 15-of-29 shooting overall, but the rest of his team went 14-for-33 (42.4 percent). After missing the season opener, Dixon is now the nation's second-leading scorer at 26.7 points per game; that's more than one-third of Villanova's 79.2 ppg over the past six games.  The Wildcats have also lost to Columbia, Saint Joseph's and Virginia this month as coach Kyle Neptune's seat grows hotter. ""Everybody has their adversity, every team -- even teams that are 6- and 7-0, everybody's going through something,"" Dixon told the Philadelphia Inquirer. ""That's no different for us. This just happens to be our adversity. We're trying to keep coming back every single day and trying to figure it out."" Villanova is allowing opponents to shoot 43.9 percent from the floor and ranks No. 120 in KenPom defensive efficiency as of Tuesday. Against Rider (4-2), the Wildcats will be facing a team with four true road wins at San Diego, Coppin State, Navy and Bucknell. In fact, the Broncs have yet to play at home this season. On Saturday at Bucknell, Tariq Ingraham collected 14 points and nine rebounds and T.J. Weeks Jr. added 12 points and six boards despite getting a cut that needed five stitches during the game. ""It takes everything you have,"" Rider coach Kevin Baggett told the Trentonian. ""The coaching, the players, everybody has got to be on one page, everybody has got to be together. There are a lot of highs and lows in a game. It takes togetherness, and that experience, we're learning now."" Rider's two losses came to power-conference foes UCLA, 85-50, and Iowa, 83-58.

The Knights (4-2) look to end a two-game skid on Wednesday night when they host Horizon League preseason co-favorite University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (5-2). The two schools will be meeting for the first time since the 1990-91 season. UCF dropped a pair of Mountain Division contests at the inaugural Greenbrier Tip-Off, including Sunday's 109-102 triple-overtime loss to LSU in the third-place game. It was UCF's first triple-overtime game in nearly a decade. It marked the sixth triple-overtime contest in UCF history, and the first since 2015 when the Knights beat Tulane 103-100. The Knights led by as many as 18 points in the second half before LSU rallied and eventually outscored them in the third OT. Senior guard Darius Johnson and transfers Keyshawn Hall and Jordan Ivy-Curry continue to pace a balanced UCF offense. However, the Knights entered Tuesday ranked in a tie for 329th in the NCAA in scoring defense (81.2 points per game). ""We learned (at the Greenbrier event) that we can be pretty good. But we have to do some things right on the court, offensively and defensively, to get that done,"" head coach Johnny Dawkins said. Milwaukee visits Addition Financial Arena in Orlando riding a four-game win streak. ""UCF's really talented."" Panthers head coach Bart Lundy said. ""They've been up and down; I think they're still figuring themselves out.

With 15.7 seconds left, Cal Baptist's Dominique Daniels Jr. beat Matt Cross on a dribble and drove for a game-tying layup. But coming out of a timeout, and against the Lancers' zone, Miller answered promptly, driving for the go-ahead shot. Miller scored 16 points for SMU (5-2), shooting 6-for-14 from the floor. B.J. Edwards tallied a team-high 17 points for the Mustangs, who earned their first single-digit victory of the season. SMU shot 52.7 percent from the field. Kendal Coleman, who had 15 points as part of a 20-4 run that tied the score midway through the second half, led Cal Baptist (4-3) with a career-high 32 points. He shot 12-for-16 from the field, 6-for-8 from 3-point range, and added six rebounds. The Lancers pushed SMU to the brink over the final 20 minutes, overcoming a 13-point halftime deficit to tie the score at 54-54 with 11:13 to play. Coleman's stellar shooting kept Cal Baptist stride-for-stride from that point on, as the game was tied six more times down the stretch. With SMU up 75-73 and just over a minute left, Edwards passed up a 3-point shot from the right corner, and instead dribbled forward for a mid-range shot, converting on a jumper that put the Mustangs up by four. But Cal Baptist answered with a 4-0 spurt, capped by Daniels' tying layup, ahead of Miller's late-game heroics. SMU opened the game on a 10-4 run, highlighted by Edwards' fastbreak layup, but Cal Baptist soon knotted the score at 10-10. The Mustangs answered in the form of a 14-3 spurt and seized the game's first double-digit lead on Miller's offensive rebound and putback. While Cal Baptist eventually cut the lead to three on a pair of Bradey Henige layups, SMU closed the half on an 11-4 run. The Mustangs took a 45-32 lead into the intermission after Chuck Harris scored on back-to-back drives to the lane in the final minute.

The left-handed pitcher announced the agreement via Instagram on Tuesday night, and terms of the contract were reported by multiple media outlets. The deal is pending a physical, according to ESPN. Snell will join a Dodgers team that beat the New York Yankees in five games to win the World Series back in October. On Nov. 1, Snell opted out of the second year of his contract with the Giants. Snell, 31, had signed a two-year deal with San Francisco that would have paid him $38.5 million in 2025. After a rough start to the 2024 season that included two trips to the injured list, Snell returned in July and impressed down the stretch. He struck out 114 batters on his way to a 1.23 ERA over his final 14 starts of the year, which included his first career no-hitter on Aug. 2 against the Cincinnati Reds. Snell won his first Cy Young Award with the Tampa Bay Rays in 2018 and added another with the San Diego Padres in 2023.

Marquette, 6-0 for the first time since 2011-12, is coming off an 80-69 victory over Georgia on Saturday in the Bahamas. The Golden Eagles' victory versus the Bulldogs came after a win earlier in the week against previously undefeated Purdue, which then dropped seven spots to No. 13. David Joplin netted a career-high 29 points to help Marquette hand Georgia its first loss of the season. The Golden Eagles led by just one at the break, but opened the second half with a 19-5 run. Georgia rallied within 69-66 with just less than five minutes left, but Marquette answered with a nine-point run to put the game away. The Golden Eagles shot 59.3 percent in the second half, including 6-of-12 beyond the arc. Marquette has four players scoring in double figures, led by guard Kam Jones, who averages 20.5 points per game. Joplin adds 15.2 points and a team-best 6.3 rebounds. Chase Ross tallies 13.2 points and Stevie Mitchell supplies 12.5. Marquette averages 81.3 points per game, allowing 64.7. The Golden Eagles have been outrebounded by 1.3 per game, but offset that with a plus-8.3 turnover margin.  As of Tuesday, Marquette ranked fourth in the nation with 12.2 steals per game, with Ross third in Division I with 3.5 per contest. ""He's a playmaker, Chase, on the defensive end,"" Marquette coach Shaka Smart said after the Georgia game. ""I think it's a fine line that he's continuing to learn. Between taking maybe reckless chances and taking the right chances. ""But Chase is better (at) that than me or anyone else coaching our team or following our team. So, we're going to continue letting him develop that feel because he's excellent at it."" Stonehill (4-4) made the jump to Division I in 2022, joining the Northeast Conference. The Skyhawks were 4-27 last season, including lopsided losses to UConn and Kentucky and a one-point defeat at Rutgers. Stonehill's last three games have been decided by a total of four points, splitting a pair of one-point decisions before defeating East Texas A&M 67-65 on Monday by hitting four free throws in the final three seconds. Todd Brogna hit the tying foul shots for the Skyhawks before Chas Stinson hit the game-winning pair after a steal. Brogna averages 13.0 points along with team-high 6.8 rebounds per game, while Stinson chips in 7.3 points. Graduate transfer Josh Morgan leads Stonehill in scoring with 15.4 points per game. Two of the Skyhawks' losses this season were on the road at Notre Dame, 89-60, and Providence, 76-49. Last Thursday, Stonehill defeated Bryant, a team that averages 85.4 points per game, 67-66. ""I'm impressed and proud with our group,"" Skyhawks coach Chris Kraus said afterward. ""Our group is growing, learning day by day, week by week, game by game. We've got guys that haven't played a lot of college minutes."" Stonehill averages 66.1 points per game, allowing 68.8. The Skyhawks shoot 38.5 percent from 3-point range but just 38.7 percent overall. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo, who leads the NBA in scoring (32.4 points per game), missed the game due to swelling in his left knee. In addition, three-time Bucks All-Star Khris Middleton has yet to play this season due to surgery on both of his ankles. The Bucks, who are 3-0 in East Group B in the NBA Cup, never trailed in the game. Miami, 1-2 in East Group B, was led by Jimmy Butler's 23 points. Tyler Herro added 18. Heat guard Terry Rozier returned after missing two games due to an injury to his right foot. He finished with 17 points on 7-of-9 shooting, including 3-of-4 from deep. Milwaukee, thanks to 17 points from Lillard, led 31-20 after the first quarter. Lillard made his first four 3-point attempts, and the Bucks shot 55 percent from the floor for the quarter. Lillard scored eight points in the second quarter as the Bucks stretched their halftime lead to 65-51. Miami shot 56.2 percent in the second quarter, but Milwaukee was even better (59.1 percent). In the third quarter, Milwaukee stretched its lead to 22 points. But Miami made a comeback, cutting the deficit to 85-80 by the end of the period. Lillard had 10 points in the third, but Milwaukee cooled off overall, shooting 46.2 percent. Miami finally caught Milwaukee at 96-96 on a Butler layup with 4:02 left in the game. In the final minute, the Bucks, leading 104-103, seemed to get a 3-pointer by AJ Green. However, the shot was delivered just after the 24-second clock expired. That turnover occurred with five seconds left. Miami then had a shot to take its first lead of the game, but Herro's open 3-point attempt from the top of the key rimmed out. Milwaukee's Taurean Prince grabbed the rebound and made two free throws for a 106-103 lead with 1.2 seconds left. Miami then tried to send the game to overtime, but Rozier missed a 3-point attempt at the buzzer, ending the game. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Tigers (5-1) are coming off a 112-63 win over Arkansas-Pine Bluff on Sunday. It marked the third straight game that Missouri won by 35-plus points, and it was also the fourth time in the past five games that Missouri won by 15 or more. A daunting test against No. 1 Kansas awaits three games from now, but first the Tigers will look to fine-tune their performance against Lindenwood (2-4), an in-state foe whose campus is outside of St. Louis in St. Charles, Mo. Missouri guard Caleb Grill is eager to stay hot after scoring 14 points off the bench on Sunday. He went 5-for-9 from the field and 4-for-8 from 3-point range. Grill leads the team with 15.5 points per game. He is shooting 58.8 percent overall and 55.3 percent from beyond the arc. ""I think his teammates are finding him, but he's not even focused on that,"" Missouri coach Dennis Gates said of Grill. ""He's focused on the defensive end. When you have a guy who hunts for basketballs the way he does, whether it's a loose ball or rebound ... that means his heart is in the right place."" Three other Missouri players have scoring averages in double figures -- Tamar Bates (13.0 points per game), Mark Mitchell (12.3) and Anthony Robinson II (10.3). Lindenwood is led by Jadis Jones, who is averaging 12.5 points and 6.8 rebounds. Teammate Anias Futrell is not far behind with 12.3 points and 6.0 rebounds per game, and Markeith Browning II is also scoring in double digits with 11.7 ppg. Jones was named Ohio Valley Conference Freshman of the Week on Monday. He set a career high with 17 points and also grabbed nine rebounds in his most recent game, a 77-64 loss against Valparaiso. ""His character and mentality for the game of basketball align with everything we are trying to build at Lindenwood,"" Lions coach Kyle Gerdeman said of Jones this past spring. ""I think the belief he has shown in our program speaks volumes for the direction we are heading."" This is the second all-time meeting between the schools.

Harding assisted on both plays as the Hawkeyes collected 14 assists on 22 made baskets before the break. Iowa's Seydou Traore left the game midway through the first half after sustaining an apparent right ankle injury. Hawkeyes staff assisted the forward off the floor as Traore was unable to put weight on his foot. A Harris trey with 15:48 to go in the first half finally put South Carolina Upstate on the board.

Lankinen made 13 saves in the middle frame and another 11 in the third en route to his second shutout of the season. The 29-year-old goaltender was supported by a defense which blocked 26 shots. DeBrusk's game-winning goal against his former team marked his third tally in two games for Vancouver, which has now banked consecutive wins and won each of its last eight on the road. Conor Garland added an empty-net tally with 12.5 seconds left to finish with a goal and an assist. Jeremy Swayman stopped 13 of the 14 shots he faced for Boston, which was unable to stretch its win streak to three games for the first time this season and lost for the first time under interim coach Joe Sacco. The Bruins had a 32-15 edge in shots on goal, but finished 0-for-3 on the power play compared to the Canucks' 1-for-2. DeBrusk gave the Canucks a 1-0 lead on a power-play goal at 5:53 of the second. Quinn Hughes had his shot from the high slot deflected off Conor Garland in front and right to DeBrusk at the right crease, where he corralled it and slid home the rebound on the backhand. Lankinen held strong during the final frame, diving back to cover up a loose puck as Marc McLaughlin set up Trent Frederic for a redirect on the doorstep with 14:09 left remaining. He later stopped Zacha point-blank during the first of two Boston man advantages in the period.

Jayden Struble and Alex Newhook scored and Sam Montembeault made 26 saves for the Canadiens in the finale of their four-game homestand (2-1-1). Utah went on its fourth power play of the game at 4:18 of the second period, but it was Canadiens forward Christian Dvorak who hit the crossbar on a short-handed breakaway. Five seconds after the power play ended, Schmaltz passed the puck out from behind the Montreal net to Clayton Keller against the side wall. He spotted Guenther calling for the puck in the left circle and Guenther scored with a one-timer for his 10th goal of the season in his 100th NHL game. The lead didn't last long. Utah tried to clear the puck, but defenseman David Savard gloved it down at the blue line and passed it to Cole Caufield, who found Struble near the blue line. Struble had room to skate into the high slot with the puck and beat Vejmelka over his left shoulder with a wrist shot, tying it 1-1 at 8:05 of the second and giving him goals in back-to-back games after the defenseman went the first 14 games without scoring. The Canadiens scored 46 seconds into the third period to move ahead 2-1. Dvorak chased down a dump-in and centered the puck from below the goal line. The puck hit Vejmelka in the skate and caromed into the crease, where Newhook lifted it into the net.

Vegas dropped the first game of the trip but has reeled off three straight wins, including a 5-4 shootout victory at Philadelphia on Monday night. The Golden Knights trailed 3-0 in the second period and pulled even at 4-4 with 8:05 left in regulation before completing the comeback in one-on-ones. ""At the end of the day, it's 3-0, and it's easy to sort of say, ‘Let's move on and get ready for the next one,'"" Vegas coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""The guys dug in. I didn't think we were far behind with our ability to catch up. We have goal-scorers in the room. ... It was a game we were way too loose to expect to win anything playing like that. Some nights over the course of 82, those happen. We were able to come out on the right side."" Both Jack Eichel and Ivan Barbashev paired a goal with an assist for the Golden Knights, who played without William Karlsson (personal reasons) and Zach Whitecloud, who is day-to-day with an upper-body injury. Vegas has won five of its last seven despite also missing captain Mark Stone due to a lower-body injury. Stone, who was placed on injured reserve last week, has been out the last nine games. The Golden Knights have gotten help from winger Callahan Burke, who was recalled before the 3-0 loss to Toronto in the opener of the road trip last Wednesday. The 27-year-old Burke, who had played three NHL games before the recall -- two of those with Colorado in the 2022-23 season -- has a goal and is averaging 11:31 of ice time in four games this season. The Avalanche had a chance for a perfect road trip but had a clunker at Tampa Bay on Monday night. Colorado had won six of seven, including the first three on the road, before dropping an 8-2 decision to the Lightning. ""I thought we had a great road trip. It just sucks it ended like this,"" Avalanche center Nathan MacKinnon said. ""Everything went in and we couldn't do anything to stop it."" The goaltending was an issue again. Justus Annunen started the game but was pulled after giving up three quick goals. He returned to start the third period and allowed two more on the first two shots he faced. In between, Alexandar Georgiev wasn't much better and smashed his stick over the crossbar after a goal. ""Listen, they're frustrated,"" coach Jared Bednar said. ""Probably upset with themselves, one another, everyone. I don't blame them for having emotion and not liking the way the game was going."" Georgiev, who has been strong in net after a rough start to the season, will likely get the start in the second game against Vegas. The Golden Knights beat Georgiev and the Avs 8-4 in the season opener in Las Vegas. Colorado had played well before Tampa, in part because it got healthier. Valeri Nichushkin (suspension), Jonathan Drouin (upper body) and Miles Wood (upper body) returned to add depth to the strong first line. The Avalanche had been winning even without MacKinnon, their leading scorer (35 points), producing much. He has just two assists in the last five games after tallying 15 in the previous seven. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""I think our bench can play better. ... I know they can give us more and we're going to need more from them (vs. the Wolverines)."" Michigan (5-1) beat Virginia Tech 75-63 in the first semifinal on Monday with a boost from Roddy Gayle Jr.'s 20 points. The Wolverines overcame a small deficit in the second half. Gayle has given Michigan a lift at times. ""Roddy is stringing together some consistency,"" coach Dusty May said. ""He has been awesome in practice. He's a great leader, and when he speaks, his teammates listen, because he's about the team. And he deserves the success."" Michigan has tried to find diversity on offense because the team is prone to attempt lots of 3-point shots. The Wolverines' ability to work for other looks against Virginia Tech was notable. ""I still don't think we converted as well as we're going to in the future around the rim, but credit our guards, our bigs did a nice job of long roll and putting pressure, and our guards found them several times,"" May said. ""Credit for that camaraderie and teamwork."" Michigan post player Danny Wolf has had three games with 10 or more rebounds. Still, there's an emphasis on better rebounding overall from the team. ""We shouldn't be getting outrebounded by these teams. We all know that,"" May said. ""But sometimes it's quickness, sometimes we're in different positions than we've been. But overall we have a group that wants to get better and they compete at a high level. It's not bad for us to have that in our locker room as a little bit of a care for motivation."" For Xavier, Miller said he saw better commitment to teamwork in the South Carolina game. ""We don't need everybody on our team auditioning to have a 20-point game,"" Miller said. ""We need balance. We need to know: 'This is our role.'"" Zach Freemantle led the Musketeers in both scoring (16) and rebounding (nine) against the Gamecocks. Dailyn Swain also stood out with 14 points, six rebounds and five steals. Michigan had a big fan turnout for the semifinal. There are plenty of ties to Florida for the team, particularly with May coaching at Florida Atlantic prior to this season. ""Wolverine Nation, they turned this into a home game,"" May said after the semifinal. ""A couple of the workers outside said that they felt like this was the best crowd they have seen, and they've had some schools that really travel well in this event."" But Xavier tends to have rabid basketball fans, and that should make for an electric atmosphere for the tournament final. The Musketeers fed off that in the South Carolina game. ""We have a great crowd that travels wherever we go and I'm thankful,"" Freemantle said. Michigan and Xavier have a common opponent in Wake Forest. Michigan fell 72-70 to the Demon Deacons at a neutral court not far from Wake Forest's campus, while Xavier won a home game against Wake, 75-60. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Tyon Grant-Foster contributed eight points, eight rebounds, five assists and three blocks as Grand Canyon (4-2) won its second consecutive game.

Raynaud sank a jumper to get Stanford within 64-60 with 3:57 to play, but he failed to complete a three-point play by missing a free throw. Coles followed by hitting a jumper, and after a Stanford miss, Williams dropped in two foul shots, making it an eight-point game with 2:52 left. Stanford's Jaylen Blakes made the game's only two field goals after that -- including a three-point play with 11 seconds remaining -- but it wasn't nearly enough to offset 10-for-12 free throw shooting by Grand Canyon down the stretch.

Washington's Jordan Poole sat out his second straight game due to left hip flexor soreness. Kyshawn George drained a 3-pointer to stake the Wizards to a 39-36 lead midway through the second quarter before Chicago ignited a 25-8 run to end the half. White scored seven points during that final spurt for the Bulls. Chicago kept its foot on the gas to begin the third quarter, with White and LaVine each sinking a 3-pointer while LaVine's driving layup capped their team's 16-9 run to push the Bulls' lead to 77-56. Washington slowly chipped away at its deficit, with Sarr's 3-pointer cutting Chicago's lead to 101-90 in the fourth quarter. The Bulls responded with a quick flourish, as Julian Phillips converted a three-point play and Smith added a hook shot. The Wizards did not seriously threaten the rest of the way. Kuzma scored 15 points in the first quarter to propel Washington to a 29-21 lead. The Wizards scored 16 points in the paint and benefited from Chicago's paltry 1-for-13 shooting performance from the arc. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Florida State (7-1) continued to gain early-season momentum as it won its fourth game in a row. It is the Seminoles' best start since the 2019-20 season. Western Carolina (2-3) dropped its second in a row as it continues a difficult road stretch. The Seminoles never trailed in the game and finished with 11 players scoring points and six players scoring eight or more points. Brandon Morgan totaled 13 points and had two assists to lead the Catamounts. Ice Emery and Cord Stansberry each totaled 10 points and three rebounds. Jamir Watkins continued his prolific start to the season with 14 points, four assists and three rebounds. Watkins helped Florida State gain a significant edge throughout the game with solid outside shooting as he made 4 of 6 three-pointers. Malique Ewin, who has come on strong for Florida State in recent games, continued his stellar play with 12 points and four rebounds in only 18 minutes. Ewin scored 10 of the Seminoles' first 12 points and keyed a 16-3 run to open the game, which put them comfortably ahead quickly. The Catamounts were able to cut the deficit to seven with 10:14 left in the first half and then eight with 8:06 left. But Florida State would score nine consecutive points to break the game open. Bostyn Holt had nine points and Chandler Jackson had eight as the Seminoles shot a staggering 57.4 percent (31 for 54) from the field and made 9 of 21 3-pointers. Western Carolina made eight triples, but shot only 8 of 36 from that range. Florida State will next travel to Baton Rouge, La. to take on LSU next Tuesday as part of the ACC-SEC Challenge. Western Carolina will take on an even bigger challenge on Saturday when it hits the road to face No. 10 Marquette. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Raptors are 0-10 on the road and have lost nine of their past 11 games overall. The Pelicans have lost five in a row and 11 of their past 12. Both teams have been in position to win recently but have come up short. Toronto had an eight-point lead entering the fourth quarter before losing to the Detroit Pistons, 102-100, on Monday night. The Pelicans have lost by four points in each of their past two games, the most recent being a 114-110 setback against the Indiana Pacers on Monday. ""We played really hard and we put ourselves in position to win the game,"" Raptors coach Darko Rajakovic said. ""We've got to do a better job of executing down the stretch and converting our offense and getting stops at the end."" Toronto took 28 more shots than Detroit (104-76) but made just 39.4 percent of them. ""(The disparity in field-goal attempts) should put you in a pretty good situation to win the game,"" Rajakovic said, ""but we just did not convert at a high enough level. I thought we did a very good job of moving the ball and doing a lot of good stuff. We've just got to make shots."" Three of the Raptors' past four losses have been by four points or fewer, and the setback against the Pistons came on a buzzer-beating basket by Jaden Ivey. ""You need to ... embrace the moment, to embrace competing, embrace when the game is on the line and to learn what it takes to win in those situations,"" Rajakovic said. Toronto, the only NBA team that has not won away from home this season, has tied the franchise record for consecutive road losses to begin a campaign, matching the 1997-98 team, but it is facing a Pelicans team that is struggling as much as the Raptors are. New Orleans, though, has gotten a lift from recently signed point guard Elfrid Payton, who had a career-high 21 assists, the most by any NBA player this season, against the Pacers. ""He was fantastic,"" Pelicans coach Willie Green said of Payton. ""He's a big-time player. He makes your team better when he steps on the floor. He's scrappy, he's sound, he can guard. I'm really, really grateful to have him with our group."" The Pelicans, like the Raptors, have had to endure an inordinate number of injuries, but guard CJ McCollum played on Monday night -- his first appearance since Oct. 29. He overcame a slow start to score 23 points. ""(We missed) his ability to create for himself and for his teammates offensively,"" Green said of McCollum. ""He's just solid. We'll need more of that from him."" The backcourt could get another boost on Wednesday, as the Pelicans expect starting guard Dejounte Murray to play for the first time since suffering a fractured left hand in the team's season opener.  ""We need to continue to stay together, which our guys are doing a great job of,"" Green said. ""Eventually, we will overcome this situation and we will be better for it in the long run."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Thomas Sorber stuffed the stat sheet with nine points, seven rebounds, six assists and three blocks as Georgetown (5-1) won its third straight game. Wagner (3-4), which is coming off its first trip to the NCAA Tournament in 21 years, was no match for the physicality of the Hoyas as it failed to score during an 11-minute stretch that bridged the halves. The Seahawks shot 28 percent from the floor and made 7 of 19 attempts (36.8 percent) from 3-point range. They committed 18 turnovers, compared to 11 for the Hoyas. Javier Ezquerra tallied eight points and four assists while Keyontae Lewis, Zaire Williams and RJ Greene each added seven points for Wagner. Lewis pulled down a game-high eight rebounds. The contest was tight for most of the first half. However, after the Hoyas scored the final five points of the first half, they followed with the first 18 of the second period to take a 46-20 lead with 12:34 left. The 23-0 run was bookended by 3-pointers from Peavy. In between, Peavy added another trey and Drew Fielder added back-to-back baskets including a two-fisted, fastbreak slam. Fielder finished with eight points, making all four of his shots from the floor. Georgetown connected on 43.1 percent of its shots from the floor and 7 of 22 (31.8 percent) from distance. In the first half, there were eight lead changes over the first 13 minutes before Georgetown began to seize control. After the Hoyas struggled in the slow-paced opening minutes, Mack provided a spark midway through the first half, making a four-point play. Then when the Hoyas closed the half on a 14-5 run, Mack provided six of the points. To close the half, Mack split defenders with a drive down the middle of the lane to give the Hoyas their biggest lead of the period, 28-20. In the second half, Georgetown maxed out its advantage when Jordan Burks scored on an alley-oop slam for 36-point lead. Burks finished with 10 points off the bench. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Although Kentucky led for most of the game after trailing 5-2 in the opening moments, Western Kentucky kept it to a single-digit deficit for parts of the second half. Julius Thedford's fastbreak bucket and foul shot with 11:54 remaining cut Kentucky's lead to 57-51.

Camwood Capital Management Group, which was founded by Mayfield's father, is the defendant in the case.  According to the lawsuit, Camwood Capital transferred over $12.2 million from Mayfield and his wife ""without authorization"" for years (2018-21).

Texas Contracting Manufacturing Group, Unitech Tool & Machine, Apex Machining and Lor-Van Manufacturing join Camwood Capital on the defense.

That included giving up 95 points to Youngstown State in a double-overtime win on Nov. 16. ""I thought we made a jump defensively,"" Autry said.

Now they face Cornell (4-2), who hasn't played a power conference opponent so far this season.

Dallas held a 3-1 lead after the second period, but surrendered three goals in the first 8:09 of the third and two more in the final 2:07. ""Next one's always big after a loss,"" Dallas forward Jamie Benn said. ""Obviously, we want to end this road trip with a win."" The Blackhawks are coming off a 3-2 overtime loss at the Philadelphia Flyers on Saturday. Chicago squandered a 2-0 lead heading into the third period before giving up the game-winner 1:06 into overtime. The Blackhawks fell to 6-1-2 when leading after two periods. Chicago defenseman Alec Martinez, who won two Stanley Cup titles with the Los Angeles Kings and another with the Vegas Golden Knights, said confidence plays a big role in holding leads. ""If you have experience where you've held those leads and been successful in that, then you fall back on your experience,"" Martinez told the Chicago Sun-Times. ""There's a knowing that, ‘We're going to get this job done.' It's a process. Every team goes through it."" Martinez said players also need to walk that fine line between attacking and playing with caution when holding a lead. ""You've got to keep attacking,"" he said. ""If you just sit back and allow them to enter the zone, you increase the sample size. You give them more zone time and the odds are further and further stacked against you."" Chicago coach Luke Richardson agrees that holding a lead is all about puck management and staying out of your own zone as much as possible. ""Eventually, it's too much and it wears out all your good energy playing defense (rather) than creating offense, which is part of our problem offensively,"" Richardson said. The Stars hope to reignite a power-play unit that is just 1-for-15 in its past six games, causing it to drop to 25th in the NHL in efficiency (16.1 percent). Dallas ranked sixth on the power play last season at 24.2 percent. ""It starts with breakouts,"" Stars forward Tyler Seguin said of improving the power play. ""More pucks to the net, for sure."" Even more discouraging for the Dallas special teams, the Stars' penalty kill gave up one short-handed goal against Carolina and two power-play goals. ""I liked most of our 5-on-5 game all night, but the special teams were a disaster,"" Stars coach Pete DeBoer said. ""(One) short-handed goal, two power play goals by them. You're not going to win if your special teams look like that."" If the Stars can find success in Chicago, they can look forward to a busy December schedule that includes nine home games and five on the road. Dallas has been much better in Its arena this season, going 8-2-0 compared to 5-5-0 on the road. ""We've got to go out and execute,"" Benn said. ""The power play can make a big difference on the road. We just need to go out there with the confidence to make a difference in the game."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Morgan Frost had a goal and an assist and Ivan Fedotov made 26 saves for Philadelphia, which lost for the third time in four games on Monday (1-2-1). Rookie right winger Matvei Michkov scored his eighth goal of the season as the Flyers finished 2-2-1 on a five-game homestand. ""One of our better showings in the offensive zone as far as puck movement and people moving without it,"" Philadelphia coach John Tortorella said. ""Take out seven or eight minutes, it's a really good game by us. But that's a really good team. They'll capitalize."" For Frost, it was just his second goal of the season and his sixth assist. ""It's nice to contribute, for sure. It's been a struggle in that area for me,"" Frost said. ""It was nice to contribute there and hopefully keep building on it and contribute more going offensively."" Sean Couturier has scored goals in back-to-back games for the Flyers and Travis Konecny has posted points in nine of the last 10 games (six goals, 10 assists). The Predators have alternated wins and losses in their last four games and have lost five of seven overall (2-3-2). Filip Forsberg and Zachary L'Heureux scored against the Devils, but Juuse Saros was pulled after allowing four goals on 30 shots in the first two periods. Scott Wedgewood stopped all 15 shots he faced in relief. ""I thought (the Devils) were faster, they won more battles and they were just a better team for 60 minutes,"" Predators captain Roman Josi said. ""We had a little bit of a push in the third, but it was way too late. We've been talking about it -- we have one good game and we fall back to a bad game, and we're not in a position to do that. We need to find consistency."" L'Heureux, Nashville's first-round pick (No. 27 overall) in the 2021 draft, pulled the Predators within 4-2 early in the third period, scoring his second goal of the season with a backhander on a breakaway. ""He's been great,"" Josi said of L'Heureux. ""He has a lot of energy. Obviously, scores a nice goal. And just in general, gets on the forecheck, he gets pucks back, he's hard to play against. So, he's been great."" Nashville was 0-for-5 on the power play after scoring on three of eight chances over the previous three games. Prior to Monday's game, the Predators acquired the New York Rangers' fourth-round pick in the 2027 NHL Draft from the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for forward Philip Tomasino, Nashville's first-round pick (24th overall) in 2019. Tomasino had one assist in 11 games this season for the Predators. Nashville forward Michael McCarron (upper-body, day-to-day) did not play Monday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

But both clubs have given their fans reason to believe aga,"Neither the Detroit Pistons nor the Memphis Grizzlies had their desired seasons a year ago. But both clubs have given their fans reason to believe again ahead of Wednesday's matchup in Detroit. Detroit is coming off a franchise-worst 14-68 campaign that saw it lose a single-season NBA record 28 straight games. The Pistons, led by first-year head coach J.B. Bickerstaff, have already won eight games this year, a total they didn't reach until Feb. 8 last year. The Grizzlies, who were on the heels of three straight postseason appearances, lost 55 games last year, much due to superstar Ja Morant playing only nine games due to a suspension and season-ending shoulder injury. Memphis appears to have returned to form this season, owning the fifth-best record in the Western Conference. The Pistons enter play following Monday's 102-100 home win over the Toronto Raptors, clinched with Jaden Ivey's buzzer-beating midrange jumper. Ivey led Detroit, which outscored Toronto 30-20 in the fourth quarter, with 25 points and eight assists. ""When (Jaden) has the ball in his hands in space, there aren't too many guys who can stay in front of him in the league. I don't care who it is, or how good you are defensively,"" Bickerstaff said. ""I thought he did a great job, obviously, getting to that spot. Those are shots that he works on."" Ivey's 18.4 points per game rank second on the team, behind Cade Cunningham's 23.5. Memphis, currently winners of three in a row, is vying for its longest win streak of the early season. Monday saw the Grizzlies go wire-to-wire in a 123-98 home win over the Portland Trail Blazers. Morant, who had missed eight straight games due to a hip injury, returned in style, logging 22 points and 11 assists in just 23 minutes.  ""(Ja) worked his tail off throughout the return to play process,"" Memphis head coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""He missed being out there, but even his engagement when he's out is great. You all don't get to see the work that he's putting in, but this past week was some of the best work I'd seen from him. ... He loves the game. He put in the work and this is no shock to see the impact he made in his first game back."" In nine games this year, Morant is averaging 20.8 points per game. Jaren Jackson Jr. leads Memphis with 22.8 per contest, and chipped in 21 points, six boards and three blocks in Monday's win. The Grizzlies also got 13 points and a season-high 17 rebounds off the bench from Santi Aldama, who's averaging career highs of 12.7 points and 7.8 boards per game. ""With Santi, I just love the effort,"" Jenkins said. ""That's something that we're challenging him with every single day. He had seven offensive rebounds (against Portland), and that's huge. That's an instinctual part of his game that aids us when we can create second chance opportunities."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Lightning coach Jon Cooper had been openly critical of his team's overpassing and highlight-reel setups over two winless games (0-1-1), but he surely had no problem Monday when the puck found its way onto the stick of Brandon Hagel. Known more for his speed and scoring, Hagel set a franchise record with four assists in the first period -- tying an NHL record for that total in an opening frame --in his club's 8-2 rout of the Avalanche. Then he added a fifth helper on the second's lone goal, a snipe by Brayden Point for his team-leading seventh on the power play. The five assists for a game matched the franchise mark held by Mark Recchi, Martin St. Louis and teammate Darren Raddysh. And the best compliment of them all? ""I think (Nikita Kucherov) asked if I was Bobby Orr after the first period, and I'm far from it. But I'll take that,"" Hagel said after the Atlantic Division team matched its high mark for goals scored this year. In all, it was a dazzling display by Tampa Bay, which moved to 4-1-1 in its past six games but had recently stumbled. Nick Perbix, Jake Guentzel and Kucherov all scored in the game's first 10:03, chasing starting goaltender Justus Annunen as the Colorado crease became a netminding turnstile. Alexandar Georgiev allowed three more before the coaching staff decided it needed to rest him. Then Annunen returned and yielded third-period goals to Guentzel and Michael Eyssimont. The Lightning were without Nick Paul for the third straight game. Cooper said at morning skate the club would be without the productive forward for the rest of the week. Down in South Florida, the Washington Capitals showed they could actually win without one of the game's premier scorers, Alex Ovechkin (broken leg). Goaltender Logan Thompson was stellar in net with 20 saves to improve to 9-1-1, while Lars Eller scored twice and Jakob Chychrun posted a goal and two assists as Washington handed the Florida Panthers their sixth defeat in seven games, 4-1 in Sunrise. Washington dictated play most of the night, as it hemmed the defending Stanley Cup champions into their own end by being one step ahead and relentless on the puck, constantly keeping pressure on Florida goalie Spencer Knight. That eventually paid off with the power-play goal from Chychrun, a native of Boca Raton, just 30 minutes north of the Panthers' arena, for the game-winner in a third period that impressed Washington coach Spencer Carbery. ""I thought the third period was our best period by far, starting with the power play to get us the lead there,"" Carbery said. ""We completely locked it down and carried the majority of the play in the third. ""I was really proud of that third period. That's got to be what it looks like."" The victory was the first in three tries with Ovechkin absent from the lineup for Washington. Wednesday marks the Caps' second of six away contests over an eight-game span. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Florida Panthers have lost four straight games.,Toronto is 7-1-0 in its past eight games. Fl","The Toronto Maple Leafs have won four straight games. The Florida Panthers have lost four straight games. Toronto is 7-1-0 in its past eight games. Florida is 1-6-0 in its past seven. On Wednesday night, those trends will be tested as the Panthers will host the Leafs in Sunrise, Fla. Oddly, Toronto is on this hot streak despite playing without seven-time All-Star Auston Matthews, who had led the NHL in goals in three of the previous four years. Matthews, Toronto's captain, is on injured reserve due to an upper-body injury. ""Don't get me wrong -- we want Auston back as soon as possible,"" Leafs star John Tavares said. ""But it's just about believing in the group and ... the depth we have. Everyone is a part of it."" Indeed, Mitch Marner leads Toronto in assists (20) and points (28). William Nylander leads the Leafs in goals (14). And Tavares has 20 points, ranking third behind Marner and Nylander. Marner has been particularly hot, as he has a four-game multi-point streak. During that span, he has scored four goals and dished four assists. ""He's an elite player,"" Tavares said. ""He makes plays. He does so many good things without the puck. He plays in all situations, and he brings an element to our locker room that is unique. ""We're lucky to have him."" The Leafs also feel lucky to have the goalie duo of Anthony Stolarz -- who played for the Panthers last season -- and Joseph Woll. Stolarz has yet to face the Panthers since signing a two-year, $5 million contract with Toronto in July. But he has been brilliant with the Leafs, posting a 7-3-2 record, a .927 save percentage and a 2.18 goals-against average. Woll is 5-2-0 with a .922 save percentage and a 2.00 goals-against average. Florida will likely start goalie Sergei Bobrovsky, who was rested in Monday's 4-1 loss to Washington. Bobrovsky is 9-5-1 with an .885 save percentage and a 3.18 goals-against average. For his career against Toronto, Bobrovsky is 13-8-1 with a .904 save percentage and a 2.82 GAA. In that loss to Washington, Panthers center Sam Reinhart had his 13-game points streak snapped. It is the longest such streak in the NHL this season. Reinhart, who started this week tied for the league lead in goals scored (16), also tops the Panthers in points (31). He has 11 goals and eight assists over his past 14 games. With stars such as Bobrovsky, Reinhart, Aleksander Barkov and Matthew Tkachuk, it's easy to see why Panthers coach Paul Maurice hasn't lost confidence in his team. But he is also honest. ""There's a piece of our game that's missing right now,"" Maurice said, ""and we're going to have to find it."" Added Panthers defenseman Niko Mikkola: ""We're a little bit off."" Panthers backup goalie Spencer Knight admitted he's frustrated. ""But we've got to stick with it,"" Knight said. ""We've done a lot of things right. We're working hard. Everyone is buying in. ""Every team in this league is good. Anyone can beat anyone."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

TJ Bamba led four players in double figures with 18 points as the Ducks (6-0) shot 61.5 percent in the second half, had runs of 16 and 10 straight points in the half and put up 51 points after the break. Brandon Angel and Jackson Shelstad added 16 points each, while Jadrian Tracey added 11 for Oregon. The Aggies (4-2) got 20 points from Zhuric Phelps and 15 from Wade Taylor IV. Texas A&M lost a 10-point lead in the second half before pulling back ahead 69-68 with 4:41 left on CJ Wilcher's 3-pointer, but that proved to be the Aggies' last bucket of the game.  Taylor's free throw tied the game at 70 following Nate Bittle's dunk, but the final 2:21 belonged to the Ducks. Kwame Evans Jr. hit the go-ahead free throw with 1:22 left before Shelstad's jumper gave Oregon a three-point edge with 45 seconds to play. Texas A&M still couldn't buy a basket, and the Ducks hit seven free throws over the final 34 seconds to seal the win. The Aggies missed their final 11 shots and finished 22-of-68 (32.4 percent) from the floor. Oregon took its first lead of the game less than two minutes into the second half, on a Shelstad 3-pointer to go up 35-32. Texas A&M's defense focused on double-teaming Bittle, Oregon's leading scorer, and it worked. He had just two points when he picked up his third foul with 12:21 left. Pharrel Payne's ensuing free throw made it 50-42 Aggies. Bittle finished with six points on just 2-of-3 shooting. Phelps drained a deep 3 for a 53-44 lead before Jace Carter added a trey and a layup to make it 58-48 with 9:35 to play. The Ducks ripped off the next 16 points, keyed by a pair of Shelstad steals and layups from Tracey, who converted one of them into a three-point play.  After Oregon forced a shot clock violation, Angel knocked down a sideline 3 for a 60-58 lead with 7:24 to play. Shelstad's layup capped the run and put the Ducks up by six, their largest lead of the game.  The Aggies led 32-29 at halftime. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Detroit hasn't been able to string together more than two wins together since late October. The Red Wings, who host the Calgary Flames on Wednesday, hope their comeback victory over the New York Islanders on Monday is the start of something big. Detroit scored three unanswered goals in the final period against the Islanders to capture a 4-2 win and avoid its fifth loss in six games. ""We're in desperation mode for sure,"" goaltender Alex Lyon told the Detroit News. ""We need to play desperate every night and the best teams in this league play desperate every night. If you're not desperate you have to find a way to play desperate. It's good, it's fun to play that way and it's a grind, but it's kind of where we're at. We need to continue to push real hard."" The Red Wings' power play had been highly productive until their last three games. They have come up empty in their last 10 opportunities, including three on Monday. Detroit's first line produced at even strength against the Islanders, as Dylan Larkin and Lucas Raymond scored the tying and go-ahead goals, respectively. Raymond has scored in three consecutive games after netting just two goals in the first 18 contests. ""You need a top line if you're going to be good in this league and if you're going to have success,"" head coach Derek Lalonde said. ""Those guys have been doing it of late."" So has the defensive unit. After surrendering 15 goals during a three-game losing streak from Nov. 15-18, the Red Wings have given up just five over the past three contests. ""We've had some ups and downs but this team has shown some battle,"" Lalonde said. ""Hopefully, we can keep building our game."" Calgary had a four-game winning streak snapped at Ottawa on Monday, 4-3. The Flames were done in by a wave of penalties. They had 20 penalty minutes, leading to nine Senators power plays. Ottawa converted on two of them. ""It's hard to win when you have 20 penalty minutes, right? It's one-third of the game in the penalty box,"" defenseman Rasmus Andersson said. ""They have a good power play. I didn't think we were playing our best, even at five on five. I think they were a desperate team, they were a little bit more desperate than us to start."" Coach Ryan Huska cited a lack of discipline for the loss. ""We took eight minor penalties. I don't care what league you're in, you're not going to win a hockey game, or give yourself a chance to win,"" he said. ""But hey, five on five, we did some things and there was a fight right to the end, which I'm pretty proud of our group. But we didn't really give ourselves a chance with the amount of penalties we were taking."" That game began a four-game road trip for the Flames, who will also visit Columbus and Pittsburgh this week. ""We gave it our all until the end. It's one of these games that you just leave behind you, and you move on,"" Andersson said. Detroit has won its last four meetings with Calgary. It's uncertain whether the Red Wings will have forward Patrick Kane (three goals, seven assists), who missed Monday's game due to an upper-body injury. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Barkley opened as a +30000 longshot at BetMGM to win MVP honors in his first season with Philadelphia. He had slashed those in half by Week 11 and to +5000 by last week. Still a +5000 longshot Sunday morning, Barkley then exploded for 255 rushing yards and a pair of touchdowns while adding four catches for another 47 yards in a 37-20 win over the Los Angeles Rams that night. By Sunday night he had trimmed those odds to +650, as he leads the NFL with 1,392 rushing yards to go along with 12 total touchdowns. By Tuesday, Barkley had the third-shortest odds at +400, and is now BetMGM's biggest liability in the MVP market. Only Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen (+150) and Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson (+250) have shorter MVP odds. Barkley is also the -400 favorite to win Offensive Player of the Year honors, down from +2500 when the market opened. That's well ahead of Ravens running back Derrick Henry, who is a distant second at +275 despite having only 67 fewer rushing yards. ""Nobody can stop Saquon right now and the bettors know it,"" BetMGM trading manager Christian Cipollini said. Barkley's MVP odds have seen a similar trend at DraftKings, where he is now the third favorite at +475 after being +4000 before his performance against the Rams. Allen is the +150 favorite at the book followed by Jackson, Barkley and Detroit Lions quarterback Jared Goff (+700). No one else has shorter odds than Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes at +1300. Meanwhile, the book reported that a pair of quarterbacks saw their MVP chances take enormous hits following upset losses in Week 12. Washington rookie Jayden Daniels went from +2500 to +6000 after the Commanders lost to Dallas, while Houston's C.J. Stroud plummeted from +2800 to +9000 following the Texans' shocking loss to Tennessee. Going in the other direction was Tampa Bay quarterback Baker Mayfield, who is still a +3500 longshot but saw his odds improve from +5000 following the Buccaneers' blowout victory over the New York Giants. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""We've got a lot of competitors in this locker room, guys that want to win and put their body on the line,"" Mavericks star guard Kyrie Irving said. ""We're not sure who is going to be healthy day-in, day-out, but those who suit up are going to be ready to play."" Irving had 32 points in the Mavericks' win over Atlanta Monday night, when Dallas was also without Quentin Grimes and Klay Thompson. The Mavericks also got a huge lift from 7-footer Daniel Gafford, who had 10 points and is averaging a career-high 12.3 points a night. Gafford, 26, has spent time with the Bulls and Wizards before being acquired by the Mavericks at the trade deadline last year. He leads the NBA in field goal percentage at 72 percent. ""I'm just getting better as the days go by,"" Gafford said. ""It's about having patience and trying to expand my offensive game to make more plays. Teams are blitzing and switching more, so I'm figuring out how to make the right passes and take advantage of mismatches."" This is the third date of a five-game road swing for the Knicks, who are fourth in the East. They poured in a season-high 145 points in a win Monday night over the Denver Nuggets -- which set Nuggets coach Michael Malone aflame in a table-pounding post-game press conference. Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau was much calmer in his remarks, noting the defensive effort his team is putting forth. ""You look at what all the markers are telling you, over the last five games, we have averaged 123 points and given up 115, and we have won four of five. Net rating (is) the most important stat there is to me,"" Thibodeau said. ""Then I look at how many points we are giving up in the paint, we're top five there, how many second-chance points, we're top five there.  ""I think the physicality is there, the rebounding is there. Now it never ends, it's something you have to always work on, so that's where we are."" Offensively, the Knicks rank fourth in the NBA at 119.1 ppg. OG Anunoby had a career-high 40 points in the win over Denver.  Karl-Anthony Towns has been just what the Knicks wanted when they acquired him in the offseason. He leads the Knicks at 26.3 ppg, while Jalen Brunson has put up 24.9. The Knicks are still without contributors Precious Achiuwa (hamstring) and Mitchell Robinson (ankle) and while it's unlikely either will play on this road trip, Thibodeau said both are making progress in recovering.

Tage Thompson told reporters after practice Tuesday that he would be ""ready to go"" against the second-place team in the Central Division. The 27-year-old center, who scored 47 goals and 94 points two seasons ago, has not played since Nov. 11 due to a lower-body injury. Despite missing five games, his 11 goals still lead the team, and he ranks third in points with 18. Buffalo swept its California road trip, beating Los Angeles, Anaheim and San Jose in four days. The Sabres were off Sunday and Monday before returning to the ice Tuesday morning. The winning streak has Lindy Ruff's team tied for eighth place in the Eastern Conference. However, with three-quarters of the season remaining, Ruff -- who was in his first stint as the Sabres' coach when the team last made the playoffs in 2011 -- knows his team still needs to do more against tough competition. It did not help matters that Tuesday's practice could have started better, Ruff said. ""You come in off a road trip, and you're hoping that the team can be ready to exceed the intensity that we were able to bring on the trip,"" Ruff said. ""It's the only way to get better."" One area in which Ruff, whom the Sabres rehired in April, wants to see improvement is staying out of the penalty box. Out west, Buffalo gave opponents 12 power-play opportunities while only getting seven. Minnesota comes to Buffalo after falling at home 4-1 against Central Division leaders Winnipeg on Monday. It was the team's second straight defeat following a shootout loss to Calgary on Saturday. Monday's loss was not for a lack of effort. The Wild generated a season-high 44 shots on goal, with half of those coming in the first period. The 22 shots were the second-most of any team in one period this season and were the most in a period for the Wild in nearly seven years. Wild coach John Hynes felt his team played well but just could not get much past Jets goalie Connor Hellebuyck, a two-time Vezina Trophy winner. ""There's some things that we can grow from the game, but we got a lot of hockey this week too,"" Hynes told reporters after Monday's loss. ""So, we got to put this one behind us, grab what we can take out of it, and then we got to make sure that we're refreshed again (Tuesday) and we're ready to go against Buffalo."" Despite the mini losing streak, Minnesota's 30 points in 21 games is tied with the 2013-14 squad for the best start in franchise history. Left winger Kirill Kaprizov leads the Wild in both goals (13) and assists (21). His 34 total points entering Tuesday are tied for third in the NHL with Vegas' Jack Eichel and a point back from co-leaders Martin Necas of Carolina and Nathan MacKinnon of Colorado. Minnesota could be without defensive center Jakub Lauko, who left Monday's game early with a lower-body injury. Hynes did not have an update on his status after the Jets game. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""If you execute it, gives ourselves a chance to win a hockey game. The plan switches, depends who you're playing."" Hischier led the charge in Nashville by scoring his first NHL hat trick. ""Just happy for him,"" Devils center Erik Haula said. ""He's just such an important player for us, obviously. Eight years and first hat trick. You'd think he has five or six of them."" Prior to that outburst, Hischier had gone 10 games without scoring a goal. ""He starts the season on absolute fire, and then he goes cold for a while there,"" Devils coach Sheldon Keefe said. ""His demeanor didn't change, his game didn't change, most importantly he didn't cheat the game. He continued to meet the tough matchups every night head on, continued to lead the way for us in the faceoff circle and penalty kill."" New Jersey will be without forward Timo Meier on Wednesday after he was given a one-game suspension for cross-checking Nashville's Zachary L'Heureux and drawing blood. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Hurricanes will attempt to extend their winning home winning streak to nine games, while the Rangers hope to avoid a fourth straight loss when the Metropolitan Division foes convene for the first time this season on Wednesday in Raleigh, N.C. Carolina missed winning the division by three points last season, when it finished with 111. The title instead went to New York, which also won the Presidents' Trophy after racking up a league-best 114 points. Just more than a month into the new season, the Hurricanes own the third-most points in the league (31) and are outscoring foes 41-16 on home ice since taking a 4-1 loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning in their home opener on Oct. 11. Carolina has scored at least four goals in each game of its home winning streak and has hit that mark 16 times overall in 21 games this season. The Hurricanes kept the streak alive with Monday's 6-4 victory over the Dallas Stars. Carolina scored five goals in the third period, including a tiebreaking, power-play goal from Martin Necas with under three minutes left to overcome a 3-1 deficit. ""I already know what we have,"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""It's just, can they grasp how we have to play every shift? I think sometimes we get a little off and try to do things differently, then all of a sudden, we get to the way we have to play... We don't always get the result like that, but you're giving yourself a chance. Really, a game like that, that's what you're hoping you get out of it."" Sebastian Aho scored the first goal of the third-period flurry and collected three assists. Seth Jarvis scored in his first game since Nov. 9 and collected two assists, including the secondary helper on the goal by Necas. The Hurricanes are continuing to win despite uncertainty in goal. Frederik Andersen is about a month into his recovery from knee surgery and Pyotr Kochetkov is in the concussion protocol after colliding with defenseman Sean Walker in Saturday's game against the Columbus Blue Jackets. Spencer Martin started in goal Monday. The Rangers raced out to a 5-0-1 start but are just 7-7-0 since then and have lost three straight. New York ended its four-game road trip with a 6-2 loss to the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday and produced another dud in a 5-2 home loss to the St. Louis Blues Monday. Will Cuylle scored twice, but big names Vincent Trocheck, Artemi Panarin and Mika Zibanejad combined for six shots on goal and were a combined minus-7 as the Rangers were outshot 44-29. ""We need to be better,"" New York coach Peter Laviolette said. ""Everybody needs to be better. It's not good enough what we're doing."" Monday's loss came after reports surfaced that general manager Chris Drury told other teams he may be willing to trade forward Chris Kreider and defenseman Jacob Trouba, who has a no-move clause to 15 teams. Kreider on Monday missed his first game since Jan. 16, 2023, due to an upper-body injury and is day-to-day. He has nine goals in 19 games this season. Trouba was on the ice for two goals Monday and has just two points since collecting four assists in the first three games this season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Chase Hunter added 17 points, while Chauncey Wiggins scored 14 and reserve Del Jones chipped in 10 points.

Nick Kern came off the bench to score 11 but Penn State was outscored 15-2 on the fast break and made just 4 of 18 attempts from 3-point range. Schieffelin came up big down the stretch, assisting on a 3-pointer by Jaeden Zackery with 6:04 left that made it 65-61. Then he made two foul shots and tossed in a jump hook from the lane to up the margin to 71-66 with 1:03 left. The big storyline going into this game was which team would be able to control the pace. Penn State came in averaging 96 ppg, while Clemson demonstrated its ability to enforce a slower tempo in March, advancing to a regional final in the NCAA Tournament.

Arizona (2-2) lost at Wisconsin 103-88 on Nov. 15 and followed that with a home loss against Duke 69-55 on Friday. The Wildcats have dropped 15 spots in the Associated Press Top 25 poll in two weeks. Arizona's record is .500 this early in a season for the first time since it was 3-3 to start the 2017-18 schedule. ""I've got work to do, so let's get to work,"" said Lloyd, in his fourth year as Arizona's head coach. ""Let's see where we're at in a month, and if we're still struggling, you know what I'll do? I still got work to do, but I'm gonna get to it."" Arizona shot 39.6 percent from the field against Duke, and just 26.1 percent (6 of 23) from 3-point range. The Wildcats were outrebounded by 43-30 and their 15 turnovers led to 19 points. Jaden Bradley led Arizona with 18 points and KJ Lewis added 12. Preseason All-American Caleb Love had eight points on 3-of-13 shooting from the field, including 1-of-9 from 3-point range. Arizona made only one field goal in the last 5:39 as Duke pulled away after its lead was trimmed to six points. ""We didn't play great,"" Lloyd said. ""Now we need to take a step back and figure out why. Are there some schematic problems? Are there some problems with how our personnel is kind of put together?

Davidson is 4-0 after a 15-17 record last season, in which it lost its last six games to put an end to postseason hopes. A 93-66 win over visiting VMI on Friday followed a 91-85 win at Bowling Green and 76-70 victory over visiting East Tennessee State. The two wins by 10 points or fewer are important because Davidson was 6-12 in such games last season. It was 4-11 in games decided by five points or fewer. ""The goal (is) to get better,"" Davidson head coach Matt McKillop said after the season opener. ""We talk about fighting to win every possession. I think we had to figure out what that really felt like with the lights on."" Davidson made 13 shots from 3-point range in the win over VMI. Reed Bailey had 23 points, eight rebounds and six assists. Bobby Durkin added 19 points, including 17 of them and a career-best five 3-pointers in the first half. Bailey leads Davidson in scoring (19 points per game) and rebounding (7.8). Durkin is shooting 57.9 percent (22 of 38) from the field and 54.2 percent (13 of 24) from 3-point range. By contrast, Arizona's Love is shooting 32 percent (16 of 50) from the field and 21.4 percent (6 of 28) from beyond the arc. Bradley leads Arizona with 15.5 points per game.

The Trail Blazers stagger into Indianapolis after a short-handed 123-98 drubbing at the hands of the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday. Five regulars -- Scoot Henderson, Kris Murray, Matisse Thybulle, Donovan Clingan and Deandre Ayton -- all sat out with injuries. Things went from bad to worse when Portland lost two starters -- Jerami Grant and Robert Williams III -- during Monday's loss. Grant injured his left knee while Williams suffered a concussion. It's possible the Trail Blazers, playing for the fifth time in eight days on the road, could be as many as seven players down for the trip finale. Not having Grant might be the biggest blow. He went for 34 and 37 points when the Trail Blazers, who only won 21 games last year, shockingly swept the season series from the Pacers. Following Monday's defeat, Portland coach Chauncey Billups practiced a speech he might have to give again in Indianapolis. ""We hung in. Couldn't make shots,"" he lamented. ""We just, at the end of the day, didn't have enough bodies."" The Trail Blazers did have two of their brightest prospects - Anfernee Simons and Shaedon Sharpe - together for just the seventh time this season against the Grizzlies. However, they were not able to duplicate the success of their previous game at Houston, when they teamed for 49 points, as they combined to shoot just 6-for-26 and total 20 points against the Grizzlies. Portland figures to need to have all guns blazing against the high-powered Pacers, who have scored 111 or more points in seven straight games, including 115 and 114 in their last two outings: wins over the Washington Wizards and New Orleans Pelicans, respectively. One game after balanced scoring led the way in the victory over the Wizards, Tyrese Haliburton surged out of a recent slump with 34 points and 13 assists. The positives for Haliburton are doubly good news for the Pacers. His 12-for-23 night from the field was a welcome relief after he'd shot just 32.9 percent over his previous five games and found himself addressing a possible slump. ""It's part of basketball,"" he admitted. ""I've just gotta keep trusting myself, working hard. I'll figure it out. Just put my head down, keep working. I'll figure it out."" Not slumping in the least, Pascal Siakam contributed a total of 36 points, 13 rebounds and 13 assists during the two-game winning streak. He made 13 of his 27 shots (48.1 percent) in those games. The Trail Blazers haven't seen the Pacers since the night Siakam made his Indiana debut in Portland last January. He had 21 points. Portland's win that night was its 12th of the season. The Trail Blazers went just 9-32 the rest of the way. Thanks in large part to Siakam, the Pacers rebounded from its loss in Portland to finish 23-17 and reach the Eastern Conference Finals.

While GM/Cadillac will have a place on the grid beginning in 2026, General Motors is not yet a power unit manufacturer for F1 and is targeting 2028 to begin providing them. The team will have to use another company's engines in the meantime. Andretti, 84, spent a portion of his decorated racing career driving for Ferrari. The Italian-born American won 12 Grands Prix and one F1 drivers' championship (1978). ""My history with Ferrari, and my relationship with Mr. Ferrari -- all of it plays, plays tremendously. There's so many factors here that make a lot of sense. It will be best of all worlds."" His involvement leaves some Andretti influence in the General Motors team after a bid by his son Michael Andretti was previously rejected by F1. The younger Andretti stepped back from Andretti Global, and GM was publicly approved Monday. Mario Andretti also hinted at the team's driver strategy when speaking to NBC News. ""From our standpoint, I think the play at the beginning would be to have one experienced driver -- nationality doesn't matter -- and then a young American talent,"" he said. ""These are the objectives at the moment."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"
ABC News: Sports,Five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek accepts a one-month suspension in doping case,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/time-grand-slam-champion-iga-swiatek-accepts-month-116304704,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 10:50:17 -0500",The International Tennis Integrity Agency says five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek has accepted a one-month suspension after testing positive for the banned substance trimetazidine,"The International Tennis Integrity Agency says five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek has accepted a one-month suspension after testing positive for the banned substance trimetazidine Five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek accepted a one-month suspension after testing positive for the banned substance trimetazidine, a heart medication known as TMZ, the International Tennis Integrity Agency announced Thursday. Swiatek failed an out-of-competition drug test in August, and the ITIA accepted her explanation that the result was unintentional and caused by the contamination of a nonprescription medication, melatonin, that Swiatek was taking for issues with jet lag and sleeping. It was determined her level of fault was “at the lowest end of the range for no significant fault or negligence,” the ITIA said. “This experience, the most difficult in my life so far, taught me a lot,” Swiatek, a 23-year-old from Poland, said in a video she posted on social media. “The whole thing will definitely stay with me for the rest of my life. It took a lot to return to training after the situation nearly broke my heart, so there were many tears and lots of sleepless nights,” Swiatek said, speaking in Polish with an English translation scrolling across the top of the post. “The worst part of it was the uncertainty. I didn’t know what was going to happen with my career, how things would end or if I would be allowed to play tennis at all.” This is the second recent high-profile doping case in tennis: The top-ranked man, Jannik Sinner, failed two tests for a steroid in March and was cleared in August, right before the start of the U.S. Open, which he went on to win for his second Grand Slam title of the season. Sinner did not miss any competition; the World Anti-Doping Agency has appealed the ruling that exonerated him. Swiatek reached No. 1 in the WTA rankings for the first time in April 2022, and she remained there much of the time since but is now at No. 2 after being overtaken by Aryna Sabalenka in October. Swiatek won the French Open in June for her fourth title there and fifth major championship overall, then took home a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics in early August. “The WTA fully supports Iga during this difficult time. Iga has consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to fair play and upholding the principles of clean sport, and this unfortunate incident highlights the challenges athletes face in navigating the use of medications and supplements,” the women's tennis tour said in a statement. “The WTA remains steadfast in our support for a clean sport and the rigorous processes that protect the integrity of competition. We also emphasize that athletes must take every precaution to verify the safety and compliance of all products they use, as even unintentional exposure to prohibited substances can have significant consequences.” Swiatek formally admitted the anti-doping rule violation on Wednesday and accepted her penalty. TMZ is the drug at the center of the case involving 23 Chinese swimmers who remained eligible despite testing positive for performance enhancers in 2021. Swiatek said she was “shocked” by her test result and had never heard of TMZ. She said she's been using melatonin “for a long time,"" adding that “all my traveling, jet lag and work-related stress mean that sometimes without it, I couldn’t fall asleep.” She already was provisionally suspended from Sept. 22 to Oct. 4, missing three tournaments during the post-U.S. Open hard-court swing in Asia — the Korea Open, the China Open and the Wuhan Open. That provisional ban was ended after her appeal showed that her test result came inadvertently from contaminated melatonin. Because the ultimate agreement was for a month suspension, she will serve the remaining eight days now, while there’s no competition, and be cleared to return to play as of Dec. 4. “I can start my new season with a clean slate, focused on what I've always done — simply playing tennis,” said Swiatek, who hired Wim Fissette as her coach in October. Swiatek also was fined the prize money of $158,944 that she earned for her semifinal run at the Cincinnati Open in August, the event immediately following the positive test. “Once the source of the TMZ had been established, it became clear that this was a highly unusual instance of a contaminated product, which in Poland is a regulated medicine. However, the product does not have the same designation globally, and the fact that a product is a regulated medication in one country cannot of itself be sufficient to avoid any level of fault,"" ITIA CEO Karen Moorhouse said. “Taking into account the nature of the medication, and all the circumstances, it does place that fault at the lowest end of the scale,"" Moorhouse said. ""This case is an important reminder for tennis players of the strict liability nature of the World Anti-Doping Code and the importance of players carefully considering the use of supplements and medications.” ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen made 28 saves for Buffalo, which failed to win four in a row for the third time this season. The shutout was Gustavsson’s second of the season. Minnesota improved to a league best 10-1-3 on the road this season. Kaprizov’s 14th goal of the season came 6:55 into the first period on a 4-on-1 rush when he finished off a pass from Joel Eriksson Ek that beat Luukkonen. Sabres: Tage Thompson returned to the Sabres lineup after he missed five games with a lower-body injury. He had six shots on goal. Wild: Defenseman Jonas Brodin was a late scratch because of an upper-body injury. He has two goals and six assists in 19 games this season. Wild defenseman Brock Faber intercepted a centering pass by Sabres defenseman Rasmus Dahlin and broke out to begin a 4-on-1 break that led to the opening goal. Kaprizov’s first-period goal gave him a point in each of his past 12 road games. He has nine goals and 16 assists in those games. The Sabres host the Vancouver Canucks on Friday afternoon.

The Nets have won four of their last five games. The Suns have lost seven of nine. Martin shot 10 of 13 from the field, including 8 for 10 from 3-point range, in his best NBA performance by a wide margin. He had scored just 33 points in 21 career games before Wednesday. Ben Simmons had 14 points, nine rebounds and eight assists for Brooklyn.  Devin Booker led the Suns with 31 points. Kevin Durant had 30 points against his former team, but also seven turnovers. The Nets used a 17-3 run to take an 80-66 lead midway through the third quarter. Brooklyn had a 96-84 lead entering the fourth. It was 63-all at halftime. Martin scored 17 points before the break, making 5 of 6 3-pointers.  The Nets were without several key players, including leading scorer Cam Thomas (hamstring) and forwards Nic Claxton (back) and Noah Clowney (ankle).  Nets: Brooklyn looked just fine without Thomas, who is averaging nearly 25 points per game. Martin's big game was obviously helpful, and Trendon Watford added 18 points off the bench. Simmons was also a bright spot with a good all-around game. Suns: It was a sloppy game for Phoenix, which gave up 24 points off 17 turnovers. Martin was fouled by Durant while shooting a 3-pointer with 0.1 seconds left in the third quarter. Martin made two of three free throws to give the Nets a 12-point cushion heading into the fourth. Martin's career high in points was six before Wednesday. He was a second-round draft pick by the Warriors in 2023 and spent last season in the G League. The Nets host the Magic on Friday.

Nuggets: Jokic proved too much for the shorthanded Jazz to handle. His efficient offense helped Denver turn a sluggish start into a blowout victory. Jazz: Micah Potter and Svi Mykhailiuk made their first starts of the season. They combined for 16 points, and Potter grabbed a career-high 16 rebounds. After George tied it on a 3-pointer midway through the second quarter, the Nuggets held the Jazz to two baskets during an eight-minute stretch spanning the second and third quarters.

Atlanta ended a three-game losing streak and recorded its second big road win this season after winning in Boston on Nov. 12 without Young. Cavaliers: Finally showed some vulnerability at home after being so dominant. Cleveland built an early 19-point lead that may have given it a false sense of security. With the Hawks up four, Young, who turned the ball over on Atlanta's previous possession, almost lost it again before recovering and draining a 39-foot 3-pointer to make it 129-122 with 1:23 left.

Maple Leafs: Stolarz, defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson and forward Steven Lorentz — all Panthers last season — got their Stanley Cup championship rings in a Wedneday morning ceremony. Panthers coach Paul Maurice, general manager Bill Zito and a number of Panthers players also were present to celebrate with their former teammates. “Worth the wait,” Lorentz said. Panthers: Florida was without Anton Lundell, who left Monday's game after a puck was deflected into his face. He took part in the morning skate Wednesday but wasn't in the game lineup. Samoskevich's goal put Florida up 2-0 — it came 50 seconds after Barkov opened the scoring — and was a very good sign for the Panthers. They're now 4-0-0 when the former Michigan star gets a goal.

The Flyers (6-2) got 20 points from Enoch Cheeks, 18 from Nate Santos, 16 from Posh Alexander and 15 from Zed Key, who led the team with nine rebounds. Cheeks shot 8 of 12 from the field, including 3 of 5 from 3-point range. A day after he scored a career-best 20 points against Colorado, UConn's Liam McNeeley went scoreless on 0-for-9 shooting against the Flyers. Karaban hit a 3-pointer that put UConn ahead 30-27 with 4:34 left before halftime, but Dayton closed out the first half on a 15-4 run to take a 41-34 halftime lead. UConn: All three of the Huskies’ losses on Maui came against unranked teams. They dropped their first two games — against Memphis on Monday and Colorado on Tuesday — by a combined three points. Dayton: The Flyers made 27 of 30 free throws and shot better than 47% from behind the arc (8 of 17). They went 25 of 50 from the field overall. UConn got within 52-49 on Solo Ball's bucket in transition at the 11:20 mark of the second half, but Dayton found some separation with Alexander’s 3-point play that stretched it back to a six-point lead with 10:34 to play. Dayton finished plus-16 in rebounding margin, including a 32-17 advantage on the defensive glass. UConn hosts Maryland Eastern Shore on Saturday, while Dayton plays host to Western Michigan on Tuesday night. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

Harden hit seven 3-pointers, had 23 points in the first quarter and eclipsed his previous season high of 29 by halftime. The 10-time All-Star posted his highest point total since scoring 44 at Detroit on March 26, 2021, despite exiting the game at the end of the third. Ivica Zubac added 18 points and 16 rebounds for the Clippers, who have won six of seven.  It was Los Angeles' second-largest margin of victory this season, after opening a four-game trip with a 26-point win at Philadelphia two games ago. Malcolm Brogdon and Jonas Valanciunas each scored 17 points for Washington, which lost leading scorer Kyle Kuzma to a left rib injury after he played just eight minutes. Clippers: Despite a long injury list that's included six-time All-Star Kawhi Leonard (knee) all season, Los Angeles hits the 20-game mark with a 12-8 record. Wizards: Washington is three losses from matching last season's longest skid of 16 straight defeats on the way to a franchise-worst 15-67 record. The Clippers were in control throughout, but erased any doubt about the outcome when Harden hit 3s on consecutive possessions to stretch the lead to 81-59 with 3:47 left in the third. Harden's 23-point first quarter marked the ninth time he scored at least 23 in one period, according to StatMuse, and his first since July 31, 2020.

Hornets: Ball, who came in averaging 43 points over the last three games, was probable entering the game with a right wrist injury. It was clearly bothering him during the game, as he was seen holding the wrist with his other hand during pauses in play.  The Hornets looked to take the lead with under 10 seconds left when Herro stole Ball's pass to Brandon Miller. Ball shot 11 of 35 from the field and 7 for 20 from long distance and had seven turnovers.

Gaudette tipped a hard pass by Stutzle past Sharks goaltender Mackenzie Blackwood with 4:12 left for his fourth goal in as many games. San Jose had tied the game earlier in the period on goals by Macklin Celebrini and Will Smith.  Stutzle's assist was his third of the game.

ABC News: Sports,Why did Iga Swiatek get a one-month doping ban? What did she test positive for?,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/iga-swiatek-month-doping-ban-test-positive-116309673,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 16:10:19 -0500",Iga Swiatek is the second high-profile tennis player to test positive for a banned substance this year,"Iga Swiatek is the second high-profile tennis player to test positive for a banned substance this year Iga Swiatek is the second high-profile tennis player to test positive for a banned substance this year, joining Jannik Sinner. While Sinner, currently the No. 1 ranked man, was fully cleared, Swiatek, who slid from No. 1 to No. 2 last month, accepted a one-month suspension that was announced Thursday. The International Tennis Integrity Agency said it determined that Swiatek's tainted urine sample was because of a contaminated medicine she took and so she bore a low level of responsibility. “These are not cases of intentional doping. These are cases — in Sinner’s case ... no fault or negligence. In (Swiatek's) case, very low end, no significant fault or negligence,” ITIA CEO Karen Moorhouse said in a video call with reporters. “So I don’t think this is a cause for concern for tennis fans and the like.” Here is a look at the details of the two cases: Swiatek is a 23-year-old from Poland with five Grand Slam titles who has been the best player in women's tennis over the past 2 1/2 seasons, particularly on clay courts. She won four of the past five French Open titles, including the last three in a row, plus one U.S. Open championship, and has been ranked No. 1 nearly every week since April 2022. Swiatek also collected a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics in early August. Swiatek's urine showed low amounts of trimetazidine, a banned heart medication commonly referred to as TMZ, in an out-of-competition test on Aug. 12, 10 days after her last match at the Summer Games and shortly before the start of the Cincinnati Open. She was told she was being provisionally suspended on Sept. 12, eight days after losing to Jessica Pegula in the U.S. Open quarterfinals. It was found that the TMZ had contaminated a sleep aid, melatonin, that Swiatek's psychologist bought for her at a pharmacy in Poland, where it is sold as a medicine. According to the ITIA report, Swiatek listed 14 medications or supplements she was using, although not melatonin. Trimetazidine is a metabolic agent that can help prevent angina attacks if used as an “add-on treatment,” according to the European Medicines Agency. It can increase blood flow efficiency and improve endurance — both crucial to high-end athletic performance. It is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's prohibited list in the category of “hormone and metabolic modulators.” The substance was involved in past Olympic athletes' cases involving Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva and 23 Chinese swimmers. Swiatek was given a provisional ban that began in September, after the U.S. Open, but that was lifted because she quickly offered a believable explanation for the contamination — one that was backed up by tests, the ITIA said. She missed three tournaments during the Asian swing after the U.S. Open, although at the time, she didn't give the real reason for being sidelined. Eventually, the ITIA and Swiatek agreed she would serve a one-month suspension; because she was credited for the time she already missed, there were eight days remaining in a “one-month” penalty, so she is “serving” those now, even though the season is over. Swiatek was able to play in the WTA Finals and the Billie Jean King Cup. “The worst part of it was the uncertainty,” she said. ""I didn’t know what was going to happen with my career, how things would end or if I would be allowed to play tennis at all.” Sinner tested positive for a banned anabolic steroid twice in March, but nothing came to light until August, just before the U.S. Open, which he went on to win for his second Grand Slam title of 2024. As with Swiatek, the cases were kept quiet until they were resolved because both players offered what ITIA found to be plausible explanations. He blamed it on a cream his trainer used before giving Sinner a massage and so was cleared completely — although WADA has appealed that ruling — while Swiatek was found to have been “at the lowest end of the range for no significant fault or negligence,” and so was given a light punishment. Asked whether there are specific guidelines that determine the lengths of bans in such instances, Moorhouse said: “No, there isn’t. This is not where you put these things into machine and it spits you out a number at the end of it. It’s a case of considering everything in the round, take into account all the circumstances and facts in the case to come to the right outcome.” ___ Howard Fendrich has been the AP’s tennis writer since 2002.

Anfernee Simons led Portland with 30 points, including six 3-pointers. Scoot Henderson and Shaedon Sharpe each had 17. Both teams are now 1-2 in NBA Cup play. Blazers: After dictating play and leading for much of the early going, the visitors were unable to recover from shooting lapses in the second half. Portland trimmed an 11-point deficit to two, but started missing again as the Pacers pulled away. The Blazers are 3-8 on the road. Pacers: Despite sporadic defense in the first half, Indiana finally found its offensive rhythm in the second half as the familiar formula of Siakam, Mathurin and Haliburton took turns making shots. The trio have been consistently clutch as Indiana improved to 7-2 at home.

Tyrese Maxey scored 39 points, including 28 in the second half, in the loss for Philadelphia, which played without Paul George and Joel Embiid and fell to 3-14. Maxey, who tied the game with three free throws with just over 11 seconds left, was held scoreless in overtime. Green rode the hot hand during the first quarter, scoring 18 points on 6-of-8 shooting. However, it was Sengun, the 6-foot-11 center from Turkey, who took over late against an undersized Philadelphia lineup that was collapsing on Green. Amen Thompson had 19 points and 13 rebounds, while Tari Eason added 14 for Houston (14-6). Guerschon Yabusele had 22 in the losing cause for the Sixers. Rockets: Houston’s ability to hit the boards is one of its biggest advantages. The Rockets entered Wednesday leading the league with 49.9 rebounds a game and outrebounded the Sixers 52-42. 76ers: Philadelphia continues to search for offensive answers other than Maxey with both George and Embiid out. Yabusele provided some of that spark on Wednesday, but Jared McCain was held to 15 on 6-of-19 shooting. After Yabusele opened the overtime with a corner 3 to give the Sixers a three-point lead, the Rockets went on a 9-0 run with Sengun hitting three layups after Green’s three free throws tied the game.

But the Timberwolves have lost four in a row and seven of nine after starting 6-3 this season.

""We was down, nobody wanted to say nothing. We got up and everybody (was) cheering and (hyped up). We get down again and don’t nobody say nothing. That’s the definition of a frontrunner. We as a team, including myself, we all was frontrunners tonight."" “Everybody right now is on different agendas,"" he added. ""I think that’s one of the main culprits of why we’re losing.” Edwards, who led the Timberwolves with 29 points on 9-of-24 shooting, didn't only admonish his teammates after the game. More than once, he could be seen communicating demonstratively in the huddle with Julius Randle, Rudy Gobert and others. Randle and guard Donte DiVincenzo were the top gets in the October trade that sent Karl-Anthony Towns to New York three weeks before the start of the season. Both have experienced up-and-down starts to their Twin Cities tenures. Towns, meanwhile, has settled in comfortably with the Knicks. Edwards said this isn't just about the new guys, though. “I’m talking about the whole team,” Edwards said. “However many of us it is, all 15, we go into our own shell and we’re just growing away from each other. It’s obvious. We can see it. I can see it, the team can see it, the coaches can see it.” So can the fans, who voiced their collective displeasure more than once Wednesday night. “The fans (are) booing us,” said Edwards, whose team is 8-10 heading into Friday's game against the Los Angeles Clippers. ""That (stuff) is crazy, man. We’re getting booed in our home arena. That’s so (freaking) disrespectful, it’s crazy.” ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Boise State, which twice boycotted regular-season matches with San Jose State, pulled out of the conference tournament Wednesday night, hours after securing a spot against the Spartans in Friday’s semifinals. With Boise State's withdrawal, San Jose State advanced to Saturday’s championship match. While the Broncos didn't announce explicitly why they withdrew, a lawsuit was recently filed in Colorado by players from various schools against the conference and San Jose State officials calling for a Spartans player not to be allowed to participate in the tournament. They cited unspecified reports asserting there was a transgender player on the San Jose State volleyball team, even naming her. U.S. Magistrate Judge S. Kato Crews in Denver ruled Monday that the player was allowed to play, and a federal appeals court upheld the decision the following day. “In this time of Thanksgiving, we are especially thankful for those who continue to engage in civil and respectful discourse,” San Jose State's statement said. “We celebrate and support all of our students, including our student-athletes as they compete for our community on this holiday weekend. While we are disappointed in Boise State’s decision, our women’s volleyball team is preparing for Saturday’s match and looks forward to competing for a championship.” San Jose State, which received six forfeit victories because of boycotts from Mountain West opponents during the regular season, is seeded second in the conference tournament and received a first-round bye. Now the Spartans will play No. 1 Colorado State or No. 5 San Diego State in the championship. Both teams, which meet in a semifinal on Friday, played the Spartans this season rather than sit out. “Decisions to forfeit matches are at the institutions’ discretion and are considered a loss,” the Mountain West said in a statement Thursday. Boise State’s decision to withdraw came hours after the Broncos defeated Utah State 25-19, 18-25, 25-20, 25-23 in the quarterfinals. The Broncos' athletic department released a statement that night that read in part: “Our team overcame forfeitures to earn a spot in the tournament field and fought for the win over Utah State in the first round on Wednesday. They should not have to forgo this opportunity while waiting for a more thoughtful and better system that serves all athletes.” Mountain West members Boise State, Wyoming, Utah State and Nevada as well as Southern Utah canceled matches this season against the Spartans. Nevada’s players said they “refuse to participate in any match that advances injustice against female athletes,” without providing further details. Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed an executive order Aug. 28 called the Defending Women’s Sports Act that challenges how Title IX rules are interpreted in that state. “Biological males – men and boys – have physical differences that give them an unfair advantage when competing with women and girls in athletics,” Little said at the time. While some media have reported those and other details, San Jose State has not confirmed the school has a trans women’s volleyball player. The Associated Press is withholding the player’s name because she has not publicly commented on her gender identity and through school officials has declined an interview request. Participation of transgender women in women’s sports became a hot political topic ahead of the recent election. ___ AP college sports: https://apnews.com/hub/college-sports 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Against Chicago, the Lions were good enough to extend their winning streak to 10 games. Barely. Jared Goff threw two touchdown passes to Sam LaPorta, Jake Bates made three field goals in the first half and Detroit held off the Bears 23-20 on Thursday. “It was a crazy ending, right?” Goff asked. Indeed. The Bears had the ball in Lions territory late in the game with a chance to drive for a game-tying field goal or go-ahead touchdown, but they blew the opportunity. Caleb Williams threw an incomplete pass as time expired from the Detroit 41 after being sacked with about 30 seconds left, allowing time to run off the clock even though Chicago had one more timeout. “I’m focused on getting everyone back and getting everyone lined up,"" Williams said. ""I don’t have a microphone, so there is no communication with coach there. We could have taken a timeout, but if we hit that play, no one would be worried about it.” The NFC-leading Lions (11-1) have their best record after 12 games in team history and their 10-game winning streak ties a franchise record with the 1934 squad. The Bears (4-8) have lost six straight, including four by a total of 10 points. Chicago coach Matt Eberflus dropped to 5-17 in games decided by seven or fewer points, winning 22.7% of those games to rank 221st and last among coaches with at least 20 games that close. “We're right there,” he said. Detroit led 16-0 at halftime and 23-7 after three quarters and Williams led a comeback that came up short for the second straight week. Williams helped the Bears rally from an 11-point deficit in the final 22 seconds of regulation against Minnesota before losing in overtime. Detroit opened the game with four straight scoring drives, going ahead 16-0 on Goff's 3-yard touchdown pass to LaPorta in the second quarter and Bates' field goals. Chicago, meanwhile, failed to pick up a first down on its first four drives and gained a total of 32 yards on those possessions. “We started off pretty hot offensively and defensively,” Lions coach Dan Campbell said. Goff's second touchdown pass to LaPorta, a 1-yard toss, gave Detroit a 23-7 lead late in the third quarter. The score was set up by Jameson Williams' 15-yard reverse, which included him hurdling Kevin Byard to gain several extra yards. Caleb Williams, the No. 1 pick overall in the draft, was 20 of 39 for 256 yards with two touchdown passes to Keenan Allen and one to DJ Moore. Williams seemed to make his first rookie mistake of the game in the third quarter on a run, pulling up instead of going out of bounds and took a low hit from linebacker Jack Campbell. “Knee is fine, but that play was kind of funky,"" Williams said. “I didn’t appreciate him diving right at my knee, but it is good.” The former USC star shook it off and on the next snap, threw a 31-yard touchdown pass to Allen. William connected with Allen for another score, throwing a 9-yarder to him with 5:36 remaining. Detroit had a chance to add to its cushion, but Bates missed a 45-yard kick after starting his NFL career 19 of 19 on field goals on a drive that was stunted by Jameson Williams' 15-yard penalty for tossing the football at a Bears player on the sideline. Jameson Williams, unsolicited, apologized to the team after the game. “I'm proud of him, the way he handled it,” Goff said. The Lions snapped a seven-game losing streak on Thanksgiving. “We’re going to enjoy this,” Campbell said. Bears: RB Roschon Johnson left the game with a concussion. ... Bears G Ryan Bates (concussion) and DB Elijah Hicks (ankle) were inactive. Lions: LB Malcolm Rodriguez (knee) left the game and Campbell said he fears the injury may be serious. ... DE Josh Paschal (knee), DL Levi Onwuzurike (hamstring) and DL Mekhi Wingo (knee) where hurt during the game, potentially more blows to a position hit hard by injuries, including Aidan Hutchinson's broken leg.

NYT > Sports,The Lions’ Belief in Jared Goff Was Unwavering. Now It’s Paying Off.,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5954240/2024/11/28/week-13-news-jared-goff-dawn-aponte-lions-giants-texans/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 21:02:41 +0000",The quarterback has emerged as Detroit’s leader and an M.V.P. candidate.,"NFL Thanksgiving is all about gratitude, football, and, of course, those unavoidable family conversations you’d rather dodge. (I’m gearing up for a spirited argument with my brothers-in-law — the same guys who, six weeks ago, were texting me to tell someone at the Eagles to fire Nick Sirianni but now can’t stop talking about booking trips to New Orleans for the Super Bowl.) Advertisement Let’s be honest, much like your Thanksgiving dinner table the NFL serves up its fair share of topics we’d rather not get stuck on. But there’s also plenty to be thankful for as fans. With a little effort, you can steer those heated conversations into more enjoyable territory. In the meantime, this column might give you a few icebreakers to help navigate the holiday chaos: • Looking back on the Lions’ unwavering belief in Jared Goff • “She’s a tough, no-nonsense leader with a better résumé and background in football than most of the men up for these jobs” • What’s wrong with the Houston Texans? • What might have been with the Giants • A chilling effect for “Hard Knocks”? • What Eagles fans, New England, the Ravens and I can be thankful for  As you watch them take on the Chicago Bears Thursday afternoon, it’s worth reflecting on how far the Detroit Lions have come in just two years. Back in 2022, the outlook was bleak. Dan Campbell was coming off a 3-13-1 debut season and then lost six of seven to start his second year. The pressure to make changes — particularly at quarterback — was mounting. But Campbell and first-time GM Brad Holmes refused to waver in their belief in Jared Goff, even as the criticism grew. Their faith wasn’t blind. Campbell had witnessed Goff’s resilience firsthand during the 2018 NFC Championship Game when Campbell was the Saints’ tight ends coach. Despite a deafening Superdome crowd, a 13-0 deficit, and a broken helmet speaker, Goff calmly rallied the Rams to an overtime victory. It wasn’t just about talent, it was about adaptability and mental toughness. The Lions have since shown that Goff moment from the 2018 season to their staff as a teaching point. The duo’s faith in Goff has paid off. Since that rocky first season-plus, the Lions have gone 32-9, with the quarterback emerging as a leader and an MVP candidate. (Want more on this? Check out Michael Silver’s revealing profile on Goff.) GO DEEPER Jared Goff hit rock bottom. A conversation with Dan Campbell ignited his unlikely comeback If you’ve been keeping up with the buzz around the many expected general manager and coaching changes coming this offseason, you’ve seen the name Dawn Aponte, the NFL’s chief football administrative officer, come up as a potential GM candidate. At first glance, some might assume her inclusion on these lists is about optics, a way for the NFL to demonstrate its commitment to diversity and women in leadership. But make no mistake, her credentials are impressive, and the interest is real. Teams are looking at Aponte as a potential GM or team president tasked with overseeing football operations. She’s long been viewed in league circles as someone capable of taking on such a position. One league source described the value of Aponte as someone who would carry out ownership’s vision while creating streamlined processes, forcing accountability, and aligning the organization at all levels. She doesn’t have a scouting or personnel background but her leadership qualities and strategic mindset are what have some teams excited about her potential. Advertisement If she was hired, Aponte would focus on structure and alignment — two areas where struggling teams often fall short — while partnering with an experienced personnel executive to handle the roster-building side of things. It’s a model that makes sense for teams needing a broader, big-picture approach to success. One coach who is interested in collaborating with Aponte texted: “She’s a tough, no-nonsense leader with a better résumé and background in football than most of the men up for these jobs. This should be the year she gets a shot.” This wouldn’t be new to Aponte; she’s worked at the highest levels of the league, holding roles with the Jets, Dolphins, Browns and the NFL office, all jobs that required sharp decision-making, strategic thinking, and a deep understanding of football operations. Last offseason she interviewed for the Chargers’ GM position, which ultimately went to Joe Hortiz. Former Jets GM Mike Tannenbaum, who has worked with Aponte, was recently hired by the Jets to help with the search for their next GM. Those close to Tannenbaum say he has a mantra: “The winning edge is to do things differently, not just better.” No one in NFL history has put a woman in charge of football operations. Being the first team to do so — with a hyper-qualified candidate in Aponte — would certainly fit that philosophy. The Houston Texans aren’t falling apart; it’s more like they’re going through some growing pains. After a strong start they’ve hit a few bumps, sitting at 7-5 as they head into Sunday’s road game at Jacksonville. I had high hopes for this team, even making them my preseason Super Bowl pick, but they just don’t look the same. Some of their toughest losses have come in heartbreaking fashion, like two games decided by walk-off field goals. And their second-half struggles are a real issue — turnovers and inconsistent execution have cost them in critical moments. They just haven’t been as sharp as they need to be to close out games. Advertisement It’s not all bad. One area in which they’ve improved is pass protection; it has been noticeably better since a Halloween night disaster against the Jets. That’s a big deal for C.J. Stroud and the offense. But a perfect example of their 2024 failings was last week. Kicker Ka’imi Fairbairn broke an NFL single-season record with his 12th field goal of 50-plus yards on Sunday, then missed a crucial 28-yarder late in the upset loss to the Titans. That pretty much sums up the Texans’ year — capable of doing incredible things, but falling short when it matters most. In Jacksonville, look for the Texans to get running back Joe Mixon going, which will help with play-action and with the team’s emphasis on taking care of the football. What’s wild is the Texans have lost two games this season in which they were plus-3 in turnover margin. Think about that: Teams win 91 percent of the time when they’re plus-3 in turnovers, yet the Texans have managed to lose twice under those conditions — that’s almost unheard of. It just shows how tough it’s been for them to close out games, even when the odds are stacked in their favor. GO DEEPER Can the Eagles seriously threaten the Lions in the NFC? The Minnesota Vikings signing former Giants starter Daniel Jones to their practice squad is all about creating opportunities and flexibility. For Jones, it’s a chance to continue his development under a solid coaching staff while contributing to the QB room. For the team, it’s a low-cost move that gives them a chance to evaluate a former starter without making a big commitment. With J.J. McCarthy Minnesota’s only quarterback under contract for 2025, this gives both sides a chance to get a feel for each other over the remainder of the season. It’s not a sign of anything definitive — this move doesn’t rule out Sam Darnold returning next year, and it’s certainly not an indication that McCarthy’s recovery is running behind. It’s simply a smart way for the Vikings to explore their options and keep their quarterback situation flexible for the future. Keep in mind that Darnold’s price might continue to go up as teams evaluate the draft and available free-agent quarterbacks. Front office executives believe that his experience and performance in Minnesota this season will make Darnold’s market competitive in March. There’s something about the situations of Daniel Jones and Saquon Barkley that feels oddly familiar, and then it hit me: It’s almost a mirror image of what happened with the Tennessee Titans back in 2020. Both teams faced the same dilemma after playoff seasons: How to keep their quarterback and running back while working within tight salary-cap situations. The Titans chose to give Ryan Tannehill a big extension and use the franchise tag on Derrick Henry, eventually hammering out a long-term deal before training camp. That duo went on to help lead the Titans to 23 wins over the next two seasons, and the No. 1 seed in the AFC in 2022. The Giants followed a similar plan, signing Daniel Jones to a four-year, $160 million deal and tagging Saquon Barkley in an attempt to maintain continuity. They even sweetened Barkley’s deal with a $2 million signing bonus, but it was only a short-term fix. By the following offseason, Barkley hit free agency, and general manager Joe Schoen made the call, despite the owner John Mara’s concerns about letting “the face of the Giants” walk. We all know the story by now. Howie Roseman and the Eagles stepped in, scooping up Barkley and adding him to their already stacked offense. Now, Barkley is thriving in Philadelphia, emerging as an MVP candidate and elevating Jalen Hurts to new heights. Every time Barkley explodes for another long run, the Schoen decision gets brought back up. Advertisement Would Barkley have had the same impact on Jones in New York as Henry did for Tannehill in Tennessee? We’ll never know. After the tandem led the Giants to the divisional round of the playoffs in 2022 they played only two full games together; the last one was a 31-28 comeback win in Arizona in which Jones threw for 321 yards and Barkley scored twice. What’s clear, though, is that Barkley’s departure — and the Giants’ inability to stabilize their offense — has left them in limbo. With both Jones and Barkley gone, Schoen has been spotted scouting quarterbacks like Shedeur Sanders at Colorado, signaling the Giants’ rebuild and search for long-term answers. It’s been said that Mara doesn’t want to fire Schoen or head coach Brian Daboll but there’s still a month of football left that could force the owner to make a move. The sticky part of this situation is Schoen and Daboll are seen as a tandem. The question remains: Would Mara be willing to fire one and keep the other, or do they both go if this continues to spin out of control? Meanwhile, Barkley’s move to Philadelphia has been transformative, almost haunting, leaving Giants fans to wonder what could have been if their duo had stayed intact.

 Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox. It’s been really hard to find a front office executive or coach in football who would willingly sign up for “Hard Knocks” again — anyone with a social media account can’t avoid the clip of the Giants deciding to let Barkley go. Every time we think the story is going to die, it comes back to life. Barkley’s success is the fuel. After what happened last summer, organizations have to wonder: Is the drama and exposure worth the hit to our team’s image? Think about it. The Giants were front and center this offseason, and what did it do? It put their handling of Barkley and safety Xavier McKinney under an intense spotlight. Everyone saw it. As an NFL executive explained to me: “Nobody wants to be embarrassed on camera, and if there’s any owner who despises public embarrassment it’s John Mara. I feel for him.” The debates about whether to pay Barkley his worth, or to extend McKinney’s contract, weren’t just whispers in the front office — they were out there for fans and media to dissect. And now look where we are. Barkley lands with the Eagles and is not just good, but MVP-level good. Meanwhile, McKinney, the guy the Giants lowballed and undervalued, goes to Green Bay and is having the kind of season that puts him in the Defensive Player of the Year conversation. Both of them are thriving. And the Giants? They’re left looking like they completely fumbled two franchise cornerstones. Fans who were already critical when the decisions were made now have the receipts, video evidence of the team essentially saying: Yeah, we’re not sure these guys are worth it. Moving forward, why would you volunteer for that? Why let the world see your process, especially when the stakes are this high? So will another team do “Hard Knocks”? Maybe. But after what happened with the Giants, I wouldn’t blame any GM who politely declines. In the spirit of the season… Eagles fans are thankful for Nick Sirianni shaving his head: The ultimate “we need to change the vibes” move came when Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni, facing heavy criticism, debuted a freshly shaved head for the team’s Week 6 matchup against the Browns. At the time, the Eagles were 2-2 and the pressure was mounting. Owner Jeffrey Lurie and GM Howie Roseman, who firmly believe they’ve built a championship-caliber roster, knew that without some sort of shift, Sirianni’s future in Philly could look bleak. Advertisement The Eagles have turned things around in remarkable fashion, going on a six-game winning streak. While the haircut itself didn’t work magic, Sirianni’s willingness to embrace change — symbolic as it may have been — helped reset the tone for the team. Now in his fourth season, Sirianni has the Eagles poised for a fourth straight playoff appearance, and with the coordinators Roseman set him up with (Kellen Moore on offense and Vic Fangio on defense), Philly looks ready for another deep postseason run. Keep in mind, Lurie and Roseman still see this as a Super Bowl roster, and Sirianni’s leadership is crucial to making that vision a reality. The six New England states are thankful for the Patriots rejecting massive draft night offers for the third pick: “Don’t get cute” is the unofficial NFL draft motto, and the Patriots took it to heart last spring. Remember, the organization held the third overall pick and received significant trade offers from teams eager to select North Carolina quarterback Drake Maye. The Minnesota Vikings proposed a package that included the 11th and 23rd picks in the 2024 draft, along with a ’25 first-round selection. The New York Giants also made a substantial offer, including their 2024 first-round pick and a ’25 first-rounder. Despite these proposals, the Patriots chose to retain their pick and selected Drake Maye as their quarterback of the future. Based on what we’ve seen and what people around the league think of Maye already, Patriots fans should be elated. The Steelers are thankful for Arthur Smith’s arrival: For the first time since Ben Roethlisberger’s heyday, it appears Steelers fans are not calling for the firing of their offensive coordinator. Former Falcons head coach Arthur Smith was brought into Pittsburgh because his coaching philosophy aligns perfectly with the Steelers’ identity: tough, physical football with an emphasis on the run game. During his time with the Tennessee Titans, he crafted one of the league’s most effective rushing attacks, helping Derrick Henry emerge as a superstar while balancing the run game with effective play-action designs. Smith’s adaptability is another key strength. He’s shown he can tailor his offense to fit the personnel he has, which is exactly what the Steelers need as they continue to develop their young offensive core around Russell Wilson. I expect Smith’s name to come back up during the head-coach hiring cycle in January. The Ravens are thankful for the hesitance of 31 other NFL teams: During the 2023 offseason, when Lamar Jackson received the non-exclusive franchise tag, teams across the league had the chance to negotiate with him. If any team had signed Jackson to an offer sheet, the Ravens would have had the ability to match it or accept two first-round picks as compensation. Remarkably, no team stepped up. Let that sink in. As a result, the Ravens retained Jackson and signed him to a five-year, $260 million extension in April 2023, including $185 million guaranteed, making him the highest-paid player in NFL history at the time. Looking back, it’s hard to believe no other team made a move for one of the league’s most electrifying players. Jackson isn’t just Baltimore’s quarterback, he’s their heartbeat. Week after week, his dynamic playmaking — whether he’s evading defenders to extend plays, threading a perfect pass, or breaking off a game-changing run — gives Baltimore a shot to win regardless of anything else. The rest of the league’s hesitation was a gift to the Ravens, one they’ll be thankful for every time Lamar Jackson takes the field.

These were doctors across the country who had not met and did not treat his 3-year-old daughter. Wynnie had brain cancer. This was how Rice, a Phillies assistant general manager, coped. Advertisement He had to gather as much information as he could. “I have still to this day never googled medulloblastoma,” said Cary Rice, his wife. “Because I can’t handle it. And I’m an analytical thinker, too. But if it’s too emotional, I can’t do it.” Everything about this felt impossible. Wynnie had lost her balance a few times — and now her parents faced a sudden and critical decision. Doctors at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) told the Rices they could not treat Wynnie with radiation; she was too young. The neurocognitive damage from radiation would prevent her from having an independent adult life. But her chances of survival were better with radiation. Ned Rice sought a second opinion from another leading children’s hospital. They told him it would be reckless not to use the treatment known to be the best — radiation — no matter the long-term effects. Rice had negotiated player contracts worth hundreds of millions — a high-stakes process that blends objective valuations with a subjective hand. But this was so different. It was a parent’s worst nightmare. Then Rice saw an email. A neuro-oncologist at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital named Richard Graham sent a lengthy reply to one of Rice’s cold calls. “I was really panicking,” Rice said. “He doesn’t even know who I am. He has his own patients and his own life.” Graham shared his advice. He became a frequent resource for Rice. These small, thoughtful moments accumulated. An unexpected gift at the doorstep. A video from Wynnie’s classmates. More responses from out-of-town doctors who would never meet Wynnie. Family members and friends who dropped everything to care for her two siblings. More gifts. Nurses who did not just look after Wynnie — but her parents, too. “It hits you over and over again,” Rice said. “There’s so many people that want to help. Everybody does it in their own way.” Advertisement Rice called his former boss. These weren’t like the late-night talks Matt Klentak and he often had while they ran baseball operations for the Phillies. But it felt normal, even though Klentak worked for the Milwaukee Brewers and Rice was on leave from the Phillies. The phone calls were cathartic. They could dive right into whatever was on Rice’s mind because Klentak knew the latest on Wynnie through an Instagram account the Rices created to chronicle her fight against cancer. It’s grown to more than 700 followers. Friends of friends of friends now reply to posts with, “Go Wynnie go!” The account is a raw look into life with pediatric cancer. It’s become a way for Ned and Cary to express complicated feelings. More than anything, it’s opened a door. “Caregiver burnout is a common phenomenon,” said Jane Minturn, Wynnie’s neuro-oncologist at CHOP, “and (Ned and Cary) have worked together to limit this.” Wynnie knows she is sick, but she does not understand what brain cancer is. The burden is shared by everyone around her. It is immense. Klentak could sense it, at times, during those late-night conversations. It is isolating. But Rice started to carry the goodness of those who had entered Wynnie’s universe. “I couldn’t really relate to what he was going through,” Klentak said. “And I think very few people could. But that doesn’t stop people from wanting to help.” The first sign of distress wasn’t alarming. Wynnie was a happy and healthy 3-year-old learning to move faster. That meant an occasional stumble. But Ned and Cary noticed their daughter’s balance wasn’t improving; it looked a fraction worse every week. They scheduled an appointment last December with their pediatrician. He threw cotton balls across the room to Wynnie, who was content to play the game. She had to bend over and fetch them. She wobbled. The pediatrician agreed something seemed off. He wanted her to see a neurologist at CHOP. The next appointment wasn’t for five months. He suggested the Rices go to the CHOP emergency room — not because it was urgent, but to assuage any immediate concerns. Advertisement They took Wynnie on Dec. 21, 2023. “Sure enough,” Rice said, “we had five neurologists in our room in a few minutes.” Wynnie didn’t have any other symptoms. The doctors scheduled an MRI in three weeks. It could be a muscular disease. Maybe it was vertigo. The Rices visited family for Christmas and Wynnie vomited twice. CHOP rescheduled the MRI for Dec. 29 and, that morning, Wynnie threw up again. She stumbled a few more times. A doctor summoned Ned and Cary during the MRI. He pointed to a screen. There was a large tumor in Wynnie’s brain. Wynnie was sedated for the MRI. The doctors wanted to do immediate surgery to remove the tumor. It was 4 p.m. on the Friday of a holiday weekend. The procedure lasted four hours; it would take a week to know whether the tumor was cancerous. Everything had spiraled so fast. “It’s a long process, but that was definitely a low point,” Rice said. “Those first few days — you took a mostly happy, healthy, sweet girl in for an outpatient MRI. She wakes up and you’re just like, ‘Will we ever see that girl again?’ That was really hard.” Then Wynnie was diagnosed with medulloblastoma. During that first trip to the E.R., before everything escalated, Rice was on the phone with Dave Dombrowski. Yoshinobu Yamamoto’s camp had instructed teams to make their last and best offers for the star free agent. Dombrowski communicated the number to Rice, who relayed it to Joel Wolfe, Yamamoto’s agent. Yamamoto signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers that night. Rice did not mention where he was. The day Wynnie underwent surgery, Rice called Phillies general manager Sam Fuld. He told him what was happening. Dombrowski was out of the country for a rare vacation; Rice talked to the Phillies’ president of baseball operations soon after New Year’s. “We’ll see you when it’s over,” Dombrowski told him. “Take everything you need. We’ll completely cover it. Don’t worry about anything.” Advertisement John Middleton called a few hours later. The Phillies’ principal owner offered to connect the family with doctors. Cary is a lawyer and her firm, Hangley Aronchick Segal Pudlin & Schiller, told her to take as much time as she needed. The Rices were fortunate; they had the means to pay for treatment and ample time to direct attention toward Wynnie. Acquaintances offered to help with whatever the family needed, but what they needed was a cure for cancer. All they wanted was normal. It was an uncomfortable situation that didn’t always have to be uncomfortable. “We just have this wonderful sort of village that kept showing up,” Cary said. “Kept calling. Kept texting. Even when I couldn’t respond. We’re just really grateful for that because we are still the same people. We still want to talk about things and do things that have nothing to do with cancer. We want to feel normal. We want to have hope for a normal future. The worst thing you can do or say is nothing.” Wynnie lived on the third floor at CHOP for almost eight months. The Rices opted against radiation. But her treatment — alternating cycles of chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplants — was so grueling that most of it was inpatient. Ned and Cary would take 24-hour shifts with Wynnie. They were ships passing in the night without much interaction. They found a community inside the hospital. “These nurses, I mean, they’re not just nurses,” Cary said. “They’re therapists. They’re friends. They’re cheerleaders.” Heidi Turner, one of Wynnie’s nurses, worked only overnights. That meant a lot of late-night bonding. Wynnie was discharged Aug. 23. The last night at CHOP, Turner handed Cary a letter to Wynnie. “I’m going to miss you so much,” Cary said to Turner. “We’ll stop by and hopefully I’ll see you.” She stared at Cary. The nurse replied she hoped to never see them again. “And,” Cary said, “it just stuck with me because it’s such a weird feeling to have.” Rice, who has been with the Phillies since 2016, stayed in contact with player agents and rival team executives last offseason but no longer served as the team’s main point of contact. The Phillies had started negotiating Zack Wheeler’s three-year, $126 million extension with B.B. Abbott, Wheeler’s agent at Wasserman. By January, Rice and Abbott had regular talks that started with 30 minutes about Wynnie and progressed to Wheeler’s contract. Advertisement “You’re never what you want to be for these families that are trying to talk about this,” Abbott said. “Because you just can’t be. It’s so all-consuming when you think, ‘My 3-year-old daughter has to go through this.’ It’s hard for parents and families to get their heads around exactly what’s getting ready to happen. The days and nights and hospitals. Watching their little girl lose her hair and be sick. All of this stuff that I knew was getting ready to come.” For years, Abbott has raised awareness for pediatric cancer research through the Rally Foundation and the National Pediatric Cancer Foundation. “I just wanted to be more of a sounding board for him,” Abbott said. The Rices weren’t keeping Wynnie’s illness hidden; it was more of an open secret. Abbott decided to help subtly. He asked Wheeler if he’d lend his name to a fundraiser for the National Pediatric Cancer Foundation near the end of spring training at the Phillies’ complex in Clearwater, Fla. Everyone knew it was for Wynnie, but no one had to say it. Word spread to the team’s front office and support staff. Dozens of Phillies employees had their heads shaved or orange streaks painted in their hair. Players made donations to the foundation. Reliever Matt Strahm’s wife, Megan, organized a present from the Phillies’ wives and girlfriends. “An unbelievable, huge, outrageous gift wagon for Wynnie,” Rice said. He had not met Strahm’s wife until later that summer at the team’s family day. “You’re amazing,” Rice said to her. With Wynnie in the hospital, Rice watched from afar this year as the Phillies sprinted to first place. “The Banatic!” Wynnie said to her dad whenever the furry green mascot appeared on the screen. There are certain rhythms to the baseball season. It is monotonous but contains specific checkpoints. The Rices had none of that with Wynnie. There were no regular updates on her prognosis. They will not know how successful her treatments were until a scan sometime in December. Their focus was singular. Get through today. “Wynnie, she’s something,” Cary said. “She has this tiny little voice and she’s so sweet and gentle with everything she does. We always kind of considered her this little delicate flower. But she’s a beast.” Two weeks ago, Wynnie had a birthday party. The Rices held it outdoors, at a playground by the Schuylkill River Park, because Wynnie’s immune system remains at risk. They had bagels and coffee and a face painter. Cary handed every kid a stuffed fox as a party favor. “Mr. Fox” was Wynnie’s constant companion in the hospital; Cary had so many at the house because people kept sending them when Wynnie would throw up on hers. Advertisement This was a celebration of Wynnie and the village that formed around her. “We were surrounded,” Cary said, “by about 85 of the friends who have been there for us in so many different ways this year.” Wynnie’s hair has started to grow back, although she wore a purple knit cap that covered her head at her party. Everyone could see the three purple flowers painted on her forehead. But Wynnie felt sick near the end of the party. She went to the emergency room with croup. Another challenge. But she was 4 and she was here. She wore her face paint to the E.R. (Top image: Dan Goldfarb / The Athletic. Photos: Ashley Blair Photography)  Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,Five-Time Grand Slam Champion Iga Swiatek Receives One-Month Doping Ban,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5954986/2024/11/28/iga-swiatek-doping-ban-tmz/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 21:02:41 +0000",The women’s world No. 2 tennis player tested positive for the prohibited substance trimetazidine.,"Tennis Iga Swiatek, the women’s world No. 2 tennis player, has received a one-month doping ban after testing positive for the banned substance trimetazidine (TMZ). The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) issued the ban on Wednesday November 27 and announced it publicly on Thursday, after ruling that the player’s level of fault was at the lowest end of the range for ‘No Significant Fault or Negligence’ and not intentional. Advertisement Having already served 22 days of the ban while the process was ongoing, Swiatek — a five-time Grand Slam winner who has spent more than 100 weeks as world No. 1 — has eight more days to serve and so will be eligible to play at the Australian Open in January. Swiatek, 23, tested positive for a trace concentration of TMZ, a drug normally used as heart medication for its ability to enhance blood flow, in an out-of-competition sample on August 12 ahead of the Cincinnati Open. Swiatek was informed of the positive test by the ITIA exactly one month later on September 12 and given a mandatory provisional suspension. Swiatek appealed the provisional suspension within 10 days of the original notice. The appeal was successful, so her provisional suspension was not publicly disclosed. This is in line with the TADP (Tennis Anti-Doping Programme) regulations. This is the same mechanism by which Jannik Sinner’s provisional suspensions, imposed after he tested positive for the anabolic steroid clostebol, were not disclosed. GO DEEPER Jannik Sinner's doping case explained: What WADA appeal means and what is at stake for tennis After submitting her medications and supplements to independent laboratories alongside hair samples, tests confirmed the presence of TMZ in one of the medications used by Swiatek: a melatonin supplement to manage her jetlag which does not require a prescription in Poland and some other EU countries. The contamination of the drug was also confirmed by an independent WADA-accredited laboratory, which was commissioned independently by the ITIA to confirm the results of the two independent laboratories. “Once the source of the TMZ had been established, it became clear that this was a highly unusual instance of a contaminated product, which in Poland is a regulated medicine,” said Karen Moorhouse, the chief executive of the ITIA. “The product does not have the same designation globally, and the fact that a product is a regulated medication in one country cannot of itself be sufficient to avoid any level of fault. Advertisement “Taking into account the nature of the medication, and all the circumstances, it does place that fault at the lowest end of the scale.” Following Swiatek’s successful appeal, the ITIA on October 4 recommended that Swiatek’s suspension be lifted. This allowed her to compete in WTA Finals in Saudi Arabia and the Billie Jean King Cup in Malaga. During the time of her provisional suspension, Swiatek missed the Korea Open, China Open, and Wuhan Open, which contributed to Swiatek losing her world No. 1 ranking to Aryna Sabalenka. At the time of those withdrawals, Swiatek said that her absence was due to “personal reasons”. The ITIA also confirmed in a statement on Thursday that Swiatek also forfeits prize money from the Cincinnati Open, the tournament directly following the test. The points Swiatek will lose for reaching the semifinals there will not affect her ranking. During this period, Swiatek also parted ways with her coach of three years Tomasz Wiktorowski in early October and replaced him with Wim Fissette. In a video statement on Thursday, she said: “This experience, the most difficult in my life so far, taught me a lot. “The whole thing will definitely stay with me for the rest of my life, it took a lot of strength, returning to training after this situation nearly broke my heart. So there were many tears and lots of sleepless nights. “The worst part of it was the uncertainty. I didn’t know what was going to happen with my career, how things would end or if I would be allowed to play tennis at all,” she said. GO DEEPER Iga Swiatek's tennis gifts are basically peerless. She just has to put her mind to them Analysis by Charlie Eccleshare On the face of it, this has been a pretty disastrous few months for tennis. Only three months on from news of men’s world No. 1 Jannik Sinner twice testing positive for a banned substance, the most high-profile and successful active women’s player has also been given a doping ban. Swiatek, ranked No.2 partly because of missing three events during the time of her mandatory provisional suspension, was the world No. 1 at the time of her positive test. Advertisement The verdict on both cases is that neither player was intentionally doping, but there will still be plenty of tennis fans who feel hugely dismayed by what has happened. The Sinner case led to a volley of criticism from some players about what they felt was favourable treatment, even though due process was followed at every stage. Likewise there was criticism of the fact that the investigation was done in private, even though again this followed ITIA protocols. We can expect similar comments in the wake of Swiatek’s case, with tennis inevitably facing questions around its integrity and credibility.

Season,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5954797/2024/11/28/mlb-thanksgiving-baseball-giving-thanks-2024/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 21:02:41 +0000","Plenty of people, teams, moments and milestones made it a special year, a columnist for The Athletic writes.","MLB It’s Thanksgiving, so I wanted to give thanks for the 2024 MLB season, which saw the best team in the regular season — the Los Angeles Dodgers — go on to win the World Series, but their impressive run was only one of many things that will stick with me. Here’s to the people, teams, moments and milestones that made it a special year. These are 24 reasons I’m thankful for MLB this year, and please share your own in the comments section. Thanks and Happy Thanksgiving to you and your families! 1. Freddie Freeman, who hammered a 10th-inning walk-off grand slam in Game 1 of the World Series, giving us yet another lifetime memory to go with the October blasts by Kirk Gibson, David Freese, Carlton Fisk, Joe Carter and company. 2. The MVP seasons of Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani. Judge had one of the best individual seasons in history, slashing .322/.458/.701 with a league-leading 58 home runs, 144 RBIs and 10.8 bWAR. Ohtani opened the 50-50 Club in unbelievable fashion, becoming the first player to hit 54 home runs and steal 59 bases in a season, while posting a 190 OPS+ and 9.2 WAR. 3. The Diamondbacks, who started the season by breaking the modern-era record for most runs scored in an inning on Opening Day, with 14 against the Rockies. 4. Elly De La Cruz, who became the first player to hit a 450-foot home run and an inside-the-park homer in the same game, on April 8 against the Milwaukee Brewers. 5. Gunnar Henderson, who became the youngest player in major-league history to hit 10 home runs before May 1. 6. Juan Soto, who became the first major leaguer to walk 669 times before he celebrated his 26th birthday, breaking the record held by Mickey Mantle. GO DEEPER Ranking Juan Soto's free-agent suitors: Which team will sign him? And for how much? 7. Francisco Lindor, who became the first shortstop to hit at least 25 home runs and steal 25 bases in three seasons (2018, ’23, ’24). Oh, and one of those homers broke up a no-hitter in the ninth, tying a game in Toronto the Mets somehow went on to win. 8. This year’s trade deadline. Some called it a “dudline,” but it still delivered: The Dodgers acquired Jack Flaherty, Tommy Edman and Michael Kopech; the Padres landed Tanner Scott; the Royals got Lucas Erceg; the Yankees traded for Jazz Chisholm Jr.; the Astros picked up Yusei Kikuchi. All of those trades were significant in helping their respective teams make the playoffs. 9. The emergence of so many talented young position players, from Jackson Merrill to Jackson Chourio to Colton Cowser to Austin Wells to Wilyer Abreu, among others. 10. Paul Skenes — who started the All-Star Game in his first season — and Luis Gil, who both wowed on the mound and pitched their way to Rookie of the Year honors. GO DEEPER Paul Skenes Ks Juan Soto, Aaron Judge to cap most dominant rookie pitching season in 50 years 11. Speaking of debuts, let’s hear it for new leadership in Baltimore, as David Rubenstein became the Orioles’ principal owner. Hopefully the ownership change will lead to more resources for a fan base that has deserved better. 12. Chris Sale, who had a remarkable comeback season that led to the first Cy Young Award of his career. And Tarik Skubal, another first-time Cy Young winner, who authored the best season of any starting pitcher in the sport. Advertisement 13. Luis Arraez, who became the first player in major-league history to win three consecutive batting titles with three different teams — the Twins, Marlins and Padres. 14. Emmanuel Clase, who had one of the most dominant seasons ever by a closer, with a 0.61 ERA over 74 games. GO DEEPER Baggarly: It's time for the BBWAA to add a Reliever of the Year Award 15. The Skenes-Ohtani matchup on June 5: Skenes strikes him out on three pitches in the first, then Ohtani goes yard in his next at-bat. A special moment of stars squaring off.  16. There were four no-hitters to celebrate. Hat tip to Ronel Blanco of the Astros, Dylan Cease of the Padres, Blake Snell of the Giants, and Shota Imanaga, Nate Pearson and Porter Hodge, who threw a combined no-no for the Cubs. 17. I’m thankful that Buster Posey, who came out of retirement after winning three World Series as a player, decided to take on the challenge — and long hours — of running a baseball operations department, for his San Francisco Giants. The game is a better place when former players like him give back. 18. A warm welcome back to future Hall of Fame Manager Terry Francona, who came out of retirement to sign a three-year contract to manage the Cincinnati Reds. It’ll be good to see Tito back in the dugout. GO DEEPER Terry Francona introduced as Reds manager: 'It just felt right' to return to Cincinnati 19. Props to the Kansas City Royals, who won 30 more games this year — improving from 56-106 in 2023 to 86-76 in 2024 — and made the playoffs. A turnaround for the ages. 20. Speaking of turnarounds, a hat tip to two teams that put together signature rallies after subpar starts: the OMG Mets, who took their fans on a wild ride, making the playoffs on the final day of the regular season and then advancing to the NLCS; and the Detroit Tigers, who went from trade-deadline sellers to “pitching chaos” postseason participants, making the playoffs, for the first time in a decade, in dramatic fashion — and winning a series to boot. 21. On the other hand, I’m thankful there is no relegation in MLB, otherwise the White Sox would no longer be part of the big leagues after the worst season I’ve seen in my lifetime. Here’s to turning the page. 22. Let’s tip our caps to the stars of the game who decided to retire, from Joey Votto to Stephen Strasburg to Cole Hamels to Kevin Kiermaier to Brandon Crawford. GO DEEPER How Joey Votto knew it was time — 'I'm expired' — and what he thinks could be next 23. And let’s give a standing O to the city of Oakland, which capped 57 years of major-league baseball in the Coliseum. There were so many things that made baseball in Oakland special and so many superstars in green and gold — from Reggie Jackson to Rickey Henderson to Catfish Hunter to Rollie Fingers to Dennis Eckersley to Vida Blue to Dave Stewart to Mark McGwire — who made their mark on the game. GO DEEPER Thank you, Oakland A’s 24. Finally, and most importantly, I’m thankful for the fans of baseball, the very best in the whole wide world!

NYT > Sports,Marc Bergevin Went From the Spotlight to Near-Obscurity. That’s Fine With Him.,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5952513/2024/11/28/marc-bergevin-canadiens-firing/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 21:02:41 +0000","Three years ago, the Montreal Canadiens fired their general manager. He then disappeared from the media glare.","NHL Marc Bergevin was fired three years ago today by the Montreal Canadiens and completely disappeared from the media glare, eventually settling into an enjoyable gig with the Los Angeles Kings. The extreme lifestyle change of going from the constant public spotlight as Habs GM for nearly a decade to near-obscurity as senior adviser without a public profile with the Kings while living in Redondo Beach, Calif., well, that suits Bergevin just fine. Advertisement “I have no regrets about my time in Montreal,” Bergevin told The Athletic this week. “It was a great nine and a half years, and I have nothing but positive memories. But there is certainly a spotlight there. “Here, you go to Starbucks to get your coffee in the morning and nobody knows who you are.” Which is exactly what he needed. Three years to decompress. “After I left Montreal, I remember thinking I wanted to be a GM again right away, but looking back, it would have been the wrong thing for me to jump back right in,” Bergevin said. “I needed this time to reenergize.” It’s not like he’s been sitting on his hands. He’s working full-time for Rob Blake, advising and traveling and doing whatever the Kings GM needs. But he’s been able to do it in the shadows. In his first media interview since his firing in Montreal on Nov. 28, 2021, Bergevin touched on a number of topics with The Athletic. Let’s dive in. Bergevin says Habs owner Geoff Molson approached him with a contract extension right after the team reached the ’21 Cup Final. His contract was expiring a year later. “I decided that for me, it was best to move forward,” Bergevin said. “Time had come. It was good for both of us to move in a different direction. Geoff was very good, very fair. But I told him, ‘Geoff, I’m going to finish my last year that’s left and then I’m going to move on.’ He was good with that. He understood.” The reality was that Bergevin was pretty much fried by one of the sport’s most demanding jobs. And not just from a hockey point of view. “COVID took a toll on me — not physically, but as you know Montreal, Quebec, was really strict with the rules on COVID, and all my kids were in the States,” Bergevin said. “There was a 14-day quarantine then (once entering Quebec). I didn’t see my kids for almost a year. Advertisement “When Geoff made me the offer, I just felt there was no light at the end of the tunnel. The whole COVID thing for me beat me up, mentally, not seeing my kids.” As it turns out, with Shea Weber playing his last NHL game in that 2021 Cup Final and Carey Price missing almost all of the following season, the end of an era for Bergevin’s team was happening even more quickly than anyone would have predicted. A 6-15-2 start to the season led to Bergevin’s firing. “I knew a change was coming (because they had mutually agreed it was his last season), but it’s always a shock even though you prepare for it,” Bergevin said. “It was done the right way from Geoff’s side.” Before Bergevin landed in Montreal as Habs GM on May 2, 2012, he was known in hockey circles for his sense of humor. During his playing career and then working his way up the scouting ranks with the Chicago Blackhawks, he was the life of the party. This is the guy who once picked up a plant walking out of a GMs meeting in Florida to avoid the cameras. This is one creative way to avoid being spotted. #Canadiens GM Marc Bergevin hides behind a plant and (almost) slips right past everyone. pic.twitter.com/XHEk12Ev2Z — Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) March 6, 2017  But a decade in that Habs job, through all the drama, chipped away at that personable, funny guy. The strain of the job was evident on his face by the end. “Yeah that’s fair,” Bergevin said. “And it’s not like you change as a person, but you’re more on your guard because you feel like you have a spotlight on you every second of the day. And everything you said could be picked apart. So you’re more on your guard. “But honestly, I enjoyed every second of my time there in Montreal. Even though there were times I didn’t feel like I did. But now that I can look back after a few years, yeah.” Advertisement He feels the good moves outweighed the mistakes, but yes, obviously, there were mistakes. “Looking back I feel our average was pretty good,” he said. One of the characteristics of Bergevin’s time in Montreal was smaller to medium moves that ended up being beneficial. They all add up. Acquiring Marco Scandella for a fourth-round pick from the Buffalo Sabres, then flipping him to the St. Louis Blues seven weeks later for second- and fourth-round picks. Getting Brett Kulak from the Calgary Flames for Matt Taormina and Rinat Valiev. One that wasn’t seen as big at the time: Getting Phillip Danault and a second-rounder from Chicago for pending UFAs Dale Weise and Tomas Fleischmann. That second-round pick became Alexander Romanov. “I learned from Rick Dudley,” Bergevin said. “He said once to me, ‘Berg, you can’t go for the home run all the time. Sometimes you make your team better a little bit here, a little bit there. And eventually you get to where you want to be.’ I always kept that in mind. I think we did that in Montreal. We hit a lot of singles.” Obviously, he also swung for the fences on some trades, including P.K. Subban for Shea Weber in June 2016. “P.K. was a very good player, but we needed something different,” Bergevin said. “To get Shea Weber, you had to give up a pretty good asset. I think it worked out for both teams. Because both teams went to the Final. Nashville did with P.K. (in 2017), and we did with Shea. “When a trade is made, both GMs think it’s going to work out for their teams, but I think the best ones are the ones that do actually work out for both teams.” Bergevin was invited by Weber to his recent Hockey Hall of Fame induction, which was special for him. “I’m glad that I went,” Bergevin said. “I told him, ‘I’m honored you’re asking me to go.’ And he said, ‘Berg, I want you to be there.’ That meant a lot to me.” GO DEEPER LeBrun: Shea Weber, David Poile enter Hall of Fame together on good terms after lengthy rift over trade, offer sheet The Habs made huge news on July 1, 2019, when they signed star center Sebastian Aho to an offer sheet. The five-year, $42.295 million was front-loaded and mostly made up of signing bonuses, including $11.3 million in July 2019 and $9.87 million in July 2020. The gamble for Montreal was that Hurricanes owner Tom Dundon wouldn’t have the stomach to pay that money up front. But Dundon didn’t blink. Advertisement In retrospect, Bergevin thinks he could have done it differently. “Aho was the right player to give an offer sheet to, but I wish it would have been a different offer sheet,” Bergevin said. “Would I take that back? Yes. But honestly, at the time, we thought we would get the player based on the signing bonuses, which (Tom) Dundon matched. It ended up being a good contract for them. “Lesson learned, honestly. Lesson learned. If I ever become a GM again, that’s a lesson I can use moving forward if it happens.” The offer sheet also made mortal enemies, at the time, of owners Dundon and Molson. That fueled Carolina’s revenge offer sheet on Jesperi Kotkaniemi in August 2021, a one-year, $6.1 million deal. The Habs didn’t match. “He wasn’t going to do a long-term deal with us because he wanted a change of scenery,” Bergevin said of Kotkaniemi. And well, the Canadiens didn’t feel Kotkaniemi was worth $6.1 million. So that decision wasn’t hard. Carolina GM Don Waddell did reach out to see if a trade could be worked out instead. The rumor at the time was that Bergevin tried to get a young Seth Jarvis back. “That’s true,” he confirmed. Waddell, not surprisingly, didn’t want to move Jarvis, who was drafted 13th the previous year. Drafting Kotkaniemi third in the 2018 draft was a decision fueled by a desperate need at center for the Habs. Obviously taking him one spot ahead of winger Brady Tkachuk, who went next to the Ottawa Senators, is tough to digest for Habs fans now. “I look back at that, honestly, if you remember, Brady had a really tough season at BU,” Bergevin said. “He didn’t score for a long time. The skating was an issue. At the time in Montreal, all I would hear is (Filip) Zadina, Zadina, Zadina … because he was playing in Halifax (of the Quebec League). “Obviously, now you would say, ‘Tkachuk, well of course.'” Advertisement But the need to draft a center was real. “We didn’t have any centermen, and we were looking at a guy that was a tall, lanky center,” Bergevin said. “He had some good hockey as a 17-year-old. I wish KK the best. I think there’s more there, but time will tell.” Bergevin’s last draft as Habs GM brought his most controversial moment, stunning the hockey world by taking Logan Mailloux 31st in 2021. Mailloux had asked NHL teams not to draft him after reports surfaced that he was convicted and fined in a Swedish court in December 2020 for disseminating offensive photography. He had taken a photo of a woman performing a sex act without her consent and circulated it among some teammates. The Habs took him anyway. Bergevin at the time described what Mailloux had done as “unacceptable,” but many felt, as The Athletic’s Arpon Basu wrote, that the pick signaled that for the Canadiens, “Improving their hockey team is more important than basic, common decency.” The story has died down over time, in part because it sounds like Mailloux has put in work to improve and educate himself. He remains part of the organization, has played six NHL games and is currently with AHL Laval. “It’s nice to see the young man has done the necessary things, to earn a second chance,” Bergevin said, declining to say anything else on the matter. I suspect his decision not to say more comes down to the regrettable decision involving other people around him in the organization. Most notably, of course, ownership signed off on it. Whatever the case, if Bergevin is to become an NHL GM again one day, he will have to answer this question in more detail as part of his interview process with his next NHL owner. Current Canadiens leadership inherited good young players, such as Nick Suzuki and Cole Caufield, but also, it must be pointed out, some hefty contracts in Brendan Gallagher and Josh Anderson. Advertisement But Bergevin feels he left Jeff Gorton and Kent Hughes decent pieces to rebuild with. “I never traded a first-round pick when I was there,” Bergevin said. “Not that I wouldn’t, but I didn’t. And you can look at the draft picks I left them. And I’m proud of that. I didn’t put that franchise in a bad spot. People might argue that, but I don’t know where you would argue that.” Gallagher’s six-year, $39 million extension, signed in October 2020 and expiring in 2027, is one some would point to, although he’s had a renaissance season in 2024-25. “He had three years of 30 goals in a row (before signing the extension),” Bergevin said. “You have to pay for that. Every GM sometimes gives one or two years too much in contracts.” And yes, the Carey Price contract is still on Montreal’s books through 2026. Bergevin signed Price to an eight-year, $84-million extension July 2, 2017. Of course it was too many years, but the alternative was to let the best goalie in the world walk a year later. “You had to sign him, but then injuries … nobody knew that — he didn’t know that — would happen,” Bergevin said. Before the extension was signed, did other teams call to gauge where things were with Price to see if a trade was possible? Like maybe at the draft? Nope. “Nobody ever called,” Bergevin said. Because it was obvious the Habs were going to do all they could to sign Price. As senior adviser, Bergevin travels to scout games and spends time with the Kings coaching staff every week. “I’ll come in most days and be part of all our discussions as a group,” Bergevin said. “I’ll watch other games, other teams, for either trades or free agency.” Last week, Bergevin went to games in Vegas, Utah, Philadelphia and Chicago. Bergevin played with Blake and Kings president Luc Robitaille on Canada’s world championship gold medal team in 1994. They remained close afterward. Advertisement The Kings hired him in January 2022. “They wanted a different set of eyes,” Bergevin said. “Marc has been a terrific addition to our staff,” Blake said via text. “Really enjoys the scouting aspect of managing. Has a busy travel schedule where he watches many live games with very thorough reports on players who may or may not fit with us. His welcoming personality allows him to interact with the coaching staff on a daily basis. Sharing his thoughts on our team and what is happening around the league.” Bergevin has interviewed for three GM openings since leaving Montreal: in Toronto in May 2023 when Brad Treliving was hired, in Pittsburgh around the same time in 2023 when Kyle Dubas was hired and in Columbus this past offseason when Waddell got the gig. “When teams reach out, it’s always good to do it,” Bergevin said. Treliving was always the front-runner for the Toronto job, but Bergevin appreciated interviewing with Leafs president Brendan Shanahan. “I knew Toronto a bit better because of my days with Montreal,” Bergevin said. “But Tree is a good general manager. After the announcement was made with Tree, I ran into Shanny and said, ‘Thank you for the opportunity.’ “There’s no hard feelings that I wasn’t picked. It’s a business. I wished him the best.” No doubt there will be more GM interviews, but whether or not that produces another GM gig remains to be seen. “I’m in a good place here with Blakey and the staff. I really am,” Bergevin said. “If it turns out that I stay here for three, four, five years instead, I’m really good with that. But do I want to try again? I think we did enough good things in Montreal to have another crack at it. But that’s not my decision. “I’ve never stopped working since the day I got let go. I’ve stayed really in touch with the game and the players.” Advertisement Regardless of what the future holds, he’s now better able to appreciate his time as Habs GM. “Geoff Molson was always supportive,” Bergevin said. “I have nothing but respect for him. And I wish the best of luck in Montreal. Because they have a great fan base, great ownership, and I know Kent and Gorts, and they’re good people. I wish everybody there the best. I really mean that.” (Photo: Minas Panagiotakis / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,The Division Making N.F.L. History,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5952981/2024/11/28/lions-bears-packers-vikings-nfc-north/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 21:02:41 +0000",The N.F.C. North is the first division since the 1970 merger to feature three teams with at least eight victories through Week 12.,"NFL The NFL’s Thanksgiving schedule delivers three-fourths of what could become the most dominant division since the league realigned in 2002. The 2024 NFC North is the first division since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger to feature three teams with at least eight victories through Week 12, led by the 10-1 Detroit Lions, who have tied an all-time NFL mark for most victories in a season by at least 38 points (three, all outside the division). Advertisement With the Lions facing the division-rival Chicago Bears (4-7) in the early game Thursday before the 8-3 Green Bay Packers play the late game against the AFC East’s Miami Dolphins, the 2024 NFC North — which also includes the 9-2 Minnesota Vikings — stands apart. It could well decide who takes home the Lombardi Trophy. The Lions (+260), Packers (+750) and Vikings (+850) are among the top seven in Super Bowl odds, per BetMGM, and the top four in odds to win the NFC, along with the Philadelphia Eagles (+325). The Lions remain Super Bowl favorites, comfortably ahead of the Kansas City Chiefs (+450), while the NFC North has the shortest odds to produce the champion at +175, half of the second-place AFC West (+350). GO DEEPER Jared Goff hit rock bottom. A conversation with Dan Campbell ignited his unlikely comeback The chart below shows where all eight divisions have ranked each season since the league realigned in 2002 in point margin per game (X-axis) and win rate (Y-axis) in non-divisional games through the first 12 weeks of each season. The 2024 NFC North (red dot) ranks first among these 184 divisional seasons in average point margin (+9.5) and second in win rate (.765), per TruMedia. Only the 2022 NFC East (26-7) had a better record than the 2024 NFC North (26-8) in non-division games through Week 12, but the current NFC North had a far better average point margin (+9.5 to +5.1) in these games. Here’s what you need to know about where the NFC North stands and what it must do to become the most dominant division over a full season since realignment. The scheduling rotation (which we’ll explore later) is part of the equation, but this level of dominance is extreme. AFC North teams lead the way in total victories over opponents who currently have winning records (11) and total non-divisional victories in these games (nine). The NFC North is second with eight and six. Since 2002, the NFC North’s +323 point margin ranks first by 64 points over the runner-up 2013 NFC West (+259) through Week 12. That is larger than the difference between the 2013 NFC West and the sixth-ranked division in that span, the 2011 NFC North (+200). The table below shows the only divisions since 2002 with PPG margins greater than 7.0 through Week 12, led by the 2024 NFC North. The 2024 NFC North ranks first among 184 divisions since 2002 in defensive EPA per play against non-division opponents, compared to a No. 69 ranking in offensive EPA per play. All four NFC North teams rank among the NFL’s top 10 in defensive EPA per play across all games this season. They are all in the top five when isolating non-divisional games only. The Lions and Packers also rank among the top 10 on offense across all games and in non-division games. GO DEEPER Vikings, Packers coaches make the NFC North the NFL’s best division: Sando’s Pick Six NFC North teams are 8-0 with a +144 differential against the Jacksonville Jaguars and Tennessee Titans. They are 14-2 with a +197 differential against the full AFC South. Bad teams get blown out. The NFC North has played its share of them. Forty-five percent of the +323 differential in non-division games stems from facing the Jaguars and Titans, while 61 percent stems from facing the AFC South overall. The six other divisions are a combined 9-9 against the AFC South, with a +14 differential. That includes a 6-7 mark with a +21 differential for AFC East teams. Advertisement The Bears are the only NFC North team without a victory over a team that currently has a winning record. They are 0-3 in those matchups, headlined by their defeat at Washington on a Jayden Daniels Hail Mary. The rest of the NFC North has a 6-1 record in those games, with three victories over Houston, two over Arizona and one over Seattle. The NFC North’s record would be 6-3 if we adjusted the parameters to feature non-divisional games against teams that had winning records at kickoff. Victories over Dallas, San Francisco and Tampa Bay would come into play. The NFL pushes most division games later in the season for competitive reasons. That leaves only 10 remaining non-division games for the NFC North to build upon its dominance or fall in the rankings. Those games are listed below chronologically and with point spreads pulled together from various sources where available. The 2013 NFC North holds the full-season record for PPG margin against non-divisional opponents since realignment (+359 in 40 games, for 8.975 per game). That division featured the 13-3 Super Bowl champion Seahawks, the Jim Harbaugh-coached 49ers (12-4), the Bruce Arians-coached Cardinals (10-6) and the 7-9 Rams. NFC North teams must outscore their 10 remaining non-divisional opponents by 72 points to beat the 2013 NFC West for the best full-season differential since 2002. That would leave the division +395 in 44 games for a +8.977 PPG differential. The best full-season record against non-divisional opponents since 2002 is shared by the 2013 NFC West and the 2007 NFC South at 30-10 (.750). The NFC North (currently .765 at 26-8) would equal that mark with a 7-3 finish against foes outside the division. Advertisement The best team in the NFC North (Detroit) will be at home for the division’s toughest remaining opponent (Buffalo). The Seahawks’ recent improvement on defense could complicate efforts for Chicago, Minnesota and Green Bay to win at Seattle. The 49ers’ decline could help Chicago (Week 14) and Detroit (Week 17). Green Bay and Minnesota can set the tone in Week 13. Both are favored at home against non-division opponents.

NYT > Sports,How a Nebraska Volleyball Star Is Leaving a Troubled Off-Season Behind Her,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5953520/2024/11/28/harper-murray-nebraska-volleyball-john-cook/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 21:02:41 +0000","Harper Murray has fought back from public struggles with her emotional health this season, helped in part by her bond with Coach John Cook.","College Sports LINCOLN, Neb. — Harper Murray is smiling and laughing every day. And she’s playing her best volleyball in two seasons at Nebraska. This alone lifts spirits among Murray’s teammates. Her happiness matters to them. The Huskers saw Murray spiral last spring amid public struggles with her emotional health. Two legal incidents derailed her offseason after Murray was named the top freshman in the Big Ten and a third-team All-American. Advertisement But her path is about more than rejuvenation. The college volleyball community and Nebraska’s legion of fans have taken notice this fall of Murray’s bond with Nebraska coach John Cook. “The connection that he has with Harper is extremely special,” senior co-captain Lexi Rodriguez said. “I think anyone can see it, whether you’re on the court or not.” Murray’s rebound is defined in part by her uncommon relationship with the 68-year coach who stood up for her like the father she lost 13 years ago. Murray, 19, brings out a soft side in Cook that few have seen. He cares for her like a daughter. “It’s unconditional love,” said Cook, a four-time national champion coach in his 25th season at Nebraska. “That’s really what it is. In this day and age, with this generation, you’ve got to have that if you’re going to coach.” They star together in TikTok videos. She created an account for him and controls the content, using his phone. He revels in the millions of views. “He’s always asking what we’re going to do next?” Murray said. “He loves it.” GO DEEPER From cowboy to coach, Nebraska's John Cook fuels a volleyball rise If the Huskers want to make a request of the coach — maybe it’s an adjustment to their uniforms or a tweak in the schedule — Murray gets nominated. “You ask” teammates tell her, she said, “because he’ll say yes to you.” Cook doesn’t say that Murray is his favorite. But the Huskers know it to be true. And it’s OK. She needs him in her life.  No. 2 Nebraska enters the final week of the regular season at 28-1 and perfect in the Big Ten. It has won 54 of 59 sets in league matches and plays at No. 4 Penn State on Friday, followed by a Saturday visit to Maryland. The postseason bracket reveal is on Sunday. Murray’s 3.29 kills per set and 27 service aces lead the Huskers. She’s the No. 1 attacking option on the most balanced offensive team in the nation. Her defense in the back row as a six-rotation player has progressed more than any area of her game. Advertisement But three months ago, Murray was terrified to walk onto the court in front of Nebraska’s fans for the preseason Red-White scrimmage. She wondered what people would think, Cook said. What would they say about her? Would she get booed? Back up eight months. Last December, Texas swept top-seeded Nebraska in the national championship match. Murray did not play well, especially in receiving the Longhorns’ serves. At the news conference that followed the loss, she was despondent. A reporter asked her about the future. “I think we’re going to win three national championships (in) the next three years,” Murray said. The comment blew up on social media. Murray digested the reactions and buried herself in negativity. She fell into a depression that lasted for months. On April 5, she was cited for DUI in Lincoln. Less than a month later, she got caught on security camera shoplifting $65 of jewelry at a sporting goods store. ESPN featured the rise and fall of Murray in an hour-long documentary, “No Place Like Nebraska.” It aired in August, tracking the Huskers’ 2023 season and the months after it. Murray lost her spot on the U.S. women’s U21 team. Family members worried that she might physically harm herself. Her mother, Sarah, feared that Cook would dismiss Harper from the team at Nebraska. Every time Cook talked to Sarah for weeks, she sought reassurance about Harper’s roster status. Public pressure existed for him to dump her. “The thought crossed my mind,” Harper said. “But I think I knew deep down that he wasn’t going to give up on me that easily.” Cook and Nebraska assistant coach Jaylen Reyes began to recruit Murray before she started high school in Ann Arbor, Michigan. She attended the Huskers’ Dream Team camp as an eighth-grader and fell for everything about the Nebraska program As Murray developed into the No. 1-rated prospect in the 2023 class, her recruiting intensified. She was named the Gatorade Player of the Year and had her choice of top schools. But she valued her initial impressions of Nebraska, and Cook won over her mom, in part, by making sure she knew he would watch over Harper and let Sarah know if her daughter made any poor decisions. Advertisement It’s a message that Cook tells the parents of every player he recruits. “It’s one thing to say that,” Harper said. “It’s another to act on it.” When her life veered off the rails this year, Cook did not waver. “I learned a long time ago that you do everything you can before you give up on these kids,” the coach said. Murray’s struggles strengthened Cook’s commitment to her — not to be construed as going easy on her. In the coach, Harper said, she saw a role model. He supported her, she said, “when other people probably wouldn’t have.” “I look up to him,” Murray said, “and just the way he approaches every day in life. It’s different than anyone I’ve ever met.” Cook helped Murray make a checklist of items required to restore her good standing with the Huskers. She completed extensive community service and more than 100 hours of therapy, which continues in addition to court-ordered probation. Within the team environment, Murray worked to regain trust. Cook often hears from former athletes and observers that they admire Murray’s growth. He marvels at her resolve. Many athletes in her situation, he said, would have left this year in search of a fresh start. She couldn’t leave. Not after all that Cook had done to help her. “He wasn’t happy with me,” Murray said. “But at the same time, he promised my mom that he would be there for me. And that’s exactly what he did. He held me accountable. But he gave me grace. “I have a lot of love and respect for him. I wouldn’t be the person or the player I am without him. And I know that I owe a lot to him. One of my biggest goals in life is to make him proud, especially because I put our program through a lot. I put us in the gutter at some points.” Murray’s father, Vada, died when she was 6. He was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2008 and lived three years with the disease until age 43. Vada was a standout safety on the Michigan football team from 1987-90, playing in three Rose Bowls. He graduated to work as a police officer in Ann Arbor. Harper holds only fragmented memories of Vada. But the absence of her father haunts her. She wears his jersey No. 27, just as her sister, Kendall, did with Michigan volleyball from 2020 to 2023. Advertisement The loss that Harper experienced has impacted Cook’s approach to their relationship. “There’s a coach-player relationship,” Cook said, “but I also think there’s a … I don’t want to call it father-daughter, because I’m not her father. But it’s built on trust.” Harper has seen their bond grow most in the way they communicate. The TikTok videos allow the public to catch a glimpse. But the roots of their connection run much deeper. On the court, she said, he’s tough on her. Harper asked Cook before this season as she struggled with confidence to ease up and show her more compassion. He complied. But it was temporary. “He can make me really mad,” she said. “But I know it’s because he wants what’s best for me.” The moment last year that triggered Murray’s slide is coming up on its first anniversary. Cook said he’s not worried that she’ll suffer again in a similar way if the Huskers fall short in December. She’s more mature, he said. Her perspective has changed. Murray said she’s as driven as ever to win a national championship. “I feel like I have something to prove,” she said. Murray wears tape on her left hand during matches. She marks the pinky finger with an “8” to honor Rodriguez, a guiding light for Harper, and the ring finger with “27,” the Murray family number. On the index finger, Harper writes “JC,” the initials of her coach. “He’s the closest thing I have,” she said, “to a father figure.” (Top photo: Dylan Widger / Imagn Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,Kylian Mbappé’s Night to Forget,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5954196/2024/11/28/kylian-mbappe-liverpool-real-madrid/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 21:02:41 +0000","Against Liverpool, he missed an opportunity to make a statement as a Real Madrid player.","UCL Liverpool ran roughshod over Real Madrid in the Champions League on Wednesday, leaving Carlos Ancelotti’s side — particularly Kylian Mbappe — hurt. At the club, the fans and the media agreed that, with Vinicius Junior absent through injury, this was Mbappe’s day to prove his worth to his new club after a mixed start to the season. Advertisement But he did not. Quite the opposite, as he missed the penalty that could have brought his team back into the game. His plight was summed up at the final whistle, seconds after he had lost possession for the 15th time in a sequence that ended with an amazing Thibaut Courtois save to stop Luis Diaz from making it 3-0. The Frenchman stood for a few moments with his hands on his hips before being the first player to reach the dressing room, crestfallen and consoled on his way by team-mate Jesus Vallejo and assistant manager Davide Ancelotti.  GO DEEPER The Briefing: Liverpool 2-0 Madrid - Are Slot's team the best in Europe? And what now for Mbappe?  Before his move to Real Madrid was announced, there was debate among fans and in the media about how Mbappe might fit in. The main concern is that his preferred position, on the left, is already occupied by Vinicius Jr, a player rated as the second-best in the world by the Ballon d’Or judges. The Brazilian started the season on the wing but at Leganes on Sunday, in an attempt to improve the Frenchman’s fortunes, Ancelotti switched their positions. With Vinicius Jr injured for the trip to Anfield, Mbappe’s area of greatest impact was cleared. And opposite him was Conor Bradley, who was playing just his fourth Champions League game and his first as a starter. Although Bradley received help from his team-mates, Mbappe continually failed one-on-one with him and against other opponents. In the opening four minutes, he had the first two losses, celebrated with jubilation by the home fans, who whistled at him throughout. The first mistake led to a Liverpool chance, too, with Raul Asencio clearing off the line. One of the most significant images came in the 32nd minute, when he challenged Bradley in a race he would have been expected to win easily, but lost. Anfield celebrated it like a goal. Mbappe finished with just one shot on target (the saved penalty) and another blocked, three successful dribbles (the most, along with Brahim Diaz) out of six, a 75 per cent passing success rate (the lowest outfielder), zero chances created, 15 possessions lost and three recoveries. His erratic display is illustrated in The Athletic’s player dashboard below.  Mbappe was presented with an opportunity in the second half to change the script. Eight minutes after going 1-0 down to Alexis Mac Allister’s goal, a combination between substitutes Dani Ceballos and Lucas Vazquez ended in a penalty for a foul on Vazquez. Without Vinicius Jr, there was no doubt the penalty taker would be Mbappe. Antonio Rudiger stayed close to the ball and his team-mate during the VAR check, making sure no one disturbed him. But when Mbappe stepped up to face Caoimhin Kelleher, Liverpool’s academy goalkeeper came out on top. Caoimhin Kelleher denies Kylian Mbappé from the spot! 😳  📺 @tntsports & @discoveryplusUK pic.twitter.com/fr45wUF2Cj — Football on TNT Sports (@footballontnt) November 27, 2024  Mbappe reacted by putting his hands to his head, though he was a little less expressive afterwards. Briefly, he thought he might have another chance, waiting to hear whether the penalty would be retaken if the goalkeeper had stepped off his line, only to be disappointed again. A third of his goals this season — three out of nine — have come from penalties. But this was not his night. Body language can only tell us so much but Mbappe’s gestures have not been giving a good impression for some time. He looked lacking in confidence as he went to the changing room at half-time. After those minutes inside, before returning to the pitch, the cameras caught him apart from a group of team-mates, as if distant, while Jude Bellingham was leading the way, giving directions and encouragement. Advertisement Mbappe’s frustration could be seen after Cody Gakpo’s goal made it 2-0 with 14 minutes remaining, protesting to the referee about a possible offside. Just before that, there had been a moment that reflected his impotence, losing a ball from Luka Modric’s short corner and losing a race back to regain possession. Many fans also criticised him for his attitude after the game, not going to greet the away stand. He also did not show his face in front of the media or the mixed zone, with Modric, Ceballos and Bellingham representing instead. Ancelotti was asked about the Frenchman’s mood. “It could be that he lacks a bit of confidence,” said the Italian. “When you have a moment when things aren’t going your way, the idea you have to have is to play simply and sometimes you complicate things a bit more. But this moment is missing. You can’t judge a player for a missed penalty.”  Mbappe is struggling and his numbers reflect that. He has produced nine goals and two assists in 18 games, at a rate of a goal involvement every 136.5 minutes. How can he improve his situation? Perhaps the first step is support from within, something he has been feeling. Club representatives have gone out of their way to speak highly of him in private with the media, highlighting his high level in training sessions. Ancelotti and his team-mates have been supportive in public, too. “Kylian has been criticised in an exaggerated way, it has been very positive how he has contributed. I see him in training and it’s scary,” Bellingham told a press conference on Tuesday. “The penalty (miss) is not the reason we lost,” said the Englishman on Wednesday. “Work and keep fighting and keep going, because the moment will pass,” said Ancelotti. “(A situation like this) has happened to me many times in my career, especially with strikers when they struggle to score. There is a medicine: be patient. Everyone has to support him.” Advertisement Modric, in captain mode, also offered supportive words in the mixed zone: “It’s his first year and it’s never easy — at Madrid, the first years are complicated. He has our confidence and knows how to get out of this: not to lose confidence, to work day by day.” Vazquez assured that his team-mates will “always support him, he is a world-class player and he will prove it. The team is always there to help him”. Ceballos also gave him a nod. “He’s not scoring the goals he wants to score, but we know better than anyone how hard he’s working,” he explained. “It’s difficult to settle at a club like Madrid, but Kylian will do it. I’m sure he will.” (Top photo: Peter Byrne/PA Images via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The river’s thick, muddy waters and countless tributaries irrigate the world’s most fertile farmland. In Iowa, that means corn, hogs and even turkeys. In Kansas, that’s winter wheat, sorghum and cattle. Advertisement Agriculture dictates business in both states, and their land-grant institutions are among the nation’s best at cultivating the next crop of farmers. It has led Iowa State and Kansas State to forge close ties, and that cooperation spills over to competition in athletics. It also helped launch one of the greatest rivalry nicknames in sports. Once considered a derisive moniker, “Farmageddon” has nudged its way into the lexicon of modern college football in a way that belies its threadbare roots. In a new-look Big 12 scuttled and reformed through realignment, Farmageddon is a relic and a treasure. With expansion, teams change conferences and rivalries disintegrate. Yet Iowa State and Kansas State have found in each other an organic partner and competitor. “There’s that sense of a rivalry between the two schools, and it’s always a battle,” said Kansas State defensive end Brendan Mott, who grew up in Iowa City, Iowa. “It’s super physical up front. The conditions are always tough. It’s definitely a rivalry. I know us as players look forward to it every year. And I’m sure Iowa State does as well.” #CyclONEnation fans voted overwhelmingly to start a trophy with one longtime foe, who ISU has played every year since 1917. Iowa state players agree. Should Iowa State and K-State meet for 'The Reaper,' as the Paul Bunyan's Axe of the Plains?Our story:https://t.co/cJl9LJM2Kd pic.twitter.com/fXo07uOXUs — Scott Dochterman (@ScottDochterman) August 16, 2022  Farmageddon has never meant more to the contestants, fans or college football, and the series has soared in importance. For just the second time in their century-plus competition, the programs meet as ranked opponents. Saturday night at Jack Trice Stadium, No. 18 Iowa State (9-2, 6-2 Big 12) could win a 10th game for the first time in school history and qualify for the Big 12 Championship Game. No. 24 Kansas State (8-3, 5-3) could ruin the party in Ames and perhaps sneak into the title game itself. Advertisement “We’ve had the game circled,” Kansas State tight end Will Swanson told reporters. For generations, the Kansas State and Iowa State football teams sat like loose nails on a wooden fence waiting for the hammer to pound them into place. From the start of the Big Six Conference in 1928 through the completion of the Big Eight in 1995, either the Cyclones or the Wildcats finished in last place 54 times in 68 seasons. In 1989 and 1991, Kansas State moved its home games with Oklahoma to Norman so both squads could generate more revenue. Then came the Manhattan Miracle led by Bill Snyder. In perhaps the greatest turnaround in college football history, Snyder took a program teetering toward shifting to a lower division and won multiple Big 12 championships. Snyder, a College Football Hall of Fame inductee, was 215-117-1 in 27 seasons with five top-10 finishes. The Wildcats had participated in one bowl game in their first 93 years. Snyder took them to 20. “When you look at both programs, their histories are very similar,” said Jeff Woody, a running back at Iowa State from 2009-13. “Kansas State just came out of it sooner. Kansas State, before Bill Snyder got there, was awful, and Iowa State was awful until (Dan) McCarney got there.” Iowa State had a few peaks under McCarney, but the Cyclones were well behind their foes 350 miles to the southwest. For 90 years, it was less a rivalry than just a series between two similar institutions that simply played every year. “They had a great run under coach Snyder, and in some ways, they were the gold standard of what maybe Iowa State kind of aspired to do,” said Iowa State’s Jamie Pollard, who ranks third in longevity among Power 4 athletic directors. “Their institutional composition, their makeup, their history, is more like us than not. Advertisement “You look at K-State as a program. They won Big 12 championships. They played in the Cotton Bowl. They did some things that Iowa State would like to do. Quite frankly, with coach (Chris) Klieman there right now, in some ways the path to where we want to go kind of goes through them.” In 2007, Kansas and Missouri played a top-five matchup at Arrowhead Stadium. The stands were full and feisty, the game a rousing success. Kansas City Chiefs brass then reached out to multiple schools to gauge interest in staging future games. “K-State was willing, as we were willing, to each give up a home game, so we did the two-year deal,” Pollard said. “It was a good one-off opportunity that allowed us to go to the Kansas City market, which is a big market for us.” Before the first game in 2009, a Kansas State fan site coined the phrase “Farmageddom.” It caught on quickly and appeared in newspapers and other media outlets. At first, many fans and supporters considered the term cringeworthy and cliche. The nickname, however, gathered momentum and stuck despite the series moving back to campuses in 2011. Concurrently, the Big 12 was amid a radical realignment. In multiple years, there were heavy discussions about six schools — including Texas and Oklahoma — joining the Pac-10. After the 2010 season, Nebraska and Colorado left for the Big Ten and Pac-10, respectively. The next year, Missouri and Texas A&M bolted for the SEC. Each time, Iowa State and Kansas State were left twisting at the whims of their higher-profile colleagues. Amid the chaos, a bond formed. “I was in college for the first round of realignment, and Kansas State was also one of those afterthought schools,” Woody said. “And you go, ‘Well, where do we go?’ Kansas State, Oklahoma State, Iowa State and Texas Tech were the land-grant schools. No one expects as much from us. It’s sort of a sibling rivalry that I can fight you and you can fight me, and we can hate each other, but no one else is allowed to hate us.” Saturday marks the 108th consecutive season the Wildcats and Cyclones face off, but the stakes never have been higher. When both schools were ranked in 2002, it was midseason, and K-State rolled past Iowa State 58-7. Now, it’s the season finale and both teams still harbor Big 12 title hopes. Advertisement Should the Cyclones win, they’re almost certain to appear in the title game for the second time, barring a three-way tie and a complicated tiebreaker. But the percentages are low, and coach Matt Campbell said Tuesday it’s not something that concerns him. Kansas State, which won the Big 12 title two seasons ago, must win and get help to make another title appearance. The long odds don’t detract from the game’s importance, however. Last year, 6 inches of snow fell during the Cyclones’ 42-35 win in Manhattan. In a game dubbed “Snowmageddon,” Iowa State running back Abu Sama III rushed for 276 yards and three touchdowns. For Saturday’s prime-time kickoff, temperatures are expected to fall into the single digits. “It always seems like it’s a cold game or snowy game or something like that,” Mott said. “It’s always a good brawl and battle. Last year, they came down to Manhattan. It was a snowy game, and it was our senior night, and we didn’t really have the game that we wanted to have. So, we’re a real hungry team.” Since the term Farmageddon was applied to this series, unusual situations and surroundings have determined the outcome. In the first Arrowhead game, Iowa State missed an extra point in a 24-23 Kansas State win. From 2014 through 2017, the Wildcats won four straight by 5 points or fewer. In 2015, Iowa State led by a touchdown with the ball and 1:31 left. All the Cyclones needed to do was kneel for the victory because Kansas State had just one timeout remaining. Instead, Cyclones coach Paul Rhoads chose to run the ball on first down. The back fumbled, and Kansas State tied the score with a touchdown four plays later. A strip-sack with 10 seconds left led to Kansas State’s game-winning field goal. Rhoads was fired the next day. I'm intrigued by what @ChrisMWilliams thinks about this. Since Mizzou left for the SEC a decade ago, Iowa State is down to a single traveling trophy. Is it time to add another? If so, which school? — Scott Dochterman (@ScottDochterman) August 14, 2022  Campbell’s arrival in 2016 has escalated the stakes. He’s 4-4 against Kansas State, which matches the number of Cyclone wins against Kansas State from 1999 through 2007. Klieman replaced Snyder in 2019 and is 2-3 against the Cyclones. The programs are built with the same principles with development at their core. Iowa State leads the series all-time, 53-50-4. Advertisement “Both football teams play a style that their fan bases really embrace,” Kansas State athletic director Gene Taylor said. “They’re similar in a lot of ways, just hard-nosed kids from small-town Iowa, small-town Kansas. They just go out and really play good, hard, solid football.” There’s little chance of snow or below-zero temperatures for next year’s Farmageddon. Kansas State shifted the game to Ireland, and it will take place in Week 0. Aer Lingus, which operates an annual game in Dublin, met with Iowa State and Kansas State to consider playing a game there. Iowa State will host only four Big 12 games in 2025, so it declined. Taylor thought Klieman would do the same but asked his coach to research the proposal. “I said, ‘There’s no way Klieman is moving the Iowa State game to a neutral site in Ireland,’” Taylor said. “Chris came down to my office and said, ‘Let’s do it.’ I was shocked, literally, because of the importance of the game.” Another change is on the horizon, one that has agitated the fan bases. In the 16-team Big 12, in which eight new members have joined in the last two seasons, only four rivalries (all in-state) are protected annually. Farmageddon is slated to cycle off the schedule in 2027. There are no plans for the schools to meet in a nonconference game. “There have been a lot of changes,” Taylor said. “We probably haven’t had a chance to really slow down and take a look at an option like that. But I think it’s worthy of discussion in the future. And say maybe we do rotate — not just one team a year that you play every year, maybe it is two or three teams. How do we keep Iowa State for us and Kansas and rotate everybody else?” Reminder: Farmageddon is not officially recognized as a rivalry by @CycloneATH @kstatesports or the @Big12Conference  Seems like as good of time as ever seeing as the next two matchups include: -Championship and Playoff implications  -International stand-alone game — Jack Trice Mafia (@JackTriceMafia) November 24, 2024  Once an afterthought, Farmageddon now resonates as an authentic rivalry shaped by similarity and substance. Mott, Woody and both athletic directors acknowledge the other has become their school’s No. 2 rival, just behind their in-state foes. It matters emotionally and competitively. “Ohio State–Michigan have played each other for forever, and that’s like a true hatred,” Woody said. “But the existence of those programs has never been threatened, like what happened to Iowa State and Kansas State. So, recognizing that it almost fell apart, and there’s this good thing between two similar programs that because it almost fell apart, you appreciate it for what it is. It’s impossible not to see the similarities between the programs.” “It is kind of that battle of the farmers,” Mott said. “I think it’s cool it’s got this nickname. It just adds to the rivalry.” (Photo: Scott Winters / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Advertisement Q4 2:18 Giants 20, Cowboys 27 The Giants aren't going away. Drew Lock scrambles for eight yards at first-and-goal to get the touchdown.

Dallas punts to New York, who will start its drive at their 20.  This is not a drill! Kevin Burkhardt and seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady are eating a Turducken on the broadcast in honor of the late John Madden. This might be the most entertaining part of this broadcast.  Getty Images Rico Dowdle’s touchdown gives him 16.3 PPR points. That is his third-highest PPR point total this season. It also trends him to score 20-plus PPR points for the game, which would be his second 20+ point game of the season. Getty Images The Cowboys aren't used to leading after three quarters at home. It's the first time they've done that this season. The closest they've been is trailing the Houston Texans 20-10. The opponent is obviously a factor. The Giants are clearly one of the NFL's worst teams.  The most interesting part of the third quarter, though, might have been Tom Brady's praise of Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy, who is in the final year of his contract. ""Oh, I think Coach McCarthy is a great coach,"" Brady said on the FOX broadcast. ""His 18th season as a head coach. He's a great leader of men. But not only as a play-caller, he's a developer of players, of talent, of quarterbacks. ""He's got a very consistent personality to him. He won in Green Bay. He's got a championship DNA. I think he's one of the better coaches in the NFL, absolutely.""  Advertisement Q4 13:34 Giants 13, Cowboys 27 Graham Gano is 2-for-2 today as he hits a 47-yard field goal. The Giants are now down 14.  IMAGN The Giants hung around during an ugly first half, but the wheels started to come off in the third quarter. Quarterback Drew Lock fumbled on the Giants' first possession of the second half and the Cowboys promptly marched 37 yards for a touchdown to take a 20-10 lead. The Giants went three-and-out on their next possession and Dallas scored again to open up a 27-10 cushion. Making matters worse, star defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence left with an elbow injury in the third quarter. The Giants don't have any sacks through three quarters. Getty Images Q3 0:00 Giants 10, Cowboys 27 Through three quarters, the Cowboys lead by 17 over the Giants. The Cowboys scored two touchdowns in the third quarter to extend their lead.

Q3 2:34 Giants 10, Cowboys 27 Drew Lock uses his legs on second-and-17, scrambling for 21 yards to pick up the first down. Much needed for this maligned Giants offense.

The Cowboys lead by 17.  Dexter Lawrence headed to the Giants locker room after getting attention from trainers on the sideline for a few minutes. Lawrence exited the field in pain, with Dan Duggan noting it looked like his left arm bothering him. Lawrence is literally, a huge presence for the Giants defense. The interior DL anchors the Giants D and is also one of the team's five captains whose leadership has been looked to amid a difficult season.  Q3 6:25 Giants 10, Cowboys 20  The Cowboys are rolling. On first-and-10, Cooper Rush throws deep to Jalen Tolbert, who stops, turns and makes the catch along the sideline.  Dallas is deep in New York territory, looking to build on its lead."

The following is from the latest Packers mailbag. Read more here. Is the winter weather advantage of Lambeau a ghost of our past? Tua seemed confident in his post-game presser. — @PackersDiehards According to Pro Football Talk, Tua Tagovailoa’s teams are 0-7 in games played below 40 degrees Fahrenheit. It’s supposed to be around 20 on Thursday night at Lambeau Field. That’s the only reason I think the weather might be an advantage for the Packers. In general, I don’t think the cold provides much of an advantage for the Packers based on recent years. “I’m excited to kill narratives, so let’s go. Bring it on,” Tagovailoa said in his postgame press conference after Sunday’s blowout win over the Patriots. Maybe the eighth time is the charm. GO FURTHER Packers mailbag: Is Green Bay a run-first team? Can Dolphins handle the cold? Packers 2023 first-round pick Lukas Van Ness is nicknamed Hercules because of how he’s built. That brute strength was on display Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers. San Francisco had a first-and-5 from its own 15-yard line early in the fourth quarter, trailing 24-10. Right guard Dominick Puni pulled to the left side of the line after the snap, but Van Ness beat him around the outside. Running back Christian McCaffrey tried to block Van Ness, but the second-year edge defender manhandled him en route to sacking quarterback Brandon Allen, who had slipped earlier in the play. Not only that, but Van Ness also knocked the ball loose from Allen, and defensive tackle Kenny Clark recovered it. The Packers scored three plays later on running back Josh Jacobs’ third touchdown of the game to put the nail in the coffin against a depleted 49ers team. Defensive end Rashan Gary took time to break out after the Packers drafted him with the No. 12 pick in 2019, and Van Ness, the No. 13 pick last year, didn’t exactly burst onto the scene, either. He still hasn’t — Van Ness has just four TFLs, two sacks and one forced fumble while playing about 40 percent of the defensive snaps this season — but perhaps his big play Sunday is a sign of things to come. An inconsistent Packers pass rush could certainly use the boost. “I’ve been waiting for a big play like that, and I’ve kept my head down,” Van Ness said. “Even going back to that game, I think a lot of it is you gotta take your shot and be willing to go out there and make a difference. Couple plays before that, I was getting that counter pass, and I told myself if I got it again, I was gonna beat that guard and get there, and obviously, I did that. Definitely a very exciting (feeling), and it does give you that itch to want to get back on the field again.” GO FURTHER Packers-Dolphins preview: Defending Miami’s offense, Lukas Van Ness and more On the 49ers-Packers broadcast in Week 12, Tom Brady said that teams aren't who they really are until Thanksgiving. We might not be at Turkey Day quite yet, but it's a late Thanksgiving this year, so we can make an exception. We saw a whole lot of true colors on the field in Week 12. Robert Mays and Derrik Klassen are here to break it all down on this episode of The Athletic Football Show. Watch here.  (Getty Images)              Green Bay (+1800) is one team I’m watching as the 2024 season approaches the homestretch. The Packers are 8-3 after dismantling the banged-up San Francisco 49ers and are right on the heels of the Lions and Minnesota Vikings in the NFC North. The Pack has one of the most balanced squads in the NFL, ranking fifth offensively in total yards per game (382.5) and tied for second in total takeaways (22). Jordan Love has not fully made his superstar turn yet, but he spread the ball around and played cleaner against San Fran, as he had his first game of the year without an interception. Josh Jacobs was the focal point offensively, though, cracking 100 yards rushing for the third time this season and recording his first three-rushing-touchdown game since October 2022. Defensively, Xavier McKinney keeps making plays in his first season in Green Bay. His pick of Brandon Allen was his seventh of the year, tied with Detroit’s Kerby Joseph for tops in the NFL. Stacking wins like they did Sunday will be important for the Packers as they prepare for a slate featuring the Dolphins, Lions, Seahawks and Vikings over the final month of the season. GO FURTHER Super Bowl 2025 odds: Lions, Chiefs lead. Eagles, Ravens rising Advertisement Miami travels to Green Bay. The book on the Dolphins the past two seasons was that they’d fold in big games in cold weather. Particularly with first-year defensive coordinator Anthony Weaver getting a lot out of a defense missing its top pass rushers, are this year’s Dolphins built to last down the stretch and potentially in the postseason? Ted Nguyen: There are a couple of things the offense is doing better than last year, even though they haven’t been as productive. First, Tua Tagovailoa is creating plays outside of structure, which hasn’t been a strength of his in the NFL — maybe the his offseason weight loss is paying dividends. Second, he’s checking the ball down more rather than forcing it to Tyreek Hill. Maybe it’s because Hill is nursing a wrist injury, but the offense is just smoother when Tagovailoa is willing to check the ball down to Achane and tight end Jonnu Smith, who is one of the best under-the-radar free agent signings of 2024. The defense was already playing at a high level toward the end of the last year but dealt with injuries and they clearly never meshed well with former coordinator Vic Fangio. Maybe the defense is playing harder for Weaver. However, last season, they struggled against playoff teams. This year is no different. On their three-game win streak, they beat the Rams, Patriots, and Raiders — all three of those teams have losing records. For Miami to prove they are a tougher team, they have to beat the Packers. Dan Pompei: We have to be careful about reading too much into what the Dolphins did in 2022 and ’23. This is a different team, one that’s trending positively with three straight wins. And the Packers are not invincible at Lambeau; in fact, two of their losses have come at home. If the Dolphins can steal a win Thursday (they are 3.5-point underdogs), they will be well positioned to make the playoffs because they have only one remaining team on their schedule — the Texans — with a winning record. Mike Jones: This Dolphins team certainly is trending in the right direction. A healthy Tagovailoa has reignited the offense, and Weaver's defense has held opponents under 20 points in each of the last three games (all victories). I still have questions, though. Those wins came against the Rams, Raiders and Patriots. Prior to the win streak, they came up short (30-27) against Buffalo. They still have some work to do before they're back in the playoff race; they need to keep winning and need wobbles from Denver (currently the seventh seed) and/or the Chargers. I'm going to reserve judgement before declaring them capable of lasting in the playoffs. I need to see quality wins against teams like Green Bay this week and Houston in Week 15 first. GO FURTHER  The Dolphins head into this big Thanksgiving game in Green Bay on a roll and with the playoffs suddenly in sight again after Tua Tagovailoa’s return has helped them win three straight games. Their 1-3 stretch without their starting quarterback set back their postseason aspirations, but suddenly the Dolphins are surging at the right time. A win Thursday night would level them at .500 and keep their wild-card hopes intact. This run has come on the heels of a great return for Tagovailoa. After missing four games due to his latest concussion, Tagovailoa has been on a tear and had another huge game Sunday against the Patriots. He completed 29 of 40 passes for 317 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions.  In his five games since returning, Tagovailoa has thrown 11 touchdown passes and completed more than 70 percent of his passes in each of those five contests.    Packers center Josh Myers and linebacker Isaiah McDuffie are both active after being listed as questionable for tonight’s game against the Dolphins. Green Bay will be without three starters already ruled out due to injury, cornerback Jaire Alexander (knee), linebacker Edgerrin Cooper (hamstring) and wide receiver Romeo Doubs (concussion). Rookie offensive lineman Jacob Monk is the only healthy scratch.  (Getty Images)              Where do the Packers and Dolphins sit in the latest power rankings from The Athletic? This week's theme is the season’s best-case scenario for all 32 teams.  5. Green Bay Packers (8-3) Last week: 6 Sunday: Beat San Francisco 49ers 38-10 Best-case scenario: Super Bowl Green Bay announced itself as a legitimate NFC contender Sunday by demolishing the reigning conference champions. If Jordan Love can be efficient (two touchdowns and a 107.7 passer rating against the 49ers) and Josh Jacobs keeps running like this, the Packers can be a threat to the Lions in the playoffs. Jacobs, who had 106 yards Sunday, is third in rushing yards (944) and has the sixth-best avoided tackle rate among backs with more than 150 carries, according to FTN Fantasy. 18. Miami Dolphins (5-6) Last week: 21 Sunday: Beat New England Patriots 34-15 Best-case scenario: Playoffs Miami is still alive despite starting the season 2-6, and Tua Tagovailoa gets the credit. The Dolphins quarterback missed Weeks 3-7 because of another concussion, but since Week 9, he has 10 touchdowns and one interception and leads the league in EPA per dropback (.36) and completion percentage (77.3). “The guy is Magic Johnson,” Jason Garrett said on “Sunday Night Football.” “When you take this guy out of the lineup, no one can replace him. He’s playing as well as anyone in the league right now.” Sunday was Miami’s third straight win.   GO FURTHER NFL Power Rankings Week 13: Eagles, Packers on the rise as Chiefs, Steelers slip Advertisement A Miami-Dade County judge has dismissed the citations issued to Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill in September, according to Miami-Dade County court documents. The citations for careless driving and a seatbelt violation against Hill were dismissed Monday due to “lack of prosecution” by an officer or witness, per the documents. Read more on the story here. GO FURTHER Citations issued to Dolphins WR Tyreek Hill in September dismissed due to ‘lack of prosecution’   GREEN BAY, Wis. — Hopefully every football fan in America enjoys watching the Green Bay Packers because they won’t have much choice over the next month. The Packers host the Miami Dolphins in the Thanksgiving nightcap Thursday on NBC. Next week, they visit the Detroit Lions on Thursday night. They travel to the Seattle Seahawks in Week 15 for “Sunday Night Football.” The New Orleans Saints visit Green Bay in Week 16 on Monday night, and in Week 17, the Packers-Minnesota Vikings noon CT game has a chance to be flexed to Sunday night since Dolphins-Cleveland Browns holds that slot. Green Bay has played in one standalone game this season, in Week 1 against the Philadelphia Eagles on Friday night in Brazil. Since then, one of the NFL’s marquee franchises hasn’t played in prime time. That changes this week with four or five consecutive standalone night games, and those come after the Fox A team of Kevin Burkhardt, Tom Brady, Erin Andrews and Tom Rinaldi have called each of the Packers’ last three games to start November. “NFL only care about November, December. Y’all know that,” cornerback Keisean Nixon said. “And we got prime time out in the stretch, so they wanna see us. We gon’ give ’em a show.” Read more here. GO FURTHER As Packers embark on prime-time stretch, do they even like night games? The Packers are playing on Thanksgiving for the 38th time. That ties the Chicago Bears for third most with the Detroit Lions (85) and Dallas Cowboys (57) leading the way. Tonight will be the Dolphins' eighth Thanksgiving game and first since 2011. While inactives are on the way, we already know CB Jaire Alexander and WR Romeo Doubs are out for Green Bay today. OT Terron Armstead is questionable for Miami. Advertisement Cold weather doesn’t care about feelings. The wind chill factor laughs at the Dolphins being mad about the narrative that they are a little soft — they are 0-3 under coach Mike McDaniel in temperatures under 40 degrees, and it’s supposed to get down to the teens on Thursday night. The Dolphins do have quick-trigger Tua, and have scored on a higher percentage of their drives since Week 8 (56.3 percent) than anyone else in the NFL.  The Packers must get pressure on Tagovailoa and not miss any tackles on all the quick outs and swing passes. And they must continue to control the trenches — they are very good against the run and offensively, they solved their red-zone issues (they were ranked 27th) last week by going 5 for 5, including three touchdowns by Josh Jacobs. (He's forced the most missed tackles, 15, of any ball carrier this season.) Miami’s defense has improved since the return of Zach Sieler, and Chop Robinson leads the NFL in pass pressure percentage the past four weeks at 25.8 percent.  We still don’t trust Jordan Love (EPA per dropback on a blitz of -0.33 and a third down passing conversion percentage of 26.8), but give us the better team up front, at home.

Survivor Pools | Fantasy football player rankings Updated through 6:50 p.m. ET, Nov. 28 Romeo Doubs, WR, Packers (concussion) — Out
Doubs has been ruled out for Week 13. With or without Doubs, receiver production on the Packers is hard to predict with Christian Watson, Dontayvion Wicks, and Jayden Reed in the group. Reed looked like an every-week starter early in the season, but he’s scored only 5.6 in Week 12, 7.5 in Week 8, and 3.0 in Week 7. He’s also only been targeted five times in the past two weeks. With this group, any one of them could have a good week, but all of them never do. Zamir White, RB, Raiders (Quadriceps) — Out
Alexander Mattison, RB, Raiders (ankle) — Questionable
White and Mattison both missed Week 12, and White is already ruled out for Week 13 while Mattison is questionable. In Week 11, each of them had five carries, and while Mattison had more yards (19) than White (nine), the numbers don’t bode well for future fantasy production. Next up on the depth chart are Ameer Abdullah and Sincere McCormick. Abdullah had eight carries to McCormick’s five, but McCormick had 6.6 yards per carry to Abdullah’s 2.5. However, Abdullah was more involved in the passing game and ended up with 65 net yards and a receiving touchdown. Aidan O’Connell, QB, Raiders (thumb) — Expected to play
Head coach Antonio Pierce said O’Connell will start in Week 13, according to Levi Edwards of the Raiders’ official site. After Gardner Minshew’s season-ending injury, Desmond Ridder is O’Connell’s backup. I’d love to see Ridder on the field Friday. But my dad is a Purdue alum, so I’m partial to O’Connell (though it’s difficult, given his 5.5 PPR point per game average), and I hope he can at least attempt to give the Chiefs some trouble and make this a game worth watching. Advertisement Tre Tucker, WR, Raiders (hip) — Expected to play
Tucker was limited in Wednesday’s practice with a hip injury but is expected to play. Week 12 was one of Tucker’s better performances, as he finished with 82 yards receiving and 15.2 PPR points. But Jakobi Meyers is the more reliable Raiders receiver, and if Tucker misses time, Meyers will have more opportunities. Meyers has only scored fewer than 10 PPR points on four occasions this year. Last week, he was targeted 15 times and ended with 121 yards and 22.1 PPR points. Isiah Pacheco, RB, Chiefs (ankle) — Expected to play
Pacheco was close to playing in Week 12 but has a better chance to play in Week 13. If he doesn’t, Kareem Hunt will again lead the backfield with a season average of 3.7 yards per rush. Spencer Shrader, K, Chiefs (hamstring) — Out
Shrader is out in Week 13 with a hamstring injury. Harrison Butker is on IR, so the Chiefs signed Matthew Wright to start in Week 13. Trevor Lawrence, QB, Jaguars (shoulder) — Questionable
Lawrence was a limited participant in practice on Wednesday. Fantasy managers with any stake in the Jags are desperate for Lawrence’s return. With him in, TE Evan Engram and WR Brian Thomas Jr. become fantasy-relevant again. Brian Robinson Jr., RB, Commanders (ankle) — Questionable
Austin Ekeler, RB, Commanders (concussion) — Questionable
If Washington is without Robinson Jr. and Ekeler in Week 13, the offense could be in some trouble. Jeremy McNichols has been plucked off waiver wires all week in case Robinson and Ekeler are ruled out. Lesser known Chris Rodriguez would also factor into the running game if the Commanders’ starting tandem can’t play. Breece Hall, RB, Jets (knee) — Questionable
Breece Hall did not practice on Wednesday due to knee soreness. Braelon Allen becomes an immediate add-and-play if Hall sits. Allen had a great Week 2 with 4.7 yards per carry and 19.6 PPR points. But he is averaging 3.7 yards per rush on the year and 5.36 PPR points. Advertisement Darnell Mooney, WR, Falcons (hamstring) — Expected to play
Mooney has averaged 13.55 PPR points this season, and his ceiling is right at the 31.5 points he scored in Week 5. Without Mooney, Drake London and Ray-Ray McCloud III may see more targets. McCloud had six receptions on six targets and 46 yards receiving in Week 11. Alec Pierce, WR, Colts (foot) — Questionable
Josh Downs, WR, Colts (shoulder) — Questionable
Neither Downs nor Pierce practiced on Wednesday. If they cannot play, Adonai Mitchell becomes fantasy-relevant again as a down-the-field threat, and Michael Pittman Jr. is sure to get the most wide receiver looks for the Colts. DeMario Douglas, WR, Patriots (ankle) — Questionable
Douglas was limited at practice on Wednesday. Averaging 8.56 PPR points per game, Douglas is a flex option in deeper leagues at best. Keyshon Boutte and Kendrick Bourne could see more work with Douglas out. Austin Seibert, K, Commanders (hip) — Injured reserve
Seibert has been placed on IR after missing kicks following his return from injury. When Seibert was out, Zane Gonzalez kicked for the Commanders, going 3-for-3 on field goals and 4-for-4 on extra points. He is still on the practice squad and available for elevation. J.K. Dobbins, RB, Chargers (knee) — Doubtful
Dobbins sprained his MCL and is expected to miss the Chargers’ matchup against the Falcons. With him out, grab Gus Edwards and think about flexing him. He didn’t do too well after Dobbins left the game in Week 12, but he will surely lead LA’s backfield in Dobbins’ absence. Will Dissly, TE, Chargers (knee) — Questionable
Dissly is questionable heading into Week 13. If he sits, Tucker Fisk is next up on the depth chart. Dissly is averaging 7.9 PPR points on the season and had 18 in Week 11. In Weeks 11 and 12, he had 80 yards and 47 yards receiving, respectively. Tyjae Spears, RB, Titans (concussion) — Questionable
Spears is again questionable heading into the week, but Tony Pollard is the RB1 in Tennessee. In Spears’ Week 12 absence, Pollard had 119 yards on 24 carries, a touchdown and finished with 21.9 PPR points. Advertisement Calvin Ridley, WR, Titans (ankle) — Questionable
Ridley didn’t practice on Wednesday but had a solid Week 12 with 93 yards receiving. If Ridley sits, Nick Westbrook-Ikhine becomes an intriguing flex play. NWI has scored over 10 PPR points in four of his last five games and had 117 yards receiving in Week 11. Often his production comes from limited targets and receptions, but if Ridley isn’t on the field, Westbrook-Ikhine could see more usage. DK Metcalf, WR, Seahawks (shoulder) — Questionable
Tyler Lockett, WR, Seahawks (knee) — Questionable
Neither Metcalf nor Lockett practiced Thursday. If either of them sits, Jaxon Smith-Njigba would see more targets and could be a great flex option in Week 13. DeVonta Smith, WR, Eagles (hamstring) — Questionable
Smith missed Week 12 with a hamstring injury and remains questionable for Week 13. Without Smith on the field, A.J. Brown and Dallas Goedert were the only pass catchers with more than one target. Saquon Barkley also caught four passes for 47 receiving yards. Ja’Tavion Sanders, TE, Panthers (neck) — Questionable
Head coach Dave Canales told reporters that Sanders is not expected to play on Sunday, meaning Tommy Tremble will likely get the start. Tremble has not exceeded 5.9 PPR points in any game this season. Brock Purdy, QB, 49ers (shoulder) — Questionable
Purdy was limited in practice on Wednesday, and if he can’t play, Brandon Allen will likely get another start. Managers of Niners receivers would be so incredibly thankful if Purdy returns for Week 13. Keon Coleman, WR, Bills (wrist) — Questionable
Dalton Kincaid, WR, Bills (knee) — Questionable
Coleman was limited at practice with a wrist injury, while Kincaid did not practice on Wednesday. Coleman hasn’t played since Week 9. Now, Coleman will share targets with Amari Cooper and Khalil Shakir. If Kincaid can’t play, Dawson Knox is a quality backup who should demand streaming consideration for this week. Cedric Tillman, WR, Browns (concussion) — Questionable
Tillman was diagnosed with a concussion during Thursday Night Football, but Jerry Jeudy has been the surging Browns receiver lately. If Tillman sits, Jeudy is an even better flex option. Bo Nix, QB, Broncos (back) — Questionable
Nix was limited in practice due to a back injury. Jarrett Stidham and Zach Wilson are the backups in Denver. If Nix sits, WRs Courtland Sutton and Devaughn Vele are less attractive fantasy plays in Week 13. 
  Outdoor games only As the weather grows colder, four matchups, including 49ers-Bills, Dolphins-Packers, Raiders-Chiefs and Steelers–Bengals, will be played in temperatures below 35 degrees. In Jake Ciely’s fantasy football strategy guide to weather, he notes that the passing game is impacted when temperatures drop below 35 degrees, which is illustrated in the table below. According to Rotowire’s aggregated NFL-related forecasts, there is a 75 percent chance of snow with an expected temperature of 29 degrees when the Bills welcome the 49ers to Buffalo. San Francisco 49ers (5-6) vs. Buffalo Bills (9-2) Snow and precipitation primarily affect the passing game. Typically, running backs are used more in difficult weather conditions, so their value is less impacted. Christian McCaffrey and James Cook should typically produce, and maybe Ray Davis even gets some carries if the game scripts lean run. Advertisement Josh Allen has played in three games in the snow, in 2020 and 2021. In those games, he averaged a completion percentage of 51.8 percent, compared to a career 63.7 percent. While that’s dismal, he also still threw for an average of 256.33 yards per game. If Dalton Kincaid is healthy, he and Cook out of the backfield could see a lot of short-yardage work. I may trust Khalil Shakir more than Amari Cooper this week because of Shakir’s rapport with Allen and consistent fantasy production. Brock Purdy hasn’t played in the snow in the NFL. The San Francisco 49ers last snowy game was in Jan. 2022, in a divisional game against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field. They won 13-10, and seven of their points came off a blocked punt that went for a touchdown. Former 49ers QB Jimmy Garoppolo was 11-for-19 and threw for 131 yards and an interception. The team rushed for 106 total yards, and Kittle led the Niners in receiving with four receptions and 63 yards. A typical snow game.
 Game-specific previews and live updates are available on the day of the game. Miami Dolphins (5-6) vs. Green Bay Packers (8-3) The Green Bay Packers are favorites over the Miami Dolphins in Week 13, as the Thanksgiving Day slate finishes strong. Miami has won its last three games, largely due to Tua Tagovailoa’s return, and while the wins have come against the Rams, Raiders, and Patriots, Miami nearly beat the Bills in Week 9. Jaylen Waddle finally looked like … Jaylen Waddle in Week 12, finishing with 144 yards receiving and 28.4 PPR points. Tyreek Hill is not producing up to his preseason ADP, averaging 11.71 PPR points per game. The Packers are winning, but Jordan Love hasn’t played particularly well. His completion percentage of 61.8 percent ranks 33rd among QBs with at least 100 pass attempts — just above Trevor Lawrence, Cooper Rush, and Bryce Young; Love’s pass/interception rate is only better than Will Levis’. In Week 12, Romeo Doubs was the only receiver to eclipse 50 yards, and Love’s two touchdown passes went to TE Tucker Kraft and WR Malik Heath. With Doubs, Jayden Reed, Dontayvion Wicks and Christian Watson (who had no receptions in Week 12) in the receiving corps., predicting who will produce week-to-week is impossible. Now, Josh Jacobs, who averages 16.5 PPR points per game and ran for 106 yards and three touchdowns in Week 12, is an easy weekly start. Read the full preview.  Las Vegas Raiders (2-9) vs. Kansas City Chiefs (10-1) The Kansas City Chiefs are favored by two scores over the Las Vegas Raiders — what a surprise. After Gardner Minshew II broke his collarbone in Week 12, the Raiders are praying that Aidan O’Connell is healthy enough to return. Or maybe we’ll see Desmond Ridder. Regardless, Las Vegas will find it hard to beat the Chiefs, who may get Isiah Pacheco back this week. Alexander Mattison and Zamir White did not play in Week 12, and the Raiders leaned on Ameer Abdullah and Sincere McCormick in their absence, leading to 69 total yards on the ground. Underrated WR Jacobi Meyers finished with 121 yards. Brock Bowers had a down week but is a bright spot on this team and will “get his” in most games. Advertisement Pacheco’s return could help a Chiefs offense that hasn’t looked as dynamic this year despite securing 10 wins. Mahomes is coming off a one-score win against the lowly Carolina Panthers and his best fantasy game of the season, finishing with 28.8 fantasy points and a passer rating of 120.2. TE Travis Kelce led receivers with eight targets; DeAndre Hopkins and Xavier Worthy each had six. Kansas City’s defense is the difference maker, ranking fourth in yards per game allowed and third in yards per rush allowed. Read the full preview (coming Friday).  Philadelphia Eagles (9-2) vs. Baltimore Ravens (7-4) After Saquon Barkley’s 302 net yards and Hurts’ efficient performance against the Rams in Week 12, Philly still doesn’t get the odds against the Ravens in Baltimore. Led by MVP candidate Lamar Jackson, the Ravens can beat anyone, even the soaring Eagles. Derrick Henry’s impact on Baltimore’s dominant season cannot be overstated. He’s averaging 20 PPR points per game and just had a 140-yard rushing performance on Monday Night Football, breaking one tackle after another. He faces eight men in the box at the second-highest rate in the NFL (33.9 percent) and still averages 3.55 yards after contact (sixth in the league). Zay Flowers (Ciely’s WR22), Mark Andrews (TE20) and Rashod Bateman (WR56) round out the Ravens offense and give Jackson capable targets. The Ravens allow the fewest yards per rush (3.5), and even Barkley may find less room to run in this game. The Eagles have a great one-two punch with A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith (who was inactive in Week 12), and TE Dallas Goedert is great for the short game. With much focus on Barkley this season, Hurts’ seventh-ranked passer rating (102.3) and sixth-ranked completion percentage (69.1 percent) have gone under the radar. Brown has 727 receiving yards on the season and averages 16.96 PPR points per game. Read the full preview (coming Sunday).  San Francisco 49ers (5-6) vs. Buffalo Bills (9-2) The Niners have been disappointing this year and sit at the bottom of the NFC West. Still in playoff contention, they hope to have Brock Purdy back in Week 13. Christian McCaffrey hasn’t looked the same since his return from injury, averaging 3.5 yards per carry and under 50 rushing yards per game. However, the Bills D gives up 4.9 yards per carry (30th in the NFL), giving fantasy managers who have McCaffrey something to be thankful for this week. Interestingly in the receiving corps, Deebo Samuel is averaging only 10.5 PPR points per game, while breakout wideout Jauan Jennings is averaging 14.9. Josh Allen is on a tear this season, averaging 231.18 passing yards and 28.7 rushing yards per game and throwing for 18 TDs while rushing for five. He has only five interceptions with a passer rating of 98.2 and is fantasy’s QB5 with 20.3 PPR points per game. Now Allen has Amari Cooper alongside Khalil Shakir as his top two receivers. Shakir has only scored less than 10 PPR points once in Week 6; he offers a great floor and a ceiling of about 20 points. Read the full preview (coming Sunday).  Cleveland Browns (3-8) vs. Denver Broncos (7-5) On the shoulders of Bo Nix’s improved play and a tough defense, the Broncos are favored over the Cleveland Browns. I was big on Nix entering the season. His college career contained few errors, and I thought he’d fit into Sean Payton’s system well. But the first few weeks of his play had me cowering in a corner. But persistence has brought vengeance! Nix has thrown zero interceptions in the past three weeks while scoring eight touchdowns. From Weeks 10-12, his passer rating is 118.6, and he has a 71.4 percent completion rate. Courtland Sutton has been buoyed because of it. During that span, he averaged 81.67 receiving yards per game on nine targets. The Broncos running game is an entirely different story. Payton seems to be using the hot-hand approach to Javonte Williams, Jaleel McLaughlin and Audric Estime, making none of them viable fantasy plays. Advertisement The Browns have some fight in them with Jameis Winston under center. They aren’t winning games, but they’ve become more fun to watch, and Jerry Jeudy has become flex-relevant in deep leagues. Jeudy has scored 12 or more PPR points since Week 8, and in Week 11, he had 26.2. Denver has a stout pass defense, allowing only 199.8 passing yards per game (ninth in the NFL), so while I think Jeudy deserves flex consideration, temper expectations. Read the full preview (coming Monday). 
 Austin Mock scours his weekly projections to spot the top values on the board. Chicago Bears at Detroit Lions over 48.5 (-110) Caleb Williams and this Bears offense have looked much better since they made a change at offensive coordinator. Pair that with the Lions defense being a little banged up on a short week, and I think Chicago can hold its own in this game. That is, on offense. Nobody has been able to contain the Lions offense since their bye week, and I don’t expect that to happen on Thanksgiving. Give me all the food, and give me all the points. — Mock See all of Mock’s best bets for Week 13. 
 A weekly guide to staying alive from Renee Miller and Adam Gretz. Odds from BetMGM as of Thursday. Question from Sammu D.: “Initially planning on taking Broncos Week 13. Now questioning if I should consider Packers or even Cowboys as options. Saving Bills for Week 16 or 17.” While I do really like the Broncos, Cleveland can be a little frisky here, and I am not sure Denver is so good at this point that anybody is an easy win for them. Myles Garrett can ruin a game. Jameis Winston is just out there playing on vibes. It could be a dangerous team. I do like the Packers because until Miami and Mike McDaniel actually beat a good team, I am going to be skeptical of that whole operation. And even without that, I’m never really comfortable picking the road team on a short week. I know it’s wild, but I do not hate the Cowboys this week. Not only is that Giants team awful, but I would imagine Dallas wants to at least have some energy for the Thanksgiving game, and the Giants have that short-week road trip. Do you think a 2-9 team wants to spend its Thanksgiving playing on the road? I don’t. —Gretz Get this week’s top survivor pool tips.

GO FURTHER Tottenham 2 Roma 2: Late Hummels equaliser denies Spurs victory in wildly open Europa League clash – The Briefing  When it comes to Claudio Ranieri, I must admit the soft spot I have for him as someone hailing from Leicester. That said, I like to think most people would be in agreement that it was great to see him on the touchline again tonight.  The passion he still has for the game and his boyhood club at the age of 73 is remarkable. We won't see many more animated managers on the touchline in north London this season, that's for sure! Advertisement Alexis Saelemaekers was a second-half substitute for Roma and he was happy with the attitude shown by his team-mates throughout. ""It was a really important point for us,"" he told UEFA.com. ""We fought until the end of the game and we will go forward now. At half-time the coach said we had to continue playing as we had been. ""We came back with the same mentality, we knew if we kept pushing we could score an equaliser and that's what happened."" Getty Images Mats Hummels played the hero for AS Roma with a last-minute equaliser to avenge his early penalty giveaway. Tottenham narrowly fumble three points at home in a thrilling 2-2 draw. Ange Postecoglou was then asked if he was shocked by the attacking threat posed by Roma. ""No, they're a good side, that's the reason they're in the Europa League,"" he said.  ""They obviously did well last year, they've had a tough time this year but they've got some quality players. But we still had enough chances to win the game."" Then, he was asked about Fraser Forster who deputised nicely for Guglielmo Vicario. ""Fraser did well, we expect that from him,"" said Postecoglou. ""He's a very experienced goalkeeper, he did his part."" Getty Images Spurs can be very good on the break thanks to Dejan Kulusevski's running power.  We saw that again before the second Tottenham goal.  It was a great run from Kulusevski onto Pape Sarr's pass, matched by the cross for Johnson to make it 2-1.  Getty Images It was briefly 2-1 to Roma after a Stephan El Shaarawy volley. But it was disallowed by VAR.  Roma had playing the better football at that point but it remained 1-1 after the offside was revealed.  Advertisement Getty Images Roma had been growing into this encounter and they got themselves level.  Evan Ndicka flicked on a free-kick at the near post and the ball did enough to beat Fraser Forster. The goalkeeper stretched to get a hand on it but could not keep it out.  Let's look back at the goals! For Tottenham's opener, was a very good advantage played from the referee Glenn Nyberg, who I thought was very sharp tonight. Son wanted a foul, and would have got one, but the Swede played on. Seconds later, Johnson worked a cross into the box, Sarr got a toe to it before Hummels, who made contact with his calf in an impatient kick out for the ball. Definite penalty, and Son slammed it home confidently. Getty Images Not the post-match interview Ange Postecoglou would have wanted to be doing when his side had the lead going into stoppage time. ""It's obviously frustrating, particularly when they score so late,"" he told TNT Sports.  ""It was a good game, we probably should have put it to bed a lot earlier. ""We missed some big chances and at 2-1, you're always keeping them in the game. So it's disappointing not to see it out."" Getty Images Tottenham's Archie Gray was keen to take the positives from the performance when he spoke to TNT Sports after the match. ""It was a tough game. The first 20 and last 20 minutes were tough,"" he said.  ""We had to dig deep but, apart from that, I thought we were good. We played our football and we were good on the counter attack. ""It's just that last moment that cost us and we've got to do better than that. It was a good performance and we'll learn from the mistakes.""  I can only imagine the criticism being aimed at Mats Hummels after he was really sloppy in conceding that early penalty. But the 35-year-old dusted himself down superbly and defended resolutely from there while also contributing with some great passing into midfield and out wide. And then he took it upon himself to decide the match with great reactions to turn Angelino's rocket of a cross into the back of the net. Life in the old dog yet... Advertisement We know Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou is pretty dogmatic about his style of play. And that swashbuckling style saw them take 24 shots on goal. But it also saw them concede 18 shots. And one of them saw Mats Hummels equalise. What's that phrase about living by the sword and dying by the sword? Getty Images The points were shared and there was a lovely, warm embrace between Ange Postecoglou and Claudio Ranieri at full time. Great to see! The Athletic Lazio, Athletic Club, and Eintracht Frankfurt are near the top of the standings with 13 points from their five matches. Tottenham drop out of the automatic qualification places, overtaken by fellow British side Rangers, who won 4-1 in Nice tonight. Manchester United are a point back on nine after their win against Bodo/Glimt. The Athletic's Jay Harris, Jack Pitt-Brooke and Liam Tharme were on hand to deliver The Briefing from the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium — check it out below. GO FURTHER Tottenham 2 Roma 2: Late Hummels equaliser denies Spurs victory in wildly open Europa League clash – The Briefing Getty Images A winning start at Old Trafford for Ruben Amorim, but not a convincing victory by any means. They scraped past Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt thanks to Rasmus Hojlund's winner. Elsewhere, there was a massive win for Rangers in France and Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce won late in the Czech Republic. Advertisement The second half had everything, even though we had to wait more than 45 minutes for a goal. There were big chances at both ends, saves from both goalkeepers, crunching tackles, and four shots that cannoned back off the crossbar. It was everything we have come to expect from matches involving Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham. On another night, Spurs would have won handsomely but they also had to heed plenty of warnings, including three Roma goals that were denied by the offside flag. A superb game of Europa League football! It is kicking off in the away end following the full-time whistle and I can see a lot missiles being thrown. Getty Images Tottenham finally punished for their lack of efficiency in both boxes and concede an added time equaliser to Hummels.  Have to say that result is probably fair enough given everything.  Spurs should have put the game to bed a lot earlier."
Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Lions hang on to defeat Bears in NFL Thanksgiving Day game: Reaction and analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/live-blogs/bears-vs-lions-live-score-updates-nfl-result/TZEHAMNGwvPM/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 22:56:00 GMT",The Lions improve to 11-1 as they beat the Bears 23-20 in a wacky finish,"NFL Advertisement live Updated 55m ago The Lions had to hold off a furious second-half charge by Chicago’s Caleb Williams and benefitted from questionable clock management to nab a 10th straight victory with a 23-20 win over the Bears. Detroit (11-1) continues to lead the NFC North and hold the top seed in the NFC. An annual participant in Thanksgiving football, the Lions notched their first win on the holiday in eight years. On the other side, Chicago (4-8) dropped its sixth consecutive game after a 4-2 start to the season. Read more about the Lions' win below.  Stream the game on Fubo and get the best ticket deals on StubHub.  GO FURTHER Lions hold off Bears in wild ending for first Thanksgiving win in 8 years: Key takeaways Chicago Bears coach Matt Eberflus addressed the clock management that saw his team run one play — despite having a timeout in hand — in the final 36 seconds of a Thanksgiving 23-20 loss to the Detroit Lions. “We’re at 36 seconds right there (after the sack),” Eberflus told reporters after the game. “Our hope was that we’d re-rack that play at 18 seconds, throw it inbounds, get it into field goal range and then call the timeout. That’s where it was and that was our decision-making process on that. “We were outside of field goal range and needed to get a few more yards in there as close as we can get and then we were going to call timeout and that’s why we held that last timeout at the end of the game. Disappointed for the players. They put a lot of work in on a short week and put themselves in position to win that game.” Read more about Eberflus' decision below.  GO FURTHER Bears coach Matt Eberflus explains why Chicago didn’t use timeout at end of game vs. Lions Advertisement Getty Images After the game, Bears cornerback Kyler Gordon did not hold back his comments regarding the end of the game.  ""I thought we were at least going to kick a field goal,"" Gordon said, as he watched from the sidelines as the Bears were in field goal range.  Asked if there's an underlying reason for the close losses, Gordon responded: ""Next question. No comment.""  The Lions’ dream season continues, even though it’s hard to feel too good about this one. Injuries continued to pile up, with Levi Onwuzurike, Josh Paschal and Malcolm Rodriguez all leaving this game without returning. Others like DJ Reader, Za’Darius Smith and Mekhi Wingo all left the game before coming back. It feels like injuries are the only thing that can derail this team right now. They won’t have much time to rest after this one, either, with the Packers coming to town in Week 14 for “Thursday Night Football.” The Lions escaped with a win, but the injury bug continues to bite. Three straight games against teams in the NFC North have resulted in three wild finishes for the Bears — and three losses. The Bears lost to the Packers on a blocked field goal, to the Vikings in overtime after erasing an 11-point deficit and to the Lions on Thanksgiving on a heave to the end zone as time expired in a three-point game. If there’s one positive, it’s that Caleb Williams can excel against tough opponents. He just needs to prove he can beat them. He’s not there yet, but the rookie quarterback definitely is close. Williams was 20-for-39 passing for 256 yards and three touchdowns for a 97.8 passer rating. The Lions entered the game leading the league in opposing QB passer rating at 72.7.  Getty Images The Bears had all the momentum, shrinking a 16-point Lions lead to 3 in the final frame. Detroit had issues in the red zone. Its defense was shorthanded. This was the time to get them. The Bears had every opportunity to hand the Lions their second loss of the season — getting into field goal range on their final possession. Yet, a series of penalties and a decision to go for the end zone with a timeout left thwarted the opportunity. At the end of the day, the Lions will take it — but this was far from their best performance. They didn’t close out the game like they normally do, but sometimes, that’s just the NFL. They’re fortunate to win the game, improving to 11-1 for the first time in franchise history. They’ve won 10 games in a row, and continue to maintain the NFC’s No. 1 seed. That’s enough for a Happy Thanksgiving. Getty Images The Bears keep finding new ways to lose one-score games. They looked like they were going to lose in a rout in Detroit, came all the way back, had the ball in field goal range but a cacophony of errors at the end led to Williams’ pass falling incomplete as time expired. They had one timeout left after Williams was sacked on what appeared to be a broken play. We’ll have a lot of questions, again, for coach Matt Eberflus about how that happened. It’s another head-scratcher for a team that has had too many this season, and during this six-game losing streak, they’ve never been on the right side of a coin-flip game.  Advertisement Getty Images After the QB Draw call on second-and-20, you can call timeout and get the perfect play called on third down to get back into field goal range.  You can then easily have enough time left in the game to run your field goal unit onto the field for “fast FG” on fourth down. The Lions are back on ""Thursday Night Football"" next week, hosting the Green Bay Packers in another NFC North divisional matchup.   Todd S: As soon as the Bears flight lands in Chicago… fire Eberflus!!!! Kevin C: The Bears are who we thought they were. Edward S: Never, ever EVER apologize for a win. Especially if the other team literally hands the game over to you on a silver platter. Happy Thanksgiving, y'all. Scott S: It should have been a Chicago win. Detroit was less than impressive. Join the conversation by clicking the 'Discuss' tab at the top of this page or by clicking here. Getty Images The Detroit Lions defensive line made it tough for Caleb Williams today.  Aaron Glenn's defense recorded five sacks, which was more than double what they average per game (2.3 sacks per game).  They also became the 12th team in the NFL this season to reach the 30-sack plateau. The Bears travel to San Francisco to take on the 49ers on Dec. 8. The week after, it's an NFC North matchup between the Bears and Vikings.  Advertisement  Caleb Williams started sloppy in today's game against Detroit but rebounded nicely after halftime.  Williams threw for 256 yards, three touchdowns, and zero interceptions despite the Bears' 23-20 loss to the Lions. It marked the first time in the rookie quarterback's career that he registered three passing scores and zero interceptions.  He has also avoided an interception in each of his last six games.  The Athletic  Above are the latest NFC North standings following the Lions win. Detroit improves to 3-0 in its divisional record.

Advertisement “We were outside of field goal range and needed to get a few more yards in there as close as we can get and then we were going to call timeout and that’s why we held that last timeout at the end of the game.

We just got to do it a little bit better.” Williams offered his perspective and explained why he made an adjustment at the line as time was ticking down. “I don’t have a microphone to speak to coach or anything like that,” Williams said. “There wasn’t any huge communication. In that situation you get a call at that time, you got to try and get the guys back, get everyone lined up so you can go run a play. “We got lined up, got the play and I made an adjustment because I saw the clock running down knowing that if we complete a ball inbounds or anything like that, we won’t have time to kick a field goal. I made an adjustment and knew Rome (Odunze) was either going to be one-on-one or he was going to beat the safety and be one-on-one there and try to give him a shot. We got the shot and missed.” Advertisement Tight end Cole Kmet added, “All of a sudden, I see everybody come on the field and the game’s over. So I was kind of like, ‘What the (expletive) had just happened?’ … I’m sure the thought process was then to be able to get some yardage and then take the timeout and then kick the field goal. But we were just a little too late on that. And then that ended up being the final play.”   Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

The loss was also the third in a row in the NFC North — with the three divisional losses happening by a total of seven points. “We got to find a way to win,” wide receiver DJ Moore said, who added he was not sure why a timeout wasn’t called. “We keep coming back in these games and we have time to actually win the game and we just s–t the bed.” Eberflus, who is in his third season as the head coach, has a 14-32 record leading the team. Earlier this month, the team changed offensive coordinators to help spark a unit that had struggled for much of the season. That said, he knows the buck stops with him.
 “I’m the head football coach, so I’m taking the blame of course,” Eberflus said of the defeat. “That’s what you do. We didn’t get it done. That starts at the top and it starts right here. Accountability is right here with me. We got to do it better. I got to do it better. I was proud of the guys and the way they fought. They did a good job putting themselves in position.” When asked if he was worried that he might be let go following this loss, Eberflus said, “I’m just going to keep grinding and working.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Tottenham 2 Roma 2: Late Hummels equaliser denies Spurs victory in wildly open Europa League clash - The Briefing,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5949205/2024/11/28/tottenham-roma-result-analysis/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 22:01:38 GMT","Jack Pitt-Brooke, Jay Harris and Liam Tharme break down the key moments from Thursday's Europa League tie","UEL Tottenham conceded a stoppage-time equaliser to drop two points against Roma on Thursday evening. The first half was a delicious Europa League mix of excitement and defensive chaos as both teams showed invention going forward and gaps at the back. Spurs took an early lead after a VAR-advised penalty was tucked home by Son Heung-min, but Roma — prompted by the excellent Paulo Dybala — equalised via Evan N’Dicka and then had a Stephan El Shaarawy effort ruled out for offside. Advertisement Brennan Johnson then put the home side back in front with a typical finish after fine work from Dejan Kulusevski — one of eight shots on target Ange Postecoglou’s side had in the opening 45 minutes. Things continued in a similar fashion after the break. Roma looked dangerous but were repeatedly foiled by Spurs’ defensive line and the offside flag, while the home side looked repeatedly dangerous on the break. But it was the visitors who finally scored another — Mats Hummels finishing from close range on the second phase of a corner. Jack Pitt-Brooke, Jay Harris and Liam Tharme break down the key moments from the game.  We all know how Tottenham like to play: dominating the ball in the opposition half, trying to find overloads, and wearing the opposition down with their movement until they finally find a way through. Many Spurs games end up with them facing a low block, trying to find their way through. But the past week has been a reminder that when Spurs do get the opportunity to break forward on the counter, they can be deadly. That was how they enjoyed so much of their success against Manchester City, taking advantage of the running power of Kulusevski, Dominic Solanke and eventually Timo Werner to attack the space City left behind their defence. That was the story against Roma, too. Spurs’ second goal was a beautiful counter-attack, Pape Matar Sarr playing a perfect ball up the line for Kulusevski to run onto. Bursting down the left, Kulusevski got his left-footed cross just right and Johnson was there to sweep the ball into the net. It was a great example of how dangerous Spurs can be when they get the chance to attack like that. Sometimes they almost look a bit short of practice at it though. Early in the second half, Spurs had a five-vs-three scenario but still managed not to score, Hummels covering and managing to tackle Kulusevski just in time. In the end, it cost them. Jack Pitt-Brooke Heading into this game, all of the attention was on Forster after Tottenham’s first-choice goalkeeper, Guglielmo Vicario, fractured his right ankle during last weekend’s 4-0 victory over Manchester City and underwent surgery on Monday. It is vital that Forster replicates Vicario’s bravery in possession. Postecoglou joked that “I don’t need my goalkeepers to be (Michel) Platini or (Paolo) Maldini, but it is about executing really simple passes and it is more about mindset”.
 Advertisement Forster made a couple of passes in the first half, including a chip towards Dominic Solanke, that you would not describe as simple, but he improved throughout. He produced a fantastic line-breaking pass at the beginning of the second half and did not show any signs of panic despite having two of Roma’s forwards chasing him. Strangely, Roma put the ball past Forster four times, but three of those goals were ruled out for offside. There was nothing Forster could have done to stop El Shaarawy’s crisp volley, but he should have done better with Artem Dovbyk’s finish. Forster’s best moment came in the 17th minute. Zeki Celik played a cute pass into space for Dybala. It was a tight angle for the Argentina international and he attempted to cleverly poke the ball over Forster with the outside of his boot. Forster saved Dybala’s shot and, crucially, held onto it. He then made a great save in stoppage time to push Gianluca Mancini’s volley away, but Roma’s equaliser came from the resulting corner. Jay Harris For a makeshift centre-back pairing, Ben Davies and Radu Dragusin more than held their own. Tottenham, as always, were playing margins — Roma had three goals disallowed for offside, including two in as many second-half minutes. Tottenham caught them offside nine times, the most by any team in a Europa League game this season (after Qarabag were offside six times versus Tottenham in September). Claudio Ranieri’s side set up with a 3-4-3 wing-back system featuring two No 10s behind a striker, with the focus clear: get it wide early and cross it. Dragusin especially was dominant in defending his box (four clearances) and the one time Dovbyk did escape Davies and finish one-touch past Forster from Celik’s cross, the flag went up. Roma’s two goals came from set pieces. The first was a wide free kick that N’Dicka headed in, unmarked, and the late equaliser came from a fizzed pass across goal on the second phase of a corner — after Forster had made an excellent save from a half-volley. There’s work to do on in-game management for Postecoglou. Liam Tharme Tottenham missed so many chances here that they could easily have won by a distance. But at the same time, Roma missed quite a few themselves — and had three goals disallowed — and will fly home regretting that they did not win. It was that sort of game: open, dramatic, marked by a mix of both good and bad quality from both teams. Advertisement It is easy enough to pick holes in Spurs’ performance, not least the long spell in the middle of the first half when they switched off and the long spell in the middle of the second, and then of course the conclusion to the game, when they conceded the equaliser. Every time they kept giving the ball away, conceding chances, and they were eventually punished in added time.  There were some problems with game management and the lack of efficiency in both boxes, but maybe we should not be too harsh. Spurs came into this game without their best goalkeeper or two first-choice centre-backs. Richarlison and Wilson Odobert both have long-term injuries. Destiny Udogie was rested and kept on the bench. Spurs’ calendar is so busy for the rest of the year — continuous Thursday/Sunday games — that they will struggle to play their best football for 90 minutes twice a week. There may well be more games like this to come. Jack Pitt-Brooke  After the game, Postecoglou said: “Yeah, it’s frustrating. We should have killed it off a lot earlier. We should have killed it in the first half with the chances that we had. At 2-1, you’re keeping the opposition in the game, so they’re throwing men forward. It’s disappointing that we couldn’t see the game out, but we’re still in a decent position.” On squad depth, the Spurs manager said: “It is what it is. We’ve been in this situation for quite a while. We are fairly thin in terms of squad depth at the moment. We had four kids on the bench. I still think we had enough of the game and enough clear-cut chances to win the game.” Postecoglou commented on Forster’s performance, saying he has faith in the 36-year-old. “I don’t think he’s lacking in confidence. He is an experienced guy,” he said. “It’s helped he’s already played this year. He’s played his part tonight and it’s just disappointing we weren’t able to capitalise on the football we played to get the three points. It’s always good for him to at least pull off a couple of big saves for us tonight and get him back into the group.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Manchester United 3 Bodo/Glimt 2: Amorim's first win, Hojlund double - The Briefing",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5949204/2024/11/28/manchester-united-bodo-glimt-hojlund-result/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 21:57:48 GMT",Laurie Whitwell dissects the key talking points from Ruben Amorim's first win in charge of Manchester United,"UEL “Bem-vindo a casa Ruben”  (“Welcome home”) read the large surfer flag unveiled before kick-off at Old Trafford and Ruben Amorim duly experienced the full array of emotions that comes with a Manchester United performance of late. The new head coach was greeted warmly by the fans during his first game in charge at Old Trafford and his team responded accordingly, with Rasmus Hojlund putting pressure on Bodo/Glimt goalkeeper Nikita Haikin and Alejandro Garnacho slotting the ball away in just 52 seconds. Advertisement The opener set the tone for an eventful night. Two goals in three minutes and 45 seconds for the Norwegian side put an unbalanced United side on the back foot in the first half, although Hojlund equalised just before half-time after a deft ball from Noussair Mazraoui. Tyrell Malacia, back in the starting XI for the first time in 550 days after knee surgeries, was taken off at half-time and Amorim’s change had an immediate impact, with Hojlund striking again to put United ahead in the 50th minute. The win, which was not without its late scares, takes United up to 12th in the Europa League table (and if you don’t know what that means, you’re not alone — we explain it here). Laurie Whitwell dissects the key talking points from Old Trafford… Ruben’s Rapid Reds got off to a flier again. Ahead after 81 seconds at Portman Road in Sunday’s 1-1 draw against Ipswich Town, this time it took them 52 seconds to gain the lead. They were given a major assist by Glimt goalkeeper Haikin, who will wonder why he decided to try to take the ball past Hojlund and succeeded only in offering the United striker a chance to steal possession. Credit to Hojlund for sprinting with intensity and wrestling Haikin off the ball. It left Garnacho with the easiest goal he will ever score. As he did at Ipswich, Amorim kept it cool for the celebration, but he must be pleased his team are starting games with a bang. Amorim showed more of his emotions for Hojlund’s equaliser, turning to supporters and letting out a primal roar, pumping his fists. It felt like an important goal, coming just before half-time for a player who is the focus of much attention given United’s need to score more. With all the debate about United’s scoring potential, the focus has fallen on Hojlund. As United’s No 9 this season, he will surely need to get close or pass the 20-goal mark for the team to secure Champions League qualification. But his performance against Glimt showed that if he is given the ball in dangerous areas, he will find the finish.  Hojlund’s 16 goals in all competitions in his debut campaign was a respectable total for a 21-year-old new to England, but he was sitting on two from 13 appearances heading into this game. He doubled his season total inside 50 minutes. His first was an absolutely brilliant finish, collecting Mazraoui’s cross with his left foot before striking with his right into the far corner. He did it all in one motion, so smoothly it spoke of a player with really high potential. Perhaps he found killer inspiration from watching Gladiator 2, given he celebrated with the iconic method of emperors deciding a combatant’s fate in the Colosseum. Hojlund told TNT Sports: “He (Amorim) told me today not to think too much about the guys behind me and try to work a little bit more about what I can see in the front, and be a little bit more aggressive towards the goal, and obviously you can see that in the first goal and I’m happy for that.” His second came at the end of a great section of team play, which culminated in Mason Mount backheeling to set Manuel Ugarte clear. Hojlund passed Ugarte’s low first-time cross into the net. He looked offside, but the goal was given after a VAR check. Advertisement Hojlund could have had a hat-trick had Garnacho followed the lead of his team-mates and passed his way rather than shooting after racing through. Hojlund peeled into space at the right moment, but Garnacho instead had a go himself, with Haikin pulling off the save. Nevertheless, it was a confidence-boosting occasion for the striker. For much of the first half, this looked like being a bad night for United. Having taken the lead, they were then cut through by Glimt repeatedly and trailed after 23 minutes. The Norwegian’s first was a cracking shot from Hakon Evjen, with the only criticism that United failed to close him down. But the second was more concerning, with Glimt taking advantage of Amorim’s man-marking system out of possession. Lisandro Martinez had pushed high from left centre-back to pressure his opponent, but instead, Patrick Berg went long to Philip Zinckernagel, who was one-on-one with Malacia. The United player had a lead on Zinckernagel but was left trailing in his wake and was only able to offer a shove as the Glimt forward went into the box. Zinckernagel was undeterred and finished between Andre Onana’s legs. The 6,714 Bodo fans in yellow went potty — the largest away crowd at Old Trafford in a European game. Before the restart, Amorim shouted over to Martinez to give instructions on his movements, with the Argentine acknowledging. Malacia’s recovery from a knee injury after such a long period out was heartwarming, but he looked very rusty and, at half-time, Amorim made the decision to substitute him. Diogo Dalot’s arrival in the second half improved United, but there are clear additions needed for Amorim’s squad. He started Antony at right wing-back and by the end had Casemiro at centre-back. The back five to finish was Amad, Mazraoui (who had another excellent game), Casemiro, Luke Shaw and Dalot. It was an unorthodox defensive line-up, a sign of how Amorim will try to think creatively, but there were a few hairy moments towards the end.  The Manchester United head coach told TNT Sports: “I see what everybody sees — good moments, difficult moments, some confusion in the end, trying to hold the result. But the lads did a good job. They ran, they pressed, they tried to do the things we did these three days (in training) and we won. “The first thing is that half of the stadium doesn’t know me, doesn’t really know me. I came from Portugal. I did nothing for this club yet, so the way they make me feel at home is so special. Advertisement “I get anxious because I don’t know what will happen. You don’t control anything at the moment. We have an idea for each game, but I don’t know the players, so we go to the game excited but at the same time you are a little bit anxious because you don’t know how the game’s going to go. “We did like four substitutions because of the fitness of the players, not thinking about the game. We are in that moment — we need the squad fit and we have to take some risks.” Sunday, December 1: Everton (home), Premier League, 1:30pm UK, 8:30am ET (Top photo: Marc Atkins/Getty Images)) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Detroit (11-1) continues to lead the NFC North and hold the top seed in the NFC. Advertisement An annual participant in Thanksgiving football, the Lions notched their first win on the holiday in eight years. On the other side, Chicago (4-8) dropped its sixth consecutive game after a 4-2 start to the season. After a tough first half, Williams rebounded to toss three second-half touchdowns — two to Keenan Allen and one to DJ Moore. With 3:31 left, Chicago got the ball back at its own 1-yard line and Williams drove the team to the Lions’ 25 before the drive stalled. Williams was sacked at the Lions’ 41-yard line with 32 seconds left.

GO DEEPER 'They like to push the boundaries': The Lions score lots of TDs and love celebrating them The Bears keep finding new ways to lose one-score games. They looked like they were going to lose in a rout in Detroit, came all the way back, had the ball in field goal range but a cacophony of errors at the end led to Williams’ pass falling incomplete as time expired. They had one timeout left after Williams was sacked on what appeared to be a broken play. We’ll have a lot of questions, again, for coach Matt Eberflus about how that happened. It’s another head-scratcher for a team that has had too many this season, and during this six-game losing streak, they’ve never been on the right side of a coin flip game. — Kevin Fishbain, Bears beat writer
 GO DEEPER Matt Eberflus explains why Bears didn't use TO at end of game vs. Lions  The Bears had all the momentum, shrinking a 16-point Lions lead to 3 in the final frame. Detroit had issues in the red zone. Its defense was shorthanded. This was the time to get them. The Bears had every opportunity to hand the Lions their second loss of the season — getting into field goal range on their final possession. Yet, a series of penalties and a decision to go for the end zone with a timeout left thwarted the opportunity. Advertisement At the end of the day, the Lions will take it — but this was far from their best performance. They didn’t close out the game like they normally do, but sometimes, that’s just the NFL. They’re fortunate to win the game, improving to 11-1 for the first time in franchise history. They’ve won 10 games in a row, and continue to maintain the NFC’s No. 1 seed. That’s enough for a Happy Thanksgiving. — Colton Pouncy, Lions beat writer   Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.
 Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.  Three straight games against teams in the NFC North have resulted in three wild finishes for the Bears — and three losses. The Bears lost to the Packers on a blocked field goal, to the Vikings in overtime after erasing an 11-point deficit and to the Lions on Thanksgiving on a heave to the end zone as time expired in a three-point game. If there’s one positive, it’s that Williams can excel against tough opponents. He just needs to prove he can beat them. He’s not there yet, but the rookie quarterback definitely is close. Williams was 20-for-39 passing for 256 yards and three touchdowns for a 97.8 passer rating. The Lions entered the game leading the league in opposing QB passer rating at 72.7. — Adam Jahns, Bears beat writer The Lions’ dream season continues, even though it’s hard to feel too good about this one. Injuries continued to pile up, with Levi Onwuzurike, Josh Paschal and Malcolm Rodriguez all leaving this game without returning. Others like DJ Reader, Za’Darius Smith and Mekhi Wingo all left the game before coming back. It feels like injuries are the only thing that can derail this team right now.

Advertisement Boise State forfeited two regular-season games against SJSU earlier this season instead of competing against an alleged transgender player on the Spartans’ roster. Now, the Broncos have said they’ll forgo another match and chance to continue competing for a potential bid to the NCAA Tournament. The Spartans received a first-round bye, and with Boise State’s withdrawal from the game scheduled for Friday, they will advance to the championship match on Saturday in Las Vegas. No. 6 Boise State beat No. 3 Utah State in four sets on Wednesday. “The decision to not continue to play in the 2024 Mountain West Volleyball Championship tournament was not an easy one,” Boise State said in its statement. “Our team overcame forfeitures to earn a spot in the tournament field and fought for the win over Utah State in the first round on Wednesday. They should not have to forgo this opportunity while waiting for a more thoughtful and better system that serves all athletes.” No. 1 Colorado State and No. 5 San Diego State are slated to play in the other semifinal match on Friday. No. 2 San Jose State received six wins due to conference opponents forfeiting during the season. Colorado State and San Diego State previously played the Spartans rather than forfeiting. The Mountain West said Thursday that decisions to forfeit matches are at the schools’ discretion and are considered losses. “San Jose State will advance to the MW Women’s Volleyball Championship final,” the Mountain West said in a statement. San Jose State also issued a statement Thursday, saying, “In this time of Thanksgiving, we are especially thankful for those who continue to engage in civil and respectful discourse.” “We celebrate and support all of our students, including our student-athletes as they compete for our community on this holiday weekend,” the statement continued. “While we are disappointed in Boise State’s decision, our women’s volleyball team is preparing for Saturday’s match and looks forward to competing for a championship.” Advertisement Four other schools — Southern Utah, Utah State, Wyoming and Nevada — have forfeited or canceled matches against San Jose State since late September. Players from several of those schools are among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed in Colorado against the Mountain West and its commissioner, Gloria Nevarez, alleging San Jose State and the conference violated the U.S. Constitution and Title IX by allowing a transgender athlete to play for a women’s sports team. On Tuesday, a federal appellate court denied the plaintiffs’ emergency injunction request seeking to declare the SJSU player who they allege is transgender ineligible for the conference tournament. That decision upheld a ruling by a district judge, Kato Crews, issued the day prior. Both Crews and the two-person panel for the appellate court ruled that the plaintiffs failed to establish irreparable harm by allowing the alleged transgender athlete to compete. The Athletic is not naming the alleged transgender athlete because the athlete has not been publicly identified. The school has not publicly confirmed whether the athlete is transgender. Crews, in his decision Monday, wrote, “No Defendant disputed that SJSU rosters a trans woman volleyball player.” Wyoming and Nevada did not qualify for the conference tournament.

GO DEEPER Iga Swiatek receives one-month doping ban after positive test in summer Swiatek, a four-time Roland Garros champion,  tested positive for a trace concentration of TMZ, a drug normally used as heart medication for its ability to enhance blood flow, in an out-of-competition sample on August 12 ahead of the Cincinnati Open. The 23-year-old was informed of the positive test by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) exactly one month later, September 12, and given a mandatory provisional suspension. Swiatek appealed that provisional suspension within 10 days of the original notice. The appeal was successful, so her provisional suspension was not publicly disclosed. This is in line with the Tennis Anti-Doping Programme (TADP) regulations. Advertisement Because Swiatek served 22 days of the ban while the case was being investigated, she only has eight more days to serve. She will be allowed to play from December 4, meaning she will be eligible for the Australian Open, the first Grand Slam of 2025, which begins January 12.  The ITIA issued the ban after ruling that the player’s level of fault was at the lowest end of the range for ‘No Significant Fault or Negligence’ and was not intentional.  According to the European Medicines Agency, trimetazidine “is a medicine used to prevent angina attacks, which are sudden pains to the chest, jaw and back brought on by physical effort, due to reduced blood flow to the heart.” Because it increases blood flow, TMZ has been included on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s (WADA) list of prohibited substances since 2014. It is listed as a “metabolic modulator” and its use by athletes is banned, both in and out of competition. “What this drug does is actually make your heart work more efficiently,” Dr. Elizabeth Murray, pediatric emergency medicine physician at the University of Rochester Medical Center, told CNN’s Early Start program in 2022. “It doesn’t change your blood pressure very much or change your heart rate. “An athlete wouldn’t get jittery or necessarily feel all that different, but they would theoretically be able to perform at a higher level for longer. It would increase their endurance, potentially.” The amount of TMZ found in Swiatek’s system was extremely low. Dr Andrzej Pokrywka of the Medical University of Warsaw, an expert in anti-doping at the Center for Sports Medicine, and someone who originally recommended TMZ be added to WADA’s banned list, said in analysis shared by Swiatek’s camp on Thursday that: “The concentration of the substance in the urine sample is extremely low, and the negative result of the analysis of the athlete’s hair sample confirmed that there was no ingestion of trimetazidine by her in an amount corresponding to even a single lowest therapeutic dose for the substance.” Advertisement To combat the effects of jet lag, Swiatek said she was taking a non-prescription medication containing melatonin that was recommended by her doctor. After a series of independent laboratory tests, it was concluded that this medicine had been contaminated with TMZ. The ITIA said in its statement Thursday: “The ITIA accepted that the positive test was caused by the contamination of a regulated non-prescription medication (melatonin), manufactured and sold in Poland that the player had been taking for jet lag and sleep issues, and that the violation was therefore not intentional. This followed interviews with the player and their entourage, investigations, and analysis from two WADA-accredited laboratories.” In an emotional, seven-minute video released Thursday, Swiatek explained the toll that the whole affair has taken on her. Particularly the fact that she had to remain silent when pulling out of the Korea Open, China Open and Wuhan Open, citing fitness concerns, “personal issues” and then a change of coach. Missing those three events also saw Swiatek lose her No. 1 ranking, and her suspension will also see her lose the points she won at the Cincinnati Open in August where the positive test was taken. Swiatek said in her video: “This experience, the most difficult in my life so far, taught me a lot. “There were many tears and lots of sleepless nights. The worst part of it was the uncertainty. I didn’t know what was going to happen with my career, how things would end or if I would be allowed to play tennis at all. “I admit this situation hit me hard, because all my life I strived to have a career that could be an example for generations to come.” WADA does not mandate the announcement of provisional suspensions. Advertisement Some sports do it and some don’t. Tennis actually does, with the ITIA erring on the side of transparency. The exception to that rule comes when a player appeals against the suspension within 10 days, as was the case with Swiatek. Once appealed, the case is considered to be under investigation and therefore confidential from the ITIA side until it has been concluded (the player under investigation could technically speak publicly about it). On a conference call with reporters Thursday, the ITIA’s CEO Karen Moorhouse said the rules are in place in the “interests of fairness”, adding: “We’ve been absolutely transparent once they’ve reached an outcome.” She said that it was up to every sport to consider what worked best for them in terms of confidentiality, and that the ITIA regularly reviews its processes. GO DEEPER What players' reaction to Sinner's doping case says about their trust in their sport If it can be proved, like in this case, that the athlete had no knowledge of the presence of the banned substance, and that it was reasonable for them to have that expectation, then that will affect the level of punishment they receive. Here, it was deemed reasonable that Swiatek should have taken a medicine that was not supposed to contain any known banned substances, and which is available over the counter in Poland and was recommended by her doctor, without anticipating that it might lead to a doping violation. The ITIA considered “the player’s level of fault was considered to be at the lowest end of the range” and the shortness of Swiatek’s ban is commensurate with that. Had she been deemed to have had no fault or negligence then she would have escaped a ban altogether. A ‘no significant fault or negligence’ verdict is, broadly speaking, divided into three bands: Low, where a ban is usually 1-8 months, medium (8-16) and high (16-24). Advertisement “Once you get into a particular band you look into the objective fault,” explained Ben Rutherford, senior director, legal, at the ITIA during Thursday’s conference call. “You look at the substance. How risky is it? Is it a medication in that country? Is it a supplement? “Then look at subjective factors. Does the player have education? How old is the player? What sort of resources does the player have to conduct their own testing? What steps did they take to check labels? To take proper advice from sports physician? To check the WADA website etc.” It’s not uncommon. Tennis players are constantly travelling and looking to improve their sleep and sleep quality due to frequent time-zone changes. According to the document shared by Swiatek’s team on Thursday, the medicine she was taking is recommended to tennis players and athletes in general for this very reason. In December last year, Britain’s world No. 24 Katie Boulter told the WTA website that her secret to good sleep was: “Melatonin, 100 per cent. When I discovered melatonin, my life changed. I don’t take it very often, and when I do, the only reason is because of jet lag. It just gives you that little nudge to get to sleep when you really need to. And I don’t get much of a hangover. I’m not a fan of putting drugs in my system, but that’s one I stand by.” In the same WTA article, Ukraine’s Anhelina Kalinina and Kazakhstan’s Yulia Putintseva also said they took melatonin to help their sleep patterns. Not especially. According to the ITIA, testing numbers and the number of anti-doping rule violations have remained pretty steady over the last few years. According to the most recent two ITIA annual reports, 12 individuals were sanctioned for doping offences in 2022, compared to 13 last year. But this year has been remarkable because two of tennis’s most high-profile players — Sinner and now Swiatek — have been given doping sanctions. Advertisement Every case is different and so it’s not possible to directly compare them. Sinner tested positive for clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid, on March 10 at the BNP Paribas Open held in Indian Wells, Calif, and on March 18, out of competition. It was determined that the Italian bore “no fault or negligence” for his positive tests, and therefore wasn’t deserving of a ban. WADA has since challenged this and appealed to the Court of Arbitration of Sport (CAS), arguing that Sinner’s level of culpability should be upgraded to “no significant fault or negligence” which would leave him facing a ban of up to two years. It is this “no significant fault or negligence” classification that has been applied to Swiatek, but at the very lowest end, hence her relatively short ban. GO DEEPER Jannik Sinner's doping case explained: What WADA appeal means and what is at stake for tennis That is a possibility, although there is not much precedent in terms of other “no significant fault or negligence” cases. WADA has 15 days to request the files, and then 21 days after receipt to lodge an appeal to the CAS. Though this period could be longer if the Polish anti-doping agency (POLADA) decides to get involved. Swiatek’s ban expires next Wednesday (December 4), so she will be eligible to play once tour events resume at the end of December. The key thing is that Swiatek will be eligible for the Australian Open, the first Grand Slam of the year and one of the two majors (along with Wimbledon) she has not won. That begins on Sunday, January 12. Coupled with the Sinner case, this threatens to do major damage. Even though it has been shown there has been no intention to dope in either case, there will be plenty of supporters who feel disillusioned with what has happened. Advertisement And even though due process has been followed throughout both cases, there will be question marks around the rules that mean it’s taken so long for information to be made public. Moorhouse said on Thursday: “The first point to reiterate is that these are not cases of intentional doping. “We’re dealing with inadvertent breaches of the rules so I don’t think it is a cause for concern for tennis fans and the like. The fact that we’re being transparent shows the depth and breadth of our doping program.” (Top photo: Antonio Borga / Anadolu via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Van Nistelrooy's attacking approach may be just what this Leicester team needs,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5954932/2024/11/28/van-nistelrooy-leicester-attacking-approach/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 19:00:02 GMT",The Dutchman is in the frame to replace Steve Cooper - if he can replicate his playing style from PSV then Leicester's squad will be happy,"EPL When potential new Leicester City manager Ruud van Nistelrooy was a player, everyone knew what to expect: goals. There weren’t many of the Dutchman’s generation who were better at putting the ball in the net.  During his 20-year career, which included spells at two of the world’s biggest clubs — Manchester United and Real Madrid — he scored 349 goals in 592 appearances. He also scored 35 times in 70 appearances for the Netherlands. Advertisement He was in the elite category of forwards — a single-minded goal machine who would famously be left unsatisfied by a victory if he hadn’t scored. Now aged 48, there is an element of the unknown about Van Nistelrooy the coach with just one (almost) full season (he left PSV with one game to go at the end of the 2022-23 Eredivisie campaign) as a head coach on his CV. That doesn’t mean he hasn’t gained valuable experience. In fact, he has been coaching for more than a decade, learning his trade from the grassroots up — initially working with the junior players at PSV while he took his coaching badges, and also learning from Guus Hiddink and Ronald Koeman as a member of the Netherlands’ backroom coaching staff for the 2014 World Cup and Euro 2020 respectively. His one season at PSV was successful, winning the KNVB Cup (equivalent of England’s FA Cup) and the Johan Cruyff Shield (equivalent of the Community Shield), while finishing second in the Eredivisie to qualify for the Champions League. A year later after leaving PSV, he chose to continue his education as assistant to Erik ten Hag at Manchester United. In many ways his pathway to Leicester, if he does indeed join, is similar to previous manager Enzo Maresca, who enjoyed a glittering playing career and then patiently built his own coaching career under Manuel Pellegrini at West Ham United and Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, with a brief stint as a head coach at Parma, before stepping out of Guardiola’s shadow to take over at the King Power Stadium in the summer of 2023. Leicester, and more importantly the players who loved Maresca’s approach, will hope the similarities between Maresca’s and Van Nistelrooy’s pathways don’t end there. The players were so wedded to Maresca’s methods and possession-based passing style that they struggled to embrace the different approach brought in by Steve Cooper. Some were even resistant. It was a major factor in Leicester’s decision to part ways with Cooper after just 12 league games. The big question now is how would they adapt to Van Nistelrooy’s approach should he embrace the challenge of trying to keep Leicester in the Premier League. They are currently just one point outside the relegation zone. GO DEEPER A disconnect between manager, squad and fans - how Cooper's time at Leicester came to an end As Van Nistelrooy has had only one season as a head coach, there isn’t a huge amount of data to draw upon — but there are some interesting trends.  Using The Athletic’s playstyle wheel, which outlines how a team look to play compared with other sides in Europe’s top seven domestic leagues by ranking them in percentiles, we can get a broad insight into the Dutchman’s sole season in the hotseat. Blessed with a stacked forward line containing Johan Bakayoko, Luuk de Jong, Xavi Simons and Cody Gakpo (the latter was only there for half of that campaign, leaving for Liverpool in January 2023), PSV adopted a direct style (patient attack, 19 out of 99) that focused on width from their marauding wingers (central progression, 53 out of 99).  Advertisement It wasn’t always smooth sailing, but only Portugal’s Benfica averaged higher than PSV’s 2.2 non-penalty expected goals per 90 across all of Europe’s top seven leagues. PSV were an attacking side who looked to accelerate the game at crucial moments (shot quality 95 out of 99 and chance creation 98 out of 99). That may excite Leicester fans, who struggled to connect with Leicester’s approach under Cooper and even grew frustrated at times with Maresca’s more patient possessional style.  However, his PSV side did still have some similarities to the Leicester of late. They would invariably start in a 4-2-3-1 system, like Cooper’s Leicester (Maresca used a 4-1-4-1) but in possession they would move into a back three, with one of the full-backs either stepping into midfield or pushing high and wide. Under Maresca, Leicester did the former and under Cooper they did the latter. At Van Nistelrooy’s PSV there were two holding midfielders, one of whom would be more of a No 8 — again a familiar look at Leicester with Harry Winks and Wilfred Ndidi adopting those roles — and he loves to use wingers, either out-and-out wide men or ones that are comfortable cutting inside, as Gakpo used to do during their time together. With the towering figure of De Jong playing up front, PSV were also prolific at putting in crosses from wide positions. With Abdul Fatawu ruled out for the season with an ACL injury, Leicester don’t have two genuine out-and-out wingers at their disposal right now. Cooper certainly liked one of his wingers to move inside to become a second No 10 behind a main striker. At PSV, Van Nistelrooy encouraged the two No 10s, or one No 10 and the box-to-box No 8, to make runs into the inside channel to drag central defenders out of position or draw a defensive midfielder deeper, leaving more space for PSV to play centrally. GO DEEPER Leicester's new manager search will be heavily influenced by financial constraints In De Jong, PSV had a main striker who was also the captain and who would lead the pressing — like Leicester have with Jamie Vardy — although as the playstyle wheel shows, with a score of just 16 for holding a high line, PSV were not completely committed to a high press. As Van Nistelrooy explained in his Coaches’ Voice masterclass of his side’s approach to facing Ajax in the 2023 KNVB final, PSV adopted a mid-block in a 4-4-2 formation, leaving space in behind his back line to defend, which requires athleticism and pace from the defenders. It is similar to how Maresca approached his side’s defending as Leicester boss, choosing to close off passing lanes. They would then become aggressive as the opposition played wide, but would drop into a deep shape in their own half. They didn’t concede a shot on target in the final, which they won on penalties. The goal they conceded in the 1-1 draw was an own goal. The first area he must address will be Leicester’s defensive shape — and mistakes — that have arguably been their biggest weakness this season. Van Nistelrooy will already be aware of that having beaten Leicester twice as caretaker manager at Manchester United this season after Ten Hag’s sacking. He only had four games in charge, but his United side beat Leicester 5-2 in the Carabao Cup and then 3-0 in the Premier League before the international break. The Leicester hierarchy took note of how his United side played in those games. GO DEEPER Van Nistelrooy departs after successfully starting the healing process at Manchester United Regardless of who comes in as Cooper’s replacement, the Leicester players are hoping for familiarity, an approach more akin to the style under Maresca that the Italian drilled relentlessly into them. Whoever it is won’t have the luxury of a pre-season. They must quickly assess the squad’s strengths and weaknesses and form a game plan to suit, but if it is to be Van Nistelrooy then he is unlikely to move too far from how he operated at PSV, with some familiar themes to some of the aspects of both Maresca’s and Cooper’s game plans. Advertisement Above all, Van Nistelrooy’s man-management skills would also come to the fore and the Leicester players, who didn’t cover themselves in glory on the field under Cooper, must fully embrace what he asks them to do if he is appointed. If a disconnect between the players and fans proved to be central to Cooper’s downfall, then Van Nistelrooy — if he takes the job — will need to make that connection straight away.

His first job as a manager came in that division, taking Derby to the playoff final in 2019 where they were beaten by Aston Villa. “I’m not disappointed [not to have got a Premier League job],” Lampard told the media at his introductory press conference at Coventry. “This is a business where jobs that have become available are very well pushed for by a lot of good coaches out there that want to work.

All ten of his F1 victories came with Mercedes. Advertisement “(The) priority for me (is) still Formula One. I feel like I’m not done yet with this sport,” Bottas said Thursday. “So, to be around, to be able to hopefully do some testing, et cetera, I think it gives me a chance for ‘26 because, in this sport, you just never know what happens. There is also a new team joining, which means two more seats. So, it obviously increases the opportunities for 2026.” That new team joining is General Motors under the Cadillac brand. The F1 grid will expand to 11 teams in 2026, offering up two more seats to drivers. At this time, it is “an agreement in principle” between F1 and GM. Bottas confirmed that he has spoken with Cadillac and called it “an interesting project.” But he added, “For sure, I’m not the only one.” Focusing on 2025, Mercedes is not the only team entertaining the idea of bringing Bottas on. The Finn said he’s had “talks and approaches” from different IndyCar teams, but “at this point, I made it pretty clear that next year comes a bit too quick.” He’s made the “conscious decision” not to race full-time next season in any series but is open to one-off opportunities. “I think it just comes too quick. Let’s say, for example, jumping into a full IndyCar season, after 12 years of F1, I just feel like it comes a bit too quick, you know, because it’s a lot of hard work and a lot of familiarization to be done, and all these things. So, I try to take just a bit of time, figure out what’s next, and go from there.” After F1 wraps up in Abu Dhabi next weekend, Bottas’ next big race will be the Race of Champions in early March before F1’s Australian Grand Prix, and both Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel will be competing in the event as well. The Finn also has his eye on the Indy 500 one day, saying, “First of all, it depends if I’m going to be around here at every grand prix or not. If yes, then obviously, the options are (more) limited. But, Indy 500 has been always on the list. I’ve been always a fan of V8’s supercars, this kind of thing. So, at the moment, I’m still pretty open, and first, I need to decide, actually, what’s the next move, and then can we see.” He hasn’t spoken to any teams about just running the Indy 500 as “I need to fix what is the actual day job for 2025,” but Bottas did receive “a solid offer for ‘25.” His goal, though, is to stay within the F1 world for now.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Champions League projections: All the talking points after matchday five,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5955295/2024/11/28/champions-league-projections-matchday-five-analysis/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 17:39:01 GMT",Just how much danger are Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain in after their latest defeats?,"UCL Five games into the new-look Champions League and the 36-team table is finally starting to take shape. Sort of. Strong favourites to progress have emerged, with Arne Slot’s Liverpool sat top of the pile after an impressive 2-0 victory over Real Madrid made it five wins from five. Inter are yet to concede a goal, while Barcelona and Arsenal — with convincing results this week — have increased their chances of qualifying for the knockout stages, via the play-offs or otherwise, to at least 90 per cent. Advertisement At the bottom, too, the picture is becoming clearer. There are still three teams without a single point — including surprise strugglers RB Leipzig — along with winless Bologna, whose chances of qualification are hanging by a thread after a fourth successive defeat. There’s also the small issue of the spread of just three points separating Bayer Leverkusen in sixth to Dinamo Zagreb down in 23rd. Given the congestion around the play-off spots, it’s a fair assumption to suggest that Real Madrid and Manchester City will find their way through to the last 16, even if it creates unwanted fixtures to add to an already tight schedule. The projections, however, suggest that one superpower faces an uphill task, with PSG’s projected points tally of nine likely to leave them 26th in the table, a point short of the qualification line. Luis Enrique’s side are now winless in their last four Champions League games following a 1-0 defeat to Bayern Munich, with a tricky trip to Stuttgart and a huge home tie against Pep Guardiola’s City to come. The PSG boss was furious after a last-gasp defeat to Atletico Madrid two weeks prior — describing the result as “inexplicable”, “unjust” and even a “robbery” in his post-match press conference — but the 54-year-old could have no complaints over a drab showing in Munich, the visitors comfortably outplayed even before Ousmane Dembele’s second-half red card.  Real Madrid are just one place above the Parisians in the 36-team table and although the defending champions were similarly blunt at Anfield this week, our projections still give them a much better chance of avoiding a shock exit. Despite three losses in their last four Champions League games — as many as in their previous 29 — they are expected to win their remaining two home games against Red Bull Salzburg and Brest after a daunting trip to high-flying Atalanta, and they have just a seven per cent chance of falling through the early trapdoor. Advertisement Carlo Ancelotti is contending with a number of high-profile injuries at present and while their attacking dynamics have yet to truly click since the summer arrival of Kylian Mbappe, they were particularly unbalanced against Liverpool on Wednesday night. As we can see from his match dashboard below, Mbappe could not make the most of his chance on the left in the absence of Vinicius Junior, consistently looking to cut inside (demonstrated by the dotted lines) to no particular avail.  City’s spectacular collapse at home to Feyenoord — the first team to ever surrender a three-goal lead after the 75th minute in Champions League history — leaves them in the bottom half of the table, too, but, like Madrid, our projections recognise that overall squad quality should see them through. Feyenoord weren’t the only side from the Netherlands to defy the odds this week, as Peter Bosz’s PSV made it four unbeaten in the Champions League with a dramatic 3-2 win over Shakhtar Donetsk. Conceding twice in the first half, the runaway Eredivisie league leaders scored their first goal after 86 minutes and 53 seconds, before hitting twice in stoppage time to secure a famous win. Shakhtar’s goalkeeper Dmytro Riznyk made 15 saves in all as the home side launched 21 shots towards his goal after a 70th-minute red card, as we can see from the sudden peak in their expected goals (xG) step plot below.  Each of PSV’s three goals were scored by USMNT regulars, including a spectacular knuckleball strike from Malik Tillman, wobbling in the air as it soared into the top corner. Ricardo Pepi poked home the late winner, his 13th goal for club and country this season after a hat-trick against Groningen at the weekend. It’s a result that leaves PSV with an 87 per cent chance of making the play-off round, where they might fancy their chances over two legs — now unbeaten (over 90 minutes) in more than two years in competitive action at home. They will have taken those odds at half-time. Gian Piero Gasparini’s Atalanta are one of only three sides yet to lose in the league phase, adding to their impressive streak with an emphatic 6-1 win over Swiss side Young Boys. It’s been over two months since La Dea tasted defeat in any competition, seeing off Napoli and Stuttgart, and scoring 35 goals in 12 games along the way. Advertisement There is some serious attacking talent throughout an eclectic squad; Ademola Lookman inspired them to a Europa League title last season with a hat-trick in the final, while striker Mateo Retegui has scored 16 goals and provided four assists in just under 17 full games for the club. This latest victory, however, was all about Charles De Ketelaere, who became just the third player in Champions League history — alongside Erling Haaland and Lionel Messi — to contribute to five goals in a single game. Driving down the right, his first assist for Retegui was an incisive slipped pass through, while a terrific swivelled finish and a deflected effort in the second half put the icing on a clinical creative display.  Amid the noise of the league phase, Atalanta are quietly carving out a very convincing path through to the knockout stage, with a 58 per cent chance of finishing in the top eight. Next up, they host Real Madrid, a fixture which could cause the reigning champions further issues. Borussia Dortmund continued their fine form in this season’s competition with a 3-0 win over Dinamo Zagreb, with Jamie Gittens front and centre once more. Nuri Sahin’s side are fourth in both the actual and our projected table, with a very healthy 75 per cent chance of progressing directly to the last 16. Fellow Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen also took a big step to qualification with a 5-0 win over Red Bull Salzburg. Wing-back Alex Grimaldo scored a dipping free kick, provided an assist, and took seven shots in total, meaning he has now provided 38 goal contributions since joining the club last summer. Pretty good for a wing-back. Arsenal’s 5-1 win over Sporting CP reasserts their grip on a top-eight finish, Mikel Arteta’s side now with a 70 per cent chance of direct qualification to the last 16. Martin Odegaard’s seamless return to the side ignited the right flank once again, with four of their five goals stemming from open-play sequences down that side. Atletico Madrid’s 6-0 thumping of Sparta Prague came almost exactly a year after they beat Celtic by the same scoreline in this competition. Julian Alvarez and Angel Correa both scored twice, while additional finishes from Antoine Griezmann and Alexander Sorloth saw Atletico flex their attacking muscles. They are now projected to finish in 10th place in the league stage. Advertisement And finally, Austrian champions Sturm Graz recorded their first points of the league phase with a tight 1-0 win over Girona, but not without a huge slice of fortune. Ivan Martin scooped the ball over the bar from 2.7 metres in the first half, leaving the Spanish side a mountain to climb if they are to qualify, with Liverpool, Arsenal and Milan up next.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Lando Norris dismisses Verstappen's McLaren title claim: 'He should start doing comedy',https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5955378/2024/11/28/lando-norris-max-verstappen-f1-championship-claim-mclaren/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 17:20:17 GMT",Verstappen has claimed he would have won the 2024 F1 championship earlier had he been driving a McLaren.,"Formula 1 LUSAIL, Qatar — Lando Norris disagrees with Max Verstappen’s belief he would have won the Formula One world championship earlier had he been driving a McLaren, saying the Dutchman “should start doing comedy or something.” Verstappen clinched his fourth F1 world championship last Saturday in Las Vegas with two rounds remaining in the season by finishing ahead of Norris, who had been his sole remaining challenger in the title race. Advertisement Post-race, Verstappen said he thought Red Bull had lacked the quickest car for 70 percent of the season, having endured a 10-race winless run between the Spanish GP in June and Sã0 Paulo GP in November. Red Bull struggled to replicate its dominant early-season form through this period while Norris and McLaren built momentum, allowing them to close up in the title race. Speaking to the Dutch media after the race, Verstappen said he thought he’d have won the title “even earlier” had he been driving a McLaren and that he could also have won the championship in a Ferrari. Earlier in the evening, Verstappen had joked to McLaren CEO Zak Brown during an interview on Sky Sports: “Like you said before, I could only win it in the fastest car. This year has been a little bit different.” When Verstappen’s comment was put to Norris in Qatar on Thursday, the British driver laughed and said: “He should start doing comedy or something. “He can say whatever he wants. Of course, I’m afraid I have to disagree, as I would. He’s good, but, yeah, it’s not true.” McLaren was often the most consistent team through Verstappen’s winless run, but Norris could only claim two victories in that period as teammate Oscar Piastri, Mercedes duo Lewis Hamilton and George Russell, and the Ferrari pair of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz all won races. That open competition played a role in Norris failing to make serious inroads on Verstappen, whose charge from 17th to first in a rainy São Paulo GP shifted the momentum and set him up to win the title in Las Vegas. It was put to Norris that unlike him, Verstappen also did not face close competition from within his own team amid Sergio Pérez’s continued struggles. Pérez has not finished on the podium since China in April, nor has he beaten Verstappen on track this year. Advertisement Norris said there were “pros and cons” to that situation for Verstappen, noting that it also meant he had to do the bulk of the work and scoring himself. “There’s a lot of things that Max can do that are phenomenal,” Norris said. “Driving at the level he does consistently without a teammate that can push him in any way certainly doesn’t make his life harder from that perspective or from a team perspective. “But at the same time, there is no pressure. He doesn’t have to deal with trying to beat someone in his own team and that comes with some comfort. “But they go together, and sometimes, and in some ways, I like having a bit of pressure because it makes me do a better job. I’m sure he’s going to say he doesn’t care, whoever his teammate is he doesn’t mind. “There’s pros and cons of having a strong teammate, and I hope at some point, he has one that can challenge him a bit more.” Verstappen was asked about Norris’ comments later on Thursday but said that: “No one needs to respond. I know perfectly well for myself what I can and cannot do.” He also avoided a question about whether Norris had been gracious in his title defeat and had congratulated him. “We don’t need to talk about that,” Verstappen said. “We don’t need to spend time on trying to slag people off or whatever. The championship is done. We try again next year.” While Norris has lost the drivers’ championship, McLaren does stand a chance of claiming its first constructors’ title since 1998, enjoying a 24-point lead over Ferrari going into the Qatar weekend.

While the midfielder is still weeks away from a first-team return, head coach Nuno Espirito Santo says it has been a “joy” to see him joining in with the rest of the squad. Forest’s players trained on the City Ground pitch today, ahead of the visit of Ipswich Town on Saturday. Advertisement Nuno says the Brazilian took advantage of the other players being warned not to make physical contact with him, by performing ‘like Maradona’. “Danilo. We are so happy because he did all of the training session. You cannot believe the joy that this inspired. To see him and the joy of his teammates, at having him around. It was lovely to see,” said Nuno in his pre-match press conference. “We played a game and I said to the other players ‘nobody can touch Danilo’. So he looked like he was Maradona. Nobody could touch him so he was running through and scoring… “Just to have him around was so nice. We missed him so much. All these players are so important. But it is so good to have people like him back around, back with the group and playing football. That smile is contagious.” Danilo suffered his break on the opening day of the season, early in the 1-1 draw with Bournemouth at the City Ground. Ibrahim Sangare, who has been recovering from a serious hamstring injury, has also been doing light work on the training ground but is not as close to a return as Danilo. “There is no way that he (Danilo) will be involved this weekend, he is still a long way away,” said Nuno. “Danilo is closer than Ibrahim, unfortunately for Ibrahim he is going to take a little longer. “His (Sangare’s) injury is very delicate. Following the surgery he had, we do not want to risk any setback. We have to be patient.” Forest also have injury doubts over Morgan Gibbs-White (ankle), Elliot Anderson (foot), and Anthony Elanga (shoulder). All three will be assessed tomorrow before a decision is made on whether they can play a part this weekend. GO DEEPER Three solutions to Nottingham Forest's three standout problems Over the summer, Nuno’s plan was for Danilo and Sangare to form the deeper-lying midfield duo within his preferred 4-2-3-1 formation. It was felt that the physical presence of Sangare and Danilo’s composure on the ball and own combative nature would be a good combination in front of the back four. But by the end of August, Nuno was missing both men through injury, with Sangare playing only three Premier League games before succumbing to his own (hamstring) injury. Advertisement Players like Ryan Yates, Anderson, Nico Dominguez and James Ward-Prowse have all produced impressive performances in their absence. But having started the season with six strong midfield options, Nuno has recently found himself with only three, with Anderson also struggling to overcome the niggling foot injury he picked up against Crystal Palace. It is still likely to be several weeks – perhaps even until after Christmas – before Danilo is ready for a first-team return. But Danilo is one of the most positive, upbeat characters in the Forest dressing room and even having him back around the group on a daily basis will genuinely be a boost to morale among the squad. When he is ready to play, he will provide another valuable option, as Forest look to continue their positive start to the campaign.

Mercedes announced Schumacher’s eventual departure on Thursday. The 25-year-old German then confirmed he “will continue to be part of the Alpine Endurance adventure,” who he competed with this year and was part of the team that scored Alpine’s maiden World Endurance Championship podium in Fuji. Advertisement “I am grateful to Toto and the entire Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team for the insight I have gained over these two years. They have undoubtedly made me a more experienced racing driver because I have got to know the engineering side better,” Schumacher said in Mercedes’ news release. “But watching these cars race and not sitting in the cockpit myself is tough. I want to get back to focusing 100% on racing. I want to be fully committed to the sporting side of motorsport. Ultimately, it is racing that you want to do as a driver, it is racing that gives you that feeling you love.” Schumacher, a Formula Two champion, spent two years on the grid with Haas but never scored a point. He was dropped after the 2022 season, and Mercedes brought him on as its reserve driver in 2023. During his time with the Silver Arrows, he completed numerous tests and simulator sessions. Schumacher was linked to the once-open Alpine F1 seat, but the team’s lineup will be Pierre Gasly and Jack Doohan in 2025. “Mick’s hard work, diligence, and determination in his role as Reserve Driver has been vital for the team over the past two years,” said Mercedes’ team principal Toto Wolff. GO DEEPER Williams F1 had to replace Logan Sargeant. Why didn't it turn to Lawson or Schumacher? “From his work in the simulator, testing of various cars, and being part of the trackside team, we couldn’t have asked for any more from him. From day one, he fitted into the team with ease and has become an incredibly well-liked colleague for everyone at Brackley and Brixworth. “However, Mick is first and foremost a racing driver. We have seen from both his time in F1, and this year with his performances in the World Endurance Championship, that he is a racer of an incredibly high calibre and one that deserves to be competing in the very best championships. As he moves on to his next challenge, I would like to thank Mick personally for his contribution to our team and we all wish him the very best in his future endeavours.” Advertisement Who will fill Schumacher’s shoes remains to be seen. Bottas, 35, is out of a seat at the end of the 2024 season after Sauber decided to go with Nico Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto for next year’s driver lineup.

The right-back is making a timely return with Conor Bradley a doubt for the game along with fellow defender Ibrahima Konate after they both picked up injuries against Madrid. Advertisement “(They are) still being assessed so difficult to see where they are in terms of the injury,” Slot said during his pre-match press conference. “Let’s wait and see but it is never a good sign. Conor, I had to take him off and Ibou didn’t walk off the pitch as he should after such a fantastic game that he played. He should have made a round and clapped the fans but he couldn’t.” GO DEEPER Conor Bradley and a tackle for the ages “It is so close after the game last night and I have just come off the training pitch so I can’t tell you exactly where they are. We have to wait and see where they are this weekend.” Alisson, Diogo Jota, Federico Chiesa and Kostas Tsimikas all missed the match against Madrid through injury as they continue their individual recoveries. Liverpool are aiming to strengthen their position at the top of the table and victory over an out-of-form Manchester City would see them extend the gap to Pep Guardiola’s side to eleven points. Despite not winning in their last six matches in all competitions, Slot still expects a tough challenge from the reigning Premier League champions. “In the last eight or nine years or longer I don’t think anyone would have said City home or away — the word easy never comes to mind. “I know everyone is looking at their results but if you face them, you analyse it. Against Brighton they were 1-0 up, could have scored two or three and got beaten 2-1. Against Tottenham after 20 minutes they could have been two or three goals up but weren’t. Against Feyenoord that has not happened many times. They were 3-0 up and completely dominated the game. “They are still a very, very, very good team and one of the reasons I think Pep is the best manager in the world is he always comes up with solutions.

They don’t even have a group chat — so far as Matt Ryan knows. They also don’t have a say in the annual process. Votes belong to 50 media members who cast their selections in a ranked system under the banner of the Associated Press. But if Matt Ryan did get to vote, the 2016 league MVP said he’d (for now) pick between four players: Lamar Jackson, Josh Allen, Jared Goff and his personal front-runner… Saquon Barkley. Advertisement “There’s still a lot of football to be played,” Ryan told The Athletic. “You never know what can happen, especially as we come down the stretch. It’s going to be whoever explodes in the month of December as we make this push.” Of course, Ryan had to tack on a conservative caveat. He’s an analyst now for CBS Sports. He’s on The NFL Today crew with Bill Cowher, J.J. Watt and Nate Burleson. He can’t be caught out here throwing around definitives. Nor would he anyway. Ryan’s careful precision steadied the former Atlanta Falcons quarterback through his greatest season, with a Super Bowl appearance, that seems so similar to what Barkley is experiencing now in Philadelphia. Ryan remembers the “M-V-P” chants in the Georgia Dome. He remembers how Mohamed Sanu, their “big hype guy,” would yell at him after almost every completion. That’s right! That’s right! Some of Sanu’s stuff, Ryan can’t repeat. But it still makes him glow. There are still tendrils curling from that aging and intoxicating ether, that expectation to be invincible and nearly always delivering. “There’s this level of confidence that’s already there,” said Ryan, who threw for a career-best 4,944 yards, 38 touchdowns and seven interceptions in 2016. “But, like, I do think you feed off of that energy, you know, and it’s amazing the self-belief that you have during times like that.” GO DEEPER 'They better know somebody coming right behind me': Where Eagles stand after Brandon Graham injury Ryan sees that self-belief in Barkley. How could you not? What else could convince someone of sound mind and judgment to even attempt jumping over a defender backward? Who wouldn’t draw inspiration from the M-V-P chants of a traveling fan base who filled the majority of SoFi Stadium on Sunday, when the Philadelphia Eagles stomped the Los Angeles Rams 37-20 beneath the boots of Barkley and his record-setting runs? Belief begets belief in a bond between teammates. Blocks become breakaways. C.J. Uzomah, the third tight end in Sunday’s 13 personnel packages, set the backside block on Barkley’s 72-yard score. Uzomah turned just in time to see fellow tight end Grant Calcaterra widen the hole on the other side. Advertisement “I’m like, ‘Damn,'” Uzomah said in the locker room afterward. “And then (Barkley’s) gone. I’m literally watching him and A.J. (Brown) run down the field together. And I see Grant out of my peripheral booking it.” “So stoked,” added Calcaterra, changing at his locker next to Uzomah. In the replay, Calcaterra can be seen charging down the field, one arm outstretched, pointing at Barkley, all the while staring at Philadelphia’s sideline. “Biggest smile on his face,” Uzomah said. There’s a shared joy when stellar play charts a clear destination, Ryan knows. The MVP conversation cannot begin without hanging it on something tangible, he says, like a palpable sense that the protagonist and his pals are bound for a deep playoff run. It’s an accessory to the ultimate goal, which is why Ryan also identifies with Barkley’s reluctance to acknowledge his undeniable spotlight. “I love being in that (MVP) conversation,” Barkley admitted Sunday. “It’s cool and all. But, like I said, it’s a team sport. If you tell me that I can have the year I’m having and win MVP but not win a Super Bowl, or I can have the year I’m having and not win MVP and win a Super Bowl, I’m going to take the other one.” Only Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has simultaneously won MVP and a Super Bowl in this century. That’s partly because votes are cast just before the playoffs begin (and are announced a day before the big game). Since the 2000 season, nine MVPs subsequently lost in the Super Bowl. Ryan’s Falcons infamously lost Super Bowl LI. Five-time winner Peyton Manning and three-time winner Tom Brady lost in both of their two Super Bowl appearances as the league’s MVP. Aaron Rodgers, a four-time MVP with the Green Bay Packers, never got past the NFC title game. The disparity reinforces what those MVPs inherently know: football, of course, is a team game. The award is intrinsically connected to a successful team. They both must be in stride. Take a player like Joe Burrow, who’s thrown for 3,028 yards, a league-leading 27 touchdowns and only four interceptions through 11 games. But the Cincinnati Bengals are 4-7. Burrow won’t be in any MVP talk. Deeply competitive players foremost desire to win. Eagles linebacker Oren Burks, who played with Rodgers during his back-to-back MVP seasons in 2020 and 2021, remembers how the quarterback made sure “the team success comes first.” Advertisement “Like that was one thing with Aaron,” Burks said. “He was always making sure (we were) holding each other accountable in terms of what they expect. And Saquon is the same way. He holds his offensive line to a certain standard. He holds Jalen (Hurts) to a certain standard. That comes from just the team atmosphere and the culture that we have here. So, I feel like it’s just bouncing off each other’s success. The more he shines, the more Jalen is going to have better opportunities. Everybody is just trying to do their part and just pull their weight. As the team rises, everybody else rises as well.” Barkley’s production and influence strongly suggest he can stop the 12-year streak of quarterbacks winning the NFL’s MVP award. His league-leading 1,392 rushing yards through 11 games already surpassed his previous career-high with the New York Giants. He’s on pace to break the NFL’s single-season record set by Eric Dickerson (2,105 yards) with the Los Angeles Rams in 1984. Adrian Peterson, the last non-quarterback to win MVP, rushed for 2,097 yards and 12 touchdowns for a 2012 Minnesota Vikings team that lost in the wild-card round of the playoffs. Ryan had the second-best numbers of his career that same season (4,719 yards, 32 touchdowns). The Falcons went 13-3, securing the top seed in the NFC. But Ryan affirmed “Adrian Peterson was unbelievable during that time frame.” “I think if you’re gonna win it from a position other than quarterback, it has to be kind of that 2,000-yard type season, right?” Ryan said. “I really think Saquon’s got a great chance. What’s he need? Just a little over 600 yards? At the rate he’s going, man, that’s happening. So I do think from a position outside of quarterback, it takes kind of a year that is an outlier, that’s historical, and I think we’re witnessing that right now.” Barkley is the posterizer of a league-wide trend. The NFL’s teams are collectively running the ball at the highest rate (43.7 percent of plays) since 2008 (44.2 percent), according to TruMedia. That’s up more than a full percentage point from 2023 (42.1). It’s a significant development considering the league’s top running backs held a Zoom call in July 2023 to discuss how to combat the devaluation of their position. No position group had lost out on more money in the previous decade than running back. The salary cap had increased by 82.8 percent since 2013. But the average of the top-five salaries for running backs had only increased by 22.8 percent in that span, according to Spotrac. Since then, the NFL’s five highest-paid running backs — Christian McCaffrey ($19 million per year), Jonathan Taylor ($14 million), Barkley ($12.58 million), Alvin Kamara ($12.25 million), Josh Jacobs ($12 million) — have signed contract extensions that bumped the position group’s top-five average up from $12.56 million in 2023 to $13.96 million in 2024. The Eagles, who’d ranked in the bottom 10 in running back spending in each of the previous four seasons, splurged on Barkley due to his caliber and his expected impact on an offensive system that already featured the dual-threat Hurts. Much of Barkley’s influence has already played out in a rejuvenated rushing attack that’s opened up one-on-one matchups in the passing game for Brown and DeVonta Smith. But recently, even when the passing game is lacking, the Eagles have dominated their opponents with their commitment to Barkley. His rush attempts in the first halves (107) and second halves (116) of games are nearly equal, but his yardage in second halves (920 yards) is more than double than his production in first halves (472). Offensive coordinator Kellen Moore said the Eagles pride themselves on having a “really physical run game,” and “those things wear on you as the game goes on.” “The way the games have played out, you can keep grinding it out as the second half progresses, and those big plays eventually pop,” Moore said. Advertisement No running back has more runs of 30-plus yards in 2024 than Barkley (9). The mechanics of an explosive run are significantly more volatile than explosive passes. For starters, running backs can’t simply toss themselves 30 yards downfield. As for the play designs themselves, Moore said there are some “dirty runs” the Eagles “anticipate being grinded-out runs” — often in short-yardage situations — and there are others in which there, “are a little bit more of the explosive opportunities.” Take Barkley’s 72-yard touchdown run against the Rams. On third-and-6, the Eagles fielded a 13 personnel package that drew nine defenders within range of the line of scrimmage. By pulling Calcaterra and right guard Mekhi Becton to the weak side of the defense, the Eagles gave themselves a numbers advantage and a favorable shot at gaining significant yardage. By handing the ball off to Barkley, they entrusted a longer third-down situation to a running back they knew considerably reduced the play’s margin of error.  Ryan likens Barkley’s explosive runs to “Heisman” moments. Every NFL MVP needs “one or two of those signature plays that jump out at you.” Barkley’s hurdled a defender backward. He gashed the New Orleans Saints for a 65-yard touchdown run, then later provided the go-ahead score. His 70- and 72-yard touchdowns against the Rams helped break the franchise record for single-game rushing yards (255) and scrimmage yards (302). He’ll duel the AFC’s leading rusher, Derrick Henry, in an Eagles-Ravens billing in Baltimore on Sunday that’s straight out of the 2000s. Barkley so far embodies the individual award that’s never been awarded to any Eagles player in the team’s 92-year history: MVP. “You’re holding your breath every time he touches the ball,” Ryan said. “Because there’s the ability to take it to the house at any minute.” (Top photo: Ronald Martinez / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"FIA exits continue as long-serving Formula 1 steward, Formula 2 race director depart",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5955017/2024/11/28/fia-exits-f1-steward-departs/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 14:50:58 GMT","The departures come off the back of the exit of Niels Wittich, who was dismissed as the F1 race director with three races to go.","Formula 1 LUSAIL, Qatar — Two more high-profile figures have been dismissed from Formula One’s governing body, the FIA, before this weekend’s Qatar Grand Prix. Tim Mayer, one of the leading stewards who helps officiate F1 grands prix and adjudicates on-track incidents and penalties, and Janette Tan, who was set to serve as the Formula Two race director in Qatar this weekend, have departed from their roles. Advertisement The FIA has not yet responded to a request for comment from The Athletic. Mayer had served as an F1 steward for over 15 years and was one of the most prominent members of the rotating set of volunteers that help officiate grands prix. The son of McLaren founder Teddy Mayer, Tim Mayer most recently was one of the four stewards at the Mexico City Grand Prix. He has also been a steward in other FIA series including World Rallycross and the World Endurance Championship. In an interview with BBC Sport, Mayer claimed that he was informed via an assistant of the FIA president, Mohammed Ben Sulayem, via text message on Tuesday that he had lost his job. Mayer said in the BBC Sport interview that “for a federation that relies on volunteers to fire by text somebody who has made a significant contribution does not speak well of the management.” He said that his dismissal related to his involvement in a hearing regarding a fine given to the promoter of the United States Grand Prix over a track invasion, and that there were “hurt feelings” on behalf of Ben Sulayem. Mayer represented US Race Management in the hearing as part of his role as the sporting organizer for the event. The departures of Mayer and Tan comes off the back of the exit of Niels Wittich, who was dismissed as the F1 race director with three races to go in the season in a sudden move that surprised F1 drivers. In a statement regarding Wittich’s exit, the FIA said he had stepped down from his role “in order to pursue new opportunities,” but Wittich claimed to multiple media outlets that he had been sacked. In the past 12 months, the FIA has also lost sporting director Steve Nielsen, single-seater technical chief Tim Goss, the head of its commission for women, Deborah Mayer, and its CEO, Natalie Robyn. Ben Sulayem’s tenure as FIA president, which started in December 2021, has faced no shortage of controversy. This has included the emergence of historic comments he made about women, as well as an investigation by the FIA’s Ethics Committee earlier this year for two allegations of sporting interference of which he was cleared. Advertisement Wittich was replaced for the Las Vegas Grand Prix by Rui Marques, who had served as the F2 and Formula Three race director this season. Marques’ first weekend was deemed a success by the drivers, who appreciated his more open and communicative approach compared to Wittich. Following the departure of Tan, Marques will also serve as the F2 race director in Qatar, adding a sizable amount to his workload for only his second weekend overseeing F1’s sessions. George Russell, who serves as a director of the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association (GPDA) that serves a union for the F1 grid, said that to have two big exits at a time when there were calls for greater transparency and consistency, as well as improved communication, felt like “a full 360.” “We still don’t have any reasoning for Niels’ removal,” Russell said. “I don’t think anybody was informed about Tim leaving. The same with (Jan), the first I heard about the new race director doing Formula 2 this weekend was through the media. “Naturally in any organization, if you’ve got people leaving or change of personnel, it’s never going to be a stable environment. People have to learn the new rules and that’s very challenging for any team. It must be super challenging for everyone within the FIA right now. “We’d love to get a little bit of clarity and understanding of what’s going on and who’s getting fired next.”  (Qian Jun/MB Media/Getty Images) Luke Smith  is a Senior Writer covering Formula 1 for The Athletic.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Making it look routine: How a schedule of Sundays helps Buffalo Bills thrive,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5954729/2024/11/28/bills-sunday-games-routine/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 14:50:23 GMT",The Bills benefit when they're on a normal Sunday schedule.,"NFL From the time hominids walked erect, they relied on routines to endure. As psychologist Jim Taylor explained, feelings of unfamiliarity, unpredictability, uncertainty and lack of control naturally created discomfort. Such situations offered dark harbingers. “It’s an evolutionary thing,” Taylor said, “because back in the Serengeti 250,000 years ago, when we officially became homo sapiens, if you experienced one of those four feelings, you know what was likely to follow?” Advertisement Death. Flash ahead 250 millennia and 7,500 miles to suburban Orchard Park, N.Y., where Buffalo Bills coach Sean McDermott articulated the concept in 21st-century, first-world terms Wednesday. He was asked the significance of his team potentially playing their final 11 regular-season games on nothing but Sundays. “Routine more than anything,” McDermott said with a grinning nod at his Wednesday news conference. “I love the bye week like anyone does, but sometimes I’m, like …” McDermott pantomimed distress, nervously darting his head and putting up his hands to fend off imaginary, sinister irregularities. “Usually, I’m in a gray shirt and Bills sweatpants,” McDermott continued. “When I’m not wearing those, I kind of go in my closet and don’t know what to wear. I’m not myself. “So I told some of the guys this morning, ‘It’s great to be back in my gray T-shirt and my Bills’ sweats.’” Alas, McDermott doesn’t own a killer wardrobe. But when it comes to success, numbers show McDermott and franchise quarterback Josh Allen have not only survived, but they’ve also remained apex predators with the help of Sunday-to-Sunday routines. The Sunday rhythm resumes at 8:20 p.m. against the San Francisco 49ers in Highmark Stadium, the Bills’ fifth night game with no more scheduled. The Bills played four primetime games from Weeks 2 through 6, including two on Monday and one on Thursday. Since, they’ve enjoyed their Sundays, winning all five to reach their bye on a five-game run. Western New York weather disasters and the NFL’s flex schedule notwithstanding, the Bills are supposed to play their next five on Sunday too. The regular-season finale against the New England Patriots in Gillette Stadium might be an 11 in a row, although that could happen Saturday, Jan. 4. Why are so many Sundays noteworthy? Because throughout Allen’s career he has established himself as one of the NFL’s greatest winners — even against the point spread — when playing on six days’ rest, the interval between Sunday games. Advertisement Taylor, a sports psychologist who has authored 18 books and edited five textbooks, works with professional and Olympic athletes. A growing focus of his mental coaching over the years regards adopting and maintaining effective routines. “Routines are mental tools, and the purpose is to help athletes prepare to perform their best,” Taylor said. “A ton of research shows that when things are complicated and require a lot of thinking and a lot of processing, it burns energy — actual calories — and it’s a distraction. “What makes the great quarterbacks great is not that they can go out and play a great game, but it’s that they can do it day in and day out, week in and week out, year in and year out. Part of that is being consistent in your preparation.” Routines, of course, are not a guaranteed formula for success. But they do propel talented coaches, athletes and teams. Four teams have played every game on Sunday so far this season: the Indianapolis Colts, Chicago Bears, Carolina Panthers and Las Vegas Raiders are a combined 14-31. “Aaron Rodgers has lots of routines, I assume,” added sports psychologist Peter Economou, behavioral health and wellness director for Rutgers University athletics. “I would be cautious to suggest there’s any linear causation. “But routines are critical in professional sports because these are grown adults with real responsibilities. We as fans only see them four hours on a Sunday. A lot of other things go on, and routines allow them to pick up a child from school or be there for their families. It allows them to live their lives.” GO DEEPER NFL Week 13 playoff scenarios: How Bills, Chiefs and Lions can clinch spots A couple weeks ago, when explaining how the Bills possibly could consider the two-time defending champion and undefeated Kansas City Chiefs merely as the next opponents and not treat them with graveness, McDermott said professional athletes crave “just some form of normalcy. They don’t live — quote, unquote — normal lives, and so that normalcy is sometimes welcomed day in and day out. That’s how we do it here.” Advertisement Buffalo won 30-21 to remain a game behind Kansas City for first place in the AFC and could clinch a fifth consecutive AFC East title this week with five games remaining. Allen won again on six days’ rest, and the Bills covered the spread. Inspired by Action Network research director Evan Abrams’ tracking of QB success against the spread, The Athletic took a deeper look into Allen’s performances relative to the number of days between games. TruMedia data goes back to 2000, two seasons before the NFL’s last expansion and realignment. We removed international games because of their logistical abnormalities, which McDermott tried to mitigate by emphasizing a regular weekly routine as much as possible before losing to the Jacksonville Jaguars last year in London. Three days: 1.000 straight up (tied first of 56); .600 against the spread (tied 19th). Allen is 5-0 on the ol’ Sunday-to-Thursday to turnaround. Carson Wentz at 7-0 is the only unbeaten quarterback with more wins. Allen also ranks third at 2.6 passing and rushing touchdowns per game, trailing Deshaun Watson and Peyton Manning. Based on a minimum of four games because these games are less common and teams used to be limited to one Thursday game a year, Allen’s percentage against the spread is .069 points better than the NFL average. Four days: No games. Allen never has experienced the NFL’s least common synapse. There have been only 13 such games since 2000, with five of them occurring in 2020 because of COVID restrictions. Kirk Cousins (1-1) and Gus Frerotte (0-2) are the lone quarterbacks to have played in more than one. Five days: .643 straight up (tied ninth of 33); .462 against the spread (17th). This usually is the Monday-to-Sunday stretch, with an occasional Sunday-to-Saturday mixed in. The Bills also pulled a Tuesday-to-Monday stretch, losing to the Chiefs during the 2020 COVID campaign. Allen averages 2.36 passing and rushing TDs a game in this situation, second just to two-time MVP Lamar Jackson. Based on a minimum of 10 games. Six days: .702 straight up (fourth of 156); .655 against the spread (ninth). The most common scheduling interval, we bumped this minimum to 20 games. This turnaround also can include consecutive Saturday or Thursday games. Allen’s win percentage is behind only Patrick Mahomes, Tom Brady and Andrew Luck and slightly ahead of Manning straight up. Allen’s 2.26 TDs are third to Mahomes and Joe Burrow. Allen’s win percentage against the spread is .149 points above the NFL average for this group. Among quarterbacks with at least 50 games on six days’ rest, only Teddy Bridgewater and Luck were better against the spread. Fascinating nugget: Despite only 0.8 passing and rushing TDs a game, old friend Tarvaris Jackson went .667 straight up and .684 against the spread over 39 such games. Advertisement Seven to nine days: .455 straight up (tied 41st of 57); .273 against the spread (55th). Here we have the Sunday-to-Monday interval and a mishmash of odd combos that provide extra time but don’t involve a bye. Despite ranking third with 2.27 combined TDs per game and sitting middle of the pack at 0.91 turnovers, Allen’s win percentage against the spread is a whopping .238 below the league average, better than only Nick Foles and Tony Romo among the 57 quarterbacks who played at least 10 such games. Ten days or more: .900 straight up (second of 25); .667 against the spread (sixth). Allen’s numbers also include the interval created by the canceled Cincinnati Bengals game in 2023 after Bills safety Damar Hamlin went into cardiac arrest. Donovan McNabb is the lone quarterback with a higher win percentage straight up. Although these stats date back to 2000, McNabb also had a victory on extended rest as a rookie in 1999, giving him a 12-1 career record. Allen against the spread is .138 better than the NFL average and behind just Joe Flacco, McNabb, Aaron Rodgers, Manning and Ryan Tannehill. McDermott is 8-0 after byes if we include the game after Hamlin’s collapse and recovery, although the organization certainly wouldn’t consider that a relaxing break. Players and coaches returned Monday to One Bills Drive but didn’t get on the practice field until Wednesday, the usual first day of practice in the Sunday-to-Sunday rhythm. “I don’t really have a ‘this is exactly what we do’ formula,” McDermott said. “It’s just more of us really getting back to what we do, getting back to the basics. Today, we’re going to have a normal practice in pads and work on the fundamentals that we need to have for a good football team in San Francisco coming here.” As valuable as routines are, they also carry risks. Fine lines exist. If awareness slips, then athletes might find themselves going through the motions or trusting too much in the ceremonial aspects of their habits. Both sports psychologists interviewed for this story stressed the difference between routines and rituals. Advertisement Taylor: “There’s almost a religious, ceremonial, mystical sense with the word ‘ritual.’ A routine is entirely within an athlete’s control, and I want an athlete’s preparation to be entirely within their control.” Economou: “We call it magical thinking in cognitive and behavioral therapy.” Taylor: “They think ‘I have to fist bump that one somebody before the game. I have to wear my lucky socks. And if I do this, the almighty football gods will bestow a victory on me.’” Economou: “It can create a false attachment to your belief system that ‘If I don’t do this, then I won’t be successful.’ That’s flawed. I could eat a chicken burrito and have the best performance of my life. It wasn’t the chicken burrito.” Taylor: “Some of that helps because it’s a way of feeling more confident and having more hope and optimism beyond preparations, but rituals are not within your control. The football gods always seem to be with you only half the time.” Another potential problem with rituals is how they could reinforce an isolation bubble around athletes or teams if relied upon too much. The bubble feels safe. The bubble protects. The game, however, is not played in the bubble. Taylor insists his clients conduct OBEs: out-of-bubble experiences to improve improvisation traits. “If you get too comfortable within your bubble, and your routine is a part of your bubble, when s— happens you won’t be able to adjust,” Taylor said. “Survival instinct, fight or flight, freak out. “Every play a quarterback makes, the bubble is his play and the routes. When there’s a blitz or the receiver’s route gets disrupted at the line, the quarterback must be able to adapt. The great ones do; the decent ones don’t. You’re wired not to like these situations, but they happen.” Perhaps not coincidentally, Allen is one of the greatest improvisational quarterbacks in NFL history. His fourth-and-2 decision to morph a thwarted pass play into a thrilling, 26-yard touchdown run that beat Kansas City two weeks ago was the latest highlight on a fat reel. There’s also Allen’s more holistic ability to adapt, what with all the roster changes and injuries that have jumbled his receivers this year. Advertisement McDermott, meanwhile, has continued his evolution, particularly seen in Buffalo ranking first in fourth-down conversions and converting more already than any season since he took over in 2017. Leaving his defensive-minded bubble is a big reason why Buffalo has contradicted the experts who said it couldn’t control the AFC East without receivers Stefon Diggs and Gabriel Davis, center Mitch Morse and safeties Micah Hyde and Jordan Poyer — former captains all. “As a species, the brain likes routines,” Economou said. “There are neurological components to this that create comfort. The brain likes what it knows. That’s why people struggle with change and why, from a performance perspective, we should try to embrace and lean into moments of discomfort. “You have to make sure you’re always growing. That requires getting out of your comfort zone.” So here are the Bills, entering Week 13 with the NFL’s most comfortable division lead and simply Sundays afternoons ahead. Making it look routine.

Head coach Enzo Maresca revealed on Wednesday night that the right-back has had a scan and is already getting “better and better, day by day”. While Chelsea have deliberately not set a date for his return in order to avoid putting pressure on him, there is optimism over his recovery. The results of the tests were good, indicating it is not a significant strain. Advertisement This is the ninth time James has been ruled out with a hamstring injury in the past four years. He went 18 months without completing 90 minutes in the Premier League between April 2023 and October 2024. Last December, he flew to Finland to have surgery after limping off at Everton in the hope of curing it for good, but he has started just three games for the club since then. However, the fact this hamstring issue is a new problem in the right leg, rather than in the left leg he had an operation on, is regarded as something to be positive about. On the eve of Chelsea’s Conference League game against German side Heidenheim, Maresca admitted that part of the issues James faces is coping mentally with suffering nine hamstring injuries in four years. He said: “It’s something he has to fight with that in terms of it is normal, if you get injuries always in the same leg or the same muscle, you can be afraid. It is normal but at the same time, this is his profession and you can get injured.

I don’t know exactly but he feels better. Now he has to prove his fitness because he’s not easy being out for three months. We’re going to help him. I don’t want to give a timeframe but he’s closer.” Michail Antonio has deputised in Fullkrug’s absence. The Jamaica international has registered one goal across 13 appearances. Lopetegui initially thought Fullkrug would be sidelined for two weeks, but the forward suffered a setback with his injury. Fullkrug’s due diligence before joining from last season’s Champions League runners-up involved canvassing the opinions of former West Ham players Sebastien Haller, who was a team-mate at Dortmund last season, and Thilo Kehrer, a fellow German international. Although Fullkrug is unavailable for Saturday’s home game against Arsenal, Lopetegui wants his players to replicate a similar performance to Monday’s 2-0 win over Newcastle. “We did well but that is in the past,” he said. “Now, we look at Arsenal.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"What the Thunder learned playing without centers, and why they're now even more dangerous",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5953873/2024/11/28/nba-thunder-defense-jalen-williams/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 14:01:49 GMT",No team and no defense can shapeshift like the Thunder. Their identity is that they play however the situation dictates they should.,"NBA Jalen Williams’ new role emerged without any warning. Williams, a broad-shouldered, 6-foot-5 freight engine, has defended larger players for years, but no one ever tagged him with the label to match. Until recently, the 20-point scorer appeared as your typical small forward. Three weeks ago, outside forces decided he would no longer be one. Advertisement Earlier this month, the Oklahoma City Thunder lost one 7-footer, Chet Holmgren, to a pelvic fracture. Another, Isaiah Hartenstein, was already sidelined. Without any conventional big men, they replaced Holmgren in the first unit with the 6-foot-5 Isaiah Joe. That meant an adjustment for Williams, the team’s new final line of defense. Williams would battle with the opposition’s centers each night. He would line up at center circle to take jump balls at the beginnings of games. Each leap was a little surprise, a reminder that a lifelong perimeter player was now down low with the big boys. “I’m gonna be shocked tonight when I do it,” Williams joked last week leading into a game in San Antonio, where he defended Spurs 7-footer Zach Collins. Only two nights earlier, he had scrapped with a couple of mammoths in Dallas, Daniel Gafford and Dereck Lively II. In reality, the Thunder’s do-everything man could not have been so shocked, even if Williams’ size deviates from your usual center archetype. Thunder coach Mark Daigneault never actually told Williams — or any of his teammates, for that matter — that he would be the one to take jump balls. It was “assumed,” as Daigneault put it. “Who else is gonna do it?” the coach said. And who else would be the team’s center for the six games that neither Holmgrem nor Hartenstein could start? The Thunder have trusted Williams to guard bigs since long before injuries forced them into it. He’s defended brawny scorers such as Giannis Antetokounmpo and Zion Williamson or towers like Victor Wembanyama and Karl-Anthony Towns. Even when Holmgren was healthy, Oklahoma City would occasionally throw its shot-blocker on a non-shooter so he could roam as a free safety with Williams defending the other team’s center. Before Holmgren was in the picture, when the Thunder deployed a tinier roster and a trio of not-so-imposing fives, a rookie Williams had to slide down a position or two. Advertisement “I just tried to make (guarding big men) a skill, add something else to my game,” Williams said. “I feel like I do damn near everything well on the court. So in my mind, it was just one of those things. Like, why wouldn’t I be able to do it? And I just kinda keep getting the opportunity to do it.” But this situation was new — 48 minutes of guarding centers up for grabs with no help from any giants in sight, a Williams fever dream. As the wise philosopher Aaron Wiggins, who moonlights as a Thunder forward, put it, “Tonight, he’s a center. Tomorrow, who knows what he’ll be?” Such is the way to survive in Oklahoma. No team and no defense can shapeshift like the Thunder. Just like Williams, OKC’s identity is that it has many. Daigneault will flip through starting units or substitution patterns regularly. He’s tried 188 lineups so far this season, sixth most in the NBA. The teams ahead of the Thunder in that category are injury-ravaged ones, such as the Philadelphia 76ers or New Orleans Pelicans, who have tossed out desperation combinations only because their top guys haven’t been able to play. On one day, the Thunder will go small. On the next, they’ll grow oversized. They toggle in and out of a zone defense or they switch with their assembly of multifaceted defenders or they move to other types of coverages. With the centers present, they have at least one deterrent in the paint, someone to scare away any dribbler who dares approach the basket. They line the perimeter with ravenous guards and wings. They gobble up steals like the basketball is doused in gravy. Without either of the bigs, they are a cloud of gnats. Now, Hartenstein’s fractured hand has healed. Oklahoma City’s biggest free-agent signing from this past summer entered the starting lineup this week and just played his third game of the season on Wednesday, when the Western Conference-best Thunder downed the Golden State Warriors, 105-101. Williams departed the game early after an inadvertent poke to the eye. Holmgren, a beanstalk rim protector who will be out at least another five to seven weeks, has already missed eight games. Hartenstein, whose analytics graded him as one of the world’s most daunting paint defenders last season, has missed 15. GO DEEPER Isaiah Hartenstein, a 'dream big' for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, found a perfect fit with Thunder The Thunder still lead the league in points allowed per possession. They force more turnovers than anyone. The trend has remained true with or without a top-notch shot-blocker: This team, which is now 14-4, doesn’t defend quite like any other — especially when Williams runs at center, which Daigneault calls “a muscle that if we do it effectively, which we’ve done to this point, will help us in the future.” Advertisement When the Thunder go small, all eyes focus on the paint. Williams mans a center. Fellow energizer Luguentz Dort will take on the other team’s highest-usage perimeter player. Other stalwarts line the outside. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is a master in passing lanes and has become one of the league’s better shot-blocking guards. Alex Caruso is a hound, as are Wiggins and Cason Wallace. Their goal is to make any ballhandler or screener uncomfortable. Daigneault talks about “rhythm.” The defense’s job is to break the offense’s. Caruso will stunt at a dribbler, then recover back onto his man. When drivers reach the free-throw line, he has an uncanny ability to step toward them and swipe the basketball away. Williams and Dort do the same. “Sometimes, it’s not even about stealing it,” Williams said. “It’s just about making somebody think you might steal it.” The Thunder are lurking. Once the ball hits the paint, arms swarm down low. They will send aggressive help from the weak side, sometimes the strong side, wherever they need. They will give up corner 3s when they’re small, but they won’t make any shot easy. “Everybody is in there and fighting,” Dort said. “That’s all we can ask for.” Without Holmgren or Hartenstein on the court this season, the Thunder force turnovers on 21 percent of their defensive possessions, a rate that would rank No. 1 in the league by far if it belonged to a team for the season, according to Cleaning the Glass. And here’s another surprise for Williams, one even greater than the six jump balls he’s lined up for this season: Their defensive rim efficiency (the points they allow per shot at the rim) when neither Holmgren nor Hartenstein is on the court would be the NBA’s eighth-best, according to Second Spectrum. To keep it simple: The Thunder, even without their rim protectors, protect the rim better than most. Advertisement “The beginning of the play, if the (ballhandler) is under duress, it changes the rhythm of the play. They’re not getting into their steps in a rhythmic way,” Daigneault said. “And then it’s just competitiveness at the rim.” On Monday, Hartenstein entered the starting lineup for the first time. He’s been an immediate hit, reaching a double-double in all three of his games so far.  The Thunder now have a conventional center, which slides Williams to a more run-of-the-mill role, one to be expected from a hyper-efficient, scoring and facilitating wing who wouldn’t normally exhaust himself wrestling people nearly a foot taller. Once Holmgren returns (and the Thunder say he will be back before the end of the season), Oklahoma City can pair the two centers together. Both wall off the paint. Holmgren shoots 3s and attacks closeouts off the dribble. Hartenstein is an expert screen-setter, passer and roller. They could operate alongside each other, especially for short stretches. In those moments, especially if the bash brothers of Dort and Williams are out there and if the stringy Gilgeous-Alexander joins too, the Thunder will be massive. Of course, that won’t change who they are — because their identity is that they play however the situation dictates they should.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Iga Swiatek receives doping ban after positive test for banned substance trimetazidine,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5954986/2024/11/28/iga-swiatek-doping-ban-tmz/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 14:00:47 GMT","Swiatek appealed a provisional suspension issued in September, meaning that it remained confidential.","Tennis Iga Swiatek, the women’s world No. 2 tennis player, has received a one-month doping ban after testing positive for the banned substance trimetazidine (TMZ). The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) issued the ban on Wednesday November 27 and announced it publicly on Thursday, after ruling that the player’s level of fault was at the lowest end of the range for ‘No Significant Fault or Negligence’ and not intentional. Advertisement Having already served 22 days of the ban while the process was ongoing, Swiatek — a five-time Grand Slam winner who has spent more than 100 weeks as world No. 1 — has eight more days to serve and so will be eligible to play at the Australian Open in January. Swiatek, 23, tested positive for a trace concentration of TMZ, a drug normally used as heart medication for its ability to enhance blood flow, in an out-of-competition sample on August 12 ahead of the Cincinnati Open. Swiatek was informed of the positive test by the ITIA exactly one month later on September 12 and given a mandatory provisional suspension. Swiatek appealed the provisional suspension within 10 days of the original notice. The appeal was successful, so her provisional suspension was not publicly disclosed. This is in line with the TADP (Tennis Anti-Doping Programme) regulations. This is the same mechanism by which Jannik Sinner’s provisional suspensions, imposed after he tested positive for the anabolic steroid clostebol, were not disclosed. GO DEEPER Jannik Sinner's doping case explained: What WADA appeal means and what is at stake for tennis After submitting her medications and supplements to independent laboratories alongside hair samples, tests confirmed the presence of TMZ in one of the medications used by Swiatek: a melatonin supplement to manage her jetlag which does not require a prescription in Poland and some other EU countries. The contamination of the drug was also confirmed by an independent WADA-accredited laboratory, which was commissioned independently by the ITIA to confirm the results of the two independent laboratories. “Once the source of the TMZ had been established, it became clear that this was a highly unusual instance of a contaminated product, which in Poland is a regulated medicine,” said Karen Moorhouse, the chief executive of the ITIA. “The product does not have the same designation globally, and the fact that a product is a regulated medication in one country cannot of itself be sufficient to avoid any level of fault. Advertisement “Taking into account the nature of the medication, and all the circumstances, it does place that fault at the lowest end of the scale.” Following Swiatek’s successful appeal, the ITIA on October 4 recommended that Swiatek’s suspension be lifted. This allowed her to compete in WTA Finals in Saudi Arabia and the Billie Jean King Cup in Malaga. During the time of her provisional suspension, Swiatek missed the Korea Open, China Open, and Wuhan Open, which contributed to Swiatek losing her world No. 1 ranking to Aryna Sabalenka. At the time of those withdrawals, Swiatek said that her absence was due to “personal reasons”. The ITIA also confirmed in a statement on Thursday that Swiatek also forfeits prize money from the Cincinnati Open, the tournament directly following the test. The points Swiatek will lose for reaching the semifinals there will not affect her ranking. During this period, Swiatek also parted ways with her coach of three years Tomasz Wiktorowski in early October and replaced him with Wim Fissette. In a video statement on Thursday, she said: “This experience, the most difficult in my life so far, taught me a lot. “The whole thing will definitely stay with me for the rest of my life, it took a lot of strength, returning to training after this situation nearly broke my heart. So there were many tears and lots of sleepless nights. “The worst part of it was the uncertainty. I didn’t know what was going to happen with my career, how things would end or if I would be allowed to play tennis at all,” she said. GO DEEPER Iga Swiatek's tennis gifts are basically peerless. She just has to put her mind to them Analysis by Charlie Eccleshare On the face of it, this has been a pretty disastrous few months for tennis. Only three months on from news of men’s world No. 1 Jannik Sinner twice testing positive for a banned substance, the most high-profile and successful active women’s player has also been given a doping ban. Swiatek, ranked No.2 partly because of missing three events during the time of her mandatory provisional suspension, was the world No. 1 at the time of her positive test. Advertisement The verdict on both cases is that neither player was intentionally doping, but there will still be plenty of tennis fans who feel hugely dismayed by what has happened. The Sinner case led to a volley of criticism from some players about what they felt was favourable treatment, even though due process was followed at every stage. Likewise there was criticism of the fact that the investigation was done in private, even though again this followed ITIA protocols. We can expect similar comments in the wake of Swiatek’s case, with tennis inevitably facing questions around its integrity and credibility.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How Arne Slot is proving to be the master of the half-time tactical tweak,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5946337/2024/11/28/liverpool-arne-slot-half-time-tweak-real-madrid/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 14:00:35 GMT",Liverpool's head coach has now shown on multiple occasions how he can turn a game with a subtle adjustment,"EPL It’s not like Arne Slot needed to fix Liverpool’s attack at half-time against Real Madrid. But despite his side creating multiple chances in the first half, he was able to tweak a few things in search of an improvement. And since the start of the season, Liverpool have been noticeably raising their level after the break — with the 2-0 victory against Madrid just the latest addition to the list of impressive second halves. Advertisement This was on show in Slot’s first Premier League game, a 2-0 victory away to Ipswich Town, when during the break he told his players to focus on winning duels and playing balls in behind because of the opponent’s man-to-man approach. That tweak guided Liverpool to victory, and another half-time tweak against Madrid brought Slot’s team closer to reaching the Champions League’s round of 16. Against Madrid’s 4-4-2 defensive shape, Curtis Jones — and to a lesser extent Alexis Mac Allister — occupied the right half-space in the first half in an attempt to break down the opponent’s defence.  However, it meant that darting runs from Conor Bradley that could provide an element of surprise were rare, because the space was mainly occupied by Jones. Only when Jones briefly roamed towards the left side was there space for Bradley to attack.  This was tweaked in the second half to manipulate Madrid’s defence, with Jones positioning himself centrally and towards the left side. By moving away from the right half-space, Jones vacated that zone for Bradley to attack. Meanwhile, Liverpool’s overload towards their left side forced Madrid to constantly move across and with Mohamed Salah (out of shot) pinning Ferland Mendy down the wing, Bradley could attack the gap between the left-back and Antonio Rudiger.  The contrast between Jones’ touches in both halves illustrates how his positioning changed after the break to exploit Madrid’s defence.  In this example, the England midfielder is positioned towards the left side, allowing Bradley to attack the right half-space. Mac Allister spots the right-back’s run…  … but Rudiger is in position to defend it and the centre-back wins the header.  In another example, Jones is again attacking the left side and combines with Luis Diaz, while Mac Allister is in a central position and Bradley is advancing forward to attack the space.  Liverpool’s overload down their left side forces Madrid’s block to shift in that direction, which moves Rudiger across and allows Bradley to freely attack the space in midfield. As Jones plays the ball to Mac Allister, Bradley is calling for the pass to be played to him…  … as it will put the right-back and Salah in a two-versus-one situation against Mendy. However, Mac Allister decides to shoot and misses the target.  Again, the positioning of Jones and Mac Allister forces Madrid to focus on defending their right side. Meanwhile, Bradley is darting into the space between Rudiger, who has been moved across by Liverpool’s left-side overload, and Mendy, who is pinned by Salah’s wide position (out of shot).  Mac Allister then plays the ball over the defence and into the path of Bradley…  … whose header is saved by Thibaut Courtois.  In the following attack, it’s a similar situation but this time Rudiger is keeping an eye on Bradley. Here, Jones plays the ball infield to Mac Allister…  … and Bradley drops to offer himself as a passing option, which moves Rudiger a couple of steps forward.  Bradley’s threat in the right half-space forces Rudiger to react and, in an attempt to stop the right-back, he moves out of position. Bradley exploits that by returning the pass to Mac Allister, who is attacking the space Rudiger vacated with Mendy not in a position to cover for his centre-back because of Salah’s threat out wide.  Mac Allister then completes the move by striking the ball into the bottom corner to give Liverpool the lead.  “Before they go out, we always prepare them what to expect from what we have seen from them (the opponent) till now. But what we saw from them (Madrid) until now was with Vinicius Junior,” said Slot after the game. “Now they lined up without Vinicius Jr, so after the first half we know better what to expect than we knew before the game. Advertisement “Sometimes these small adjustments help as well, but it has mainly to do with the effort we put in in the first half already.” By introducing a subtle tweak in their attacking phase, Liverpool presented another solution to break down Carlo Ancelotti’s defence and it proved to be the catalyst for their first victory against Madrid since 2009. In Slot’s brief time as Liverpool’s head coach he has shown on multiple occasions how his minor tweaks can affect the game without disrupting the team’s structure and losing control. It’s a quality that can make the difference in Liverpool’s search for another Premier League title, and especially in the knockout stages of the Champions League.

Liverpool and City supporters will do likewise prior to the 4pm kick-off at Anfield with banners being displayed both inside and outside the grounds. Organisers say it is a response to rising ticket prices and the erosion of concessionary rates. Earlier this week it emerged that United were removing discounted rates for children and seniors with some tickets increasing from £25 to £66. There is also growing concern that some clubs are targeting the £30 cap on away tickets — despite the Premier League’s broadcast and commercial revenue rising by 17 per cent to £12.25billion for 2025 t0 2028. “It’s time for clubs to remember that their wealth and success are built on the unwavering loyalty of their supporters,” says Gareth Roberts, spokesman for Liverpool supporters’ union Spirit of Shankly.

That support is being threatened by the price of football — from tickets to TV subscriptions, even down to the prices of food and drink on the concourse. “Raising prices when financial pressures on fans are at an all-time high is an insult. We’re proud to unite with fans from Manchester in this campaign to fight for fairness.” MCFC Fans Foodbank Support spokesperson Nick Clarke adds: “There’s been increasing animosity between City and Liverpool fans in recent years due to the rivalry on the pitch so we’re incredibly proud to stand together on this important issue. “Tribalism holds football fans back from addressing the real threats to the game we built – working-class fans are being priced out before our eyes.

This is our first step. This movement will grow.” Dave Kelly, from Everton Fans Supporting Foodbanks, adds: “The cost of living crisis becomes ever greater. “With children going to school hungry, parents skipping meals and the cost of match tickets out of reach to some of the most passionate and loyal fans in our communities. “This isn’t about the colour of the shirt or the badge upon the chest.

(I’m gearing up for a spirited argument with my brothers-in-law — the same guys who, six weeks ago, were texting me to tell someone at the Eagles to fire Nick Sirianni but now can’t stop talking about booking trips to New Orleans for the Super Bowl.) Advertisement Let’s be honest, much like your Thanksgiving dinner table the NFL serves up its fair share of topics we’d rather not get stuck on. But there’s also plenty to be thankful for as fans. With a little effort, you can steer those heated conversations into more enjoyable territory. In the meantime, this column might give you a few icebreakers to help navigate the holiday chaos: • Looking back on the Lions’ unwavering belief in Jared Goff • “She’s a tough, no-nonsense leader with a better résumé and background in football than most of the men up for these jobs” • What’s wrong with the Houston Texans? • What might have been with the Giants • A chilling effect for “Hard Knocks”? • What Eagles fans, New England, the Ravens and I can be thankful for  As you watch them take on the Chicago Bears Thursday afternoon, it’s worth reflecting on how far the Detroit Lions have come in just two years. Back in 2022, the outlook was bleak. Dan Campbell was coming off a 3-13-1 debut season and then lost six of seven to start his second year. The pressure to make changes — particularly at quarterback — was mounting. But Campbell and first-time GM Brad Holmes refused to waver in their belief in Jared Goff, even as the criticism grew. Their faith wasn’t blind. Campbell had witnessed Goff’s resilience firsthand during the 2018 NFC Championship Game when Campbell was the Saints’ tight ends coach. Despite a deafening Superdome crowd, a 13-0 deficit, and a broken helmet speaker, Goff calmly rallied the Rams to an overtime victory. It wasn’t just about talent, it was about adaptability and mental toughness. The Lions have since shown that Goff moment from the 2018 season to their staff as a teaching point. The duo’s faith in Goff has paid off. Since that rocky first season-plus, the Lions have gone 32-9, with the quarterback emerging as a leader and an MVP candidate. (Want more on this? Check out Michael Silver’s revealing profile on Goff.) GO DEEPER Jared Goff hit rock bottom. A conversation with Dan Campbell ignited his unlikely comeback If you’ve been keeping up with the buzz around the many expected general manager and coaching changes coming this offseason, you’ve seen the name Dawn Aponte, the NFL’s chief football administrative officer, come up as a potential GM candidate. At first glance, some might assume her inclusion on these lists is about optics, a way for the NFL to demonstrate its commitment to diversity and women in leadership. But make no mistake, her credentials are impressive, and the interest is real. Teams are looking at Aponte as a potential GM or team president tasked with overseeing football operations. She’s long been viewed in league circles as someone capable of taking on such a position. One league source described the value of Aponte as someone who would carry out ownership’s vision while creating streamlined processes, forcing accountability, and aligning the organization at all levels. She doesn’t have a scouting or personnel background but her leadership qualities and strategic mindset are what have some teams excited about her potential. Advertisement If she was hired, Aponte would focus on structure and alignment — two areas where struggling teams often fall short — while partnering with an experienced personnel executive to handle the roster-building side of things. It’s a model that makes sense for teams needing a broader, big-picture approach to success. One coach who is interested in collaborating with Aponte texted: “She’s a tough, no-nonsense leader with a better résumé and background in football than most of the men up for these jobs. This should be the year she gets a shot.” This wouldn’t be new to Aponte; she’s worked at the highest levels of the league, holding roles with the Jets, Dolphins, Browns and the NFL office, all jobs that required sharp decision-making, strategic thinking, and a deep understanding of football operations. Last offseason she interviewed for the Chargers’ GM position, which ultimately went to Joe Hortiz. Former Jets GM Mike Tannenbaum, who has worked with Aponte, was recently hired by the Jets to help with the search for their next GM. Those close to Tannenbaum say he has a mantra: “The winning edge is to do things differently, not just better.” No one in NFL history has put a woman in charge of football operations. Being the first team to do so — with a hyper-qualified candidate in Aponte — would certainly fit that philosophy. The Houston Texans aren’t falling apart; it’s more like they’re going through some growing pains. After a strong start they’ve hit a few bumps, sitting at 7-5 as they head into Sunday’s road game at Jacksonville. I had high hopes for this team, even making them my preseason Super Bowl pick, but they just don’t look the same. Some of their toughest losses have come in heartbreaking fashion, like two games decided by walk-off field goals. And their second-half struggles are a real issue — turnovers and inconsistent execution have cost them in critical moments. They just haven’t been as sharp as they need to be to close out games. Advertisement It’s not all bad. One area in which they’ve improved is pass protection; it has been noticeably better since a Halloween night disaster against the Jets. That’s a big deal for C.J. Stroud and the offense. But a perfect example of their 2024 failings was last week. Kicker Ka’imi Fairbairn broke an NFL single-season record with his 12th field goal of 50-plus yards on Sunday, then missed a crucial 28-yarder late in the upset loss to the Titans. That pretty much sums up the Texans’ year — capable of doing incredible things, but falling short when it matters most. In Jacksonville, look for the Texans to get running back Joe Mixon going, which will help with play-action and with the team’s emphasis on taking care of the football. What’s wild is the Texans have lost two games this season in which they were plus-3 in turnover margin. Think about that: Teams win 91 percent of the time when they’re plus-3 in turnovers, yet the Texans have managed to lose twice under those conditions — that’s almost unheard of. It just shows how tough it’s been for them to close out games, even when the odds are stacked in their favor. GO DEEPER Can the Eagles seriously threaten the Lions in the NFC? The Minnesota Vikings signing former Giants starter Daniel Jones to their practice squad is all about creating opportunities and flexibility. For Jones, it’s a chance to continue his development under a solid coaching staff while contributing to the QB room. For the team, it’s a low-cost move that gives them a chance to evaluate a former starter without making a big commitment. With J.J. McCarthy Minnesota’s only quarterback under contract for 2025, this gives both sides a chance to get a feel for each other over the remainder of the season. It’s not a sign of anything definitive — this move doesn’t rule out Sam Darnold returning next year, and it’s certainly not an indication that McCarthy’s recovery is running behind. It’s simply a smart way for the Vikings to explore their options and keep their quarterback situation flexible for the future. Keep in mind that Darnold’s price might continue to go up as teams evaluate the draft and available free-agent quarterbacks. Front office executives believe that his experience and performance in Minnesota this season will make Darnold’s market competitive in March. There’s something about the situations of Daniel Jones and Saquon Barkley that feels oddly familiar, and then it hit me: It’s almost a mirror image of what happened with the Tennessee Titans back in 2020. Both teams faced the same dilemma after playoff seasons: How to keep their quarterback and running back while working within tight salary-cap situations. The Titans chose to give Ryan Tannehill a big extension and use the franchise tag on Derrick Henry, eventually hammering out a long-term deal before training camp. That duo went on to help lead the Titans to 23 wins over the next two seasons, and the No. 1 seed in the AFC in 2022. The Giants followed a similar plan, signing Daniel Jones to a four-year, $160 million deal and tagging Saquon Barkley in an attempt to maintain continuity. They even sweetened Barkley’s deal with a $2 million signing bonus, but it was only a short-term fix. By the following offseason, Barkley hit free agency, and general manager Joe Schoen made the call, despite the owner John Mara’s concerns about letting “the face of the Giants” walk. We all know the story by now. Howie Roseman and the Eagles stepped in, scooping up Barkley and adding him to their already stacked offense. Now, Barkley is thriving in Philadelphia, emerging as an MVP candidate and elevating Jalen Hurts to new heights. Every time Barkley explodes for another long run, the Schoen decision gets brought back up. Advertisement Would Barkley have had the same impact on Jones in New York as Henry did for Tannehill in Tennessee? We’ll never know. After the tandem led the Giants to the divisional round of the playoffs in 2022 they played only two full games together; the last one was a 31-28 comeback win in Arizona in which Jones threw for 321 yards and Barkley scored twice. What’s clear, though, is that Barkley’s departure — and the Giants’ inability to stabilize their offense — has left them in limbo. With both Jones and Barkley gone, Schoen has been spotted scouting quarterbacks like Shedeur Sanders at Colorado, signaling the Giants’ rebuild and search for long-term answers. It’s been said that Mara doesn’t want to fire Schoen or head coach Brian Daboll but there’s still a month of football left that could force the owner to make a move. The sticky part of this situation is Schoen and Daboll are seen as a tandem. The question remains: Would Mara be willing to fire one and keep the other, or do they both go if this continues to spin out of control? Meanwhile, Barkley’s move to Philadelphia has been transformative, almost haunting, leaving Giants fans to wonder what could have been if their duo had stayed intact.

 Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox. It’s been really hard to find a front office executive or coach in football who would willingly sign up for “Hard Knocks” again — anyone with a social media account can’t avoid the clip of the Giants deciding to let Barkley go. Every time we think the story is going to die, it comes back to life. Barkley’s success is the fuel. After what happened last summer, organizations have to wonder: Is the drama and exposure worth the hit to our team’s image? Think about it. The Giants were front and center this offseason, and what did it do? It put their handling of Barkley and safety Xavier McKinney under an intense spotlight. Everyone saw it. As an NFL executive explained to me: “Nobody wants to be embarrassed on camera, and if there’s any owner who despises public embarrassment it’s John Mara. I feel for him.” The debates about whether to pay Barkley his worth, or to extend McKinney’s contract, weren’t just whispers in the front office — they were out there for fans and media to dissect. And now look where we are. Barkley lands with the Eagles and is not just good, but MVP-level good. Meanwhile, McKinney, the guy the Giants lowballed and undervalued, goes to Green Bay and is having the kind of season that puts him in the Defensive Player of the Year conversation. Both of them are thriving. And the Giants? They’re left looking like they completely fumbled two franchise cornerstones. Fans who were already critical when the decisions were made now have the receipts, video evidence of the team essentially saying: Yeah, we’re not sure these guys are worth it. Moving forward, why would you volunteer for that? Why let the world see your process, especially when the stakes are this high? So will another team do “Hard Knocks”? Maybe. But after what happened with the Giants, I wouldn’t blame any GM who politely declines. In the spirit of the season… Eagles fans are thankful for Nick Sirianni shaving his head: The ultimate “we need to change the vibes” move came when Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni, facing heavy criticism, debuted a freshly shaved head for the team’s Week 6 matchup against the Browns. At the time, the Eagles were 2-2 and the pressure was mounting. Owner Jeffrey Lurie and GM Howie Roseman, who firmly believe they’ve built a championship-caliber roster, knew that without some sort of shift, Sirianni’s future in Philly could look bleak. Advertisement The Eagles have turned things around in remarkable fashion, going on a six-game winning streak. While the haircut itself didn’t work magic, Sirianni’s willingness to embrace change — symbolic as it may have been — helped reset the tone for the team. Now in his fourth season, Sirianni has the Eagles poised for a fourth straight playoff appearance, and with the coordinators Roseman set him up with (Kellen Moore on offense and Vic Fangio on defense), Philly looks ready for another deep postseason run. Keep in mind, Lurie and Roseman still see this as a Super Bowl roster, and Sirianni’s leadership is crucial to making that vision a reality. The six New England states are thankful for the Patriots rejecting massive draft night offers for the third pick: “Don’t get cute” is the unofficial NFL draft motto, and the Patriots took it to heart last spring. Remember, the organization held the third overall pick and received significant trade offers from teams eager to select North Carolina quarterback Drake Maye. The Minnesota Vikings proposed a package that included the 11th and 23rd picks in the 2024 draft, along with a ’25 first-round selection. The New York Giants also made a substantial offer, including their 2024 first-round pick and a ’25 first-rounder. Despite these proposals, the Patriots chose to retain their pick and selected Drake Maye as their quarterback of the future. Based on what we’ve seen and what people around the league think of Maye already, Patriots fans should be elated. The Steelers are thankful for Arthur Smith’s arrival: For the first time since Ben Roethlisberger’s heyday, it appears Steelers fans are not calling for the firing of their offensive coordinator. Former Falcons head coach Arthur Smith was brought into Pittsburgh because his coaching philosophy aligns perfectly with the Steelers’ identity: tough, physical football with an emphasis on the run game. During his time with the Tennessee Titans, he crafted one of the league’s most effective rushing attacks, helping Derrick Henry emerge as a superstar while balancing the run game with effective play-action designs. Smith’s adaptability is another key strength. He’s shown he can tailor his offense to fit the personnel he has, which is exactly what the Steelers need as they continue to develop their young offensive core around Russell Wilson. I expect Smith’s name to come back up during the head-coach hiring cycle in January. The Ravens are thankful for the hesitance of 31 other NFL teams: During the 2023 offseason, when Lamar Jackson received the non-exclusive franchise tag, teams across the league had the chance to negotiate with him. If any team had signed Jackson to an offer sheet, the Ravens would have had the ability to match it or accept two first-round picks as compensation. Remarkably, no team stepped up. Let that sink in. As a result, the Ravens retained Jackson and signed him to a five-year, $260 million extension in April 2023, including $185 million guaranteed, making him the highest-paid player in NFL history at the time. Looking back, it’s hard to believe no other team made a move for one of the league’s most electrifying players. Jackson isn’t just Baltimore’s quarterback, he’s their heartbeat. Week after week, his dynamic playmaking — whether he’s evading defenders to extend plays, threading a perfect pass, or breaking off a game-changing run — gives Baltimore a shot to win regardless of anything else. The rest of the league’s hesitation was a gift to the Ravens, one they’ll be thankful for every time Lamar Jackson takes the field.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Timberwolves' Anthony Edwards says individual agendas are behind slow start,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5954565/2024/11/28/anthony-edwards-timberwolves-slow-start/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 13:47:56 GMT","This has not been a team that plays together, pushing in the same direction. ""We got to start doing what the coaches say,"" Edwards said.","NBA Anthony Edwards walked out of the Target Center locker room with a smile of exasperation on his face, the kind of smile that only comes when the muscles in your face do not know how to react to the scene unfolding in front of you. His Minnesota Timberwolves had just given away a 12-point lead with 7 minutes, 17 seconds to play, losing 115-104 to the short-handed Sacramento Kings. It was their fourth straight loss and seventh in the last nine games, dropping them to 8-10 on the season. But more troubling to Edwards than the losses themselves was the bad body language he saw on the court. The good vibes of last season — the connectivity and tenacity — are all gone. And Edwards does not know what to do. Advertisement “It’s like we’re not even happy for each other out there,” he said to Rudy Gobert as he walked out. “I’ve never seen nothing like this in my life.” Edwards had just given a startlingly blunt assessment of the team in his postgame interview session. The eye test has shown a team that is disconnected, lacking energy and defensively inept, and Edwards confirmed every one of those observations with searing honesty. “We soft as hell as a team, internally,” Edwards said. “Not to the other team, but internally, we soft. We can’t talk to each other. Just a bunch of little kids. Just like we playing with a bunch of little kids. Everybody, the whole team. We just can’t talk to each other. And we’ve got to figure it out because we can’t go down this road.” The Timberwolves led the Kings 98-86 and seemed to be on their way to snapping their losing streak and injecting some much-needed positivity into a sullen group. But the shot making and defense that built their lead evaporated with an embarrassing quickness, and the Kings closed the game with a 29-6 avalanche to bury the Wolves in front of a furious home crowd. Edwards called the Wolves’ play “trash,” but still criticized the fans for booing them, perhaps showing the conflicted feelings that were coursing through him after the defeat. “However many of us it is, all 15, we go into our own shell and we’re just growing away from each other,” he said. “It’s obvious. We can see it. I can see it, the team can see it, the coaches can see it. The fans f—–g booing us. That (stuff) is crazy, man. We’re getting booed in our home arena. That’s so f—–g disrespectful, it’s crazy.” Those comments will get the headlines and attract attention, but another one of his statements gets much closer to the heart of what ails these Timberwolves. Last season’s team rode a dominant defense and a palpable internal harmony to the second Western Conference finals berth in franchise history. One of the biggest factors in that chemistry was the relative lack of players with uncertain futures. Edwards, Jaden McDaniels, Naz Reid, Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Mike Conley all got new deals before or during the season. Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert had their max contracts inked years before. The youngest players on the roster, Josh Minott and Leonard Miller, were second-round picks who understood that their time had not yet arrived.  The dynamics on this season’s team are completely different. Reid and Julius Randle can be free agents next summer if they exercise opt-out clauses in their contracts. Alexander-Walker is set to become a free agent when his deal expires. Donte DiVincenzo, who with Randle was acquired from the Knicks for Towns just before the season began, is in a new role coming off of the bench after starting 63 games and all of the playoff games in New York last season. It also is his fifth team in four years. Minott is in his third season and seeing very little time after a strong preseason. Rob Dillingham was drafted eighth overall and expected to be a fixture in the rotation at the start of the season. Advertisement Even Edwards has a different role this season. After sharing the “face of the franchise” label with Towns for his first four seasons in the league, Edwards is the unquestioned No. 1 guy in Minnesota this season. And while Randle has been good offensively since he arrived, he has not been the same kind of running mate that Towns was for Edwards. That puts even more pressure on Edwards to not only lead on the court, but in the locker room. “I’m trying to get better in that aspect, figure out what the hell to say to get everybody on the same agenda, because everybody right now is on different agendas,” Edwards said. “I think that’s one of the main culprits of why we’re losing because everybody out there has got their own agenda.” That observation crystallizes the problem in Minnesota through the first six weeks of the season. This has not been a team that plays together, has each other’s backs and is all pushing in the same direction. There are outside forces that have crept into the locker room and have contributed to the regression in so many of their games. After averaging 15.5 points, 3.7 rebounds and shooting 40.1 percent from 3-point range for the Knicks last season, DiVincenzo’s numbers have cratered in his first season in Minnesota. He is averaging 8.9 points, shooting 31.5 percent from 3 and turning the ball over seemingly every other time he hits the paint on a drive. He had five points and was 1 of 6 on 3-point shots against the Kings. The Wolves have tried to make him a pseudo-backup point guard, but the role has not been a good fit. If his shot was falling at a better clip this season, perhaps that adjustment would not look as difficult as it has. Randle is shooting better from 3 than last season. His scoring is down, but that was to be expected moving into a true No. 2 role to Edwards in Minnesota. His rebounding (6.7 per game) is the worst of his career by a wide margin and his defense has left a lot to be desired to this point. He had 21 points and nine rebounds on Wednesday night but also turned it over four times. Fox throws a DIME to Domas in the post 🏈 pic.twitter.com/FTHws5EjYk — Sacramento Kings (@SacramentoKings) November 28, 2024  Reid’s offensive numbers are all very similar to when he was NBA Sixth Man of the Year last season, but his defense has taken a noticeable step back from a year ago. He had a quiet night against Sacramento with seven points and three rebounds. McDaniels is financially secure in the first season of a five-year, $136 million deal and had, over the last couple of weeks, addressed coach Chris Finch’s concerns about soft defense and a lack of rebounding by putting in more consistent effort in both phases. But his shooting has been a disaster, hitting 28.8 percent of his 3s. He went 0 of 2 from deep against the Kings and was scoreless in 24 foul-filled minutes. Advertisement Gobert did get a new contract just before the season started, offering him the security and stability that he wanted. But he has been very inconsistent as well following up his fourth NBA Defensive Player of the Year award last season. His scoring has dropped from 14.0 points per game last season to 10.5 with a well-publicized pouting in Toronto, protesting not getting the ball on offense. His lack of inclusion in the offense could be bleeding over to his defense, where he has not been the same dominant presence. His rebounds have dropped from 12.9 last season to 11.1, and he is averaging 1.6 blocks per game, which is down from 2.1 last season. “It’s about us being willing to adapt to each other and really do anything we can to help each other thrive,” Gobert said after a loss to Houston on Tuesday. “When we do that, the team is going to thrive. I think we have that in us. We got some young guys, but we’re not a young team anymore. Even the younger guys have been through a couple of playoff experiences and they know what it takes.” Right now, the group has not splintered but has seemed to retreat to separate corners to work through their struggles. The shoulders slump quickly when things start going wrong and self-centered play starts to take over. Edwards, still only 23 and learning what it takes to be a true leader, set a terrific tone to start the game against Sacramento. He made his first five shots, including four 3s, in the first quarter to get the Wolves out quickly. But he went just 4 of 19 the rest of the way, including 0 of 5 from deep. When the Wolves still had a 10-point lead with 6:41 to play, Edwards uncorked a wild stepback 3 that missed and led to an easy runout for Keon Ellis, which gave the Kings some life. “We lost our willingness to execute,” Finch said. “We’re looking for the knockout punch all the time. Even if you make that shot, there’s five minutes left and you’re only up 13 so it’s not a knockout shot. Gotta get better there.” Finch has to take accountability as well. He has essentially run the same eight guys out there every night, save for when Conley was out the previous two games with a toe injury. Dillingham played an electric game against Houston, but only received 5 minutes, 32 seconds on Wednesday night, thanks to Conley’s return. Finch was looking for more defense against the Kings. He said he is going to start calling more plays himself to get the offense running the way it should and he is also looking for ways to address the porous rim protection when Randle and Reid share the frontcourt and Gobert goes to rest. He also said he wants to lengthen the rotation, but that has been an ongoing talking point that has yet to show any signs of being implemented. Advertisement Finch echoed Edwards’ concerns about the team chemistry preventing them from turning any kind of corner. “They have to be able to handle small pieces of adversity a lot better than they are, whether it’s a shooting slump or a bad call or a bad stretch of play or a poor decision by their teammate,” Finch said. “They’ve got to get a lot closer and more connected through those times, for sure.” While the public pressure mounts on Finch, Edwards stands tall for the coaching staff. If anything, Edwards said, the players aren’t executing what the coaches tell them to do. “We got to start doing what the coaches say,” Edwards said. “We always got something to say back. Even if you have something to say back, I feel like we just go out there and do our own (stuff). … It just comes from not following the game plan and listening to the coaches, man. I think that’s the main thing.” That’s where the individual agendas can wreak the most havoc. Much like Gobert’s ragged first season in Minnesota two years ago, it takes time for new players to learn how to play with him. The struggles that come at the beginning of that union can be difficult to overcome because the players need to see it be successful to believe in it. Randle and DiVincenzo have never won at a high level with Gobert. That’s why you see Randle hesitate to throw it to him in the post or DiVincenzo turn it over while forcing a pass to him through a tight window. The lack of success breeds hesitation. The hesitation is easy for everyone to see. “We have to live with each other’s deficiencies,” Conley said. “We have to live with each other’s mistakes and pick each other up. And that’s what the message is right now; you can’t be immature about this.” The Timberwolves are discovering what the Kings realized last season, that the euphoria of an unexpected rise in competitiveness can be enough to fuel one run, but that’s about as far as it can take a team. The Kings ended a 16-season playoff drought in 2022-23 but missed the playoffs again last season. Advertisement “The biggest thing is it only gets harder,” Kings coach Mike Brown said. “It’s easier to ascend and get to where you think you should be. But once you get there, people come for your neck not most games, but every game. Every game is a big game for your opponent. Somehow, some way, you have to match that focus, that energy, that accountability to details. It can take some time.” While Towns is off to a terrific start in New York, the Knicks have been up and down themselves. They are 10-8, but lost on Wednesday night to the Dallas Mavericks without Luka Dončić and recently lost to Utah as well. The Wolves do miss the sweet-shooting big man on the court, but they also miss his goofy nature in the locker room. There were times when Towns could induce eye rolls with a corny story, but he did help to keep the room light in good times and in bad. It’s a stark contrast to the dour tone in there over the last two games. “We’re just so negative right now. Last couple years, we were like this,” Edwards said, clasping his hands together. “And I just feel like we’ve gradually grown away from each other, which is the craziest thing because most of us have been together. We’ve got two new players, that’s about it. Everybody else has been together.” While frustration is high and heads are low in the Timberwolves locker room, the belief remains. They are 18 games into an 82-game schedule and still trying to build trust in one another. While Edwards exited the locker room shaking his head, Conley walked out with confidence. “We’re going to be all right,” he said. “I promise you.” The Wolves host the LA Clippers on Friday night and the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday to complete the homestand. By that time, the season will be nearly a quarter of the way over. Comparisons have been drawn to Gobert’s first season in Minnesota, but as of right now, another infamous Wolves season seems more apt. The Wolves were the toast of the NBA in 2004 when Kevin Garnett, Sam Cassell and Latrell Sprewell led them to the conference finals. The next season started with sky-high expectations, but quickly imploded thanks to Cassell and Sprewell getting sidetracked while lobbying for new contracts. The toxicity and selfishness on that team were much greater than what this team has exhibited to this point. But it feels like the collapse on Wednesday night marked a new low for them. Advertisement They have held team meetings after that embarrassing loss in Toronto last week and again during halftime on Wednesday when the Kings put up 69 points on the hapless Wolves defense, 42 of which were scored in the paint. Conley pulled the team together and started a conversation, one that helped them get in the frame of mind to turn a 12-point halftime deficit into a 12-point fourth-quarter lead. But even Conley knows the time for talking is just about over. “I talk all the time telling guys what to do or not to do, my experiences and how we’re gonna get out of this thing,” he said. “But talking is talking at the end of the day. We gotta go out there and we have to put something on that court that’s kind of compared to what we’re talking about in the locker room.” (Photo of Anthony Edwards: Jordan Johnson / NBAE via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"The Warriors need Brandin Podziemski, and he's showing some promising signs",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5954850/2024/11/28/brandin-podziemski-golden-state-warriors-thunder/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 13:41:18 GMT","After a stellar rookie year, Brandin Podziemski has struggled to start Year 2. But Wednesday, he looked like a player finding his way back.","NBA SAN FRANCISCO — After four missed layups by the Golden State Warriors, Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander drilled a 3-pointer over Kevon Looney to tie the game at 96. Just over four minutes remained. This is a moment for Stephen Curry. But he was wearing olive green pants and jacket, not No. 30. The Warriors would have to get a bucket without him. Advertisement After a couple passes and a couple of screens, Brandin Podziemski got the ball on the left wing. He drove past the Thunder’s Isaiah Joe and into the paint. Podziemski then slowed his pace as he two-stepped into his shot. He put his shoulder into the chest of Thunder center Isaiah Hartenstein, who’d slid over to protect the rim, and faded backward into a one-handed floater over the 7-foot center. For the sake of this game, it mattered that he didn’t make the shot. His push shot in the lane bounced around the rim before missing. It was part of the drought that would doom the Warriors in the 105-101 loss to the best team in the West. Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox.
 Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox. For the sake of this season, and the hope of Golden State, it mattered that he took the shot. “Slowly but surely,” he said, “I know I’m going to score the ball and shoot the ball at a better rate. … I’m just focused on being joyful, competitive, talking to my teammates, having a high attachment to that versus minutes, shots, all that kind of stuff. So it’s been a mindset flip for me. For now, I’m just going to try to go out there, play with joy and let the eggs fall where they may.” Podziemski believes he’s cleared a critical hurdle. But it didn’t happen on the court. It didn’t happen in the Warriors’ loss Wednesday. The breakthrough came earlier, on Sunday. It happened upstairs, in the space beneath his strawberry-blonde curls. In an hour-or-so session that recalibrated the psyche of the second-year guard. His plans for domination, to level up after his impressive rookie season, were thwarted by a slump to start the season. The space, once teeming with the confidence of Jack Harlow lyrics, had become infested. With frustration. With disappointment. With an anguish counterproductive to his game. So Podziemski met with Dr. Graig Chow, director of mental performance at Cal who also works with the Warriors as a mental coach. Advertisement It sparked a perspective shift. “I think my biggest struggle is like always wanting more and always wanting to achieve more,” Podziemski said. “And, you know, sometimes I’ve got to be reminded I’m only in my second year and a lot of guys around me been doing this for 10, 15 years now. And I know I’ve got so much to grow. But as a young guy that’s confident and wants to succeed so bad, you tend to want more than maybe what you’re capable of.” He finished with 7 points and 6 assists in a loss Monday to Brooklyn, which he deemed as a step in the right direction despite going just 2-for-5 from the field. Thus, his production against OKC was another step: 12 points to go with 8 rebounds and 5 assists in just shy of 30 minutes. He took 10 shots, which was just the fourth time in 12 games this month he attempted double digits. He was just 2-for-7 from 3-point range the last two games — after going 2-for-13 the previous five games — but this felt more like Podz. GO DEEPER Missing Steph Curry, Warriors go cold in crunch time and lose to Thunder Podziemski was a first-team All-Rookie selection who started 28 games, averaged 26.6 minutes and became almost an instant fan favorite. His coach loved him enough to play him over veterans with rings. His front office valued him enough to make him relatively untouchable in trade talks. Then the departure of Klay Thompson created even more opportunities for Podziemski. Podziemski didn’t run from the expectation. Didn’t deflect the possibilities. He conjured them. His visualization of his success was so clear as to feel certain. He wasn’t shy about declaring his vision. Swag got him to this level. Belief turned him into a keeper. It makes sense it would turn up after he did so in his rookie season. Podziemski is indeed pivotal to the Warriors’ plans. They need him. The absence of Curry underscored what’s clear even when Curry is present — a successful year for the Warriors mandates a good year from Podziemski. That’s especially true now with De’Anthony Melton out for the season. Advertisement Podziemski is the Warriors’ best option at point guard outside of Curry. The best penetrator off the dribble. One of the best playmakers. Expected to be one of the best shooters. But the NBA has a way of humbling its proud, decelerating its ambitious and, most certainly, chastising its young. “It’s hard,” Draymond Green said last week, “and I don’t say this from experience of myself. I say this from the experience of watching people. It’s hard having a great rookie season and then coming back and having a second year as good or better. It’s tough. … And I think for him, he’s just put so much pressure on himself for the player he wants to be and thinks he should be. And it’s unnecessary.” Podziemski wasn’t elevated to a permanent starter role, only getting the nod whenever Curry misses a game. His minutes are slightly down, even with four starts due to Curry DNPs. The worst? He missed 44 of his first 54 3-point attempts, an eye-popping 18.5 percent from deep. It drove him to seek answers. “I think I’ve let the mental piece of it get to me a little bit,” Podziemski said. “Early on, when I was struggling, the first five, 10 games, I thought it was more physical. Like maybe I wasn’t putting enough into it. But everybody around here knows I’m one of, if not, the hardest workers and I put a lot into it. So I just thought outside the box. ‘Mentally, how can I get to where I want to get to?’ … And Dr. (Chow) has helped, obviously, a lot of people around here. And it doesn’t hurt to try and ask him. So he helped me give me a lot of different things that help me be my authentic self.” This is what the vets in the Warriors locker room have subtly predicted, warned against in their veiled way. Podziemski’s brimming confidence has produced an eye roll or two, but mostly a you-just-watch disposition from those who’ve experienced the humbling. Advertisement But the important question was, is, how Podziemski responds to this inevitable position at which he’s arrived. One of the big takeaways from his session? Trust the work. Focusing on results leaves a player emotionally unstable, given to the ebbs and flows of basketball. The healthier perspective is to work hard at the craft and rely on the output to resemble the input. Over time. On average. He can’t lose aggression. He can’t press. He can’t get down on himself for not delivering the big splashes. Move with felicity instead of angst. Be a prisoner to the moment and not to the vision board. Appreciate who he is now while working towards an even better version. He’ll have every opportunity to be the player his ability suggests. Because the Warriors need him to be. Because when he’s on, the impact is felt. BRANDIN PODZIEMSKI HOOP AND HARM ⚡️ 📺 @NBCSAuthentic pic.twitter.com/dhBsTkkyhU — Golden State Warriors (@warriors) November 28, 2024  In the third quarter Wednesday, when the Warriors were clawing back from a 19-point deficit, Podziemski found himself in a minor groove. The aggression he rediscovered led to two driving layups during a Warriors run that turned the noise up in Chase Center. He hustled up a rebound on a missed Andrew Wiggins 3-pointer, leaping into the fray to deflect the ball to a teammate. He then drifted back behind the 3-point line where he received the pass from Green. Podziemski pulled it before Thunder guard Cason Wallace could get close enough to stop him. From the right wing, it splashed beautifully. Podziemski turned towards the roaring crowd with both arms spread wide. A moment of thanksgiving. A moment of relief. A moment of the joy he found again.

It was one of those timely 3s, cutting the Warriors’ deficit to 4, surging the momentum of the home team during a run that would eventually claim the lead. For the sake of this season, and the hope of Golden State, it mattered that he took the shot. (Photo of Brandin Podziemski: Noah Graham / NBAE via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Bowden: 24 reasons I'm thankful for MLB in 2024,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5954797/2024/11/28/mlb-thanksgiving-baseball-giving-thanks-2024/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 12:41:12 GMT","Giving thanks: Here's to the people, teams, moments and milestones that have made it another special year for MLB.","MLB It’s Thanksgiving, so I wanted to give thanks for the 2024 MLB season, which saw the best team in the regular season — the Los Angeles Dodgers — go on to win the World Series, but their impressive run was only one of many things that will stick with me. Here’s to the people, teams, moments and milestones that made it a special year. These are 24 reasons I’m thankful for MLB this year, and please share your own in the comments section. Thanks and Happy Thanksgiving to you and your families! 1. Freddie Freeman, who hammered a 10th-inning walk-off grand slam in Game 1 of the World Series, giving us yet another lifetime memory to go with the October blasts by Kirk Gibson, David Freese, Carlton Fisk, Joe Carter and company. 2. The MVP seasons of Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani. Judge had one of the best individual seasons in history, slashing .322/.458/.701 with a league-leading 58 home runs, 144 RBIs and 10.8 bWAR. Ohtani opened the 50-50 Club in unbelievable fashion, becoming the first player to hit 54 home runs and steal 59 bases in a season, while posting a 190 OPS+ and 9.2 WAR. 3. The Diamondbacks, who started the season by breaking the modern-era record for most runs scored in an inning on Opening Day, with 14 against the Rockies. 4. Elly De La Cruz, who became the first player to hit a 450-foot home run and an inside-the-park homer in the same game, on April 8 against the Milwaukee Brewers. 5. Gunnar Henderson, who became the youngest player in major-league history to hit 10 home runs before May 1. 6. Juan Soto, who became the first major leaguer to walk 669 times before he celebrated his 26th birthday, breaking the record held by Mickey Mantle. GO DEEPER Ranking Juan Soto's free-agent suitors: Which team will sign him? And for how much? 7. Francisco Lindor, who became the first shortstop to hit at least 25 home runs and steal 25 bases in three seasons (2018, ’23, ’24). Oh, and one of those homers broke up a no-hitter in the ninth, tying a game in Toronto the Mets somehow went on to win. 8. This year’s trade deadline. Some called it a “dudline,” but it still delivered: The Dodgers acquired Jack Flaherty, Tommy Edman and Michael Kopech; the Padres landed Tanner Scott; the Royals got Lucas Erceg; the Yankees traded for Jazz Chisholm Jr.; the Astros picked up Yusei Kikuchi. All of those trades were significant in helping their respective teams make the playoffs. 9. The emergence of so many talented young position players, from Jackson Merrill to Jackson Chourio to Colton Cowser to Austin Wells to Wilyer Abreu, among others. 10. Paul Skenes — who started the All-Star Game in his first season — and Luis Gil, who both wowed on the mound and pitched their way to Rookie of the Year honors. GO DEEPER Paul Skenes Ks Juan Soto, Aaron Judge to cap most dominant rookie pitching season in 50 years 11. Speaking of debuts, let’s hear it for new leadership in Baltimore, as David Rubenstein became the Orioles’ principal owner. Hopefully the ownership change will lead to more resources for a fan base that has deserved better. 12. Chris Sale, who had a remarkable comeback season that led to the first Cy Young Award of his career. And Tarik Skubal, another first-time Cy Young winner, who authored the best season of any starting pitcher in the sport. Advertisement 13. Luis Arraez, who became the first player in major-league history to win three consecutive batting titles with three different teams — the Twins, Marlins and Padres. 14. Emmanuel Clase, who had one of the most dominant seasons ever by a closer, with a 0.61 ERA over 74 games. GO DEEPER Baggarly: It's time for the BBWAA to add a Reliever of the Year Award 15. The Skenes-Ohtani matchup on June 5: Skenes strikes him out on three pitches in the first, then Ohtani goes yard in his next at-bat. A special moment of stars squaring off.  16. There were four no-hitters to celebrate. Hat tip to Ronel Blanco of the Astros, Dylan Cease of the Padres, Blake Snell of the Giants, and Shota Imanaga, Nate Pearson and Porter Hodge, who threw a combined no-no for the Cubs. 17. I’m thankful that Buster Posey, who came out of retirement after winning three World Series as a player, decided to take on the challenge — and long hours — of running a baseball operations department, for his San Francisco Giants. The game is a better place when former players like him give back. 18. A warm welcome back to future Hall of Fame Manager Terry Francona, who came out of retirement to sign a three-year contract to manage the Cincinnati Reds. It’ll be good to see Tito back in the dugout. GO DEEPER Terry Francona introduced as Reds manager: 'It just felt right' to return to Cincinnati 19. Props to the Kansas City Royals, who won 30 more games this year — improving from 56-106 in 2023 to 86-76 in 2024 — and made the playoffs. A turnaround for the ages. 20. Speaking of turnarounds, a hat tip to two teams that put together signature rallies after subpar starts: the OMG Mets, who took their fans on a wild ride, making the playoffs on the final day of the regular season and then advancing to the NLCS; and the Detroit Tigers, who went from trade-deadline sellers to “pitching chaos” postseason participants, making the playoffs, for the first time in a decade, in dramatic fashion — and winning a series to boot. 21. On the other hand, I’m thankful there is no relegation in MLB, otherwise the White Sox would no longer be part of the big leagues after the worst season I’ve seen in my lifetime. Here’s to turning the page. 22. Let’s tip our caps to the stars of the game who decided to retire, from Joey Votto to Stephen Strasburg to Cole Hamels to Kevin Kiermaier to Brandon Crawford. GO DEEPER How Joey Votto knew it was time — 'I'm expired' — and what he thinks could be next 23. And let’s give a standing O to the city of Oakland, which capped 57 years of major-league baseball in the Coliseum. There were so many things that made baseball in Oakland special and so many superstars in green and gold — from Reggie Jackson to Rickey Henderson to Catfish Hunter to Rollie Fingers to Dennis Eckersley to Vida Blue to Dave Stewart to Mark McGwire — who made their mark on the game. GO DEEPER Thank you, Oakland A’s 24. Finally, and most importantly, I’m thankful for the fans of baseball, the very best in the whole wide world!

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Missing Steph Curry, Warriors go cold in crunchtime and lose to Thunder",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5954335/2024/11/28/warriors-lose-thunder-steph-curry/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 12:38:02 GMT","Golden State has now lost three in a row, and Curry is dealing with pain in both knees. Others failed to step up late on Wednesday night.","NBA SAN FRANCISCO — Backup forward Kyle Anderson muscled through an and-1 layup with 5:45 left on Wednesday night to give the Warriors a 96-93 lead on the Thunder. It forced an Oklahoma City timeout, the brief high point of a game Golden State trailed nearly the entire way. But the momentum faded quickly. Anderson missed the free throw after the timeout, and then the Warriors failed to score on nine consecutive possessions. They went from the 5:45 mark to the 19-second mark stuck at 96 points, an extended drought that delivered them a third straight loss, dropping them to 12-6 this season. Advertisement “It’s kind of pick-and-roll time late in the game (in the NBA),” Steve Kerr said. “With Steph (Curry) out, it makes it a little trickier on our team.” Despite averaging only 29.7 minutes per game, Curry is “banged up” early this season, Kerr said. He’s popped up on the injury report a few times recently with left knee bursitis. There was some talk internally of him missing the second night of a road back-to-back in San Antonio last Saturday. But Curry instead played against the Spurs and then played again two nights later, logging 94 minutes over four days. Curry’s knee tendinitis is causing pain in both knees. He had an MRI that came back clean on Tuesday. But lead medical decision maker Rick Celebrini suggested he miss Wednesday’s game against the Thunder, giving him a few extra days of rest before Saturday’s game in Phoenix. That left the Warriors without Curry in crunchtime against the Thunder’s fierce defense, currently ranked first in the NBA. Against it, with the game on the line, Golden State had a sequence of jagged possessions that ended in contested Andrew Wiggins and Jonathan Kuminga fadeaways, turnovers or rushed jumpers late in the clock. “I thought we were a bit scattered and that’s on me,” Draymond Green said. “The game gets to that point, somebody got to slow the game down and get us into a set. I am the veteran out there. I am the one with the most experience out there. So I gotta get my head out of my a– and go get the ball and get us into a set. Something that would be beneficial for all of us.” Without Curry, Kerr decided to go small with his starters for the first time this season. Brandin Podziemski started in Curry’s place and Kuminga replaced Trayce Jackson-Davis, bumping Green to the center spot. Podziemski and Kuminga — expected to get a bump in scoring responsibility — started extremely slow, and the Warriors dug an immediate double-digit hole. But both brought more juice in the second quarter and were a large part of the third-quarter surge after Thunder wing Jalen Williams left the game, injuring his eye while contesting a Kuminga poster dunk. Advertisement Podziemski had 12 points and five assists. It was a small step forward as he tries to climb out of his offensive slump. Pat Spencer, the two-way guard who stepped into backup duties, turned the game with his second-quarter energy. Kuminga scored a team-high 19 points on 8 of 21 shooting. “JK came and did that great job after that first (stint) when he was rusty,” Kerr said. “We definitely will play that smaller lineup with JK at the four and Draymond at the five plenty coming up. But my gut would be to keep starting the way we’ve been starting with Trayce and Draymond.” Kerr said pregame that he knows Kuminga would “prefer to start,” but he likes him as the team’s scorer off the bench “When (they) took me out the starting five, I didn’t complain,” Kuminga said. “Coming in today and telling me that I’m going to be in the starting five, I was happy but that hasn’t affected me at all. I still go out there and just play and be free. It’s not something that really affected me or anything like that.” Steve Kerr started small because he said he didn’t want to pair Draymond/TJD without Steph Curry. But Kerr said his “gut” would be to move back to the big starting lineup (with Kuminga back to the bench) when Curry returns. pic.twitter.com/M8VYVb4iAC — Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) November 28, 2024 
In the five-plus-minute drought in crunchtime, Wiggins and Kuminga both had an in-traffic turnover, Podziemski missed a contested floater, Kuminga had a 3 blocked in the corner, Wiggins couldn’t get off a clean 11-footer and Green left an open corner 3 short. Nothing operated smoothly. “Everybody wanted it,” Green said. “JK was getting to the hole. He wanted it. Wiggs got into the paint a couple of times. He wanted it. BP did as well. But our spacing wasn’t correct, and so they’re able to collapse on the paint and we don’t have the proper kick-outs because our spacing wasn’t right because we weren’t getting into anything. It was just guys making plays themselves. “So I can do a better job there and I definitely have to, especially when Steph’s out . .. Sometimes you just get lost in the game. I kind of got lost in the game a little bit, but I got to be able to identify that we’re a little scattered and get us settled down and get us into something. That’s not on BP or any of those guys. They don’t have the experience to do that, so that’s on me, that’s my fault.” (Photo of Kyle Anderson, Ajay Mitchell and Cason Wallace: Ezra Shaw / Getty Images)   Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Auburn looks like college basketball’s best team — and Johni Broome its best player,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5954782/2024/11/28/auburn-basketball-johni-broome-maui-invitational/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 12:16:25 GMT","Broome had 21 points, 16 rebounds, six assists, four blocks, two 3-pointers and one steal in the Maui title game domination of Memphis.","NCAAM LAHAINA, Hawaii — Down John Broome went, descending the wooden bleachers inside the Lahaina Civic Center as quickly as his legs could carry him. Anything for a better view. By the time Broome’s feet hit the hardwood, he’d already whipped his iPhone out of his jorts pocket, to stream the entire scene on Instagram Live. With one hand holding the phone, and the other adjusting the plaid Auburn cap affixed backward atop his head, the proudest father in the entire gymnasium Wednesday gave the world a glimpse of life from the peak. Advertisement A glimpse of his middle child, Johni, at the summit of the college basketball stratosphere. “It’s a blessing come true,” John told The Athletic with his phone trained on Johni at midcourt, seconds after No. 4 Auburn’s 90-76 win over Memphis in the Maui Invitational title game. “He’s been working hard all of his life, he’s been overlooked, and now he’s on the stage to show the world who he is — and I’m just proud of him.” As he should be. As all of Auburn should be, especially after Broome led the Tigers to their first Maui title in program history. And “led” is doing some heavy lifting there. Broome had — deep breath — 21 points, 16 rebounds, six assists, four blocks, two 3-pointers and one steal against Memphis. His opening sequence of the game was as masterful as we’ve seen this young season. Simply, he was the best player on the floor on Wednesday … and Tuesday … and Monday … and maybe this entire season. KenPom ranks the 6-foot-10 graduate center from Plant City, Fla., as its too-early National Player of the Year, and anything less wouldn’t feel fair. He has been that good, that dominant — and the reason why Auburn will emerge from Feast Week as arguably the best team in the entire sport. Kansas, the current No. 1, has wins over North Carolina and Duke. Not bad, not bad. But Auburn? Bruce Pearl’s team has three top-12 wins in its first seven games — another program first in the season’s first month — and that doesn’t even include Memphis, which entered this week unranked but will surely be in the Top 25 come Sunday’s tally. It’s not all because of Broome — but he’s sure a big part of why. “He’s the biggest dog,” said his mother, Julie, clutching a miniature plush tiger and an orange-and-blue pom-pom. “Everybody’s smaller than big dog.” When Broome, a former three-star recruit, first arrived on the Plains three seasons ago after transferring in from Morehead State, he was a fine back-to-the-basket big. But he was also, in Pearl’s words, “a young 19, even though he’s a large man.” Basically? Broome needed to grow up. Needed to lock in. Even Memphis coach Penny Hardaway — whose Tigers played Pearl’s Tigers back in Broome’s first season at Auburn — remembered so. Advertisement “Probably a little distracted and thought it was going to be easier,” Hardaway said. “He got a reality check of what it was like to come up.” And now? The player who torched his team from the opening tip? Who had nine points, four boards, three blocks, three assists and a steal in the first nine minutes Wednesday, as Auburn built an insurmountable 12-point lead? “Now he understands the lay of the land,” Hardaway added. “He knows how serious he has to be, knows he has to be a leader — and he’s doing that now. That’s a total difference from two years ago to now with him.” There’s no short way to summarize two-plus years of teenage maturation, but one example hits the nail on the head. When Broome first joined the program in 2022, fellow center Dylan Cardwell wasn’t the biggest fan. “I looked at him as an opponent rather than my teammate,” Cardwell acknowledged. “I wasn’t cheering for him. I wasn’t really happy for him as I should have been.” Early last season, when Broome had his first 30-point breakout vs. Virginia Tech — banishing Cardwell to the bench for all but nine minutes — you can imagine how the incumbent felt. But then he remembered two games prior, when Broome was parked on the bench while Cardwell went a perfect 6-for-6 from the charity stripe. “The loudest person in that arena,” Cardwell said, “was Johni Broome.” A brotherhood was born in that instant, the ramifications of which Memphis felt Wednesday. Not only did Broome carve up the Tigers, but his gravitas opened up everything else for his teammates — including Cardwell, who had a career-best 18 points and six assists and was the beneficiary of a handful of Broome’s best assists. Look out👀 pic.twitter.com/D7antwxGzq — Auburn Basketball (@AuburnMBB) November 27, 2024  That speaks to Broome’s off-court growth. But on it? The 240-pounder has become the sort of mismatch befitting the block-lettered tattoo running the length of his right shin: NIGHTMARE ON BROOME STREET. Broome went from not even attempting a 3 his freshman year to making the first shot of the game from — you guessed it — behind the arc. He’s shooting 34.6 percent from 3 this season, after hitting 35.4 percent last season. Advertisement That hasn’t happened by accident. Julie remembers, back when Broome first committed to Morehead State, sending out a Tweet about her son: You don’t know his name now, but you will. “I know my son,” she said, explaining her rationale. “I know the hard work and dedication he’s put in. I know his resilience. I know his integrity, his game — and he doesn’t stop. And when it comes to competition, he ain’t gonna go down. He invites it. Bring it on.” That has been abundantly clear all week, beyond Wednesday. On Monday, Broome had the game-winning sequence against No. 5 Iowa State, in the first top-five matchup in the first round in Maui Invitational history. He stripped Cyclones guard Keshon Gilbert — a 6-foot-4 blur leading ISU with 16.8 points per game — with less than 15 seconds left and the score tied, then tipped in a missed Denver Jones layup on the other end to complete Auburn’s 18-point comeback. He then terrorized North Carolina’s timid frontcourt on Tuesday, coming within a stat correction of 20 and 20. More of the same Wednesday. Even his first-half stat line — 15 points, 11 rebounds, five assists and three blocks — was the stuff most big men dream of. John was waving a white towel, literally, as the buzzer went off at the break, in a sign of support for what Memphis should’ve done. And yet, maybe because of his journey from three-star recruit to the Ohio Valley Conference, Broome isn’t someone to puff out his chest. In fact, he refused to pose for photos alone in the pandemonium of Auburn’s win, instead insisting on sharing the spotlight — like he did the rock — with his teammates. Fitting, for someone humble enough to have LOSER tattooed vertically behind his right ear. “Unicorn. Special. That’s not normal,” John said of his son’s unselfishness. “You don’t see that all the time.” Advertisement But even if Broome won’t take the spotlight for himself, it’s going to be hard to steer clear of it after his national breakout this week in Hawaii. He’s top-10 nationally in defensive rebounding rate and top-50 in block percentage, per KenPom, while also posting a top-150 efficiency rating, despite taking almost a third of the team’s shots when he’s on the court. “The Player of the Year (talk) don’t really matter to me,” Broome said, from behind a square pair of glasses. “I care about winning.” That’s fine — because at this rate, Auburn’s going to be doing plenty of that. The Tigers were picked second in the SEC in the preseason and were ranked in the top 10 nationally, but even that lofty hype feels ludicrously low in hindsight. Because even on the off chance that Broome has a bad night, good luck stopping the rest of his supporting cast. Cardwell, normally a defensive enforcer, had his moment in the sun Wednesday, too. Chad Baker-Mazara is a 6-foot-7 Swiss Army knife, who is shooting 44.8 percent from 3 while also defending opposing centers. Jones is Pearl’s defensive dog, the guy he sticks on the opponent’s best guard. Just ask Memphis’ Tyrese Hunter — who averaged 24.5 points and six made 3s the first two games this week — how he liked the Jones treatment on Wednesday. He went scoreless in the first half and finished with 11 points on 4-of-10 shooting. Tahaad Pettiford, who torched Houston’s typically ironclad defense weeks ago, is the rare five-star on Pearl’s roster, and the fact that he comes off the bench speaks to the hilarious glut of talent the Tigers have. Either Chaney Johnson or Miles Kelly are liable to go off on any night and give Pearl two more perimeter stoppers he can deploy on bigger wings. It would be a Top-25 outfit without Broome. With him? Well, let’s just say that four months from now, we might be talking about a sixth team that used a Maui title as a springboard to winning it all. Back on the floor, John and Julie were asked what it feels like for their son to be arguably the best player in the country as November comes to a close. Not insulted, per se, they interrupted to amend that query, issuing a correction almost in lockstep. Advertisement “He is the best player,” John said. “He’s a competitor, and he’s a winner,” Julie added, “and now, he’s a champion.” Wearing a wave cap and the honorary lei given to the tournament MVP, Johni disappeared into the locker room behind his parents. Other Auburn fans flocked out of the gym, off to celebrate what could be the best team in school history. John and Julie didn’t want to miss the party, so a final question: Based on what they saw this week in Hawaii, behind their son’s superb efforts, just how good can Auburn be? How far can these Tigers go? “To Texas,” Julie said, already well aware this season’s Final Four is in San Antonio. Then John flashed his gold grill and popped out the No. 4 jersey he wore — Johni’s number — with both thumbs. “We’re going all the way, baby,” he said. “We’re going for championships. Stamp it. Stamp it.” (Photo of Johni Broome: Darryl Oumi / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories. Subscribe to The Athletic for in-depth coverage of your favorite players, teams, leagues and clubs.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Cowboys Today: Predictions for Thanksgiving matchup vs. Giants and Brandin Cooks returns,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5954586/2024/11/28/cowboys-today-predictions-giants-cooper-rush/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 12:06:28 GMT","Comparing Cooper Rush and Dak Prescott, injury updates and picking the winner in the Cowboys-Giants matchup.","NFL The passing game was bound to change when Cooper Rush took over for the injured Dak Prescott at quarterback. One thing that’s different is how much the ball is being pushed down the field. According to TruMedia, Prescott attempted 10.8 percent of his passes 20 or more yards down the field. Rush is less, but not by much: He’s attempted 9.4 percent of his passes beyond 20 yards. A similar trend exists with passes at or behind the line of scrimmage. For Prescott, 20.6 percent of his passes fit that category while Rush is in the same ballpark at 21.5 percent. The difference, though, is a bit more in the intermediate game. Fifty-eight percent of Prescott’s passes went beyond five yards, whereas the figure is 50 percent for Rush. For 10-plus yards, it was 30.4 percent for Prescott while it’s 26.2 percent for Rush. Prescott has been above 55 percent on five-plus yards for all but one year in his career and over 30 percent in 10-plus yards for all but one year in his career, too. In terms of passing depth, the intermediate game is where there’s been the biggest change from Prescott to Rush. Rush suffered a knee injury during Sunday’s game. He was limited Monday and Tuesday but was a full participant Wednesday. He said Tuesday that he was “good to go” for today’s game. Cowboys RG Zack Martin and TE Jake Ferguson have officially been ruled out for tomorrow pic.twitter.com/ZAYPxGcLsu — Jon Machota (@jonmachota) November 27, 2024  Brandin Cooks is officially back, with the Cowboys bringing the veteran wide receiver off of injured reserve on Wednesday. It’s a positive development for the Dallas offense, especially given Cooks’ leadership and the respect he commands from the entire locker room. Although Cooks’ return is a good thing, Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy needs to be realistic in how he plans to call the offense, and which players he features. Dallas has been sorely lacking in playmakers around CeeDee Lamb, and that’s included Cooks when he was healthy, for the bulk of last season and earlier this season. Advertisement With it being his first game back after being out for two months, Cooks may be on a snap count, anyway. Regardless, the Cowboys need to lean in to where the results have been showing up. Having the full stable of wide receivers shouldn’t result in getting too pass-happy and abandoning the run game, especially after Rico Dowdle is coming off an 86-yard performance. KaVontae Turpin has also shown up as a playmaker the past couple of weeks with two 60-plus yard touchdowns. He deserves to be involved in the Cowboys’ plan to score points. Getting Cooks back should be helpful, especially as tight end Jake Ferguson remains out with a concussion. Having more weapons to work with is always a good thing, but McCarthy needs to make sure he doesn’t abandon what’s been working, just to accommodate Cooks’ return. GO DEEPER Giants at Cowboys: How to watch, odds, expert picks for annual Thanksgiving game in Dallas Give this week’s episode a listen as we preview today’s game but spend most of the time talking about bigger picture topics, like the future of the Cowboys’ coaching staff. We also responded to several mailbag questions about the rest of the season and which players Dallas needs to make a priority in free agency.  Jon Machota, Dallas Cowboys beat writer: The Vegas line has me second-guessing myself. I figured with all the drama in New York and the Cowboys coming off a win at Washington that they would be a touchdown favorite over the Giants. But the oddsmakers have Dallas as only a 3.5-point favorite. Maybe it’s because of the sun. It’s often an issue at AT&T Stadium during these 3:30 CT games. What a fun storyline that will be. But ultimately, I think Mike Zimmer has the Dallas defense heading in the right direction. I think Micah Parsons and company will make things very difficult for Drew Lock or whoever is playing quarterback for New York. Cowboys 17, Giants 10. Saad Yousuf, Dallas Cowboys beat writer: I’m having a hard time not looking past this game for the Cowboys, not necessarily because I think they’re so much better than the Giants but more so because I don’t think this game reveals much about the team. If they lose, last Sunday’s win serves as a blip on the radar and it’s back to the miserable feeling when they lost five consecutive games. If they win, well, it’s the Giants. Get through this one, and then I think we’ll find out more about the Cowboys next week against the Cincinnati Bengals. Cowboys 20, Giants 9. GO DEEPER Giants have become a national punchline. Will Brian Daboll, Joe Schoen survive the season? Charlotte Carroll, New York Giants beat writer: The Giants have plunged to the bottom of power rankings and climbed to the top of the league in embarrassment after Sunday’s thrashing by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. It wasn’t just the loss but what came after that made the Giants look so bad: The postgame locker room was furious, and players like Malik Nabers and Dexter Lawrence didn’t hold back from venting their frustrations. This is a team teetering on the edge, so they desperately need to produce a respectable performance in front of a national audience to quiet the conversation. Thursday’s game won’t be pretty, but Dallas might not be good enough to embarrass New York. I think the Giants can at least hang around before ultimately falling. Cowboys 20, Giants 10.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Barcelona's 125th anniversary: 7% of goals scored by Messi, three papal conclaves and 132 trophies",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5927155/2024/11/28/barcelona-125th-anniversary-messi-numbers/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 12:00:23 GMT",Barcelona are 125 years old on Friday. So what are some of the most significant numbers in their history?,"La Liga Friday, November 29, 2024, will mark the 125-year anniversary of the formation of FC Barcelona. To mark the occasion, The Athletic is running a series of pieces, celebrating the people and the moments who have helped make the club what it is today. First up was the story of Joan Gamper, the man who founded the club. Next, our statistics expert Will Jeanes runs through some of the most significant numbers in the club’s history… Barcelona, one of the most famous and successful clubs in world football, is about to turn 125 years old. One hundred and twenty-five years of some of the greatest players, sides and moments in the sport’s history. What began as a Swiss businessman’s park team as the sun set on the 19th century is now one of the biggest global brands in the world with fans in every corner of the planet. Advertisement The sheer number of trophies, records and statistics is mindboggling — and that’s just for their most famed former player, Lionel Messi. What is the club’s biggest victory? How many men have won the World Cup while playing for Barcelona? And what percentage of the total number of Barca goals have been scored by the Argentinian who dazzled the Camp Nou for almost 17 years? Here, The Athletic picks out the best numbers from Barcelona’s history. There are quite a few… Editor’s note: All numbers and statistics in this article refer to the Barcelona men’s team only. Barcelona’s first football match took place just over a week after their founding in November 1899 by Joan Gamper — a 1-0 loss to ‘English Colony’, a team, unsurprisingly, made up of Englishmen living in the Catalan city which, at the time, had a population of around 530,000. Now, the second-largest city in Spain is home to more than 1.6million people. That was a friendly game, however, with the club’s first competitive outing a 2-1 defeat by the now-defunct Hispania Athletic Club in January 1901 in the also now-defunct Copa Macaya — a short-lived competition involving only clubs from Catalonia. Overall, Barca have played 4,367 competitive games in their 125 years of existence. Messi, who made his debut for the club in October 2004 at the age of 17, has played in more of them than anyone else. He surpassed his former team-mate and the club’s future manager Xavi at the top of the list in a 6-1 victory against Real Sociedad in March 2021. Messi, you will not be shocked to read, scored twice and provided one assist in that match in San Sebastian. Messi left the club that summer, making his final Barca appearance in a loss to Celta Vigo in May 2021. He was 33 years old in that match, which, given how much he achieved at the Camp Nou, seems very young looking back now.  Eight of the top 10 appearance-makers in Barcelona’s history have played for the club in the last 11 years. Carles Rexach (final game in 1981) and Migueli (1988) are the two exceptions. George Girvan, a 22-year-old Scotsman, scored the club’s first competitive goal in that loss to Hispania Athletic Club in 1901 — and Barca have gone on to score another 9,406 since then. Here are the 10 players to have scored the most goals for the Catalans.  Of these men, only four (Cesar Rodriguez, Mariano Martin, Rexach and Josep Escola) were born in Spain. Messi’s tally of 672 means the Argentinian has scored 7.1 per cent of the goals in the club’s history. That is the most anyone has ever scored at a single club in the history of top-level football, with Messi surpassing Pele’s 643 at Brazilian club Santos with his goal against Real Valladolid in December 2020. That figure of 672 is also more than the number of votes George W. Bush beat Al Gore by in Florida (where Messi now lives) in the 2000 United States presidential election (537). At the time the state’s population was 16 million. GO DEEPER Lionel Messi at Barcelona: The pain and glory of a 20-year love affair Here is the breakdown of Messi’s goals for the club by season. He scored 50+ times in six different campaigns and won 35 trophies at Barcelona — averaging a piece of silverware every 22 games for them.  Barcelona’s 9,407 goals across well over a century have helped them win a total of 132 trophies, with 27 of those the Spanish top-flight title (including in its inaugural season in 1929) and five of them the European Cup/Champions League. Barcelona have won the treble (league title, main domestic cup and European Cup/Champions League) twice — in 2008-09 and 2014-15. Bayern Munich (2012-13 and 2019-20) are the only other European side to have achieved this more than once. Here is a breakdown of Barcelona’s trophies. Not all of these competitions were classed as competitive, but this is the Catalan club’s trophy cabinet in full. Arch-rivals Real Madrid (36) are the only team to have won La Liga more often than Barcelona. Meanwhile, the Catalan club’s 31 triumphs in the Copa del Rey — Spain’s equivalent of the FA Cup — is seven more than second-placed Athletic Club from Bilbao. Madrid (15), Milan (seven), Bayern (six) and Liverpool (six) are the only sides that have been European champions more times than Barcelona. In the Champions League era (1992-93 onwards), only Madrid have achieved this feat more often than the Catalan club. Here is Barcelona’s finishing position in every La Liga season from 2000-01 onwards, with 11 of their 27 titles coming in the last 20 years (10 of them with Messi at the club).  As you can see, Barcelona haven’t ended a season outside the top three since a sixth-place finish in 2002-03. The last time Madrid did not finish either first, second or third was in the following campaign (2003-04) when the side then managed by Carlos Queiroz came fourth. The last time Barcelona finished outside the top six was in 1941-42 when they came 12th (Spanish league football continued throughout the Second World War). Madrid last did so in 1976-77, when they came ninth. Advertisement Barcelona, Madrid and Athletic Club are the only teams to have played in every season of the Spanish top flight, which began in 1929. Barca have competed in European football in 67 different seasons (counting editions of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup that spanned multiple campaigns as just one season). Only Madrid have played continental football in more campaigns.  Barcelona have had 73 managers in their history (including caretakers and counting those who did more than one spell multiple times), with 35-year-old Englishman Billy Lambe in 1912 the first (as player-manager). In total, 10 Englishmen have managed the club — with Bobby Robson, whose final game was the Copa del Rey final victory against Real Betis in June 1997, the most recent. Here are the managers to have taken charge of the club in the most number of games.  Of those 11 managers, five also played for Barcelona — Johan Cruyff, Pep Guardiola, Luis Enrique, Ernesto Valverde and Xavi. Barcelona’s biggest margin of victory in a competitive game is nine goals — a feat they have achieved on nine occasions, but just once since 1979. Five of these games were in the Copa del Rey and four in La Liga. The league matches were the victories against Gimnastic Tarragona in 1949, Sporting Gijon in 1952, Real Oviedo in 1954 and Rayo Vallecano in 1979. In that match against Sporting in 1952, Barca’s Hungarian forward Laszlo Kubala scored seven times — something that has not been matched in Spain’s top flight since. The only other instance of a player scoring seven times in a La Liga game came in February 1931, when Bata, a 22-year-old forward for Athletic Club, did so against Barca. The match, which finished 12-1 to home side Athletic, is the biggest competitive defeat in Barcelona’s history. It is also the biggest loss any side has suffered in the Spanish top flight.  Barcelona conceded 43 goals in the league that season (in 18 games) with 28 per cent of them coming in that match under English manager James Bellamy. The Catalan club finished the campaign in fourth, just one point behind champions Athletic (two points were awarded for a win at that point). Yet despite such a narrow gap, the two team’s goal differences read: Athletic: 40, Barcelona: -3. The 22-goal swing from their game in the Basque Country had much to do with the enormous discrepancy. Advertisement Speaking of scorelines, probably the quirkiest stat in Barcelona’s history is that every time the club have played a competitive game during a papal conclave (when the College of Cardinals sits to elect a new pope) they have won the match 4-0. This has happened three times — against Madrid in October 1958 and Las Palmas in October 1978 in La Liga and versus Milan in March 2013 in the Champions League. The elected popes? John XXIII, John Paul II and Francis. Dani Alves is the oldest player to ever appear for Barcelona competitively — the Brazilian had just turned 39 when he made his final appearance for the club in 2022. At the other end of the scale, Lamine Yamal is the youngest player in the club’s history, breaking a record that had stood for 101 years when he made his debut in April 2023 at 15. Eleven men have won the World Cup while at Barcelona, with seven of those doing so for Spain in 2010. David Villa, who was Spain’s top scorer at the 2010 edition in South Africa, agreed terms with Barca the month before the tournament began but didn’t play for the Catalans until the start of the following season, after the tournament. He was therefore classed as a Valencia player on the squad list for the World Cup. Romario won the Golden Ball at the 1994 edition for Brazil and Andres Iniesta scored Spain’s extra-time winner against Netherlands in the 2010 final. Goalkeeper Victor Valdes and Ousmane Dembele are the only two of the 11 who didn’t play in the final when their countries triumphed (though Dembele featured in the 2022 final, when France lost to Messi’s Argentina on penalties). Barcelona players have won the Ballon d’Or on 12 occasions, with those wins achieved by six different players. 
  No club have had a player representing them win the prestigious award more often (Madrid also have 12), while Messi’s six wins as a Barcelona man is the most times any player has won the Ballon d’Or at one club. Barcelona have come a long way from the amateur side created by a Swiss expat new to the city nearly 125 years ago. Will the club be totally unrecognisable again on their 250th anniversary? Will anyone surpass Messi’s record number of goals? What scoreline will the next papal conclave bring? Whatever happens, it won’t be without drama, excitement and lots more numbers.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Taylor Swift, the future of fandom and a dilemma facing women's football",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5952288/2024/11/28/taylor-swift-womens-football-fandom/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 11:45:41 GMT","Powerful figures within the game have spoken about the opportunities for attrating new fans, but the comments have divided opinion","UK Women's Football How to sum up Taylor Swift’s record-breaking Eras tour? Unavoidable and unignorable, given its scale and economic impact: the highest-grossing concert tour of all time boosted tourism, local businesses and the hospitality industry more significantly than the 2024 Summer Olympics and the Super Bowl. Dancing from concertgoers at several stops registered seismic activity. Advertisement In a world stratified by endless streaming options, over the past two years Swift has felt like the world’s only ubiquitous, monolithic pop culture figure, drawing unprecedented levels of engagement among white women and girls in particular. Now, the most powerful people in women’s football have turned their attention to Swift. Michele Kang, the American owner of Washington Spirit, Olympique Lyonnais Feminin and London City Lionesses, has told her players and staff they are not competing with men’s football teams for eyeballs but the entertainment business — Swift included. “You all have seven evenings a week,” she began at a media conference to mark her purchase of London City. “You can go see a Taylor Swift concert. Why would you come to watch women’s football? We have to convince people this is the best form of entertainment.” Nikki Doucet, the chief executive of Women’s Professional Leagues Ltd, the company that has taken control of the Women’s Super League (WSL) and Championship from the Football Association (FA), spoke to the Guardian newspaper in August about the importance of capturing “your ‘Taylor Swift fanbase’”: fans who had discovered the women’s game through the Lionesses and had no prior affiliation with men’s football. In a September address with wider media, Doucet stressed the need for women’s football to find its own language and identity: the game should be unafraid to “try new things” if it was serious about growth. “Maybe we want to share friendship bracelets, or something the men’s game might never think of but it might work for our game,” she said. At talk of friendship bracelets, Doucet met her greatest point of resistance online from women’s football fans who felt that importing what the New York Times called “the badge of the Swiftie fandom” would dilute the integrity of a sport often battling to be taken seriously. Followers of women’s football are creating its culture in real time — often online — and as a result the nature of fandom is constantly reinventing and reflecting on itself. That newness brings a certain malleability to the sport, but fans are understandably protective when it comes to preserving what they see as the best parts of that space. Women’s football already has its own ecosystem and idiosyncrasies, many argue — why does it need to borrow some from Swift? Some talked as if making friendship bracelets was about to become a condition of entry for women’s games. Others wondered if Doucet was simply grabbing at Swift as a figure popular with millions of women and girls. What actually happened was that, following its takeover, WPLL commissioned an external company to break down the women’s football fanbase, the results of which were analysed in January and February last year. Research took four months and comprised over 150 hours of interviews across the country with more than 60 people from the ages of 10 to 60. Advertisement The differences that emerged were not based on age, sex or geography but in the respondents’ relationships with football, spawning three different groups. The first is the core fan: the intensely loyal, the season-ticket holders, those abreast of formations and tactics. “They disproportionately over-influence because they’re the biggest cheerleaders, they’re the most vocal and they’re just so important,” Doucet tells The Athletic. Then comes the secondary fan, who has come to the women’s game via men’s football but does not necessarily have the capacity to follow both with the same devotion. They may flit in and out around international breaks and major tournaments. Group three is the ‘free fan’, or, in Doucet’s words, “the one that’s never watched men’s football before”. In most cases, their first encounter with football is the Lionesses. They are still learning the game’s key characters, rivalries and rules. Doucet’s Guardian interview coincided with Swift’s final shows at Wembley, when media estimates predicted an impending £300million ($380m) boost to the London economy due to Swift’s impact. Doucet attended one of the concerts. “When I looked around that particular stadium and you see who’s in the crowd, it looks similar to the Lionesses crowd and the Euros crowd,” she says. “It doesn’t look similar to a men’s football crowd. What we’re trying to do here is get women’s football to be more culturally ingrained in our society and bring it to more people who may not necessarily watch men’s football. “Part of it was maybe trying to use an analogy — more so for the clubs and the football stakeholders — to show what an incredible opportunity it is. Traditionally, they don’t really talk to that audience.” Swift, Doucet says, is “someone who has listened to her fans, has created a massive community that’s open for everybody and is giving her fanbase what they want. She listens. She responds. It’s that type of concept: are we listening to our fanbase? Are we giving them the content they want? Do they have the stories that they need to follow the teams or the players or (enhance) their understanding of the game?”  Doucet got her first friendship bracelet at a WSL game at Tottenham Hotspur. Several players wore them to the WSL’s media launch day in September. The West Ham United goalkeeper Kinga Szemik’s was a gift from team-mates and Aston Villa’s Maz Pacheco wore one from a fan. “I just love getting bracelets from the fans,” Pacheco, 26, said. “I change them every day. (They bring them) to every game. It’s beautiful.” Advertisement “It’s tapping into different behaviours and listening, thinking, and responding,” Doucet adds. “Is that something our fanbase would like? Is it something they wouldn’t like? And if they wouldn’t? OK, fine.” Doucet’s data has already demonstrated that the buying habits of women’s football fans differs from those in the men’s game. “This is another opportunity to drive asset value for their club,” she says. “We have to understand: what’s a great experience? How are we creating the right experience for women’s football, across all of the clubs, that people want to keep coming back to?” There is little overlap between Swifties and men’s football fans. Andrew James, 29, describes himself as an “Evertonian Swiftie — not in that order”, and enjoys rewriting Swift’s songs with an Everton twist (see his illustrated reimagining of Swift’s All Too Well addressed to Dominic Calvert-Lewin from the perspective of Tom Davies). “I’m into them both for similar reasons, even though there’s not really much crossover in how I experience them,” he says. “I’m aware that people do kind of see them as very different things. I’ve definitely got two different sides to my X account.” An Everton fan living in London, he watched Everton Women win the Merseyside derby during the men’s international break but does not go to women’s games regularly. He wonders if the women’s game can borrow from Swift’s habit of making every show unique by dropping hints and announcements. “Every concert could be a night that she announces something,” he says. “If there are ways to hold off announcing signings on social media and having them at the stadium, that would be a much more exciting thing. It will give them extra reasons to go to the match.” The boundaries between Swifties and women’s football fans are a little more permeable. Players from the 2015 World Cup-winning U.S. Women’s National Team joined Swift on stage that year for the East Rutherford concert of her 1989 World Tour and her music has featured prominently in the team’s marketing through the years. In 2023, Swift filmed a video announcing Alex Morgan’s inclusion in the World Cup squad. Swift is also a frequent topic on Arsenal Women’s official TikTok, with players asked to choose their favourite albums and songs. “When I was growing up, football fans and music fans were two very separate types of people,” says Oli, 26, a Swiftie of 16 years who follows Manchester City’s men’s and women’s teams. “But now I think — and social media really helped in this — it has merged. Fan culture has infiltrated sport in a way that we’ve never seen before.” Advertisement Women’s football culture, he says, “comes heavily from pop culture and Stan culture and that level of fandom”. The chronically online strand of WSL fandom has its own in-jokes, narratives, heroes and villains; some fans are as likely to root for individual players as they are clubs; a good portion of the rivalry between the former Arsenal and Chelsea managers, Jonas Eidevall and Emma Hayes, was stoked online and was the first of its kind in women’s football. The anger preceding Eidevall’s Arsenal departure — including ‘Jonas Out’ graffiti and a fan displaying a cardboard P45 at a match — felt like new territory, tonally, for the women’s game and something more in keeping with men’s football. There were parallels, though, with the pop Stan culture of the 2010s, when fandoms — from Directioners to KatyCats to Beliebers and Arianators — warred with each other online. “In pop culture — and I think it’s bled into football, especially women’s football — we have become a little bit more defensive of the things that we like when people attack them,” continues Oli. “I would argue the Swifties were the start of that.” Much of the online Swiftie presence is devoted to dissecting her lyrics and ‘Easter Eggs’, the hidden messages laced through Swift’s lyrics, social media posts and iconography. “There are so many storylines built into her music,” says Swiftie and Arsenal fan Laura, 32. “It’s very easy to buy into as a consumer, particularly with how she positions herself with all of her ex-boyfriends. Even if it’s made up, it’s a personal connection. I think one thing that is probably missing for women’s football, just because it’s not had the time to develop, is the heroes and villains of the game. In men’s football, in terms of the personal connection, there are teams you hate or players you love. That’s something she plays on quite well.” “Taylor Swift teaches fans about her backstory and with the eggs, she’s communicating with them and is cultivating a long-term fandom that is showing up,” Doucet adds. “Our insights would suggest the free fan is more attracted to the players’ personalities and they’re learning about the technical side. Our job is to make sure that, no matter who you are, you can find women’s football and you can find something for you. Hopefully, you can convert more people to become a core fan. Ultimately the success of any league is to have as many core fans as possible.” Helpfully, Swift’s impact on the NFL, via her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, provides a recent case study. The NFL had been making efforts to attract greater numbers of female fans, but Swift’s attendance at matches supercharged everything. Prior to Super Bowl LVIII, U.S. brand consulting and analytics firm Apex Marketing Group calculated that Swift had generated $331.5m in equivalent brand value — how much they would have had to spend for the same level of exposure — for the Chiefs and the NFL. Super Bowl LVIII’s record 123.7million average viewers was widely attributed to the 24 per cent leap in engagement from 18 to 24-year-old women. All in all, the NFL enjoyed its highest regular-season female viewership since its records began. Perhaps the NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, put it best: “People are talking about the game that weren’t talking about the game yesterday,” he said. “And whatever that reason is, I’m good with it.” The caveat, of course, is that the NFL had the actual Taylor Swift to draw eyeballs. More significantly, Swift also has engaged little with women’s sport despite, at several points in her career, positioning some strands of feminism as central to her brand identity. Advertisement Swift’s role in the sphere is different to, for instance, the actress Natalie Portman, who leads the majority-female ownership group behind NWSL side Angel City. Swift has not publicly backed Wrexham AFC Women, who have a sponsorship deal in place with the beverage company owned by Swift’s close friend Blake Lively (Swift is godmother to Lively and Wrexham co-owner Ryan Reynolds’ three daughters). Since dating Kelce, Swift has enjoyed a friendship with Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany Mahomes (a former soccer player turned fitness influencer), who both own stakes in the NWSL team Kansas City Current — but she has not been seen at their matches. She is under no obligation to but it’s a point worth noting, at least in a narrative sense, when positioning Swift as crucial to the growth of women’s sport. Her absence becomes more glaring when contrasted with her presence at men’s sporting events such as the U.S. Open in September, where she made headlines for dancing alongside Kelce. Still, Swift’s involvement has precipitated an important shift in how sports executives think about their audiences: here is an audience you have overlooked and underserved but that is primed to follow sport. Even if those women do not remain lifelong fans of the NFL, Swift has triggered a conversational shift in sports boardrooms. The designer behind Swift’s viral Chiefs puffer coat, for example, now has a merchandising deal with the NFL. Swift’s gameday wardrobe sparked conversations over team apparel for women. “We often talk about the power of the female economy and that, for a long time, men’s sport hasn’t even spoken to women — never mind women’s sport being a space which is opening a new market,” says Jenny Mitton, a managing partner at M&C Saatchi Sport & Entertainment. Mitton and her team have included Swift in their discussions with chief marketing officers and key decision-makers to underscore the commercial opportunity in women’s sports. “Because (women’s sport) is new, we don’t have anything to compare it to,” she explains. “The product on the pitch is the same, but everything around it is different to men’s sport. The closest thing we probably have is how we’ve seen the same tactics and the same audience react and behave to the likes of Taylor Swift. That’s probably the closest model we can compare with in terms of showing there’s an opportunity. You can’t really go: ‘Look at men’s sport — we can get here some day’, because actually it’s a different audience. We’re deploying different tactics. Probably, the most like-for-like comparison is with role models and icons like Taylor.” Since its inception, the WSL, broadly speaking, operated on the assumption that existing fans of a men’s football team would naturally want to watch the club’s women’s side. Clubs focused their marketing on pulling both together. The Women’s Euros proved a turning point when sales figures revealed that 75 per cent of general ticket purchases were made by fans previously unknown to the FA and European football’s governing body UEFA. “That was the first time we were like: ‘OK — maybe it’s not just the men’s fans we need to go after’,” says Mitton. “The low-hanging fruit is this audience we’ve never spoken to before who probably think football isn’t for them. Actually, it is.” Advertisement Doucet has spoken at length with fans who have found, in women’s football, a community that feels safer and more inclusive than men’s football. Like Doucet, Amelia, 26, a fan of Fulham men, the Lionesses and Lewes Women, found similarities between the Eras tour audience and the Lionesses crowd. Both felt like inclusive spaces for women and girls, where their dreams and inner lives were respected. “Whenever I think of a women’s football match, I always feel quite safe and I really enjoy being around all the women who enjoy the same things as me,” she says. “It can be hard, as a woman, to feel like you can enjoy something without being ridiculed. One of the similarities between Swifties at the concert and women who enjoy women’s football matches is reclaiming it as your hobby and unapologetically enjoying it.” Food for thought, then, for the key movers and shakers at board level in women’s football. Fandom will always carve out its own identity beyond their interventions but over the next few years those at the top will make winning more fans a priority. Plainly, Swift will not do all their work for them. Her very white fanbase will not, for example, solve the game’s well-documented issues with diversity, but significantly she has stakeholders looking beyond the white, male model of sport fandom. A 2024 study by Snapchat found that 47 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds believe the world of traditional sports fandom is inaccessible to them unless they meet certain criteria; men’s football is infamous for demanding its female fans prove their credentials. In that vacuum, women’s football has an opportunity to expand. None of that should be to the detriment of hardcore fans of women’s football. Equally, there is nothing to stop Swifties from following men’s football should they choose to. “I totally understand why core fans are like: ‘Don’t change this world. I love it. I love football. Don’t bring in friendship bracelets’,” concludes Mitton. “But if we don’t talk to audiences in different ways and show people who have probably never been served football, how are we going to grow that base? For these sports to thrive and survive, we need to bring these new audiences in.” “We are trying to listen as best we can to continue to make good decisions for the league and to help,” adds Doucet. “I think you have a core fan who is really educated, but probably a little bit nervous about change because everybody believes there’s something super special about women’s football. We do, too. I cannot overemphasise the importance of the fan insights: any decision we will make is made on informed insight. We’re constantly talking, learning and evolving as the fan, the broader market and the industry evolves.” (Top photos: Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The period since December has been very different from his early days at the club. The 28-year-old has been one of United’s best players this season, the caveat of course being that the team have struggled in outfield areas, which naturally shines a light on a side’s goalkeeper. Advertisement The Cameroon international has pulled out some ‘Wow’ moments which have spared United’s blushes: the penalty save in the 3-0 win at Southampton which was a decisive moment with the game goalless at the time, the double-save against Crystal Palace a week later that kept his team in the game as they went on to take an away point, another double-save in the 1-1 draw with Fenerbahce in Istanbul and, most recently, an excellent point-blank parry against Ipswich Town’s Liam Delap in Sunday’s stalemate at Portman Road. Onana also felt he could have saved Omari Hutchinson’s equaliser in the latter match had the shot not taken a deflection off United defender Noussair Mazraoui. Despite the flashy acrobatics which showed off his individual prowess, when speaking to club channel MUTV, Onana picked the Southampton penalty stop as his best save so far in a United shirt because it was the turning point for the team in the game. Matthijs de Ligt opened the scoring just two minutes later. But it has not always been so rosy for Onana. His first five months in Manchester after signing from Italy’s Inter were not easy, as has been well documented. In his first appearance, in pre-season against French side Lens, he was beaten from the halfway line at Old Trafford. It was a poor goal to concede, when all eyes were on him. Sources close to Onana say from that point on he struggled to regain his confidence. In one training session, a United youth player said: “Are you going to save one or what?”. This time last year, Onana was at one of his lowest points as a United player. Away against Galatasaray in the Champions League, Hakim Ziyech had caught him out from two free kicks as United threw away a 3-1 lead to only draw the game. After, he stood alone on the pitch. Those mistakes, and the two dropped points, would later cost his team knockout-stage football. But Onana bounced back straight away and, according to the player’s inner circle, playing Newcastle away in early December, despite United losing 1-0, was a turning point. He told friends after the game that he was going to free himself from the shackles of doubt and prove himself. The biggest difference is psychological — say those who know the player well — and Onana is confident in his capabilities. He tells himself: “The mistake is next to me”. It is a way of rationalising that errors are inevitable and nobody is perfect, but he is now more prepared to handle those situations. Advertisement It is very difficult, however, to prepare for the scrutiny that comes with playing for United. Onana had won three league titles with Ajax in the Netherlands and later appeared on one of the biggest sporting stages of all in the 2022-23 Champions League final with Inter. But a few weeks after that match he had made the biggest move of his career for £43.8million ($55.5m), with a potential £3.4m more in add-ons, replacing David de Gea — who had left a lasting legacy — at the most global club in the game. There was expectation. And Onana was not used to receiving abuse online, being the subject of memes and receiving criticism in the press and on social media. GO DEEPER Manchester United's switches of play were the positive aspect of Amorim's first game in charge According to those close to the player, like many in this article wishing to remain anonymous to protect relations, United’s manager at the time Erik ten Hag was key to getting Onana back on track. He backed his No 1 and constantly reminded the player that he had proved he was a top goalkeeper when playing for Ajax (where they had worked together) and Inter. He had started slowly with those clubs too, but improved once he got to know his team-mates. Onana felt that even if he made another mistake, he had the manager’s support. They say a happy person makes for a happy player and Onana has now settled into his environment in Manchester. “He knows how the club and his team-mates work,” says former professional goalkeeper and now The Athletic analyst, Matt Pyzdrowski. “That naturally, as a goalkeeper, gives you more confidence.” Pyzdrowski has noted Onana has been more consistent with his positioning in goal and his set position with his hands. “They are in sync almost the whole time,” he says. “Last year, he wasn’t always in sync, sometimes the set position was a little bit too low. Now he has much more of a neutral position. His hand placement has really helped improve that. It’s much easier for him to make the decision whether he’s going (to try to make a save) with one or two hands. He’s always been a good shot-stopper, the question mark has been consistency.” Twelve games into the season, Onana leads the Premier League in the expected goals on target prevented (xGOT) metric. This is an accurate way to measure goalkeeper performance, comparing how many goals they have actually conceded and the number they were expected to allow. The higher the goals-prevented number, the better the shot-stopping performance. Advertisement Onana would have been expected to concede 17.5 goals based on the quality of shots he’s faced but his shot-stopping ability has kept that number down to 13. His goals-prevented rate is also the league’s best. This is a metric that adjusts for how busy a goalkeeper is, suggesting he is conceding a goal for approximately every 1.3 xGOT faced.  Onana was solid in this regard over the course of last season too, preventing 3.8 goals more than expected and finishing fourth among all Premier League goalkeepers for that metric. But why would such intricate details such as footwork and set position be affected by matters away from the actual football? “You start to overthink,” says Pyzdrowski. “When you don’t feel comfortable off the pitch, you just naturally don’t feel comfortable on it. “Players train throughout their lives, focusing on all the details so when you get to gameday, it’s just second nature. You just do it as opposed to thinking, ‘Do I stay or go? Last time I made a mistake when I did this, maybe I shouldn’t do it next time’. These are all the thoughts that come into your head when you’re not comfortable or you’ve been making mistakes.” People familiar with the dressing-room environment say Onana has got on well with his string of United goalkeeping coaches, all of whom have been different characters: Richard Hartis was old school, Dutchman Jelle ten Rouwelaar light-hearted and focused on fun, and now it is the charismatic 63-year-old Jorge Vital from Portugal. It is testament to Onana that he’s built a rapport with each of them. GO DEEPER Ruben Amorim's backroom staff: Who they are and what they do Even though they have only had a handful of training sessions together so far and Vital has changed Onana’s routine, the United No 1 is happy to adapt and feels he has a good connection with his new position coach.  “It affects you,” says Pyzdrowski, when asked about changes in routine. “That’s the guy you’re working with every single day who should be pushing and giving you confidence. The relationship between the goalkeeping coach and goalkeeper is even more important than that of the head coach and goalkeeper. If you don’t have that relationship with your goalkeeper coach, you feel even more isolated than you already do as a goalkeeper. Advertisement “It comes down to comfort. Routine happens off the field: sleep, nutrition, family, all that stuff impacts the player on the field. We are starting to see him shine, he’s been able to step out of the shadow and show that he can be the guy.” That guy, according to those at United, is a very personable, smiley figure around the club’s Carrington training ground. Onana is now an important member of the dressing room. He is multilingual — speaking English, Spanish, French, Italian and Ewondo (a regional Cameroonian language) — and that helps knit the squad together, and he sees himself as a future captain. When times are tough, some players may take the earliest opportunity to go home but Onana has never shot out of Carrington. He always eats on-site, often staying there until mid-afternoon, and has never shirked responsibility from his club duties, even going so far as having a brief spontaneous chat on the phone in French with The Athletic while this article was being formed. That is a small glimpse into the person who has visited the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital to donate United-designed hospital gowns and the club’s foundation’s Street Reds training sessions for local children. On Tuesday, Onana received the FIFPRO Impact award for his humanitarian work in Cameroon and other African countries, where his charitable foundation provides free medical care to underprivileged communities. A new head coach with a new style of play and new demands will test Onana once again. If his team-mates struggle to adjust to Ruben Amorim’s methods, there will be more pressure on their goalkeeper to deliver. Onana, however, believes he is in his best form since joining the club and there is still more to come.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Wizards already have reached inflection point: 'This much adversity early stinks',https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5954533/2024/11/28/washington-wizards-losing-streak/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 11:15:40 GMT",Washington has lost 13 consecutive games. Can its players emerge with their spirit intact?,"NBA WASHINGTON — This is miserable basketball. Every time the Washington Wizards step on the court, they face disadvantages. In experience. In talent. In what’s at stake. And it shows in the results. The Wizards lost their 13th consecutive game Wednesday night. They got steamrolled yet again. The LA Clippers routed them 121-96 at Capital One Arena. Advertisement Even in a season in which the Wizards’ roster and playing-time decisions have been thoughtfully designed to maximize their hopes in the critical draft lottery, they already have reached an inflection point. “All it takes is one thing to bring everything together,” guard Jordan Poole said. “But moments like this really show who loves the game, who wants to continue to work, who wants to continue to find ways to get better, who wants to get in the lab, who wants to watch film. So, it definitely tests your character, but we’ve got really good guys in that locker room.” True, Washington has really good guys in its locker room. But even good people are imperfect. Losing is corrosive, especially this level of losing. Lots of teams in NBA history have done what the Wizards are doing — playing for lottery odds and calling it “player development” — and many of those teams have hindered their young players’ growth in the process. Let’s make this clear: In rebuilding, in racing to the bottom of the league standings, the Wizards are doing what they must do in search of a brighter future. In the NBA, a team simply must have at least one star to contend (and preferably, two stars or more). The best way for Washington to bring aboard high-level talent is through the draft. If the Wizards finish with the league’s worst record, they would still be unlikely to win the top pick and have the right to draft Cooper Flagg or Ace Bailey. But having the worst record at least would ensure they would receive no worse than the fifth pick. At 2-15, Washington is where it needs to be. It’s the league’s worst record. Still, that race-to-the-bottom approach often creates collateral damage. Can Bub Carrington, Bilal Coulibaly, Kyshawn George and Alex Sarr emerge unscathed from all this losing and keep growing? Advertisement “To me, we don’t really have a choice,” George said as he sat at his locker after Wednesday’s loss. “It’s too easy to just give up, and you lean on the people that are around you. I think we have a great group of guys as persons that hold each other accountable. We’re all working toward the same goal — the players and the coaching staff and the whole organization. So, it’s too easy to just say, ‘OK, this is what it is, and we’re not going to get better.’” The Wizards have guardrails in place. The basketball operations department tracks players’ individual progress in excruciating detail and, every 10- and 25-game period, meets with each player to see if he is fulfilling the goals that have been set for him. Hey, it’s not holding someone accountable in the same way that winning and losing games holds people accountable. But it is something. There are also legit, well-respected veterans on the team, a group headed by 31-year-old Malcolm Brogdon and 32-year-old Jonas Valančiūnas. After Tuesday night’s 127-108 loss to the Chicago Bulls, Brogdon told a few of his Wizards teammates something Nate McMillan, his former coach in Indiana, used to say. When times got tough, McMillan would remind his players they needed to “believe” in themselves and believe they would win soon. Brogdon tends to pick his spots to offer words of wisdom to younger players. Do it too often and you run the risk of being tuned out. Tuesday, however, Brogdon thought he needed to say something because too often he has seen the Wizards start games well but begin to hang their heads the moment an opponent goes on a run. Then everything snowballs. Wednesday was one of those nights when everything escalated. Washington trailed by 17 at halftime and 33 midway through the fourth quarter. It didn’t help that Kyle Kuzma left the game late in the first quarter because of a sprained left rib and didn’t return. Even though Kuzma has not played to his standards this season, he’s one of the few guys on the team who can generate a bucket for himself and take some of the pressure to execute off the youngsters. Advertisement Much has been made recently about the Wizards’ effort, but that’s been overblown to some extent. Yes, there have been a few times when the effort was subpar, namely the Nov. 18 loss to the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden, when the Wizards lost 134-106. The truth is coach Brian Keefe is playing so many youngsters so heavily — and so heavily simultaneously — that it’s not realistic to expect the team to play with any level of consistency. Carrington and Sarr are only 19. Coulibaly and George are just 20. They’re talented players, but they’re also supremely inexperienced. They’re going to make mistakes. Wednesday night, for instance, the trio of Coulibaly, Sarr and George played 14 minutes together, and during that stretch, the Clippers outscored the Wizards by 23 points. The concern is not just that Washington is losing. It’s how badly it’s losing. Wednesday marked the 10th time in 15 defeats that the Wizards have lost by at least 15 points. “It’s still really, really early, but to run into this much adversity early stinks — and stings,” swingman Corey Kispert said. “It’s testing the culture that we put in, the deposits that we’ve implemented. But there’s still a lot of positivity within the room, and there’s still a lot of encouragement and positive attitudes within the room, as well. So, while things are tough, they’re not toxic and not unbearable.” Still, with games upcoming against the Milwaukee Bucks, Cleveland Cavaliers, Dallas Mavericks, Denver Nuggets and Memphis Grizzlies, it’s difficult to envision the Wizards winning anytime soon. This is likely to get worse before it gets better. Poole offered the best perspective of the night. From 1995 to 2012, the Warriors were pretty much an afterthought outside of the Bay Area. But once the team brought aboard Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green and kept Curry healthy, Golden State wound up winning four NBA titles. Advertisement The effort to draft the next Curry, Thompson or Green is why Washington is rebuilding and enduring so much pain. “Every organization has to go through tough times in order to figure out what the good times are like, if that makes sense,” Poole said. “We’ve got to figure it out. We’re building a foundation. We’re laying pieces. It’s not supposed to be easy.” In other words, the Wizards are taking their medicine, and that medicine is going to leave an awful taste in their mouths. Mired in a terrible stretch and with more adversity likely to follow, can they emerge with their spirit intact?

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Putting the NFC North's dominance in context: Best division since realignment?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5952981/2024/11/28/lions-bears-packers-vikings-nfc-north/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 11:00:31 GMT","The Lions, Vikings, Packers and Bears have combined to beat non-divisional foes by 9.5 points per game, easily the best since 2002.","NFL The NFL’s Thanksgiving schedule delivers three-fourths of what could become the most dominant division since the league realigned in 2002. The 2024 NFC North is the first division since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger to feature three teams with at least eight victories through Week 12, led by the 10-1 Detroit Lions, who have tied an all-time NFL mark for most victories in a season by at least 38 points (three, all outside the division). Advertisement With the Lions facing the division-rival Chicago Bears (4-7) in the early game Thursday before the 8-3 Green Bay Packers play the late game against the AFC East’s Miami Dolphins, the 2024 NFC North — which also includes the 9-2 Minnesota Vikings — stands apart. It could well decide who takes home the Lombardi Trophy. The Lions (+260), Packers (+750) and Vikings (+850) are among the top seven in Super Bowl odds, per BetMGM, and the top four in odds to win the NFC, along with the Philadelphia Eagles (+325). The Lions remain Super Bowl favorites, comfortably ahead of the Kansas City Chiefs (+450), while the NFC North has the shortest odds to produce the champion at +175, half of the second-place AFC West (+350). GO DEEPER Jared Goff hit rock bottom. A conversation with Dan Campbell ignited his unlikely comeback The chart below shows where all eight divisions have ranked each season since the league realigned in 2002 in point margin per game (X-axis) and win rate (Y-axis) in non-divisional games through the first 12 weeks of each season. The 2024 NFC North (red dot) ranks first among these 184 divisional seasons in average point margin (+9.5) and second in win rate (.765), per TruMedia. Only the 2022 NFC East (26-7) had a better record than the 2024 NFC North (26-8) in non-division games through Week 12, but the current NFC North had a far better average point margin (+9.5 to +5.1) in these games. Here’s what you need to know about where the NFC North stands and what it must do to become the most dominant division over a full season since realignment. The scheduling rotation (which we’ll explore later) is part of the equation, but this level of dominance is extreme. AFC North teams lead the way in total victories over opponents who currently have winning records (11) and total non-divisional victories in these games (nine). The NFC North is second with eight and six. Since 2002, the NFC North’s +323 point margin ranks first by 64 points over the runner-up 2013 NFC West (+259) through Week 12. That is larger than the difference between the 2013 NFC West and the sixth-ranked division in that span, the 2011 NFC North (+200). The table below shows the only divisions since 2002 with PPG margins greater than 7.0 through Week 12, led by the 2024 NFC North. The 2024 NFC North ranks first among 184 divisions since 2002 in defensive EPA per play against non-division opponents, compared to a No. 69 ranking in offensive EPA per play. All four NFC North teams rank among the NFL’s top 10 in defensive EPA per play across all games this season. They are all in the top five when isolating non-divisional games only. The Lions and Packers also rank among the top 10 on offense across all games and in non-division games. GO DEEPER Vikings, Packers coaches make the NFC North the NFL’s best division: Sando’s Pick Six NFC North teams are 8-0 with a +144 differential against the Jacksonville Jaguars and Tennessee Titans. They are 14-2 with a +197 differential against the full AFC South. Bad teams get blown out. The NFC North has played its share of them. Forty-five percent of the +323 differential in non-division games stems from facing the Jaguars and Titans, while 61 percent stems from facing the AFC South overall. The six other divisions are a combined 9-9 against the AFC South, with a +14 differential. That includes a 6-7 mark with a +21 differential for AFC East teams. Advertisement The Bears are the only NFC North team without a victory over a team that currently has a winning record. They are 0-3 in those matchups, headlined by their defeat at Washington on a Jayden Daniels Hail Mary. The rest of the NFC North has a 6-1 record in those games, with three victories over Houston, two over Arizona and one over Seattle. The NFC North’s record would be 6-3 if we adjusted the parameters to feature non-divisional games against teams that had winning records at kickoff. Victories over Dallas, San Francisco and Tampa Bay would come into play. The NFL pushes most division games later in the season for competitive reasons. That leaves only 10 remaining non-division games for the NFC North to build upon its dominance or fall in the rankings. Those games are listed below chronologically and with point spreads pulled together from various sources where available. The 2013 NFC North holds the full-season record for PPG margin against non-divisional opponents since realignment (+359 in 40 games, for 8.975 per game). That division featured the 13-3 Super Bowl champion Seahawks, the Jim Harbaugh-coached 49ers (12-4), the Bruce Arians-coached Cardinals (10-6) and the 7-9 Rams. NFC North teams must outscore their 10 remaining non-divisional opponents by 72 points to beat the 2013 NFC West for the best full-season differential since 2002. That would leave the division +395 in 44 games for a +8.977 PPG differential. The best full-season record against non-divisional opponents since 2002 is shared by the 2013 NFC West and the 2007 NFC South at 30-10 (.750). The NFC North (currently .765 at 26-8) would equal that mark with a 7-3 finish against foes outside the division. Advertisement The best team in the NFC North (Detroit) will be at home for the division’s toughest remaining opponent (Buffalo). The Seahawks’ recent improvement on defense could complicate efforts for Chicago, Minnesota and Green Bay to win at Seattle. The 49ers’ decline could help Chicago (Week 14) and Detroit (Week 17). Green Bay and Minnesota can set the tone in Week 13. Both are favored at home against non-division opponents.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Another Maple Leafs forward injury means more changes are coming up front,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5954497/2024/11/28/maple-leafs-injuries-mcmann-berube-panthers/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 11:00:21 GMT","Bobby McMann left the second period of the Leafs' loss to the Panthers, putting coach Craig Berube into yet another quandary.","NHL SUNRISE, Fla. — Mitch Marner exhaled and said out loud what so many within the Toronto Maple Leafs organization were probably thinking. “We’re missing half our team up front, man,” Marner said when asked what his ailing Leafs team must do to score more at five-on-five. The score in the Leafs’ 5-1 loss to the Florida Panthers made the game seem far more lopsided than it was. If the Leafs had iced a lineup they hope will be ready to face teams like the Panthers in the playoffs, a 5-1 loss might have alarm bells ringing. Advertisement Instead, six regular forwards are injured, another is out suspended and one left the game against the Panthers with a new injury. Not cause for complete panic, but the loss will likely force head coach Craig Berube to re-jig his forward group once again. Because what was missing against the Panthers was what’s been missing throughout their entire nine-game stretch without reigning Rocket Richard Trophy winner Auston Matthews, still out with a mysterious injury: five-on-five scoring. The Leafs’ lone goal against the Panthers came on the power play via a spectacular unassisted solo effort from Marner. Since Matthews last played on Nov. 3, the Leafs now have the dubious distinction of sitting last in the NHL in five-on-five goals: just nine over those nine games. And so between injuries and their inability to score at even strength, the Leafs’ loss to the Panthers felt like it was coming. Entering Wednesday’s game against the Panthers, the Leafs were 7-1 without Matthews this season. That’s a respectable run without their best player; admirable, really, when you consider the other forwards the Leafs had lost. But only three of those seven wins came against teams clearly in a playoff spot. Three more came against sub-.500 teams. That’s not meant to diminish their results. But when up against a difficult Panthers team, the Leafs’ continued injuries simply caught up with them. And now the Leafs can add Bobby McMann to their list of players nursing wounds. The left winger was on a decent run of form playing on a new-look top line with John Tavares and Marner. But McMann did not return to the game for the second period with what the Leafs are calling a lower-body injury. rough night for McMann could be a combination of things, he also fell during his last shift of the game off a defensive zone draw pic.twitter.com/OhnbrrSZNQ — Omar (@TicTacTOmar) November 28, 2024  McMann was seen briefly postgame without a walking boot or crutches. “It’s day to day right now,” Berube said of McMann’s injury. “We’re going to have to see tomorrow how he is. But he wasn’t able to continue to play tonight.” And so with McMann questionable at best, but with Berube sounding hopeful he’ll get some of his injured forwards back in the lineup, what’s clear is that the Leafs’ forward group could look very different — once again — against the Tampa Bay Lightning on Saturday. Advertisement With Matthews possibly returning, should Berube split up the duo of Marner and Tavares? There’s rarely any doubt about the chemistry Marner and Matthews can provide. But it’s been Marner and Tavares who have been combining well to do much of the heavy lifting on offence lately. That decision could have a trickle-down effect. Will Berube quickly return to his go-to first line with Matthew Knies on the left side of Matthews and Marner for heavy minutes? That could be seen as a risk considering both Matthews and Knies are returning from respective injuries. Would Berube want to continue to keep William Nylander without a proven offensive player nearby? The line of Nylander, Pontus Holmberg and Nick Robertson generated the most shot attempts (12) and scoring chances (5) of any line at five-on-five against the Panthers. None of those attempts found the back of the net, however. Berube tried playing Marner, Tavares and William Nylander together for 3:25 of five-on-five time against the Panthers. They generated just one scoring chance. The loss of McMann means yet another left winger could be out of the lineup. And so theoretically, that should mean more ice time for Robertson, right? But how many more prime opportunities will Berube want to give a player who has scored just once in 19 games this season? Robertson has been playing well lately, but Berube needs him to produce. What kind of role Berube gives Robertson in another impending shake-up could be telling. What about relying heavily on vibes and trying William and Alex Nylander for more than a few shifts together on a line? The younger Nylander is still figuring things out with the Leafs (more on that in a bit) and neither is known for producing the kind of ugly goals Berube desires. But there’s also a clear joy the two have playing together. That kind of spark alone might lead to a fire. Advertisement We’re getting to the point where even-strength scoring has been so hard to come by that no idea should be written off. Expect the Leafs’ next practice on Friday to present some intriguing line combinations. Because after the game, Berube himself sounded exasperated at the Leafs’ lack of five-on-five scoring as of late. “I think that we can do a better job of getting to the net front and creating more opportunities around the net and scoring some greasy goals around the net. I don’t think that we’re hard enough around the net. I don’t think that we’re working hard enough to get to the net,” Berube said. “We’re not making it difficult enough on the goalie and creating second, third opportunities around the net. A lot of times that’s the way you’ve got to score goals five-on-five.” The Leafs might get two players who can score those types of goals back in the lineup Saturday in Matthews and Knies. And that’s a good thing for a Leafs team that came out of Wednesday night with questions about a number of players vying for roster spots for the short-term future. This is not the forward group anyone, much less Berube, thought they’d have for crucial games against Atlantic Division rivals. Nikita Grebenkin took an unnecessary boarding penalty early in the first period. The Panthers capitalized with a power-play goal a little over a minute later. There’s evident energy in his game but there’s just as evident a need for that game to mature. Alex Nylander was demoted from the first power-play unit just as quickly as he arrived. The winger saw his ice time diminish period after period against the Panthers. Berube sent Nylander over the boards for just four shifts in the third period as the Leafs were clearly trying to score and get back in the game. Alex Steeves was one of five Leafs forwards without a shot against the Panthers. Advertisement Fraser Minten won 50 percent of his faceoffs and spent time on both the power play and the penalty kill. He’s clearly finding his way at the NHL level but was also on the ice for three Panthers goals. Minten is going to be a full-time NHLer soon enough. Considering he came into this season with the goal of learning how to produce more at the AHL level, leaning on him to score in the NHL is a big ask. No other Marlies forwards currently justify a call-up to try and generate more offence, either. “Maybe we don’t have the finishers and I get that side of it too,” Berube said. “But I’m not going to focus on that. I’m focused on what we have in the lineup and how we need to play to generate chances and score goals.” What Berube has is a forward group he’s still trying to figure out. The Leafs coach is in a situation he couldn’t have prepared for. So as the coaching staff prepare to head west across the state of Florida, they’re likely feeling less frustration after a loss and more pressure to figure out how to put the pieces of a brand-new puzzle together very quickly.

Manchester United Supporters Trust (MUST), the Fan Advisory Board (FAB) and the Fans Forum are applying pressure to United’s football leadership in a bid to provoke a U-turn on the policy to increase the price of seats for the remaining games at Old Trafford to £66 each. Advertisement The groups call the hikes, which were announced on Tuesday night without consultation, a “scandalous” way to treat younger fans, who will not be granted concessionary discounts in the new system. The letter sent to Berrada also emphasises how making the changes unilaterally “undermines the integrity” of the club’s fan engagement policy, which is a requirement of Premier League regulations. The price rises, which will affect everyone who wants to buy a home ticket from now until the end of this season, are the result of Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s determination to raise revenue to comply with financial rules. But MUST claims the move will generate “meagre returns” that add “insult to injury” to real cost for under-16s. Berrada was appointed chief executive by Ratcliffe this year, starting work officially in July. Dear Omar, We write on behalf of the members of the Fans’ Forum, Fans’ Advisory Board and the Board and Committee of MUST, to protest in the strongest possible terms to the ticket price changes announced on 26 November. These changes are a disgrace, both in their substance and in how the club has gone about making them. First, you are making changes to ticket prices mid-season, with immediate effect. This has never happened before. Secondly, the scale of the increase to individual fans is at a level never seen before — as much as a 40% increase for adults and 164% for kids. The worst aspect of this is the removal of discounts for children and seniors. A U16 ticket costing £25 in one of the ends is now £66. A parent taking their child will now pay £132, around double the current price. Surely we can all agree that youngsters going to the game with their parents are the future of the Club? And yet, scandalously, it is this very group that will suffer the biggest increases of all. Furthermore, it is of great concern that the Club has taken this approach to concessionary tickets and the way these policy changes have been communicated, bearing in mind the Premier League Rules that surround these issues. Thirdly, this increase in ticket prices will indisputably have an impact on the 15/19 Usage rules. Your conditions state that in order for a resold ticket to be counted as used, the Club must be able to re-sell it. Did the Club do any analysis of how price increases would impact take-up for these spare tickets? This is a direct change to Season Ticket policy mid-season which surely has not been explored in terms of its impact. Is it the Club’s intention to penalise Season Ticket Holders who, despite trying to comply, fall afoul of the Usage Rules? Finally, with the ink barely dry on your recently published Fan Engagement Strategy and despite a consultation protocol agreed in discussions with FAB and MUST (one that explicitly addressed matters of ticketing), the Club made this decision without any consultation whatsoever. The manner in which this has been done completely undermines the integrity of the Club’s fan engagement processes. It adds insult to injury that such an unprecedented and controversial approach has been adopted notwithstanding the meagre returns this programme will yield. This is a clear-cut case of the cure being worse than the disease. Tickets are the access point for match going supporters. By exploiting them, you risk losing the goodwill and affinity which brings so much added value to the club, not just in support for the team but financially as well, both in terms of fans’ discretionary spend and also value for sponsors. The marginal gains in ticket revenue will be outweighed by the loss in these other areas. Compared with our main rivals, United has a proud tradition of fairer pricing, which in turn has helped to generate our huge loyal support over decades. Decisions like this one take this loyalty for granted and put it at risk. The Club’s announcement of these changes stated that you wish to engage with fans to discuss longer-term changes to tickets and prices. Such engagement can only take place in an environment of mutual trust — and that has been undermined this week. It is as if the Club has decided to set fan engagement back to the dark ages. That is unacceptable. There are three things we ask you to do now: We look forward to hearing from you as a matter of urgency. United say they will respond appropriately and insist the decision has been very difficult to reach. (Carl Recine/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,AFC North Whiparound: Which players are teams in the division most thankful for?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5953307/2024/11/28/ravens-bengals-browns-steelers-afc-north-week-13/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 10:30:45 GMT","Plus, how many wins will it take to win the division? And what's the current vibe surrounding each of the four teams?","NFL By Mike DeFabo, Jeff Zrebiec, Paul Dehner Jr. and Zac Jackson Each week during the regular season and occasionally during the offseason, our AFC North writers gather for a roundtable discussion on trending topics, the best players and the biggest factors in determining which teams can survive this division. Here’s our Week 13 Thanksgiving edition. Advertisement We’re not afraid of a cheesy holiday theme here at Whiparound Headquarters. With that in mind, is the team you cover extra thankful for a certain player or group of players? Or would you rather call out a bunch of turkeys for derailing things? Mike DeFabo (Pittsburgh Steelers): When the Steelers signed safety DeShon Elliott in free agency and traded for cornerback Donte Jackson, it was easy for those moves to go under the radar. But as the season has unfolded, Elliott and Jackson have proven to be significant upgrades, rounding out the defense in a meaningful way. Jackson leads the Steelers with four interceptions, matching a career high, and has been an upgrade over a 33-year-old Patrick Peterson. Meanwhile, Elliott has been the Steelers’ most impactful safety. He’s second on the team with 72 tackles and has forced two fumbles, recovered three and intercepted a pass. While the stars often get the credit, these two new defensive backs are a big reason Pittsburgh’s defense ranks fourth in points allowed per game (16.9). The Steelers have gone from a good defense with a few great players to a well-rounded unit without an obvious weak spot. Jeff Zrebiec (Baltimore Ravens): I’d love to get cute and creative here, but that wouldn’t be playing to my strengths. And really, how can you say anything other than the Ravens are thankful they have Lamar Jackson on their side? He’s a two-time MVP in the middle of the best season of his career, and his play in Pittsburgh was a blip. We’re in Week 13, and Jackson leads the NFL in passing yards and passer rating, and he’s tied for first in touchdown passes. He also leads all quarterbacks with 599 rushing yards. His touchdown-to-interception ratio is 27 to 3, and all three of his picks should have been caught by the intended receiver. Jackson is in the unenviable position where nothing he does in the regular season is going to matter much to his critics. He’ll again be judged by his postseason performance. The Ravens are thankful for the growth, maturity and consistency their star quarterback has shown this season. Paul Dehner Jr. (Cincinnati Bengals): Never miss a chance to give thanks for Joe Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase. Watching these two work weekly is the epitome of excitement in the NFL. The Bengals will pay that price of admission to Chase next offseason, but even as the sky is falling with turkeys around them like it’s the “WKRP in Cincinnati” turkey drop, they’re arguably the best show going right now. GO DEEPER How Joe Burrow elevated his game and the Bengals offense with 2 improvements Zac Jackson (Cleveland Browns): For as turkey-ish as the Browns have been in what was billed as a glorious feast of a season, the current feeling has to be of disappointment. Had the Browns just made a quarterback change and acknowledged mistakes a couple of weeks earlier, they’d have a playoff pulse. They remain thankful for the likes of Myles Garrett, Denzel Ward and some others, but the focus is on crucial decisions in the months ahead — and Jameis Winston potentially continuing his redemption tour this season. In a big-picture sense, this thing can still go many different ways. Advertisement The Ravens and Steelers each have eight wins; Baltimore has five games left, and Pittsburgh has six. How many is it going to take to win the division? For the remaining optimists in Cincinnati, how many is it going to take to earn an AFC wild-card spot? DeFabo: The Steelers’ final six games are against the Bengals, Browns, Philadelphia Eagles, Ravens, Kansas City Chiefs and Bengals again. Let’s say for this exercise they split with the Bengals, avenge their loss to the Browns and lose to the Ravens in Baltimore. That gets the Steelers to 10 wins with a 3-3 divisional record. The Chiefs and Eagles are the other two games. A split there would be a best-case scenario and push the Steelers to about 11 wins. That might not be enough. Even if the Ravens lose to the Eagles this week and the Houston Texans on Christmas (which I’m not predicting), they’d still get to 11 wins if they can beat the New York Giants, Steelers and Browns. I’m predicting the Ravens to go 3-2 or 4-1 down the stretch. A 12-win season should be enough to win the division, and 11 wins could do it with tiebreakers. It’s starting to look like the Steelers will have to beat the Ravens again and/or sweep the Bengals if they want to win the AFC North. Zrebiec: If you get to 12 wins, I think that would be a lock. Given how many difficult games the Ravens and Steelers still have on their schedules, there’s probably a decent chance that 11-6 would be enough to finish atop the North. But I’m going to say the winner eventually finishes 12-5. As for the Bengals, I’ve thought all along that the last wild-card spot could be filled by a 9-8 team. However, the Denver Broncos winning two straight and the Miami Dolphins rattling off three in a row probably makes that less likely. I wouldn’t discount the 5-7 Indianapolis Colts either, even though they’ve stunk lately. Cincinnati’s remaining schedule isn’t rigorous. I don’t think the Los Angeles Chargers or Ravens/Steelers will come back to the pack enough, and I think either the Broncos or Dolphins finish with 10 wins, which would mean 9-8 isn’t cutting it for Zac Taylor’s Bengals.

 Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox. Dehner: Twelve wins the division. Baltimore and Pittsburgh are too good to think one of them doesn’t hit that mark. More than likely the winner of the second game between those two on Dec. 21 ends up the winner. As for the Bengals, even the most optimistic of fans dressing up in Bengals costumes every week have a tough time seeing them pull this off. They have to go 5-1, at minimum, and the loss can’t come to Denver. That would probably mean sweeping the Steelers. Jackson: As the guy who’s covered three playoff teams in 25 seasons, I’ll look up here and mostly just nod and agree. I think the Ravens will get to 12, and I think they’ll win the division. On a total gut feeling, I’ll guess that the Bengals end up missing the playoffs by one game as punishment for the number of games they gave away in the first half of the season. Whether it’s chasing a big trophy or just finishing with more wins than losses, what’s the current vibe on the team you cover? Do you feel a memorable and productive December coming? DeFabo: Memorable and productive aren’t the words I’d use. Physical. Taxing. Exhausting. Trying. Illuminating. Those are probably better adjectives for a home stretch full of AFC matchups, short weeks and Super Bowl contenders. The Steelers should make the playoffs, and if they can get through the three-games-in-11-days gauntlet healthy, they’ve got a shot to win their first playoff game since 2016. Whether the offense looks more like it did during the first three starts with Russell Wilson or the two recent outings will determine how much further they advance. GO DEEPER Seven stats to explain the Steelers' 7 touchdown-less quarters Zrebiec: Things were feeling pretty tenuous for the Ravens after they started a tough three-game stretch against the Steelers, Chargers and Eagles with a stinker in Pittsburgh. The Ravens looked tired and beat up, as you’d probably expect for a team with a Week 14 bye. The offense was starting to show some cracks after carrying the team for so long. Roquan Smith was hurt. There was a West Coast trip and a matchup with a hot team filled with ex-Ravens players and coaches. Baltimore fell behind 10-0 and then responded to get a nice road win. There’s a maturity about the Ravens where they understand it’s a week-to-week league. They’ve put themselves in a decent position, but their story will be told in January and possibly February. The players accept that. They also understand they need to play with more consistency and make fewer mistakes to get where they want to go. Advertisement Dehner: The ping-pong tables are back in the locker room! The international symbol for being juiceless and out of ideas. They are searching for ways to keep the energy up for this group. They’ve been in must-win mode all season and suffered one of the most soul-sucking strings of heartbreaking defeats you can dial up. Get out the paddles, but not for ping pong — these cats are on life support. Jackson: Considering they’ve defeated the Ravens and Steelers, the Browns’ current mood is fine. Last week’s win had some magical and memorable elements, but it leaves us to wonder (more) about the future of the team as a whole, Nick Chubb and the quarterback position. I think an important December is coming for several facets of the organization, but I can’t say that “memorable and productive” are probable outcomes. Maybe winning a couple more division games would change the overall mood. Weekend prediction time. Can the Bengals score a huge divisional win? Can the Browns play spoiler again? Will Ravens-Eagles be as good as advertised? DeFabo: Before the Steelers squared off against the Ravens, many were wondering if this would be the time the old AFC North rivalry would turn into a shootout. Instead, Pittsburgh once again proved it had Jackson’s number and somehow won another game without scoring a touchdown. I don’t think the Steelers can follow that same script here. Given the way Burrow is playing, Pittsburgh’s offense will face its biggest test to score points. Considering how the Steelers have fared in the red zone lately, I’m taking the Bengals in Cincinnati. The Ravens seem to lose games only against the Steelers or inferior opponents. The Eagles are neither of those. I like Baltimore in a thriller. Because the Browns already won their Super Bowl by beating the Steelers, I say they’ll return to mediocrity against the Broncos. GO DEEPER Some games mean more: The Week 13 matchups that will have biggest impact on playoff odds Zrebiec: I think I’ve picked the Bengals in just about every big game they’ve had this year, so at some point, they lose the benefit of the doubt. Taking Mike Tomlin’s team after a loss is always a safe proposition, so that’s what I’ll do in a game where I think a good number of points will be scored. I’m still not sold on the Broncos, but it seems like the Browns don’t have a whole lot of urgency when they’re not facing an AFC North opponent. I’ll take Denver in a close one. I’m not sure I’ve gotten more than three or four Ravens games right all year. When I take them to win, they lose. And vice versa. So Ravens fans will probably be happy to know that I think the Eagles will win Sunday. I think both offenses will come to play, but Philadelphia’s defense is much easier to trust than Baltimore’s. Dehner: The Bengals are the team that always finds a way to lose. They’re facing the Steelers, a team that always seems to find a way to win. Kings of the one-score loss versus kings of the one-score win. Outside of the wackiness of the NFL, this screams Steelers 24, Bengals 23. Elsewhere, the Browns come back to earth and the Eagles take advantage of the Baltimore defense just enough to squeeze out an instant classic between two heavyweights. Jackson: My inclination is to pick the Ravens to win big, but I’m a little hesitant about jumping in front of the Saquon Barkley train. So I’ll land in the middle and guess a big game-management error by Eagles coach Nick Sirianni helps the Ravens win, something like 24-21. I think the Browns will lose a bit of a low-scoring snoozer in Denver, and I think Burrow will go crazy in a big win for the Bengals.

The players have provided plenty of fuel this week. Monday was notable on the news front thanks to a trio of Auburn freshmen. Advertisement Linebacker DeMarcus Riddick kicked it off. On the Iron Bowl: “I will not lose to Bama while I’m here.” On quarterback Jalen Milroe: “He’s fast, but he’s not faster than me. He’s not getting out of that box this week.” On Crimson Tide freshman Ryan Williams: “He ain’t really nobody to me. Ryan Williams is himself. He ain’t no big-time player to me.” Here is the video of Riddick's comments from Monday's media availably.@abc3340 https://t.co/TSLeuC6JkX pic.twitter.com/jFUdBgWnw8 — Johnny Congdon (@congdonsation) November 25, 2024  Auburn wide receiver Cam Coleman on Saturday’s game: “Really a revenge tour. We’re going in their place, and we’re really just going to go into their crib and just take over and have fun while we’re doing it. This is going to be some of the last memories we make with each other, so let’s go make it a memorable game.” Then, finally, receiver Perry Thompson posted a picture on X of Auburn quarterback Payton Thorne’s stats next to Milroe’s. Thorne has more completions, passing yards and passing touchdowns. Tuesday, Alabama responded. “I don’t even know who that is,” Milroe said of Riddick. “But, I mean, let them talk. It’s a part of it.” Alabama safety Malachi Moore: “They’re gonna do stuff to put it out there and try to hype the game up. But the game is already hype. It’s the Iron Bowl. Can’t get no bigger than this. We’re gonna see Saturday.” As for Saturday’s game, there’s something to be had on both sides by winning: momentum. Alabama, through its disappointment, can end the regular season on a positive note. And who knows what can happen on the CFP front given the volatile nature of the sport this year? For Auburn, it’s a chance to reach a bowl game and validate the progress under Hugh Freeze. A loss for either? Panic, likely. Auburn ranks last in the SEC and 128th nationally in turnover margin at minus-11. In four of the Tigers’ six defeats, they have lost the turnover battle. Last Saturday, in the four-overtime win over Texas A&M, Auburn committed only one turnover and forced one. Advertisement Alabama, on the other hand, leads the SEC and ranks eighth nationally at plus-11 for the season. Last week, though, the Tide lost the turnover battle for only the second time in SEC play (both losses), with Milroe throwing three interceptions in the 24-3 loss at Oklahoma. Alabama’s defense recovered a fumble and has now forced at least one turnover in six straight games. Whichever team can create extra possessions — and then capitalize on it offensively — will put itself in the best position to win. The numbers suggest Alabama has the big edge. What’s to stop Auburn’s offense from copying and pasting what worked for Oklahoma, Tennessee and Vanderbilt in Alabama’s losses this season? In those three games, Alabama allowed an average of 4.3 yards per rush and 212 rushing yards per game while giving up 17 runs of 10 yards or more. And as with those three teams, Auburn has a dual-threat quarterback in Thorne who can execute a similar game plan. The Tigers also feature one of the league’s best running backs: Jarquez Hunter. If Alabama can stop the run and force Auburn into must-pass situations, there are opportunities to be had. However, Alabama had one combined sack (against Tennessee) in its three losses, due in large part because it didn’t force those teams into many third-and-long situations. This is a big moment for Alabama’s front seven given last week’s performance, and the challenge is amplified without Deontae Lawson. Jihaad Campbell, the team’s best pass rusher, will be rushing less and playing more inside backer in Lawson’s absence. Where will the pass rush come from? Alabama ranks 65th nationally with just 22 sacks. Finding a way to affect Thorne — on the ground first, then through the air — is critical to win. If there’s one thing Alabama and Auburn have in common it’s that their success is tied to quarterback play. At times, Thorne and Milroe have been really good — mostly in wins — but each has had backbreaking turnovers in losses. How each manages Saturday will be critical. Advertisement That said, each player is going to need help. Alabama’s coaching staff needs a bounce-back performance after Oklahoma, as do the skill players who had several drops and the offensive line that allowed nine tackles for loss. Auburn’s offense seems to be trending upward with the recent emergence of Coleman to complement receiver KeAndre Lambert-Smith. And Hunter is averaging 7.2 yards per carry in his last four games. What will Freeze scheme up for this game? And what’s the plan to get Milroe’s run game going? Auburn, like Oklahoma, has been good at stopping the run. Until last year, Alabama hadn’t had a senior class go undefeated against Auburn since 1981. This year’s group of 19 seniors (10 scholarships and nine walk-ons) hopes to remain unblemished against the Tigers. “We talked about it (Sunday) in the team meeting,” coach Kalen DeBoer said. “You can already feel leadership stepping up and really talking about what this game means to them, what this means to us, what it means to everyone on both sides (of) the state. Ever since I’ve been here, I think I hear about it every day. So understand what it means. We have to learn from last week and be better because of it and do everything we can to be successful on Saturday and find a way to win.” This is the quintessential “no result would surprise me” game.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Bryce Young showed progress — and then the fire teammates were waiting to see,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5953967/2024/11/28/panthers-bryce-young-speech-chiefs/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 10:03:24 GMT","After playing his best game last week, Bryce Young wanted his teammates to know that pushing the Chiefs was no fluke.","NFL CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Bryce Young had several moments during Sunday’s scare of the Kansas City Chiefs where his growth was evident on the field — and one very loud moment afterward when a different type of development all but shook the locker room walls. Young has a different leadership style than the last quarterback the Carolina Panthers drafted No. 1. Where Cam Newton was brash, flashy and wanted the world to know it, Young is more mellow and OK with letting others handle the hype and pep talks. Advertisement But some situations call for the quarterback to step up, clear his throat and let his voice be heard. And after the Panthers went toe to toe with the two-time defending Super Bowl-champion Chiefs, Young thought the moment called for his perspective. Young had just played the best game of his career against the NFL’s best measuring stick, matching two-time MVP Patrick Mahomes scoring drive for scoring drive before Mahomes broke loose on a long scramble to allow the Chiefs to escape Charlotte with a 30-27 win. GO DEEPER Bryce Young's continued growth shows why Panthers should ride with him rest of the way Running back Chuba Hubbard said Young wanted his teammates to know that pushing the Andy Reid- and Mahomes-led Chiefs to the brink was not a fluke. “This is who we are and it’s not a surprise. We’re a great football team. We’re not quite where we want to be yet, but we shouldn’t be surprised that we can do great things.” That was Hubbard’s synopsis of Young’s comments, apparently minus some salty language. “I just know he used a lot more profanity than probably I ever heard come from him,” cornerback Jaycee Horn said. “But it was good because it got the guys going. Obviously, everybody’s talking about it, so hopefully we can come out here and rally off that speech.” Dave Canales says Bryce Young’s trust in protections and route runners is helping him be an anticipatory QB. pic.twitter.com/p3YRbqxFUW — Joe Person (@josephperson) November 27, 2024  There were football reasons behind Dave Canales’ decision to sit Young down after two desultory performances to begin the season. But the Panthers also were looking for more energy and take-charge spirit from a player they gave up a lot for in the hopes he could lead them out of the NFL’s hinterlands. They were looking for a moment like Sunday. “I wouldn’t say I was surprised. I was just kind of happy, like, finally,” Horn said. “He stepped up and just a show of leadership and really just being the guy we all knew he was. It’s a lot being the No. 1 pick, going through the ups and downs. Nobody’s career is perfect. He’s playing ball and I’m proud of him. I’m just happy to see him take control of the team.” Advertisement Young experienced more downs in his first NFL season than he’d endured in the rest of his football-playing years combined. And when he came out scuffling in Year 2, despite the presence of a so-called quarterback whisperer in Canales, many thought the Carolina portion of his career might be short-lived. GO DEEPER 'Throwing guys out the club': Panthers getting their money's worth with Robert Hunt Canales still isn’t ready to anoint Young the franchise quarterback, but he appears to be warming up to a player who preceded him in Charlotte by a year. Minutes after Young completed 21 of 35 passes for 263 yards and a touchdown against the Chiefs, Canales named him the starter for this week’s game against Tampa Bay without making him wait a day or two, as had been the case. “As he continues to show us the progress that we’re looking for, as he continues to earn these moments, then yeah, he’ll be in there,” Canales said Wednesday. “That’s what I’ve been most excited about is there’s a weekly growth that’s happening.” That on-field growth has been most apparent in a couple of areas. Young and his offensive teammates are no longer scurrying to the line of scrimmage with little time left on the play clock, which has allowed the offense to operate more efficiently. Just as importantly, Young is staying in the pocket and letting plays develop, rather than abandoning it as he did earlier in the season — sometimes when the pass protection was solid. The Chiefs, a top-five defense, came after Young with blitz packages. He didn’t flinch, completing 11 of 13 passes for 135 yards and a TD against the blitz, according to ESPN. Exhibit A: With the Panthers facing a third-and-8 near midfield on the final play of the third quarter, the Chiefs sent seven defenders in the pass rush at Young. Two of them — defensive end George Karlaftis and safety Chamarri Conner — converged on Young just as he was stepping into his throw. Advertisement The Panthers were running a sail concept, with wide receiver David Moore running an out underneath Adam Thielen’s clear-out. With two defenders in his face, Young threw to the spot where Moore would end up — and hit him in stride for a 17-yard gain to extend a drive that ended with an Eddy Pineiro field goal. On the 💰 📺: CBS pic.twitter.com/rVJs2M0SXM — Carolina Panthers (@Panthers) November 24, 2024  When Moore got to the sideline, offensive coordinator Brad Idzik told him what Moore had been unable to see while running his route. “Idzik was like: ‘You should’ve saw Bryce. He just kind of like threw that thing out there, saying D-Mo’s gonna be there somewhere,’ ” Moore said. Canales said Young’s success against the blitz was the result of him trusting his receivers and being an “anticipatory quarterback.” “There were a couple times where they had a better pressure than we had protection,” Canales added, “and Bryce got a quick solution with guys being exactly in the spots that they needed to be in.” But few could have anticipated that Young would later address the team. The only other time he’s done so — at least to the public’s knowledge — was after a rough Thursday night loss at Chicago last year when the Panthers fell to a Bears team that started undrafted rookie Tyson Bagent at quarterback. Young’s message after the Chiefs game was more uplifting. “Just to keep building,” Young said. “I have to be consistent. We want to make sure we’re building on stuff and embracing the things where we can go and where we want to go. Stuff that’s really real. And just instilling belief. I have all the confidence in the world in this group and these guys. I think we all do.” Moore, who had a career-high six catches against Kansas City, was as surprised as anyone when Young broke the team huddle down. Advertisement “Nobody’s seen that. Nobody’s heard that,” said Moore, in his first season with the Panthers. “And for us to see it after a great game we played — granted, we lost — and him saying that, everybody felt that. … This is us. This is who we are, and we’ve gotta remain that.” (Photo: Jim Dedmon / Imagn Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Rams won’t suspend Demarcus Robinson as legal process continues; more Week 13 notes,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5954107/2024/11/28/rams-demarcus-robinson-no-suspension-week-13-saints/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 10:02:53 GMT","Robinson addressed the entire Rams team during meetings Wednesday, then spoke with local reporters after practice.","NFL LOS ANGELES — Sean McVay said Wednesday that Los Angeles Rams starting receiver Demarcus Robinson won’t be suspended for Sunday’s game in New Orleans, after Robinson’s arrest on suspicion of driving under the influence earlier this week. “Talking with him, I think he does understand the severity of this and how lucky we were that nobody was injured, (and) I do believe that he is remorseful,” McVay said. Advertisement The legal process and the NFL’s corresponding action from that outcome will continue, McVay said. Robinson was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence Monday morning, the California Highway Patrol said in a news release to The Athletic and the Rams later confirmed. Patrol officers say they initiated an enforcement stop after observing a white Dodge sedan traveling over 100 miles per hour on the US-101 freeway south of Tampa Avenue. Patrol officers said that after they stopped the car, Robinson identified himself as “an active player for the Los Angeles Rams,” according to the release. Officers said they observed “objective signs and symptoms of alcohol impairment.” Robinson was cited and then released to a “responsible party,” according to the release. Robinson addressed the entire team during meetings Wednesday, then spoke with local reporters after practice. “Hopefully everyone in the room can learn from my mistakes,” Robinson said. “It’s a bad look. I don’t want to bring that type of light or any type of negativity toward the team. Things like that (are) not natural for me or in my nature, stuff that I usually do. I told (McVay) I sincerely apologize to him and the team and this whole organization for even putting myself and the organization in a predicament like that.” McVay said the team would also take some additional measures in response instead of a suspension, but declined to say what they are. “I appreciate his ability to acknowledge it to the team, while also not minimizing or undermining the severity of what could have been,” McVay said. “I do trust that he is going to learn from it, and I think it’ll be a good learning opportunity for our whole football team.” McVay said that Rams players have team resources if ever impaired by a substance that are in place to prevent them from getting behind the wheel. Players are informed of those resources, such as drivers or car services, during the onboarding process each year. Advertisement “I think it was a bad decision he made,” said McVay, “I don’t think that makes him a bad person. I do believe that this is something that, with the words that he said (in the meeting) our guys will learn from it — and hopefully nobody is ever going to repeat something like this. Let it be a learning opportunity and a fortunate outcome in the fact that nobody was injured. … I don’t believe there was malicious intentions, but God forbid if something were to happen to him or somebody else.” Robinson, 30, was signed by the Rams in 2023. He has caught six touchdowns this season, which is a career high. McVay said earlier this week that right tackle Rob Havenstein is trending toward a return Sunday, after missing the previous three games with an ankle injury, although the team would have to continue to evaluate him through Wednesday’s practice (Havenstein was a full participant). In his absence, backups Joe Noteboom and Warren McClendon allowed a combined nine pressures and three sacks, according to TruMedia. Rams left tackle Alaric Jackson didn’t practice with a foot injury, according to the injury report released Wednesday evening (and after McVay’s news conference, so the head coach did not address the situation). Tight end Tyler Higbee, who tore his MCL and ACL after a low hit by Detroit Lions safety Kerby Joseph in last year’s wild-card playoff matchup, had his practice window opened on Wednesday though is not expected to play Sunday. At Wednesday’s practice, Higbee caught passes to the side of skill players’ drills with quarterback Matthew Stafford and backup Jimmy Garoppolo. Third-string quarterback Stetson Bennett was the thrower. “I’m just happy for him, it’s such a difficult thing to go through (an) injury, especially a long one like that,” Stafford said. “I’m so happy for him, proud of him. In and out of this room, the training room, walking around, you just see the work that he’s put in to get to where he is now to be able to come back out (here) and do what he loves.”  Rams rookie kicker Josh Karty has missed five field goals this season, including one in each of the last three games. His missed attempt from 26 yards in Week 11 at New England prompted McVay to punt from the opposing 35-yard line late in the fourth quarter instead of attempting a field goal from there. After the game, McVay noted that there wasn’t “a whole lot of back and forth” in making that decision because “there wasn’t a lot of reason to feel good about that (field goal) operation today.” GO DEEPER Rodrigue: Rams can’t run with the big-time postseason teams if they can get run over Karty also missed a 47-yard field goal attempt in Sunday’s 37-20 loss to Philadelphia. “Just keep on kicking, learn from it, move on,” said Karty after the game. “I feel like I’ve been kicking really really well (in practice) over the last three or four weeks, it just has not been clicking in games.” Advertisement Karty said he and McVay had a one-on-one conversation ahead of the Week 12 game. They discussed working through adversity, said Karty, and how eventually he would look back on this time and realize it was a good thing he went through it. “Definitely feels like sh– (now), haven’t been in this spot before in my career,” Karty said. “But it’s just a matter of time before I go on a tear and then they all start going in.” McVay said Wednesday that he wanted to instill “belief with authenticity” in Karty as he continues to get to know him. He added that he’s still confident in the kicking operation moving forward. (Top photo of Robinson: Rio Giancarlo / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How Nebraska volleyball star Harper Murray is leaving a troubled offseason behind her,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5953520/2024/11/28/harper-murray-nebraska-volleyball-john-cook/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 10:02:05 GMT","Murray has fought back from public struggles with her emotional health this season, helped in part by her bond with head coach John Cook.","College Sports LINCOLN, Neb. — Harper Murray is smiling and laughing every day. And she’s playing her best volleyball in two seasons at Nebraska. This alone lifts spirits among Murray’s teammates. Her happiness matters to them. The Huskers saw Murray spiral last spring amid public struggles with her emotional health. Two legal incidents derailed her offseason after Murray was named the top freshman in the Big Ten and a third-team All-American. Advertisement But her path is about more than rejuvenation. The college volleyball community and Nebraska’s legion of fans have taken notice this fall of Murray’s bond with Nebraska coach John Cook. “The connection that he has with Harper is extremely special,” senior co-captain Lexi Rodriguez said. “I think anyone can see it, whether you’re on the court or not.” Murray’s rebound is defined in part by her uncommon relationship with the 68-year coach who stood up for her like the father she lost 13 years ago. Murray, 19, brings out a soft side in Cook that few have seen. He cares for her like a daughter. “It’s unconditional love,” said Cook, a four-time national champion coach in his 25th season at Nebraska. “That’s really what it is. In this day and age, with this generation, you’ve got to have that if you’re going to coach.” They star together in TikTok videos. She created an account for him and controls the content, using his phone. He revels in the millions of views. “He’s always asking what we’re going to do next?” Murray said. “He loves it.” GO DEEPER From cowboy to coach, Nebraska's John Cook fuels a volleyball rise If the Huskers want to make a request of the coach — maybe it’s an adjustment to their uniforms or a tweak in the schedule — Murray gets nominated. “You ask” teammates tell her, she said, “because he’ll say yes to you.” Cook doesn’t say that Murray is his favorite. But the Huskers know it to be true. And it’s OK. She needs him in her life.  No. 2 Nebraska enters the final week of the regular season at 28-1 and perfect in the Big Ten. It has won 54 of 59 sets in league matches and plays at No. 4 Penn State on Friday, followed by a Saturday visit to Maryland. The postseason bracket reveal is on Sunday. Murray’s 3.29 kills per set and 27 service aces lead the Huskers. She’s the No. 1 attacking option on the most balanced offensive team in the nation. Her defense in the back row as a six-rotation player has progressed more than any area of her game. Advertisement But three months ago, Murray was terrified to walk onto the court in front of Nebraska’s fans for the preseason Red-White scrimmage. She wondered what people would think, Cook said. What would they say about her? Would she get booed? Back up eight months. Last December, Texas swept top-seeded Nebraska in the national championship match. Murray did not play well, especially in receiving the Longhorns’ serves. At the news conference that followed the loss, she was despondent. A reporter asked her about the future. “I think we’re going to win three national championships (in) the next three years,” Murray said. The comment blew up on social media. Murray digested the reactions and buried herself in negativity. She fell into a depression that lasted for months. On April 5, she was cited for DUI in Lincoln. Less than a month later, she got caught on security camera shoplifting $65 of jewelry at a sporting goods store. ESPN featured the rise and fall of Murray in an hour-long documentary, “No Place Like Nebraska.” It aired in August, tracking the Huskers’ 2023 season and the months after it. Murray lost her spot on the U.S. women’s U21 team. Family members worried that she might physically harm herself. Her mother, Sarah, feared that Cook would dismiss Harper from the team at Nebraska. Every time Cook talked to Sarah for weeks, she sought reassurance about Harper’s roster status. Public pressure existed for him to dump her. “The thought crossed my mind,” Harper said. “But I think I knew deep down that he wasn’t going to give up on me that easily.” Cook and Nebraska assistant coach Jaylen Reyes began to recruit Murray before she started high school in Ann Arbor, Michigan. She attended the Huskers’ Dream Team camp as an eighth-grader and fell for everything about the Nebraska program As Murray developed into the No. 1-rated prospect in the 2023 class, her recruiting intensified. She was named the Gatorade Player of the Year and had her choice of top schools. But she valued her initial impressions of Nebraska, and Cook won over her mom, in part, by making sure she knew he would watch over Harper and let Sarah know if her daughter made any poor decisions. Advertisement It’s a message that Cook tells the parents of every player he recruits. “It’s one thing to say that,” Harper said. “It’s another to act on it.” When her life veered off the rails this year, Cook did not waver. “I learned a long time ago that you do everything you can before you give up on these kids,” the coach said. Murray’s struggles strengthened Cook’s commitment to her — not to be construed as going easy on her. In the coach, Harper said, she saw a role model. He supported her, she said, “when other people probably wouldn’t have.” “I look up to him,” Murray said, “and just the way he approaches every day in life. It’s different than anyone I’ve ever met.” Cook helped Murray make a checklist of items required to restore her good standing with the Huskers. She completed extensive community service and more than 100 hours of therapy, which continues in addition to court-ordered probation. Within the team environment, Murray worked to regain trust. Cook often hears from former athletes and observers that they admire Murray’s growth. He marvels at her resolve. Many athletes in her situation, he said, would have left this year in search of a fresh start. She couldn’t leave. Not after all that Cook had done to help her. “He wasn’t happy with me,” Murray said. “But at the same time, he promised my mom that he would be there for me. And that’s exactly what he did. He held me accountable. But he gave me grace. “I have a lot of love and respect for him. I wouldn’t be the person or the player I am without him. And I know that I owe a lot to him. One of my biggest goals in life is to make him proud, especially because I put our program through a lot. I put us in the gutter at some points.” Murray’s father, Vada, died when she was 6. He was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2008 and lived three years with the disease until age 43. Vada was a standout safety on the Michigan football team from 1987-90, playing in three Rose Bowls. He graduated to work as a police officer in Ann Arbor. Harper holds only fragmented memories of Vada. But the absence of her father haunts her. She wears his jersey No. 27, just as her sister, Kendall, did with Michigan volleyball from 2020 to 2023. Advertisement The loss that Harper experienced has impacted Cook’s approach to their relationship. “There’s a coach-player relationship,” Cook said, “but I also think there’s a … I don’t want to call it father-daughter, because I’m not her father. But it’s built on trust.” Harper has seen their bond grow most in the way they communicate. The TikTok videos allow the public to catch a glimpse. But the roots of their connection run much deeper. On the court, she said, he’s tough on her. Harper asked Cook before this season as she struggled with confidence to ease up and show her more compassion. He complied. But it was temporary. “He can make me really mad,” she said. “But I know it’s because he wants what’s best for me.” The moment last year that triggered Murray’s slide is coming up on its first anniversary. Cook said he’s not worried that she’ll suffer again in a similar way if the Huskers fall short in December. She’s more mature, he said. Her perspective has changed. Murray said she’s as driven as ever to win a national championship. “I feel like I have something to prove,” she said. Murray wears tape on her left hand during matches. She marks the pinky finger with an “8” to honor Rodriguez, a guiding light for Harper, and the ring finger with “27,” the Murray family number. On the index finger, Harper writes “JC,” the initials of her coach. “He’s the closest thing I have,” she said, “to a father figure.” (Top photo: Dylan Widger / Imagn Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Women’s tennis season review: Aryna Sabalenka rises, Coco Gauff evolves, Zheng Qinwen breaks through",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5946918/2024/11/28/tennis-season-review-wta-roundtable-sabalenka-gauff-swiatek-zheng/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 10:01:29 GMT","The best matches, biggest surprises, and most important storylines of 2024 on the WTA Tour.","Tennis Tennis is finally taking a breath. After four Grand Slams, 56 more WTA Tour tournaments and the small matter of the 2024 Paris Olympics, the tennis calendar enters its off-season — in which players are mostly found first in the Maldives and then on the practice courts before the new campaign begins in Australia and New Zealand at the end of December. Advertisement In a review of the 2024 WTA season, The Athletic’s tennis team look back at Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek’s battle for world No. 1; Zheng Qinwen’s breakthrough; Coco Gauff’s evolution; Jasmine Paolini’s emergence and much more. They also pick their best and favorite matches, surprises, and moments from another remarkable year in tennis. Don’t forget to sound off in the comments on your picks — there’s plenty of tennis to review. James Hansen: Sabalenka’s official ascent to world No. 1 was deeply unsatisfying: an unheralded reduction of ranking points for non-participation in mandatory tournaments moved Sabalenka above Swiatek one Monday morning in October. It had nevertheless been coming for some time, especially for Swiatek, who said she thought she would “lose it, like, two weeks ago” in a news conference at the WTA Tour Finals. Matthew Futterman: Evolution and rest. She expanded on the biomechanical fixes to her serve by adding more variety into her game. She won the biggest points of the U.S. Open semi-final and final against Emma Navarro and Jessica Pegula with short angles, drop shots and volleys, not the frozen-rope winners she used to blast Zheng Qinwen off the court in Melbourne. She also missed Wimbledon, the Olympics and other weeks, the latter because of Belarus’s exclusion from the Billie Jean King Cup, which meant she got time to rest when everybody else was flying around and playing. Charlie Eccleshare: Not playing the Olympics and Wimbledon was a big thing, even though at the time, missing Wimbledon felt like a massive problem. She talked about the fact that she should have had a break in March (after the death of hockey player Konstantin Koltsov, her former boyfriend) but going into the U.S. hard-court swing fresh was a massive advantage while Swiatek looked to run out of steam around the U.S. Open. Hansen: The Olympics didn’t define the season, but it probably had a bigger impact than might have been anticipated earlier in the year. Swiatek, who went out unexpectedly there to Zheng, still ended the year with the most WTA titles in the top 10 as well as the highest win percentage; she was world No. 1 from the start of the year until late October. She’s brought on Wim Fissette as her new coach and they have both spoken about making adjustments to her game in the off-season to prevent her defeats from looking both alike and impossible to stop, as started to happen around Wimbledon. She looks ready to make a charge. Advertisement Eccleshare: When we spoke in Riyadh at the WTA Tour Finals, Sabalenka said that when she was first world No. 1 (just before the end of the 2023 season) it felt like “five minutes”, she felt like a pretender. Now she sees herself as someone who should be dominating, and she showed that in Melbourne and then particularly in the hard-court swing towards the end of the year. Swiatek wasn’t where she was expected to be in the second half of the year and will likely come back. GO DEEPER 'I can be the best player in the world': Aryna Sabalenka crowns the season of her life Matt Futterman: I don’t know if I see anyone else coming on to challenge Swiatek and Sabalenka passing the world No. 1 back and forth the next few years at the moment. The X factor is Coco Gauff. Hansen: If you were analyzing Gauff’s season — the WTA Tour Finals title, a WTA 1000 title in Beijing, a 250 in Auckland and the women’s doubles title at the French Open — as Gauff, what would you say? Futterman: She would not have signed up for these results and by that measure she’ll be disappointed. I think she expected to keep accumulating Slams, or at least win one more — and she didn’t make a Slam final, which is what she wants. Eccleshare: I think you would have to split it into the pre- and post-Brad Gilbert era, given the nature of her losses at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open and the improvements she’s already made to her serve and forehand since then, even though the serve can still leave her at seemingly unexpected moments. Gauff beat Navarro in the semifinals when she won Auckland, so for Navarro to then knock her out of two Grand Slams in a row was a significant measure of where she was before parting ways with Gilbert. Hansen: Staying on the theme: Who in the WTA top 10 would have signed up for their season and who wouldn’t? Eccleshare: Zheng and Paolini are the ones who stand out. I think anyone outside of the top three would have signed up for Paolini’s extraordinary year, with two Grand Slam finals, Olympic doubles gold alongside Sara Errani and then winning the Billie Jean King Cup with Italy as well. Then Zheng, Olympic singles gold medalist, Australian Open final, those are the two that have really kicked on. Navarro as well, because she keeps making really steady progress and is easy to overlook because she’s not had quite so many headlines. Advertisement Futterman: Well, Barbora Krejcikova would certainly have signed up for a Wimbledon title. The person I would nominate for this would be Danielle Collins, given where she was in January, not even seeded for Grand Slams. For a month-and-a-half in March and April she was probably the best player in the world. She would take that, certainly. Eccleshare: Elena Rybakina is the one — not even with just results, but in her time with and then split with long-term coach Stefano Vukov, the illnesses and injuries — who will be looking back wondering what might have been. Even just after Stuttgart and then Madrid it looked as if she was poised to have a four-way fight with Swiatek, Sabalenka and Gauff as the best players in the world by quite some distance and it just didn’t work out that way, especially at Wimbledon when she was 1-0 up on Krejcikova with three break points in the second set of their semi-final. Hansen: The fact Rybakina’s early-season form kept her in the WTA Tour Finals — and that she beat Sabalenka there — maybe suggests that she could be on her way back with Goran Ivanisevic in her box. Who, for you, made the biggest statement on the tour in 2024 with the progress they made from this time last year? Eccleshare: Zheng. “Statement” is a good word for her because I feel she’s unsettled players at the top of the tour with how she doesn’t take a backwards step. Players sometimes have a breakthrough season but still look overawed; she doesn’t feel that way at all and I think she’s put noses out of joint in a really positive way. Futterman: Navarro. It was almost all in one match – which she lost – the Maria Sakkari match in Indian Wells. She went toe-to-toe with Sakkari and was really hitting the ball hard, and played with such confidence in her tournaments after that. Even when she won the Hobart International she wasn’t playing with that kind of confidence. Even though Gauff knew more about her than most from their junior days, she didn’t see her coming, not like this. Hansen: The two players at the center of the strangest beef of the year. GO DEEPER Navarro blasts opponent Zheng after Olympic loss: 'I didn't respect her as a competitor' Hansen: This was a season of significant returns to the court, for the likes of Naomi Osaka, Paula Badosa and Karolina Muchova among others. Who of those three, who all made progress in different ways, will look back with the most satisfaction? Eccleshare: Badosa. She’s most improved both her fitness and level. Muchova has achieved more in a single event and has shown that her level is still in the conversation for possibly winning a Grand Slam, but Badosa looks more ready to do a full season and stay fit than the Czech does at the moment given Muchova’s end-of-season injury. Osaka had the same issue and I don’t think she has fully answered the level question yet. Badosa has stitched those two things together the best. Advertisement Futterman: I think the weird thing about Osaka — without knowing how serious her back injury is — I think physically she’s right there. The mystery with her is that she’s lost her superpower, which was that the tighter the moment, the better she played. The serves she hit in Grand Slam finals on crunch points were outrageous. The Osaka of 2021 was completely unbothered by losing games, sets, her serve. It didn’t matter, she would win. That’s what she was not able to do in the moments this year, whether it was against Swiatek at the French Open or against Muchova in New York. That was when she would put the hammer down. I don’t know if coach Patrick Mouratoglou can get her there but we will find out. Hansen: Who of the younger players on the tour made the most significant strides this year? Eccleshare: Diana Shnaider stands out. She’s not come through and just had one or two impressive results at a Slam: she’s won a title on every surface, one of them a WTA 500; she’s made a WTA 1000 semifinal in Canada. For someone who hasn’t had a huge amount of hype and still has lots of room to improve in terms of her Grand Slam results, she’s the one who stands out for me. Futterman: I was super impressed with Iva Jovic, the 16-year-old American who beat Magda Linette at the U.S. Open and was a few points away from beating the No. 29 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova in the second round. I think she has the solidity to progress further and that was a heck of a start.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,The Lions score lots of TDs and love celebrating them: 'They like to push the boundaries',https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5951374/2024/11/28/lions-touchdown-celebrations-amon-ra-st-brown-jameson-williams/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 10:01:15 GMT",What will be the next Lions TD celebration? Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams have already been thinking about it.,"NFL DETROIT — Believe it or not, there’s a burden that comes with being the NFL’s best offense. The Detroit Lions are learning that now. Each game presents an opportunity to put paint on canvas. There’s an art to what they’re doing. With that comes certain expectations, certain standards to uphold. It’s a different kind of pressure. Advertisement All eyes are on them. And their celebrations. “We’re just trying to bring some more excitement besides the touchdowns to the game,” WR Jameson Williams told The Athletic. Since the 2022 season, no team has scored more touchdowns than the Detroit Lions. They lead the league with 157, 12 more than the next closest team in that span. They’re on pace to set numerous franchise records — much of which were set last year by this same group. Through 11 games this season, the Lions have averaged a league-leading 32.7 points per game, which would rank 12th all-time in NFL history over the course of a full season. When you’re scoring as much as they are, you need to come ready to celebrate. That’s never an issue for this bunch. Everyone knows what to expect when the ball crosses the plane. GO DEEPER Jared Goff hit rock bottom. A conversation with Dan Campbell ignited his unlikely comeback “I tried to share them a celebration,” Lions OC Ben Johnson said last week. “They haven’t done it yet. That’s hopefully coming down the pipe at some point. I’m on St. Brown about that. He’s the guru.” Guru. Ringleader. Whatever title you want to give him, Amon-Ra St. Brown will humbly accept what’s bestowed upon him. Over the last two seasons, St. Brown is tied for the league in touchdown receptions with 19. He is the braintrust behind some of the Lions’ most viral celebrations, and the man responsible for organizing them among his teammates. If you know St. Brown, this is, of course, unsurprising. We’re talking about a guy whose party trick is reciting every receiver drafted ahead of him from memory. He operates life with those 16 chips on his shoulder. Nobody believed he’d have this kind of success in the NFL — a two-time Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro before his 25th birthday — except him. There’s a reason he’s the way he is, and why he’s as good as he is. “I’d be lying to you if I said I wasn’t trying to score every game,” St. Brown said recently, after scoring a touchdown in his eighth consecutive game. “I think every receiver’s trying to score every game.” Advertisement True. But what separates St. Brown is that he sees everything, and wants you to see him. He participated in his first Lambeau Leap last year, and blew a kiss to the crowd after the win. He once used Jaire Alexander’s celebration against him in a game, right in his face, then did it again. A troll with an eye for celebrations, St. Brown and the end zone are a match made in heaven. “I’m pretty sure he always practices his at home,” Penei Sewell said of St. Brown’s celebrations. “He’s well-prepared for his.” The ideas often materialize out of thin air, without much rhyme or reason. Sometimes, they’re planned days in advance. Sometimes, inspiration can strike the night before a game and make its way to an end zone near you on Sundays. And sometimes, it’s as simple as doing what you feel in the moment. But best believe St. Brown and these Lions are gonna get a celly off. The rabbit hole goes deep, with no shortage of options. On a Saturday heading into an NFC North game against the Green Bay Packers earlier this month, St. Brown watched a clip of Incarnate Word WR Jalen Walthall doing a headstand after scoring a touchdown. Walthall told “SportsCenter” the celebration was an ode to a move shown in the film “Stomp the Yard.” Who knew a movie released 17 years ago would be the indirect source of one of St. Brown’s numerous celebrations? As the clip picked up steam, St. Brown didn’t let many in on his plans. However, he did tell teammate Jahmyr Gibbs that he would hit the headstand if he scored the next day. He did. There is now a bobblehead of the celebration available for purchase.  Amon-Ra St. Brown had no doubt the headstand celebration would be a hit. (Junfu Han / Imagn Images) “As a kid, I just remember doing headstands,” St. Brown told reporters after the game. “… I would do those as a kid, so, I knew it wasn’t gonna be too hard. I saw the clip on my phone and I was like, ‘All right, I’m doing it tomorrow.’ And sure enough when I scored, I did it. Once I did it, I knew it was gonna look pretty cool.” Advertisement Another one that made the rounds came in a Week 3 win over the Arizona Cardinals. Leading up to the game, popular Twitch streamer Kai Cenat went live with Colorado star Travis Hunter. Cenat had a celebration suggestion for Hunter, suggesting he get on all fours and walk like a dog around the end zone. Hunter obliged, then re-enacted it after Colorado’s overtime win over Baylor this season. TRAVIS HUNTER REALLY DID THE KAI CENAT CELLY 🤣 pic.twitter.com/GNLBRvswT6 — Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) September 22, 2024  It caught St. Brown’s attention. He tried to one-up it. Amon-Ra St. Brown hit the Kai Cenat celebration 😂 pic.twitter.com/B6rr0CD74E — FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) September 22, 2024  If St. Brown is the main character, Gibbs takes home the award for best supporting actor. They have as close a friendship as you’ll find on the team, often posting up at each other’s locker during the week and sending each other videos of celebrations they see for approval before they try it themselves. “We’ll watch something or we’ll go on TikTok and try and find sh–,” said Gibbs, a man of few words. Amid a 52-6 dismantling of the Jacksonville Jaguars two weeks ago, those two, alongside RB David Montgomery, unveiled a Dragon Ball Z-inspired celly — executed to perfection. kamehameha@amonra_stbrown @jahmyr_gibbs1 pic.twitter.com/juJTvmkMb7 — Detroit Lions (@Lions) November 17, 2024  This past Sunday against the Colts, Gibbs had an idea for the running backs and anyone else who wanted to join to wear throwback NBA jerseys on the team’s flight to Indianapolis. Gibbs wore Allen Iverson’s No. 3 76ers jersey. The next day, he and St. Brown recreated arguably his most famous on-court moment — a crossover baseline jumper, before stepping over Lakers guard Tyronn Lue. Naturally, the idea matched the fit pic. “I thought about last night,” Gibbs said after the game. “I didn’t tell him until, actually, when he first got here. I told him in the locker room.” Bringing @alleniverson to the celly 🥳️#EasyToCelebrate 🍻 @budlight pic.twitter.com/G2dsNhuizO — Detroit Lions (@Lions) November 24, 2024  The wild card of the group, to the surprise of absolutely no one, is Jameson Williams. The best way to describe Williams is that he’s somehow everyone’s little brother — even guys younger than him. He plays football as an adult the same way he did when he first put on pads as a 6-year-old in St. Louis. It’s how he was taught to play the game by his youth league coach, Cory Patterson — who’s now coaching WRs at Purdue. Advertisement “The way he taught us how to play the game is just to have fun,” Williams said. “We was out there, he’ll tell us to celebrate. When Terrell Owens did the popcorn celebration, he had us do that in little league. So, like, he just used to instill that into us to just have fun in the game.” You can tell by the way he celebrates. His first NFL touchdown was a 41-yard pitch-and-catch. Williams proceeded to bounce around Ford Field like a toddler who ate too much sugar before bed. These days, Williams isn’t a stranger to the end zone. Now that he’s a regular in the lineup, he can plan out his end-zone moves ahead of time. Earlier this season, as Lions legend Calvin Johnson was inducted into the franchise’s ring of honor, Williams honored him by re-enacting Johnson’s famous goal-post dunk — just barely sneaking it through the uprights. He was fined for it, but it was worth it. Last week, the Lions gifted Williams with a framed photo of his dunk, autographed by none other than Johnson himself. Shout out to @calvinjohnsonjr 🙏 pic.twitter.com/ut0Qm6LCyQ — Detroit Lions (@Lions) November 23, 2024  What separates Williams from others on the team is that you never know how many celebrations you’re gonna get. They can range from one to four on a given touchdown — maybe even five if he’s really feeling himself after a score. That is, if he remembers everything in his head upon arrival. “I got a lot, but you know, when you in a game and you score, you actually forget,” Williams said, giggling. “So it’s kind of hard. Somebody has to come remind me.” This happened recently in a game. After scoring a 64-yard touchdown vs. the Jaguars, Williams was supposed to unveil a rehearsed celebration with Montgomery. The two made plans to get on a knee and shoot dice in the end zone. However, the celebration had to wait a week. Williams decided to pay homage to Marshawn Lynch instead. He was fined again.

JAMO TD 🦁 📺: #JAXvsDET on CBS/Paramount+📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/2pPKz1VI81 — NFL (@NFL) November 17, 2024  His teammates are used to him marching to the beat of his own drum. “I see him catch it and as soon as I see the safety take the wrong angle or he’s out of position, I knew it was a touchdown,” St. Brown said of Williams’ touchdown vs. the Jaguars. “So I’ll just meet him in the end zone, let him do his celebration, I’ll wait like five minutes until he’s done and then we’ll celebrate together.” But rest assured, Williams and Montgomery eventually got the dice celebration off the call sheet, after Montgomery scored a 6-yard touchdown this past Sunday vs. the Colts. David Montgomery efforts his way into the end zone 💪#DETvsIND | 📺 FOX pic.twitter.com/WKq6Lz10SY — Detroit Lions (@Lions) November 24, 2024  “I think me and Jamo will get fined today,” Montgomery said after the win over the Colts, “But I’m excited for that fine.” Again, you never quite know where the inspiration for a celebration will come from heading into the week. Players will text to coordinate if they have a strong idea in mind, but it typically only involves a couple of guys at a time. The exception to that would be one of the more memorable scores of the year, taking place on “Sunday Night Football” vs. the Houston Texans earlier this month. As the story goes, Williams was scrolling social media when he saw an entire team run into the end zone, lay flat on their stomachs and kick their feet. He sent it to St. Brown, St. Brown created a group chat to send out the bat signal, tight end Sam LaPorta scored and the rest is Lions history. Give credit where it’s due pic.twitter.com/KTeAGlMwkM — Detroit Lions (@Lions) November 14, 2024  Williams wasn’t even on the field for the play. But he felt it was only right for him to join in on the fun, so he sprinted over from the sideline. “I’m the one who came up with it,” Williams said. “I swear I am. I sent it to the wide receiver group chat before the game. I said, ‘We gotta do this.’ I said, ‘Tell everybody.’ Because it’s real video of some people playing, like, seven-on-seven football, but they whole team, like, everybody cleared the sideline. Like, it was 30, 40 people on the field doing that. I was really on the sideline during the touchdown, but once I seen somebody off the sideline run onto the field, I’m like, ‘I’m going, too.’ ” Advertisement “For the Texans game, I did create a quick one with some linemen, Jared, tight ends, some receivers, just to spread the word that when we score the first down, we’re doing that celebration,” St. Brown explained. “Jamo is right. Jamo came up with that one. … He said, ‘Saint, you gotta tell everyone to do it, they gonna listen to you.’ I said bet I’ll send it.” Ahead of a Thanksgiving matchup against the Bears, St. Brown, Gibbs and Williams have already been plotting potential celebrations. It’s another nationally televised game for them to showcase their, uh, artistic vision. GO DEEPER NFL playoff projections 2024: Can Eagles overtake Lions for top seed in NFC? If there’s any franchise that deserves to celebrate its successes, it’s the Detroit Lions. No longer a basement dweller, the Lions look like one of the NFL’s elites. They’re tied for the best record in football at 10-1 — achieving that mark for the first time since 1934. They’ve won nine games in a row. They own the league’s best-point differential, its best-scoring offense and its second-best scoring defense. A complete football team from top to bottom. Of course, the Lions know what really matters is how they finish the season. That test begins in January. The ultimate celebration is the one that takes place on Sunday, Feb. 9 in New Orleans, as confetti falls from the skies and players are forever etched in history. But the journey is worth celebrating, too. “I tell our guys, ‘Hey, as long as you don’t cost us 15,’ I’m good with whatever they do,” Dan Campbell said, when asked about the celebrations this week. “They have fun with it, they are creative, they like to push the boundaries — whatever those are, and they are. I know our guys have fun with it and I think that’s important. They enjoy it. … I’m glad they have a good time with it.” (Top photo of Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams: Gregory Shamus / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Kalen DeBoer needs a win. How have other first-year coaches fared in the Iron Bowl?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5953108/2024/11/28/alabama-auburn-iron-bowl-kalen-deboer/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 10:00:46 GMT",DeBoer said there hasn’t been a day since he took the job at Alabama in which he hasn’t heard something about the Iron Bowl.,"NCAAF TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — On Monday, Kalen DeBoer said there hasn’t been a day since he took the job at Alabama in which he hasn’t heard something about the Iron Bowl. And of all the stories, last year’s game particularly sticks out. “I understand what took place a year ago and what it took to win that game,” DeBoer said. “I think probably pretty reminiscent of what both sides are looking at as far as the effort it’s gonna take and playing for four quarters, playing every second, every play like it’s your last. That’s the intensity of it.” Fourth-and-31 or “gravedigger” is one of the most iconic moments in one of college football’s best rivalries — and it was a heartbreaking ending for Hugh Freeze in his first Iron Bowl and a magical final Iron Bowl for Nick Saban. TOUCHDOWN ALABAMA ON 4TH AND A MILE!  UNREAL! pic.twitter.com/rX5XPRsuzV — CBS Sports (@CBSSports) November 26, 2023  This year’s game isn’t as consequential as other Alabama–Auburn matchups in the grand scheme of the sport. Alabama is clinging to Playoff hopes at 8-3 while Auburn (6-5) is fighting for bowl eligibility. However, this game is very important for a first-year coach in DeBoer, who desperately needs to change the narrative on what has been a disappointing debut season. Advertisement So how has the Iron Bowl gone for other first-year coaches on both sides of the rivalry? Let’s take a look. Auburn won six of the first seven Iron Bowls and was heavily favored in 1903, having won its first two games by an 84-0 margin. However, Alabama pulled off the upset 18-6. After the game, Alabama coach W.B. Blount admitted to the Montgomery Advertiser, “I am free to confess that the result of the game was as much a surprise to me as anybody else.” After a 6-6 tie in 1907, the teams did not play again until 1947. History points to a multitude of reasons, including player per diem rates, disagreements on referees, land grants and more. Thanks to a push from the Alabama board of trustees and state legislature, the series resumed in 1948. Coach Harold Drew led Alabama to a 55-0 win, the largest point differential in the series. Bear Bryant lost his first Iron Bowl, a 14-8 setback to No. 2 Auburn in 1958. Years later, he posted one of the most significant wins of his career against the hated rivals. Alabama defeated Auburn 28-17 in 1981 as Bryant won his 315th career game to pass Amos Alonzo Stagg to become the all-time winningest coach in Division I history. On the losing side was first-year Auburn coach and former Bryant assistant Pat Dye. In 1958, Alabama’s record against Auburn was 9-13-1. When Bryant retired, Alabama’s record was 28-19-1. Stallings’ first season started rough at 0-3, but two rivalry upsets set the tone for what was to come. Alabama won at No. 3 Tennessee earlier in the year, and then Stallings delivered another stunner — a 16-7 victory over No. 20 Auburn that snapped the Tigers’ four-game winning streak in the series. Advertisement Alabama, the defending national champ, was 8-1-1. Auburn was undefeated at 10-0. But the Tigers, under first-year coach Terry Bowden, were on probation and banned from appearing on television for one season. Since 1981, this is the only Iron Bowl that hasn’t been televised. The game sold out two stadiums. Over 47,000 people watched via simulcast at Bryant-Denny Stadium (tickets were capped due to limited sight angles of the broadcast) while Jordan-Hare Stadium was packed, as usual, to see the actual game. Auburn won 22-14 to complete an undefeated regular season, but the Tigers did not play in a bowl game due to probation. Just like Bryant, Saban’s Iron Bowl career started with a loss — a 17-10 defeat that marked Auburn’s sixth straight win in the series, its longest streak in the rivalry. Saban would reel off 12 wins in the next 16 years to re-establish Alabama’s dominance. Not surprisingly, Bryant (.760) and Saban (.706) have the highest winning percentages of any coaches in this rivalry. Some classic Iron Bowls involving Saban that aren’t listed below include “The Drive” in 2009, the “Camback” in 2011, the highest-scoring Iron Bowl ever (a 55-44 win) in 2014 and Tua Tagovailoa’s six-touchdown masterpiece in 2018. With 0:01 on the clock and the score tied 28-28, Alabama freshman kicker Adam Griffith attempted a 57-yard potential game-winning field goal. It fell short, and Auburn cornerback Chris Davis caught the ball at the back of the end zone and returned it 109 yards for the game-winning touchdown as time expired. It was an iconic Iron Bowl debut for Auburn coach Gus Malzahn, who led the Tigers to the national championship game that year. The Kick Six won ESPYs for Best Game and Best Play. Shades of 2009. Alabama was down on the road at Auburn, needing a long touchdown drive to keep its championship hopes alive. Bryce Young proceeded to drive the Tide 97 yards for a game-tying touchdown to force the first overtime game in Iron Bowl history. Alabama prevailed 24-22 in four OTs. It was a heartbreaking debut for Bryan Harsin at Auburn and a signature moment for Young, who became Saban’s fourth and final Heisman Trophy winner a few weeks later.

The Dallas Cowboys look to snap their six-game home losing streak when they host the New York Giants in a battle of backup quarterbacks. The Cowboys are a little more than a field-goal favorite. Advertisement Not only have the Cowboys lost six consecutive home games going back to last year’s playoff game, they have been blown out in most of them and not even been remotely competitive. They finally have a chance to change that and snap that streak to give their fans something to finally be happy about. Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush was an addition to the injury report this week with a knee issue, but he is expected to play. He has thrown for 813 yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions in place of starter Dak Prescott. There is a little more uncertainty on the Giants side where backup Tommy DeVito is not a guarantee to play as he deals with a right forearm injury. He has lost four consecutive starts going back to last season. If he cannot go, Drew Lock will get the start. Like the Cowboys, the Giants have been better on the road this season than they have been at home and could actually get to .500 on the road (3-3) with a win on Thursday. Both teams have been miserable at covering the spread this season and enter Thursday with matching 3-8 records against the spread. The Cowboys (0-5) have failed to cover as a home team.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Three years later, Marc Bergevin on how it ended with the Canadiens and what's next",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5952513/2024/11/28/marc-bergevin-canadiens-firing/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 10:00:29 GMT","In his first media interview since his firing in Montreal, Bergevin touched on the end with the Habs, the Mailloux pick and his future.","NHL Marc Bergevin was fired three years ago today by the Montreal Canadiens and completely disappeared from the media glare, eventually settling into an enjoyable gig with the Los Angeles Kings. The extreme lifestyle change of going from the constant public spotlight as Habs GM for nearly a decade to near-obscurity as senior adviser without a public profile with the Kings while living in Redondo Beach, Calif., well, that suits Bergevin just fine. Advertisement “I have no regrets about my time in Montreal,” Bergevin told The Athletic this week. “It was a great nine and a half years, and I have nothing but positive memories. But there is certainly a spotlight there. “Here, you go to Starbucks to get your coffee in the morning and nobody knows who you are.” Which is exactly what he needed. Three years to decompress. “After I left Montreal, I remember thinking I wanted to be a GM again right away, but looking back, it would have been the wrong thing for me to jump back right in,” Bergevin said. “I needed this time to reenergize.” It’s not like he’s been sitting on his hands. He’s working full-time for Rob Blake, advising and traveling and doing whatever the Kings GM needs. But he’s been able to do it in the shadows. In his first media interview since his firing in Montreal on Nov. 28, 2021, Bergevin touched on a number of topics with The Athletic. Let’s dive in. Bergevin says Habs owner Geoff Molson approached him with a contract extension right after the team reached the ’21 Cup Final. His contract was expiring a year later. “I decided that for me, it was best to move forward,” Bergevin said. “Time had come. It was good for both of us to move in a different direction. Geoff was very good, very fair. But I told him, ‘Geoff, I’m going to finish my last year that’s left and then I’m going to move on.’ He was good with that. He understood.” The reality was that Bergevin was pretty much fried by one of the sport’s most demanding jobs. And not just from a hockey point of view. “COVID took a toll on me — not physically, but as you know Montreal, Quebec, was really strict with the rules on COVID, and all my kids were in the States,” Bergevin said. “There was a 14-day quarantine then (once entering Quebec). I didn’t see my kids for almost a year. Advertisement “When Geoff made me the offer, I just felt there was no light at the end of the tunnel. The whole COVID thing for me beat me up, mentally, not seeing my kids.” As it turns out, with Shea Weber playing his last NHL game in that 2021 Cup Final and Carey Price missing almost all of the following season, the end of an era for Bergevin’s team was happening even more quickly than anyone would have predicted. A 6-15-2 start to the season led to Bergevin’s firing. “I knew a change was coming (because they had mutually agreed it was his last season), but it’s always a shock even though you prepare for it,” Bergevin said. “It was done the right way from Geoff’s side.” Before Bergevin landed in Montreal as Habs GM on May 2, 2012, he was known in hockey circles for his sense of humor. During his playing career and then working his way up the scouting ranks with the Chicago Blackhawks, he was the life of the party. This is the guy who once picked up a plant walking out of a GMs meeting in Florida to avoid the cameras. This is one creative way to avoid being spotted. #Canadiens GM Marc Bergevin hides behind a plant and (almost) slips right past everyone. pic.twitter.com/XHEk12Ev2Z — Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) March 6, 2017  But a decade in that Habs job, through all the drama, chipped away at that personable, funny guy. The strain of the job was evident on his face by the end. “Yeah that’s fair,” Bergevin said. “And it’s not like you change as a person, but you’re more on your guard because you feel like you have a spotlight on you every second of the day. And everything you said could be picked apart. So you’re more on your guard. “But honestly, I enjoyed every second of my time there in Montreal. Even though there were times I didn’t feel like I did. But now that I can look back after a few years, yeah.” Advertisement He feels the good moves outweighed the mistakes, but yes, obviously, there were mistakes. “Looking back I feel our average was pretty good,” he said. One of the characteristics of Bergevin’s time in Montreal was smaller to medium moves that ended up being beneficial. They all add up. Acquiring Marco Scandella for a fourth-round pick from the Buffalo Sabres, then flipping him to the St. Louis Blues seven weeks later for second- and fourth-round picks. Getting Brett Kulak from the Calgary Flames for Matt Taormina and Rinat Valiev. One that wasn’t seen as big at the time: Getting Phillip Danault and a second-rounder from Chicago for pending UFAs Dale Weise and Tomas Fleischmann. That second-round pick became Alexander Romanov. “I learned from Rick Dudley,” Bergevin said. “He said once to me, ‘Berg, you can’t go for the home run all the time. Sometimes you make your team better a little bit here, a little bit there. And eventually you get to where you want to be.’ I always kept that in mind. I think we did that in Montreal. We hit a lot of singles.” Obviously, he also swung for the fences on some trades, including P.K. Subban for Shea Weber in June 2016. “P.K. was a very good player, but we needed something different,” Bergevin said. “To get Shea Weber, you had to give up a pretty good asset. I think it worked out for both teams. Because both teams went to the Final. Nashville did with P.K. (in 2017), and we did with Shea. “When a trade is made, both GMs think it’s going to work out for their teams, but I think the best ones are the ones that do actually work out for both teams.” Bergevin was invited by Weber to his recent Hockey Hall of Fame induction, which was special for him. “I’m glad that I went,” Bergevin said. “I told him, ‘I’m honored you’re asking me to go.’ And he said, ‘Berg, I want you to be there.’ That meant a lot to me.” GO DEEPER LeBrun: Shea Weber, David Poile enter Hall of Fame together on good terms after lengthy rift over trade, offer sheet The Habs made huge news on July 1, 2019, when they signed star center Sebastian Aho to an offer sheet. The five-year, $42.295 million was front-loaded and mostly made up of signing bonuses, including $11.3 million in July 2019 and $9.87 million in July 2020. The gamble for Montreal was that Hurricanes owner Tom Dundon wouldn’t have the stomach to pay that money up front. But Dundon didn’t blink. Advertisement In retrospect, Bergevin thinks he could have done it differently. “Aho was the right player to give an offer sheet to, but I wish it would have been a different offer sheet,” Bergevin said. “Would I take that back? Yes. But honestly, at the time, we thought we would get the player based on the signing bonuses, which (Tom) Dundon matched. It ended up being a good contract for them. “Lesson learned, honestly. Lesson learned. If I ever become a GM again, that’s a lesson I can use moving forward if it happens.” The offer sheet also made mortal enemies, at the time, of owners Dundon and Molson. That fueled Carolina’s revenge offer sheet on Jesperi Kotkaniemi in August 2021, a one-year, $6.1 million deal. The Habs didn’t match. “He wasn’t going to do a long-term deal with us because he wanted a change of scenery,” Bergevin said of Kotkaniemi. And well, the Canadiens didn’t feel Kotkaniemi was worth $6.1 million. So that decision wasn’t hard. Carolina GM Don Waddell did reach out to see if a trade could be worked out instead. The rumor at the time was that Bergevin tried to get a young Seth Jarvis back. “That’s true,” he confirmed. Waddell, not surprisingly, didn’t want to move Jarvis, who was drafted 13th the previous year. Drafting Kotkaniemi third in the 2018 draft was a decision fueled by a desperate need at center for the Habs. Obviously taking him one spot ahead of winger Brady Tkachuk, who went next to the Ottawa Senators, is tough to digest for Habs fans now. “I look back at that, honestly, if you remember, Brady had a really tough season at BU,” Bergevin said. “He didn’t score for a long time. The skating was an issue. At the time in Montreal, all I would hear is (Filip) Zadina, Zadina, Zadina … because he was playing in Halifax (of the Quebec League). “Obviously, now you would say, ‘Tkachuk, well of course.'” Advertisement But the need to draft a center was real. “We didn’t have any centermen, and we were looking at a guy that was a tall, lanky center,” Bergevin said. “He had some good hockey as a 17-year-old. I wish KK the best. I think there’s more there, but time will tell.” Bergevin’s last draft as Habs GM brought his most controversial moment, stunning the hockey world by taking Logan Mailloux 31st in 2021. Mailloux had asked NHL teams not to draft him after reports surfaced that he was convicted and fined in a Swedish court in December 2020 for disseminating offensive photography. He had taken a photo of a woman performing a sex act without her consent and circulated it among some teammates. The Habs took him anyway. Bergevin at the time described what Mailloux had done as “unacceptable,” but many felt, as The Athletic’s Arpon Basu wrote, that the pick signaled that for the Canadiens, “Improving their hockey team is more important than basic, common decency.” The story has died down over time, in part because it sounds like Mailloux has put in work to improve and educate himself. He remains part of the organization, has played six NHL games and is currently with AHL Laval. “It’s nice to see the young man has done the necessary things, to earn a second chance,” Bergevin said, declining to say anything else on the matter. I suspect his decision not to say more comes down to the regrettable decision involving other people around him in the organization. Most notably, of course, ownership signed off on it. Whatever the case, if Bergevin is to become an NHL GM again one day, he will have to answer this question in more detail as part of his interview process with his next NHL owner. Current Canadiens leadership inherited good young players, such as Nick Suzuki and Cole Caufield, but also, it must be pointed out, some hefty contracts in Brendan Gallagher and Josh Anderson. Advertisement But Bergevin feels he left Jeff Gorton and Kent Hughes decent pieces to rebuild with. “I never traded a first-round pick when I was there,” Bergevin said. “Not that I wouldn’t, but I didn’t. And you can look at the draft picks I left them. And I’m proud of that. I didn’t put that franchise in a bad spot. People might argue that, but I don’t know where you would argue that.” Gallagher’s six-year, $39 million extension, signed in October 2020 and expiring in 2027, is one some would point to, although he’s had a renaissance season in 2024-25. “He had three years of 30 goals in a row (before signing the extension),” Bergevin said. “You have to pay for that. Every GM sometimes gives one or two years too much in contracts.” And yes, the Carey Price contract is still on Montreal’s books through 2026. Bergevin signed Price to an eight-year, $84-million extension July 2, 2017. Of course it was too many years, but the alternative was to let the best goalie in the world walk a year later. “You had to sign him, but then injuries … nobody knew that — he didn’t know that — would happen,” Bergevin said. Before the extension was signed, did other teams call to gauge where things were with Price to see if a trade was possible? Like maybe at the draft? Nope. “Nobody ever called,” Bergevin said. Because it was obvious the Habs were going to do all they could to sign Price. As senior adviser, Bergevin travels to scout games and spends time with the Kings coaching staff every week. “I’ll come in most days and be part of all our discussions as a group,” Bergevin said. “I’ll watch other games, other teams, for either trades or free agency.” Last week, Bergevin went to games in Vegas, Utah, Philadelphia and Chicago. Bergevin played with Blake and Kings president Luc Robitaille on Canada’s world championship gold medal team in 1994. They remained close afterward. Advertisement The Kings hired him in January 2022. “They wanted a different set of eyes,” Bergevin said. “Marc has been a terrific addition to our staff,” Blake said via text. “Really enjoys the scouting aspect of managing. Has a busy travel schedule where he watches many live games with very thorough reports on players who may or may not fit with us. His welcoming personality allows him to interact with the coaching staff on a daily basis. Sharing his thoughts on our team and what is happening around the league.” Bergevin has interviewed for three GM openings since leaving Montreal: in Toronto in May 2023 when Brad Treliving was hired, in Pittsburgh around the same time in 2023 when Kyle Dubas was hired and in Columbus this past offseason when Waddell got the gig. “When teams reach out, it’s always good to do it,” Bergevin said. Treliving was always the front-runner for the Toronto job, but Bergevin appreciated interviewing with Leafs president Brendan Shanahan. “I knew Toronto a bit better because of my days with Montreal,” Bergevin said. “But Tree is a good general manager. After the announcement was made with Tree, I ran into Shanny and said, ‘Thank you for the opportunity.’ “There’s no hard feelings that I wasn’t picked. It’s a business. I wished him the best.” No doubt there will be more GM interviews, but whether or not that produces another GM gig remains to be seen. “I’m in a good place here with Blakey and the staff. I really am,” Bergevin said. “If it turns out that I stay here for three, four, five years instead, I’m really good with that. But do I want to try again? I think we did enough good things in Montreal to have another crack at it. But that’s not my decision. “I’ve never stopped working since the day I got let go. I’ve stayed really in touch with the game and the players.” Advertisement Regardless of what the future holds, he’s now better able to appreciate his time as Habs GM. “Geoff Molson was always supportive,” Bergevin said. “I have nothing but respect for him. And I wish the best of luck in Montreal. Because they have a great fan base, great ownership, and I know Kent and Gorts, and they’re good people. I wish everybody there the best. I really mean that.” (Photo: Minas Panagiotakis / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"NHL hype-o-meter: Praise for the Hurricanes' system, Canucks' new-look top line and more",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5953300/2024/11/28/nhl-hype-o-meter-hurricanes-canucks/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 10:00:27 GMT","There is a lot to highlight at the quarter mark of the season: Surprise goalies, the Canes still cooking and the Sharks are at least fun.","NHL Navigating the Carolina Hurricanes’ 2024 free agency would have been a tall ask for the most experienced general manager, let alone Eric Tulsky, who was promoted just weeks earlier. Deadline addition Jake Guentzel headlined the list of unrestricted free agents. Then there was Carolina’s entire second pair of Brady Skjei and Brett Pesce, along with depth forward Stefan Noesen. Tulsky and the Hurricanes traded Guentzel’s rights and let their other key free agents walk. The team wasn’t splashy with their replacements. They signed Sean Walker and Shayne Gostisbehere to replenish the blue line and added Jack Roslovic and William Carrier up front. The team may have shed $13 million in salary in the process, but the roster also dropped in value by a minus-21 Net Rating. Advertisement But a quarter way into the season, those subtractions aren’t the story. The Hurricanes are proving to be one of the strongest teams in the league and should be a playoff lock. While some dramatic and concerning trends are developing around the league on Thanksgiving, there is also a lot to highlight. The Canes are first up on the hype-o-meter’s™️ radar. Hype-o-meter: 9/10 Tulsky and the Hurricanes’ front office decided not to seek out a Guentzel replacement in free agency. Instead, the team held onto Martin Necas, whose name was swirling through trade rumors. The decision to trust Necas after a down year and let him cook in Carolina has been a game-changer. He is leading the entire league in scoring with 35 points heading into Wednesday night. That’s the oomph this team needed upfront. Not every team would have been able to withstand losing their entire second pair, either. As much as the Hurricanes have developed a reputation for maximizing defensemen within their system, Jaccob Slavin and Brett Pesce have always been the staples on the blue line to help facilitate that. Dmitry Orlov and Jalen Chatfield, last year’s third pair, were promoted into expanded roles and have thrived so far, with a 60 percent expected goal rate and a 22-8 scoring edge in their minutes. With a top four that can be leaned on against top competition, the coaches can shelter their third pair. Walker and Gostisbehere help drive play from the back end with 63 percent of the expected goal share. If the team started shooting more than 5.7 percent in their minutes, the goal scoring would probably reflect their efforts a lot better. Even Roslovic, who is a bit of a one-dimensional scorer, has carved out a role for himself with the Hurricanes. It’s all a testament to Carolina’s identity and structure, which remains a major strength year after year. The Hurricanes are one of the best two-way teams in the league, which is helping them overcome some deficits in goal — Monday night’s comeback win over the Stars was a prime example of that. Management bet on that, and it’s clearly paying off. Advertisement Hype-o-meter: 8/10 On Monday night, Anthony Cirelli was served a heavy diet of Nathan MacKinnon and Mikko Rantanen. Most opponents struggle to contain that dynamic duo, but Cirelli helped shut them down. In 13:37 head-to-head five-on-five minutes against MacKinnon, the Lightning dominated play. Tampa Bay held Colorado to just five shot attempts in that time, worth an expected goal value of 0.21. The Lightning, on the other hand, put up 21 attempts worth 1.36 expected goals and outscored the Avalanche 2-0. It’s just a small glimpse into a fantastic season for Cirelli so far, which is made all the more impressive by his workload. The Lightning have had one of the most difficult schedules in the first quarter of the season, and Cirelli has had one of the toughest workloads in the league in terms of offensive competition. Still, Cirelli and the Lightning are shutting down some of the league’s best in that time, only giving up 1.88 expected goals against per 60 minutes of play — 0.51 per 60 less than his teammates. Unlike the last couple of seasons, Cirelli has more support around him to elevate his two-way game. He tends to share the ice with Ryan McDonagh, whose shutdown presence has helped revitalize Tampa Bay’s top four. Just like McDonagh’s helping ease the workload for Victor Hedman, Cirelli is for the Nikita Kucherov line. Brandon Hagel has been the perfect fit on Cirelli’s wing; the two aren’t just neutralizing their opponents’ offense, they’re forcing them to play defense as well. The duo has earned a 67.6 percent expected goal rate in their minutes so far and is making an impact on the scoresheet. With 22 points in 20 games, Cirelli is scoring at a career-high pace of 3.40 points per 60. While scoring shouldn’t drive the Selke conversation, Hagel’s production and play-driving could finally help him get recognition for his elite defense. GO DEEPER NHL awards watch: Kirill Kaprizov is the early MVP front-runner Hype-o-meter: 8/10 Unfortunately for the Canucks, a lot of the talk around Elias Pettersson picked up where it left off last postseason. Despite making moves to solidify the winger depth around him — like swapping Ilya Mikheyev out for free agent Jake DeBrusk — the franchise center underwhelmed in the early goings of the season. Advertisement But with a new-look top line, Pettersson is finally back on track and performing like the difference-maker this team needs. The switch came against the Blackhawks earlier this month when Kiefer Sherwood got the boost alongside Pettersson and DeBrusk in place of Conor Garland. Sherwood was one of the bright spots in Vancouver to open the season. He has helped the Canucks gain the zone with his entries, is super physical, and makes life hard for opponents on the forecheck. And he chipped some much-needed depth scoring in a bottom-six capacity and added energy to the lineup. Now, he’s proving he can keep up and complement the team’s best on the top line with his passing and scoring chance creation, along with his physical edge. This line made an instant impact against the Blackhawks and has only built on it. And the timing couldn’t have been better for the Canucks, who were already down Brock Boeser when the trio was put together and then lost J.T. Miller two games later. This trio has only been together for 56 minutes of five-on-five play, and small samples can inflate results. But that doesn’t take away from how impressive they have been together over this last stretch of play. With DeBrusk-Pettersson-Sherwood on the ice, the Canucks are thriving with a 64.8 percent expected goal rate which is one of the best marks among any line combination with at least 50 minutes of play under their belt. And most importantly, considering how short-handed the team has been, the results back that up. Their offensive zone control is turning into goals, with a 6-1 edge in scoring in their minutes. Hype-o-meter: 7.5/10 Connor Hellebuyck, Juuse Saros and Igor Shesterkin are expected to sit atop the goalie charts. The three are among the elite bona fide starters left in the league. But they aren’t the only goaltenders excelling. Heading into Wednesday night’s matchups, Lukas Dostal sat at the top of the league in goals saved above expected at 16.8 — just a shade above Hellebuyck. Despite facing one of the most challenging workloads in the league, Dostal has been a game-breaker for the Ducks. Advertisement Joey Daccord is showing that last season wasn’t a fluke, with nine quality starts in 15 appearances and the third-best goals saved above expected in the league ahead of Wednesday night. He has stepped up in a big way in Seattle and has earned the starting net. The same is true in Utah with Karel Vejmelka. After a breakout in 2022-23 in Arizona, he fell below average last year and lost the net to Connor Ingram. While Ingram hasn’t followed that up this season, Vejmelka has rebounded in a big way with 12 goals saved above expected through 11 games. When Joseph Woll, the projected 1A in Toronto, was sidelined to open the season, it was Anthony Stolarz to the rescue. He put up sparkling numbers across his first five starts and continues to earn his minutes in rotation with Woll. In Calgary, Dustin Wolf has emerged as the front-runner in the Calder Trophy race. He is a major reason why the Flames sit in a playoff position right now. Logan Thompson has helped the Capitals surprise this season as well. He looks like one of the best goalie adds of the summer, along with Stolarz. Even Cam Talbot and Mackenzie Blackwood have earned praise for their starts behind bad defensive teams.  Hype-o-meter: 7/10 What makes the Devils such a threat? Their elite one-two punch down the middle has something to do with it. Jack Hughes is the more well-known superstar, but Nico Hischier can’t be underestimated, either. Just look at his performance on Monday night against Nashville. In Hischier’s five-on-five minutes, the Devils outshot the Predators 18-7, earned 79 percent of the expected goal share, and had a 2-1 edge in scoring. Oh, and Hischier had a hat trick. That came just a few games after a dominant game against the Panthers, where his usual strengths — his playmaking and solid defense — were the shining elements. Hischier’s back-to-back performances against Florida ended a small blip in the first quarter where his game trended down for a short stretch. But he has rebounded back to the heights of the early-goings of the season. Heading into Wednesday night’s game, that play has earned him a 55 percent expected goal rate at five-on-five while being tasked with matchup minutes in New Jersey. Like Cirelli, Hischier’s making a statement through the first quarter of the season as one of the best two-way centers in the league. That could add some heat to the Selke conversation instead of just the usual race for second place behind Aleksander Barkov. It could even earn him some late-ballot Hart votes if he keeps driving the Devils. Advertisement Hype-o-meter: 6.5/10 Brock Faber and Jonas Brodin picked up where they left off last season. They were stout in their own zone in their first couple of games together and helped bolster Minnesota’s offense. But when Jared Spurgeon was sidelined early lineup adjustments were made — including moving Jacob Middleton to Faber’s left. The 2023-24 season wasn’t too kind to Middleton, who seemed to be missing his mainstay partner Spurgeon. But playing with Faber this season seems to have revitalized his game. In 287 minutes together at five-on-five, they have earned about 53 percent of the expected goal share while shouldering minutes against top competition and outscored opponents 16-6. Faber is the driving force of that — he is already building on his impressive rookie season with more shutdown play. The fact that Middleton is clicking there allows for more balance on the blue line behind them. Unlike last year, the Wild don’t have one strong pair to lean on. When Spurgeon returned to the lineup, he landed in a familiar spot alongside Brodin. And the two have quickly rekindled their chemistry on the second pair. The Wild are controlling play with a 64 percent expected goal rate, and much of that is thanks to their stingy play. Minnesota has only conceded 1.45 expected goals against per 60 with this duo on the ice, which is among the best in the league. This top-four has helped the Wild renew their identity as one of the best defensive teams in the league, and that seems to be benefitting their goaltenders after a rough last season. Hype-o-meter: 6/10 The Sharks are projected to finish 32nd in the league with just 67 points. That’s a part of the process. But despite all of their flaws, the vibes feel different. Coaching is a part of it, with a fresh voice behind the bench in Ryan Warofsky. Management bringing in veterans to complement the up-and-coming talent, like Tyler Toffoli, Mikael Granlund, Alex Wennberg and Jake Walman, has made a difference, too. Each one has been a better contributor than expected and given this team a surprising offensive punch some nights, along with up-and-comers William Eklund and Fabian Zetterlund. Advertisement Then, of course, there’s Macklin Celebrini. On the season as a whole, the production isn’t as eye-catching as it could be. And concerns are emerging below the surface, considering his number relative to his teammates. But there have been glimpses of his skill — and that started Night 1 of the season when he attempted a gusty spinning pass that ended up in the back of the net. That star power was on display again on Monday night in a three-point performance when the Sharks dominated the Kings, even if his underlying numbers were suspect. That game on Monday was a reminder of what feels different about this Sharks team. San Jose is rising to the occasion against stronger opponents and staying in games longer than expected (some of which is thanks to that better-than-expected goaltending from Blackwood). Their games against the Rangers and Sharks earlier this month are reminders of that. Same with their 3-0 comeback against Pittsburgh to force overtime and their rally against the Red Wings for an overtime win just one game later. The Sharks may not be good or have any hope of climbing up the standings. But they’re a lot more fun and disruptive this season. — Data collected before Wednesday night’s matchups via Evolving-Hockey, HockeyViz, Hockey Stat Cards, All Three Zones, and Natural Stat Trick.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,John Tavares has started strong for the Maple Leafs. Will he stay in Toronto?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5949308/2024/11/28/john-tavares-maple-leafs-contract-talks/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 10:00:16 GMT","Leafs management and John Tavares’ agent Pat Brisson of CAA Hockey have engaged in a series of discussions throughout the fall, say sources.","NHL TORONTO — Steady as a metronome, John Tavares is keeping a consistent beat in his 16th NHL season. The loss of the Toronto Maple Leafs captaincy? The prospect of playing out an uncertain contract year? A new head coach with different priorities and ideas about how the game should be played? None of these realities has knocked Tavares off course. Advertisement With the sands shifting at his feet and no shortage of things he might worry or wonder about, the 34-year-old centre has instead put his head down and poured all of his energy into pushing forward. That’s what new Leafs coach Craig Berube appreciates most about Tavares, who has 20 points to show for 21 games so far. The coach calls him a “true professional.” “A guy who prepares like that day in and day out — every day — he’s going to keep playing and playing at a high level,” Berube said. Ideally for Tavares, he’d love to keep playing in Toronto. More than six years after choosing his hometown team following a high-profile free agent courting period — the San Jose Sharks, Dallas Stars, Boston Bruins and Tampa Bay Lightning were the others given a chance to pitch him face-to-face at his agency’s Los Angeles offices in late June 2018 — Tavares has little interest in testing the open market for a second time next summer. He and his wife Aryne have planted deep roots in the city. They’ve got a growing family with sons Jace and Axton and daughter Raelynn, all born since Tavares signed a $77 million, seven-year contract with the Leafs. Plus the original objective of bringing a Stanley Cup to Toronto remains. The team has qualified for the playoffs in each of his six seasons and Tavares scored the series-clinching goal in overtime when the Leafs eliminated Tampa Bay from the first round in 2023. He was unavailable due to injury for the biggest postseason disappointment of this era in Leafs history, when Toronto squandered a 3-1 series lead to the Montreal Canadiens in 2021. Tavares neither projects to be, nor pretends to be, the same player he was when he signed his last contract. He’s going to be taking a pay cut this time around. The question is exactly how much less he’ll make. Advertisement Leafs management and his agent Pat Brisson of CAA Hockey have engaged in a series of discussions throughout the fall, according to league sources briefed on those talks, but haven’t yet landed on an extension that works for all involved. At the end of a summer during which Tavares graciously relinquished the captaincy to teammate Auston Matthews — bringing his kids to the August press conference in No. 34 Matthews sweaters when the change was formally announced — there didn’t seem to be any real urgency on a contract extension. It was only natural to wait and see how everything fell into place under Berube. And with Tavares celebrating his 34th birthday on Sept. 20, gauging where he was at on a personal level made sense, too. The on-ice results have been strong so far. They tell the story of an athlete who is still highly driven to perform at the highest level. Not only is Tavares on pace for 35 goals and 77 points, the Leafs have enjoyed a strong territorial advantage during his even-strength minutes by generating 55 percent of expected goals and scoring 71 percent of the actual ones. When Matthews went down with injury this month, Tavares stepped into the top-line centre role and has helped the team go 7-2-0 without its best player. “He’s had a terrific start to the year,” Leafs GM Brad Treliving said of Tavares during a recent interview with The Athletic’s Pierre LeBrun. “He’s handled everything so well.” Given his rate of production, the list of comparables the Tavares camp can bring to the table covers veteran players earning as much as $6.5-$7 million annually. For example, Claude Giroux had 0.85 points per game in his platform season when he signed a three-year deal in Ottawa carrying a $6.5 million AAV in July 2022. Los Angeles Kings captain Anze Kopitar was fresh off a campaign of 0.9 points per game in 2023 when he signed a two-year extension with a $7 million AAV. Advertisement Both of those players were at similar stages of decorated careers to where Tavares finds himself now. On the Leafs side of this negotiation, they naturally want to keep the contract number down. Every bit of cap space counts in Toronto. They might point to the $5 million Patrice Bergeron earned, including bonuses, during his last season in Boston. Or even the last two years of Joe Pavelski’s career with the Dallas Stars, when he took home $6 million and $5.5 million, respectively. They are the only team that can offer Tavares the chance to keep playing at home. And while the Leafs continue to value Tavares’ play and the intangible qualities he brings — helping set an example for the organization’s young players and even opening his house to Matthew Knies and Fraser Minten when they first arrived in Toronto — they need to preserve the ability to invest elsewhere on roster upgrades as he ages and becomes less productive. Given the dynamics at play, it wouldn’t be surprising if the sides landed on a compromise that sees some of the money deferred beyond the life of the next contract. The Leafs used that mechanism to lower the cap hit on Jake McCabe’s recent extension and both sides in this negotiation are believed to be open to exploring a similar type of structure for Tavares. For his part, Tavares seems to have a realistic view of where he’s at in his career and what he’s up against. He cites work done on his skating with consultant Paul Matheson in recent years as an example of something that’s helped him push the limits of his performance. A former No. 1 NHL draft pick who entered the league with massive expectations and became a 1,000-plus point scorer, he’s trying to strike the balance between leaning into his longtime strengths and adding new elements to his game. “I’ve called it an evolution a lot over the last couple of years,” Tavares said. “I truly think that’s what it is. I can’t try to compare myself and my game to 10 years ago or my first year that I came here, things like that. “A lot happens within the league, within the team, within yourself and you gain so much more experience and knowledge.” Advertisement Historically, star players have often had to wait before signing fourth NHL contracts that take them into their twilight. While Pittsburgh Penguins captain Sidney Crosby and Tampa Bay Lightning captain Victor Hedman — who signed new deals last summer — are two exceptions to that rule, consider the list of those who recently finished out third contracts entirely before getting their next one: Giroux, Pavelski, Bergeron, Alex Ovechkin, Steven Stamkos, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang, among others. Should that list grow to include Tavares this year, there’s no reason to expect any uncertainty it creates to derail a promising season. He’s a master at remaining in the moment and believes the contract situation will ultimately resolve itself. “I’m playing the game at its highest level,” Tavares said. “I get to play on a great team with great players and I just try to enjoy that. Where I’m at now, I know I’ve got a lot left in the tank, but also I think there’s a great appreciation for just what I’m doing every day.” (Photo of John Tavares and Auston Matthews: Andrew Francis Wallace / Toronto Star via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The long-serving central defender has missed the last four Premier League matches with a calf injury sustained during the warm-up before the 2-2 draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers at the Amex Stadium in October. Advertisement Head coach Fabian Hurzeler said at his press conference on Thursday morning: “Lewis will be an option. He will be back in the squad.” Dunk, 33, is unlikely to come straight back into the starting line-up, due to the form of Brazilian Igor Julio alongside Dutch international Jan Paul van Hecke. Brighton have lost narrowly at Liverpool and beaten Manchester City at home and Bournemouth away in their last three league matches. Turkey international full-back Ferdi Kadioglu remains doubtful with a toe injury which has ruled him out of the last two games, but Yankuba Minteh is back in the squad having missed the last five matches through injury and sickness. Tariq Lamptey is also back in squad contention after injury. Brighton will go second in the table in the table if they win on Friday night but Hurzeler is expecting a tough test against bottom-placed Southampton after they pushed leaders Liverpool hard in Sunday’s 3-2 home defeat. “There is no easy opponent in this league,” said Hurzeler. “Southampton proved it last week and that is a warning for us to be ready for this game.” GO DEEPER Kaoru Mitoma finally looking his old self after taxing second Premier League season (Matt McNulty/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Anthony Edwards unloads on Timberwolves, calling them 'soft' and 'front-runners'",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5954552/2024/11/28/anthony-edwards-postgame-comments/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 06:34:36 GMT",Timberwolves have lost four in a row and sit in 12th place in the Western Conference at 8-10.,"NBA After the Minnesota Timberwolves gave away a 12-point lead in the final seven minutes of the game against Sacramento to lose their fourth straight, star guard Anthony Edwards did not hold back in his assessment of what is ailing the Wolves this season. In a candid and no-punches-pulled postgame interview, Edwards called his team “soft” and said they were “front-runners” who could not seem to hold up to any kind of adversity and lamented the fans booing them on their home floor. The 115-104 loss dropped the Wolves to a disappointing 8-10 on the season. They have lost seven of their last nine games, and most of them have followed a similar script. They fall down by double digits, claw back to take the lead and then fade down the stretch. Advertisement This time the Wolves led 98-86 with 7 minutes. 17 seconds to play in the game. The Kings outscored them 29-6 the rest of the way to win easily. “We look like front-runners for sure tonight,” Edwards said. “We was down, nobody wanted to say nothing. We got up and everybody cheering and f—–g hype. We get down again and don’t nobody say nothing. That’s the definition of a front-runner. We as a team, including myself, we all was front-runners tonight.” Edwards led the way with 29 points, five rebounds and five assists. But after a 5 of 5 start to the game, he was just 4 of 19 the rest of the way. One of the misses was an ill-advised stepback 3-pointer with the Wolves up 10 points in the fourth. It led to an easy runout for Keon Ellis and jump-started the Kings’ comeback. As he always does, Edwards made sure that the criticism he levied toward the team started with his play. “I’m (going to) put this one on me,” Edwards said. “We made all the right plays. If I’m the guy, I’ve got to make those shots down the stretch. I missed a couple shots and they made shots. So, I’m (going to) take this one.” The Wolves entered the season with high expectations coming off of a run to the Western Conference finals last season. But a major trade right before training camp that sent Karl-Anthony Towns to New York for Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo has sapped them of the chemistry and cohesion they had last season. Edwards has been one of many players frustrated by the jagged start. “We soft as hell as a team, internally,” Edwards said. “Not to the other team, but internally, we soft. We can’t talk to each other. Just a bunch of little kids. Just like we playing with a bunch of little kids. Everybody, the whole team. We just can’t talk to each other. And we’ve got to figure it out, because we can’t go down this road.”  The Wolves have started a four-game homestand with two losses to the Houston Rockets and Kings, which included lackluster defense and glaring collapses in the fourth quarter. They have Thanksgiving off and then host the LA Clippers on Friday. “I’m trying to get better in that aspect, figure out what the hell to say to get everybody on the same agenda because everybody right now is on different agendas,” Edwards said. “I think that’s one of the main culprits of why we’re losing because everybody out there got their own agenda. I guess their imagination of what’s supposed to be going on, and what’s happening.” Advertisement The fans are taking out their frustrations on a team that has played with poor body language and low energy for most of the season. During both of the most recent home games, the Wolves have been booed loudly when the turnovers come in bunches and the defense cannot get stops at the rim. “However many of us it is, all 15, we go into our own shell and we’re just growing away from each other,” he said. “It’s obvious. We can see it. I can see it, the team can see it, the coaches can see it. The fans f—–g booing us. That (stuff) is crazy, man. We’re getting booed in our home arena. That’s so f—–g disrespectful, it’s crazy.” As players left the locker room after the game, they spoke of rediscovering a connection that has never formed this season. Edwards has almost always had a positive disposition, rain or shine, but his words on Wednesday night were laced with frustration from being unable to find the answers yet this season. “We’re just so negative right now. Last couple of years, we were like this,” Edwards said, clasping his hands together. “And I feel like we’ve gradually grown away from each other, which is the craziest thing because most of us have been together. We’ve got two new players, that’s about it. Everybody else has been together.” (Photo: David Berding / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Ohtani, fresh off a World Series win and a National League MVP season with the Los Angeles Dodgers, asked the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on Tuesday for a hearing to regain ownership of sports cards authorities seized from Mizuhara. The hearing was granted and scheduled for Dec. 20. Advertisement Mizuhara pleaded guilty in June to bank and tax fraud after stealing millions from Ohtani. Between January and March of 2024, Mizuhara purchased baseball cards on online resale platforms eBay and Whatnot, intending to resell them. Ohtani wants those items back, arguing they were bought with his money. In addition, Ohtani wrote to the court that “a quantity of personally signed collectible baseball cards” with his image were wrongly in Mizuhara’s possession when they were seized, and he seeks their return as well. Mizuhara stole from Ohtani via unauthorized access to his bank account. The Dodgers fired Mizuhara in March. Mizuhara’s sentencing was set for Dec. 20 but was delayed Wednesday to Jan. 24. The hearing had originally been scheduled for Oct. 25. In court filings, Mizuhara’s forfeited items are described as “collectible sports cards found in silver and black Panopply case; collectible sports cards found in gray Panopply case; box containing collectible sports cards; card wrap device; and plastic card protectors holders.” (Photo of Ohtani and Mizuhara in December 2023: Kirby Lee / Imagn Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Johni Broome, Auburn dominate in Maui Invitational championship with win over Memphis",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5954103/2024/11/27/auburn-memphis-maui-invitational-championship-result/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 00:57:08 GMT","Auburn big man Johni Broome scored a team high 21 points, 16 rebounds, six assists, four blocks and one steal.","NCAAM LAHAINA, Hawaii — There was no signature moment, no singular play that proved Auburn is the best college basketball team in the country. But that’s kind of the point, isn’t it? Death by a thousand papercuts is how Auburn coach Bruce Pearl prefers his team to play. It’s wave after wave — fitting, given this week’s locale — of different types of talents, all of them perfectly square puzzle pieces that complement one another and need no set order to fit together. Then you put the apparent best individual player in the country, All-American center Johni Broome, in orange and blue, too? Advertisement Well, you get No. 4 Auburn winning 90-76 over Memphis in Wednesday’s Maui Invitational championship game. This one win is only the cherry on top of a three-day confirmation, or coronation, that the Tigers are as good as any team in the country. Kansas beat Duke this week to remain undefeated, and it’s tough to demote an unbeaten blue blood from the top spot. Auburn has as good a case as any, having won three top-12 games in the first month of the season for the first time in program history. If casual college hoops fans didn’t know Broome’s name before, they certainly do now. En route to earning tournament MVP honors, Auburn’s big man — whose tip-in with under two seconds left against No. 5 Iowa State completed the Tigers’ comeback win, who nearly had 20 and 20 against No. 12 North Carolina in the semifinals — saved his best for last: 21 points, 16 rebounds, six assists, four blocks and one steal. “The Player of the Year doesn’t really matter to me,” Broome said, holding his wooden ball-shaped MVP trophy. “I care about winning.” Still, a masterpiece marvelously done by Auburn’s maestro. Early work for 4👌 pic.twitter.com/bVgmcfxlvw — Auburn Basketball (@AuburnMBB) November 27, 2024  “I believe,” Pearl said, “we’ve got the best front line in college basketball.” It’s hard to argue with him. No forensics expert is needed to confirm Broome’s fingerprints all over Auburn’s win, straight from the jump. The game was always in the palms of his oversized hands. On the opening possession, the 6-foot-10 graduate stroked the first of his two three-pointers and broke out the celebration he has all week — thumb and pinky out, shaking his hand aloha-style — jogging backward down the court. Two possessions later and posted up on the block with two Memphis defenders trapping him, Broome picked up his head — something he couldn’t always do when he arrived on the Plains three seasons ago — and dished out the first of his five first-half assists (which tied his season-high) to a cutting Miles Kelly; he eventually finished with six dimes, one off his career-high of seven. Advertisement Broome got it done defensively, too, stuffing Memphis’ de-facto MVP Tyrese Hunter on an early turnaround jumper, for one of his three first-half blocks. So, yeah, Broome was critical to Auburn’s 11-2 lead barely four minutes in. “You let a team get out 9-0 on you, that’s the No. 4 team in the nation,” Memphis coach Penny Hardaway said, “you can’t recover from that.” Even worse news for Memphis? Pearl’s team is much more than just Broome. It’s a lot like the crashing Pacific: coming in waves, neverending and pulling you back down the second you think you’ve found your footing. Four other Tigers — Dylan Cardwell, Chas Baker-Mazara, Denver Jones and Chaney Johnson — had at least five first-half points. And fitting with Pearl’s larger stylistic preference, eight different players saw at least five first-half minutes. The 6-foot-11 Cardwell, who had scored four points combined thus far in Hawaii, is perhaps the best example of that ideology; the fifth-year center broke out for 18 points and six assists — both career-highs — while benefitting from Broome’s broader gravity. “It’s a blessing to have him on my team,” Cardwell said of his frontcourt mate. 7 for 7🤫 pic.twitter.com/DtnI205shc — Auburn Basketball (@AuburnMBB) November 27, 2024  Meanwhile, Memphis — which has been the surprise of this tournament and upended No. 2 UConn on Monday before toppling Tom Izzo and Michigan State on Tuesday — would’ve been lost if not for leading scorer PJ Haggerty, whose 15 at the break constituted nearly half of the Tigers’ total scoring efforts. There is one stat that speaks both to Auburn’s excellence and Memphis’ frustration. Hunter, who made 12 3-pointers the last two days, went scoreless in the game’s first 20 minutes; his first field goal didn’t come until three and a half minutes post intermission when he made one of the falling-away treys he’s seemingly mastered here in Maui. Advertisement “Me being a basketball player that played at the highest level, I understood what they were going to do to PJ and Tyrese. They were going to make it hard,” Hardaway said. “Why wouldn’t you, when those were the two hottest guys in the tournament?” If not for Pearl earning a technical foul with under a minute left in the first half — which gifted Memphis guard Colby Rogers four free free-throws — then Auburn’s halftime lead would’ve easily been 20-plus, instead of only 16. Not that a 47-31 deficit was anything Memphis, or any team in attendance of the tournament’s 40th anniversary, was capable of making, anyway. And without skating right over the second half, what more is there to say? Memphis never got things within 13 after intermission. Hardaway’s Tigers finished the game shooting 50 percent overall and 67 percent from 3 — and still got clobbered. Broome’s drive-and-dunk with 3:17 to play put Auburn up 21, and his punching that one down was as final a punctuation point as any. It was just a matter of the final margin from there. Although, does the exact margin matter? “Those guys have paid their dues and they’ve gone through their bumps and bruises,” Hardaway said. “They came to win today, and we just couldn’t overcome that.” That wasn’t just a Memphis problem, though. The same affliction also befell Iowa State, North Carolina, and before this tournament, Houston. No one has had a solution so far and a way to slow down Pearl’s Tigers. Duke gets the next crack — maybe home-court advantage inside Cameron Indoor will be of some assistance — but with a top-five offense and defense, there aren’t many flaws Auburn’s foes can exploit. Instead, for three straight days, Auburn made its case as the country’s top team, behind Broome and his ballyhooed supporting cast. It was the dominant team here in Hawaii, at least, in a field that featured four top-12 sides. Advertisement And now? Auburn will be a deserved Final Four frontrunner as it flies home. Five teams have won the Maui Invitational and gone on to win the national championship — and after this week, Auburn fans are rightfully dreaming they could be the sixth. “Obviously, Maui is a prize,” Pearl said. “This has been a great springboard, but the confidence that we’re going to get from this is we know we can play with anybody. … If we stay healthy, (if) we continue to get God’s blessing, we’ll be in position.” Broome is one of the toughest individual covers in the sport and a legitimate stretch center who also protects the rim on the other end. He’s a matchup nightmare. The rest of Auburn’s roster fits so well around him, giving Pearl umpteen different combinations. He can play Broome at the five alone, at the four alongside Cardwell — or even sit both and play the 6-foot-7 Baker-Mazara in spot minutes at the 5. It’s the same deal in the backcourt. JP Pegues led Furman past Virginia in the NCAA Tournament two years ago, but has struggled so far this season since up-transferring to the SEC — and yet Pearl can afford to be patient with him since he also has five-star Taahad Pettiford, lockdown defender Denver Jones and Georgia Tech transfer Miles Kelley. That doesn’t even factor in Chaney Johnson and Chris Moore as do-everything wing guys, who take Auburn’s physicality up another notch. Defensively, perhaps the most impressive thing about the Tigers is how they take opponents out of their offense. After the Memphis win, Auburn tops nationally in defensive assist rate, meaning opponents struggle to share the ball more against Pearl’s team than any other. (Memphis only had seven assists against 11 turnovers on 28 made shots.) Between that, the Tigers’ defensive rebounding, and their length on the wings and in the frontcourt, it’s hard for other teams to get any easy looks. The gauntlet of the SEC will test that theory, and the Tigers won’t realistically go undefeated. It looks like it’ll take a nuclear shooting night to down this team.

A three-time All-Star and four-time Gold Glove winner, Crawford left his mark on the Bay Area during 13 seasons. In June 2021, he became the franchise’s all-time leader in appearances at shortstop with 1,326, breaking a record held by Hall of Famer Travis Jackson. He also had the third-most hits by a shortstop in franchise history, with 1,392. Advertisement The 37-year-old spent 2024 with the St. Louis Cardinals, but before that had spent his entire career with his hometown team, which drafted him in the fourth round in 2008. He became a fixture in the Giants lineup in 2011 and helped them reach the playoffs in 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2021. “Growing up in the Bay Area and going to games at Candlestick, I always dreamed of playing for the San Francisco Giants,” Crawford wrote in a post on Instagram. “Being drafted by my hometown team and spending most of my career with them far surpassed any dream I had as a kid. I definitely pretended to win a World Series in my backyard – but winning two? That was beyond my wildest dreams. I always dreamed of being the shortstop for the Giants, but never could I have imagined breaking the team record for the most games played at the position. “As a kid sitting in the stands at Pac Bell/SBC/ATST/Oracle Park, I would picture myself playing a game there, but I never imagined I’d end up playing the MOST games there. From a grand slam in my debut, silencing the crowd in Pittsburgh, to two unforgettable parades down Market Street, and more memories than I can fit in a single post, the 13 years in the Bay Area were nothing short of extraordinary.” During his time in San Francisco, he batted .250 with 146 home runs and 744 RBIs. He had arguably his best season towards the end of his Giants stint when he hit .298 with career highs in home runs (24) and RBIs (90) in 2021. “Watching Brandon play was an absolute privilege for not only me but for Giants’ fans everywhere,” Giants President & CEO Larry Baer said in a news release. “He was an All-Star, Gold Glove and Silver Slugger winner, a two-time World Series champion, and a Lou Gehrig and Willie Mac Award winner, that always carried himself with class, honor and respect. Advertisement “The Giants have been incredibly blessed to have had Brandon as part of the franchise for 16 years — really for his entire 37 years, first as a young fan, who will ever forget that indelible photo of him leaning on the railing at Candlestick Park when there was a possibility that his Giants might leave San Francisco — and as this chapter closes on his career, his legacy in the game will be celebrated by fans, teammates, and future generations of players who look up to him by the example he set.” The Giants announced plans to honor Crawford, who totaled more than 6,300 plate appearances and was worth 30.9 fWAR, at Oracle Park on April 26. “It was an honor to get to know Brandon as a friend and as a teammate,” Giants president of baseball operations Buster Posey said in a news release. “From the first day we were both drafted in 2008 to our final year playing together in 2021, it was an honor to play alongside him for 14 years. Whether it was the clutch moments like the grand slam he hit in the 2014 Wild Card Game in Pittsburgh, the franchise-record, seven-hit game he recorded in Miami, or the dazzling defensive plays and acrobatic throws he made over and over again, Brandon made his mark in a way few athletes ever do.” (Photo: D.

My esteemed colleague Steve Madeley has taken all the key bits from around the continent including: It’s all yours, with the link below: GO FURTHER Champions League briefing: Liverpool prodigy wins Mbappe battle, Bellingham booed, USMNT pair shine Getty Images A bit more reaction here, now from Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti from our correspondent, Mario Cortegana: 💬 “The result is correct. Liverpool have a good dynamic, they are on fire, they play with intensity... We defended well in the first half but we failed in some decisions in the last pass.” And on Kylian Mbappe’s penalty miss and difficult start to Madrid life: 💬 “It has happened to me many times, especially with strikers when they struggle to score. There is a medicine, which is to be patient. It’s a moment for him, especially after this missed penalty, everyone has to support him. “It could be he lacks a bit of confidence. When things aren’t going your way, you have to play simply but sometimes you complicate things more. But you can’t judge a player for a missed penalty.” Advertisement Getty Images It was more wisdom from Arne Slot at half-time that helped his Liverpool team get over the line against Real Madrid. Here’s a snippet of what he told TNT Sports:  💬 “It’s not the same as any other one (game). They are the reigning champions and have dominated Europe recently. They are a pain in the arse for Liverpool many times as well!   “But it’s not just the result, it’s the way we played. “We were a bit impatient (in the first half). Every time they threatened us it was from us being sloppy or forcing it. I said we could play with more intensity so forget the shirt you face, do what you always do, and we can create more chances even than we did in the first half.” Getty Images That was not the night Jude Bellingham was hoping for on his return to England with Real Madrid. Here is his reaction to TNT Sports:  💬 “They just took control of the game. We never really maximised the spells we had in possession. When we got the ball back, we tried to force the counter-attack a few too many times and turned it over so much. “They kept us in a place where we couldn’t really harm them and I just think they were more up for it than us to be honest, which is really disappointing to say. “The penalty (miss) is not the reason we lost. As a collective, we weren’t good enough on a night they performed better than us, and it’s as simple as that.” Getty Images You can tell from the smile plastered over the face of Alexis Mac Allister that this was one of the good nights at Liverpool. Here he is, speaking to TNT Sports: 💬 “When you play against teams like Real Madrid, it is always nice to score but the most important thing is that we won it and in a really good way.  “We dominated the game, and we needed this guy (Caoimhin Kelleher) a couple of times. But thank god he was there and he really played well again tonight.” Getty Images What an emergence from Caoimhin Kelleher this season, especially when facing penalties. The Liverpool goalkeeper, stepping in for the injured Alisson, has faced four penalties in 2024-25 for club and country — and he has saved three of them. Harry Kane for England against Ireland in this month’s international break at Wembley has been the only player to score against him from 12 yards. Finland’s Joel Pohjanpalo (vs Ireland) and then Southampton striker Adam Armstrong, plus Mbappe tonight, complete the list of Kelleher’s spot-kick successes.  Here are the major talking points from tonight — all dissected by Gregg Evans, Tomas Hill Lopez-Menchero and Mark Carey. Enjoy! (...but probably more so if you’re a Liverpool fan) GO FURTHER Liverpool 2 Real Madrid 0: Are Slot’s team the best in Europe? And what now for Mbappe? Advertisement Liverpool fans will quickly turn their focus to this weekend’s huge game with Manchester City after their side finally chased the ghosts of Real Madrid away for the first time in 15 years. The good news is that Liverpool will be heavily favored in each of their next three matches in Europe — against Girona, LOSC Lille and PSV. The more concerning development is how serious Ibrahima Konate's late injury will turn out to be…  Getty Images Here’s something no one expected, new format or not: Real Madrid are in danger of falling out of the top 24 and failing to advance past the Champions League group stage. Madrid are reeling — this was their first loss to Liverpool in 15 years and first time ever losing three group stage games in the Champions League. Next up is a rematch against one of the more surprising success stories of this year’s Champions League: defending Europa League winner Atalanta.  Real Madrid defeated the Italian side 2-0 in the UEFA Super Cup in August, a game which also marked Kylian Mbappe's club debut (and first club goal). What a night for Liverpool, and it was deserved too. If you take Real Madrid’s penalty out of the full-time numbers below — for example, 0.80 of their expected goals created — then you can see how little Madrid created. Those numbers are below… FT: Liverpool 2-0 Real Madrid Real Madrid were missing some key figures, but this was a statement performance — and result — from the Premier League leaders.  Getty Images There were six other Champions League matches taking place at the same time around the continent. Here are the full-time results: Those six results join the two from earlier:  Getty Images Arne Slot’s decision to task Conor Bradley — a young player with very little Champions League experience — with keeping Kylian Mbappe quiet was another stroke of genius for the first-year Liverpool boss.  Bradley stymied Mbappe and the loaded Madrid attack throughout the 90 minutes at Anfield. He set the tone early with a perfectly timed tackle on an Mbappe breakaway chance that electrified the Anfield crowd, and never looked back from there, refusing to let the superstar get a quality chance at goal and winning balls all night long regardless of who he was matched up with. As if that was not enough, Bradley also had the assist on a give-and-go with Alexis Mac Allister for Liverpool's opening goal. Advertisement Getty Images Some concern for Liverpool after the final whistle with Konate staying down and needing treatment.  Back on his feet but hobbled off the field.  That’s a worry for Slot ahead of Sunday’s Premier League showdown with Manchester City here. Getty Images What a moment for Caoimhin Kelleher. Liverpool’s No. 2 goalkeeper was picked to start in place of the injured Alisson and got his star turn in the 61st minute, guessing right on a Kylian Mbappe penalty to keep Real Madrid from equalising. While Kelleher deserves credit, it was also an extremely poor strike from someone of the quality and stature of Mbappe as the Frenchman continues his rocky first season with Real Madrid. Getty Images Both Liverpool and Real Madrid have lived up to pre-match expectations.  One is the most in-form team in Europe and the other is struggling to perform at a top level and had a lot of absentees. Mbappe is singled out as he was signed for this type of game, and he was probably the worst player tonight."

The France international was forced off just before the hour mark of the 2-0 defeat at Anfield and replaced by right-back Dani Ceballos. Advertisement Tests carried out on Thursday confirmed the 22-year-old sustained a muscular injury in the biceps femoris of his left leg. It means he will be unavailable for Madrid’s next three La Liga outings against Getafe, Athletic Bilbao and Girona — as well as their next Champions League match against Atalanta on December 10. The former Rennes midfielder will be hopeful of returning for Madrid’s trip to Rayo Vallecano on December 14. The midfielder missed 12 games for club and country earlier this season with a left knee injury picked up in training prior to the UEFA Super Cup win over Atalanta in August. His absence will be keenly felt by Carlo Ancelotti’s side, who have seven games in a little over three weeks before their winter break. The club have been hit with a number of injuries this season. Eder Militao and Dani Carvajal are set for long spells out after suffering anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries while David Alaba is still working his way back from his own ACL tear. Camavinga’s fellow midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni is currently sidelined with an ankle knock while Vinicius Junior this week suffered a hamstring injury which is likely to keep him out for three weeks. The Champions League trip to Atalanta on December 10 is a possible target for the Brazil international. “Last year it wasn’t so different, we had this kind of problem,” Ancelotti said after the game. “Today another player went down and we have to put up with it. Hopefully Rodrygo or Tchouameni can come back for the next game.” Real Madrid return to action against Getafe in La Liga on Sunday.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How Aston Villa and Morgan Rogers were denied a late winner in their Champions League draw against Juventus,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/live-blogs/aston-villa-juventus-live-updates-champions-league-score-result/MrMc6Cp5A1ll/,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 23:01:30 GMT",Rogers thought he scored with the last kick of the game but the goal was controversially ruled out for a foul on goalkeeper Michele Di Gregorio,"UCL Advertisement live Updated 55m ago GO FURTHER Aston Villa 0 Juventus 0: Last-minute VAR drama, Kamara’s return and Weah’s central role  We are at that stage of the year where the games come thick and fast. No time for either of these two teams to rest on their laurels as they are back in domestic action in a few days' time. Aston Villa face a tough trip to Stamford Bridge on Sunday where they face Chelsea while, later in the day, Juventus go to Lecce looking to end a run of successive goalless draws. Advertisement Getty Images It's the Champions League briefing! And it is coming your way courtesy of Steve Madeley — give it a read below. GO FURTHER Champions League briefing: Liverpool prodigy wins Mbappe battle, Bellingham booed, USMNT pair shine Opta/X A look at this snazzy graphic from our friends at Opta shows that Villa were consistently ahead of Juventus tonight in terms of the expected goals total (xG), which values chances depending on the position shots were taken. Neither side did enough to score, though! Getty Images Jesus Gil Manzano was not a popular man as he walked off the field this evening. Several of his decisions during the match were a little questionable, including a very harsh yellow card for Tim Weah, for example. But the officiating team got the big calls right, for me. The Juventus penalty shout after the ball hit Pau Torres' hand was rightly waved away, and frankly, the big call at the end for the foul on the goalkeeper was correct too, for me. Diego Carlos is a big, strapping lad and goalkeeper Michele Di Gregorio was well set to catch the cross before his body is noticeably shunted to the side by Carlos bumping into him. That puts him off balance and means he can't grab the ball.  Is it on the softer side? Sure. Would players have got away with that 20 years ago? Definitely. Did Di Gregorio sell it a bit? Yes. None of those preclude the referee giving a foul. And imagine the histrionics from Emi Martinez if it were the other way around...  For about 30 seconds, the Aston Villa players and fans thought they had stolen all three points with the last kick of the game.  Getty Images Casting our minds away from the late frustration briefly, that was a really important clean sheet for Unai Emery's men. The fact they have kept more shutouts against Bayern Munich and Juventus than they have in all of their Premier League matches this season is... fun. While Digne was put through the wringer by the fleet-footed Conceicao, Torres and Carlos were very good in the heart of the defence. And any backline supported by Emi Martinez is onto a winner. Emery was clearly very happy with that clean sheet. Advertisement Getty Images After sharing praise for the performance of his players, Unai Emery was not drawn into any controversial comments about the referee's late decision. ""(I'm) very happy. We got one point but we were very competitive and very serious,"" he told TNT Sports. ""We respected the opponent as well, we dominated parts of the match and the last action is clear. ""It's the interpretation of the referee. We know here in England, 80 per cent (of the time) it's not a foul. But maybe in Europe, it's a foul."" Getty Images Over on our discussion page, Aston Villa fans are unsurprisingly furious with the referee's decision to deny Morgan Rogers a late winner.  Jim M.: Not a foul. Mic P.: Poor refereeing all game, letting things go. And makes himself the center of the game by making that call. What a disgrace.  Michael H.: Scandalous decision. Got jumped into. Tomos H.: Frustrating all around. Seen better refs in the National League. The rare Juventus fan in our discussion took a more even-keeled approach. Thomas A.: Feels like we got away with one. Keepers are protected but we really defended well and deserved the point all in all. We definitely had our chances to win the game and more or less gave as good as we got.  A fascinating game that one, particularly in the second half. The statistics don't quite tell the tale of the match but, for all their possession, Juventus never looked much of a threat. The Athletic's Jacob Tanswell and Greg O'Keeffe were on hand to deliver The Briefing from Villa Park — you can check it out at the link below. GO FURTHER Aston Villa 0 Juventus 0: Last-minute VAR drama, Kamara’s return and Weah’s central role Want a visual representation of just how close Francisco Conceicao was to giving Juventus the win? Check out that graphic... Advertisement Getty Images Before the match, Aston Villa's fans were serenading their goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, officially the best in the world after winning the Yashin Trophy at the Ballon d'Or awards for the second year running. And you could see why after this glorious save from Francisco Conceicao's header, described so eloquently by Ed here. What made the save so good is the fact he was coming across his goal, and must have only seen the ball late after his eyes tracked across the throng of players cluttering his eyeline in the middle of the penalty area. Once he did see the ball, it was pure instinct and physicality. The dexterity, agility, and reactions were incredibly impressive. Say what you like about some of his antics but he's a heck of a goalie. Getty Images ...to some of the other players to impress tonight. For Villa, Emi Martinez made that super stop, and Pau Torres was nerveless in playing out from the back under, at times, highly intense Juventus pressure. Boubacar Kamara broke up play nicely too. For the visitors, Federico Gatti was a rock at the back, while midfielder Manuel Locatelli moved the ball nicely too and Tim Weah did a decent job up front considering the lack of service and that he was playing out of position. Getty Images That's right, the player of the first half is also the player of the match. It might seem odd to nominate an attacker in what ended a 0-0 draw, but the 21-year-old winger was a constant threat, an omnipresent thorn in the side of poor Lucas Digne and the host of other players that tried to stop him. Despite being one of the smallest players on the park, his stooping header was inches away from crossing the line before Martinez's fantastic save, before he turned this way and that dizzyingly to win the free kick from Morgan Rogers, who must have had stars in his eyes. Diligent in defence too, it was an electric all-court performance from the Portuguese. Only on loan at the moment with the Turin side from Porto, there's a gentleman's agreement to give Juve a headstart in signing him permanently. Some showing. Getty Images There were six other Champions League matches taking place at the same around the continent. Here are the full-time results: Those six results join the two from earlier: Crvena Zvezda 5-1 Stuttgart, plus Sturm Graz 1-0 Girona. *Live on The Athletic — follow live reaction with our blog here. Watkins clearly wasn't happy with the performance of Spanish referee Jesus Gil Manzano, but stayed very calm in his post-match interview with TNT Sports. ""I've got to be careful what I say about the referees,"" he said. ""Like I said, the refereeing is a little bit different in this competition, they don't let things go as much. We're used to that now. ""Sometimes the decisions go against you and sometimes they go with you, but it's out of our control."" Advertisement Getty Images A very magnanimous Ollie Watkins spoke to TNT Sports immediately after the full-time whistle. The late controversy was, of course, the first topic of discussion. ""I think it's soft. Maybe in the Premier League, that's a goal,"" said the Villa striker. ""In Europe, the goalkeepers are protected a lot by the referees. It's one of those. ""To be fair, I think it was a 0-0 game so we'd have been lucky if we'd taken that (win) there."" Getty Images The mood inside Villa Park is not a happy one. The fans are fuming that their wild late celebrations were ruined by a very questionable decision. We can definitely file Juventus under lucky to get away with that one. The home supporters make their feelings towards the officials known as they leave the pitch before dishing out strong ovations for their players. In the end, that was a really fun second half despite the lack of a goal. Getty Images Di Gregorio has got away with one there — I'm not sure that's a foul.  Villa thought they had snatched it at the death."

The Mountaineers upset No. 3 Gonzaga 86-78 in overtime Wednesday in the quarterfinals of the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament on Paradise Island, Bahamas. That improves Darian DeVries’ first team to 4-1 and suggests big leaps since an 86-62 loss at rival Pitt on Nov. 15. Advertisement Also, it demonstrates the importance of the other DeVries, 6-7 senior wing Tucker, whose stint with the Mountaineers should be much shorter than his father’s. Down five with less than 20 seconds left in regulation, DeVries came off a screen and nailed a long 3-pointer to make it 71-69. After the ensuing inbounds pass, he picked Nolan Hickman cleanly, took it the other way, got fouled and made two clutch free throws with 5.9 seconds left. That forced an extra session that was controlled by the underdog. DeVries, the two-time Missouri Valley Conference Player of the Year while playing for his father at Drake, ended up with 16 points, six rebounds and four assists. Teammate and Oklahoma State transfer Javon Small went off for 31 points. West Virginia moves on to play another surprise team in the semis, Louisville, which crushed No. 14 Indiana 89-61. Braden Huff had 17 off the bench for Mark Few’s team, and Khalif Battle scored 16. But Gonzaga (5-1) got just 12 points and 2-for-16 shooting combined from stars Ryan Nembhard and Graham Ike. The Bulldogs came in with one of the most efficient offenses in the country but had a mortal 1.026 points per possession and shot 40 percent from the floor. West Virginia was more physical and more precise in its execution late. Gonzaga already has a season-opening rout of Baylor on its resume and has major tests ahead, beyond the Bahamas – Kentucky on Dec. 7 in Seattle and UConn on Dec. 14 in New York.

Five Western Hockey League clubs submitted bids ahead of September’s deadline for the 106th Memorial Cup — the largest number of CHL teams vying to host the tournament in more than 15 years. Advertisement Among them were the Medicine Hat Tigers, the Brandon Wheat Kings, the Lethbridge Hurricanes, and the Spokane Chiefs (one of the WHL’s six American markets, fresh off the Saginaw Spirit’s successful hosting of the 2024 tournament in the United States). The Tigers positioned their bid around 2026 NHL Draft sensation Gavin McKenna’s draft year — and could have potentially iced a roster around him that included 2024 top-five pick Cayden Lindstrom, 2024 second-rounders Andrew Basha and Ryder Ritchie, as well as the Ruck twins, a pair of fellow 2026 prospects. Instead, the Rockets, who successfully won the bid to host the 2020 Memorial Cup and had nearly completed preparations for it when it was canceled due to the COVID pandemic, have won the chance to host again. “We are truly devastated to not be bringing this event to Kelowna,” then-Memorial Cup Committee Chair Tom Dyas said in March of 2020. “We’ve been working so hard with our local committee, partners, sponsors and volunteers over the last year and having to cancel this event is something that we never expected. We know that the health and safety of the community needs to come first, so we are supportive of the CHL’s decision to cancel the 2020 Memorial Cup.” Back to B.C.

We get the chance to bring this event back to the Okanagan and while it has been a long grind to get it, we’re excited for the city as well as our season ticket holders. It’s an opportunity for something special.” Advertisement Rockets head coach Kris Mallette — who was on the bench when the Rockets lost to the Oshawa Generals at the 2015 Memorial Cup and is friends with some of the alumni who won the 2004 Memorial Cup (Kelowna’s only CHL title), including Josh Gorges, Shea Weber and Blake Comeau — remembers the loss as a “game of inches.” “I was talking to somebody today about how many chances we had to put that game away and then Anthony Cirelli had probably played five minutes in that game and comes out the hero — one mistake and it’s in the back of your net,” he said. He also remembers the heartbreak of March 2020. “We thought it was just going to be a two-week thing and we’d be back playing and finish the season. And then it was two weeks, and a month, and then nothing. It was hard. And it was hard for our organization as well because we gave up quite a few assets to try and build that team, and the following season not being able to recoup that with a couple of 19-year-olds to restock the shelves, it made for some difficult times in Kelowna over the last few years,” Mallette said. “That was heartbreaking for everybody because it was a lot of work.” WHL commissioner Dan Near said the Rockets losing out on hosting in 2020 wasn’t a major factor in the decision to re-award the team the 2024 event. “In this case it was a clean slate, so there was not a concession,” Near said. “All five of the clubs going in, that was made clear because I think if there was a scenario where it was a make-good or something to that extent, I don’t think that everyone would have bid. It was made clear that you’re going to have to win and you’re going to have to beat four other teams.” The Rockets’ 2025-26 roster could be headlined by 2024 top-10 pick Tij Iginla. On Wednesday morning, Mallette, who is in Oshawa as head coach of Team CHL for the CHL USA Prospects Challenge, broke the news to his players on a Zoom call. Advertisement “There’s a lot of guys from our team who are going to be a part of it, we talked about it at the beginning of the year,” Mallette said. “It’s also a little bit bittersweet because at the same time, we’re going to have to build and have some additions and some of our players are going to have to be traded away and I think some guys realize that.” (Photo: Francois Laplante / FreestylePhoto / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

O’Connell’s expected return comes after Minshew suffered a season-ending broken collarbone against the Denver Broncos on Sunday. O’Connell had replaced a benched Minshew against the Broncos in Week 5, and the plan was for him to be the starter the rest of the way — until he got hurt against the Rams. Advertisement He’s played in four games this year, starting only two of them, and completed 63.4 percent of his passes for 455 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. O’Connell started 10 games as a rookie last season, including all nine of Pierce’s games as interim head coach. He finished the season with a 62.1 completion percentage, 2,218 passing yards, 12 touchdowns and seven interceptions and posted a 5-5 record as the starter. The Raiders always expected to have O’Connell back this week. He’d been sidelined on injured reserve since Week 7, but he’s made steady progress and was able to begin throwing outside of practice last week. He was designated to return from IR on Monday and was a full participant in practice Tuesday, which made it clear he’d be good to go against the Chiefs on Friday. The path was cleared for O’Connell to take over as the starter after Minshew suffered his injury. O’Connell actually replaced Minshew in Week 6 before hurting his thumb.

The award, handed out by Italian newspaper Tuttosport, is voted for by a group of 50 journalists. Yamal also picked up UEFA’s equivalent, the Kopa Trophy, last month. There was double success for Barcelona with Vicky Lopez of Barcelona Feminin taking home the Golden Girl award. GO DEEPER Perfection, by Lamine Yamal Analysis by Barcelona correspondent Laia Cervello Herrero Watching Yamal at this summer’s European Championship, it was easy to forget how old he is. The Spain and Barcelona winger turned 17 the day before the July 14 final against England, but the talent and intelligence he showed while playing with such expectation was unbefitting of a teenager. Most players in Yamal’s position would likely get carried away with their newfound fame. Not Yamal, who during the tournament told radio station Cadena Cope: “I only have one friend; and my cousin, who is also my friend.” Sources at the club had long promised there was a “brilliant” player from their La Masia academy, the likes of which they had not seen since Messi. That player, Yamal, made his first-team debut at 15 years and 290 days old in April last year, becoming the club’s youngest-ever La Liga player. Advertisement Yamal’s talent would make him a star anyway, but Barcelona supporters have also got carried away because of their desire to find their ‘New Messi’. That was heightened by the emergence of photos, which have now gone viral, of Messi with a baby Yamal in December 2007, fuelling the sense that the kid really was the ‘chosen one’. The experiences of Ansu Fati and other young players at the club show why Barca cannot take too many risks. But talent like Yamal’s also can’t be contained, and he is already a key player for Barcelona, just as he is for Spain. He has scored six goals and provided eight assists in 16 games so far this season. Perhaps tellingly, Barca have started three games without him in La Liga — against Osasuna in September and against Real Sociedad and Celta Vigo this month — and won none of them.

Walter only began his role at the MKM Stadium in July, signing a three-year deal to replace Liam Rosenior. The 49-year-old German had been backed to implement a bold, attacking strategy but leaves after winning just three of his 18 league and cup games in charge. Advertisement A 2-0 defeat at home to Sheffield Wednesday on Tuesday night proved to be Walter’s last stand, despite owner Acun Ilicali giving Walter his full backing ahead of the game. Hull are now in danger of a season fighting relegation to League One, a year after they narrowly missed out on the Championship play-offs under Rosenior. That seventh-place finish was ultimately deemed unsatisfactory by Ilicali, who complained that he and Rosenior did not share the same long-term vision for the club. Walter, who had previously managed Stuttgart and Hamburg, was appointed to implement a philosophy more to Ilicali’s liking but was unable to bring the best out of a squad that was overhauled in the summer. It took until September 20 for Walter to win his first game in charge of Hull but that run of three straight victories against Stoke City, Cardiff City and Queens Park Rangers proved to be a false dawn. Just three points were taken from a possible 27 after Sheffield Wednesday became the latest club to pile the pressure on Walter this week. Ilicali had appeared on BBC Radio Humberside ahead of the game to assure fans that Walter would remain in charge regardless of the result but the vocal opposition heard at the MKM Stadium led to the sacking on Wednesday afternoon. Ilicali has now sacked four managers since arriving as Hull’s owner in January 2022, with Walter joining Grant McCann, Shota Arveladze and Rosenior.

The Manchester United Supporters Trust (MUST) also criticised the club for failing to consult fans on a move that eliminates concessions for children and over-65s. Advertisement United sent an email to members of the Fans Forum on Tuesday night announcing the sudden changes, explaining how all remaining tickets for home games this season will be priced at £66 each whatever the age of the person buying them. In the email, seen by The Athletic, United say that more than 97 per cent of available tickets for confirmed matches have already been sold, with five age-related discounts applied, but they now need to make the change on the those seats yet to be allocated to help improve “operational efficiencies” and “stabilise revenues”. United also outlined how all future cancelled or donated season ticket holder tickets will be sold at adult price and that they are removing the 25 per cent discount for UEFA Europa League knockout fixtures. Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has led a cost-cutting regime since gaining control, with 250 staff made redundant and a tightening on spending. The club are also exploring how to fund a new Old Trafford. The price rises have infuriated supporters. MUST reacted by issuing a statement which read: “This means that for an adult member to take their kid to a game in the remainder of this season will cost £132. Well over double the minimum price they could pay to do it today. And this change is happening overnight, immediately. “The club has provided zero consultation on the matter, neither with the Forum nor the Fan Advisory Board nor MUST. “Suffice it to say, that the idea that the fans must pay their ‘fair share’ for the club’s excesses and/or mismanagement — and above all, the Glazers lack of investment over two decades — is offensive. “We fans have done everything we have been asked. We have cheered the players on even in the face of substandard performance. We have gone to matches and abided by the new usage rules for tickets. We have taken on a price increase this year. Advertisement “There is a risk that this is only the opening salvo of what will surely be massive pressure to implement a significant price rise for next season. Once they have got used to charging £132 for a parent and child to come to Old Trafford, will they really go back to the old pricing levels for next season? “If the club has a need for short term capital they should issue new shares, as they did when INEOS first arrived, and bring in funding from existing or new shareholders. “We have objected to this action in the strongest possible terms, both for the action itself and the complete lack of consultation, which is a step backward based on the process we had agreed with the club before INEOS’ arrival. GO DEEPER How Sir Jim Ratcliffe's INEOS took charge of Manchester United's football and business “Over the coming days MUST will be seeking urgent discussions with the club to get them to listen to fans’ concern at this policy. United fans have sucked up a lot. We will not be silent on this and we need to be prepared to resist any attempts to further drive up ticket prices.” MUST also insist the 97 per cent figure is misleading as it does not include season tickets that will be returned and resold at the higher £66 price. Pressure group The 1958, members of which met with club executives in October including chief operating officer Collette Roche and director of fan engagement Rick McGagh, announced a peaceful protest in response to the ticket increases. A gathering will be held at the Trinity Statue outside Old Trafford before the Everton game on Sunday. Future home games in the Carabao Cup, FA Cup and Europa League will have discounted tickets available. United’s email says: “We appreciate we usually try to provide more notice of, if not consult around any changes, but this is something we have had to review quickly, not providing the usual opportunity for consultation. “It was a difficult decision following recent changes at the club but ultimately the increased revenue will also support investment in the team and contribute to football success.” GO DEEPER High ticket prices, low supply: The Premier League's age timebomb (Top photo: Stu Forster/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The contract will be a one-year deal. The Giants released Jones last Friday after benching him earlier that week. Advertisement Jones departed New York in his sixth season after the franchise drafted him No. 6 in 2019. The Giants started this season 2-8 with Jones in the lineup and he completed 63.3 percent of his passes for 2,070 yards, eight touchdowns and seven interceptions through those 10 games. The 27-year-old quarterback has played in 70 games for New York, throwing for 14,582 yards with 70 touchdowns and 47 interceptions and tallying a 64.1 completion percentage. Jones cleared waivers, as expected, following his release, as it was unlikely another team would claim the $13.8 million of guaranteed money remaining on his contract. Jones signed a four-year, $160 million extension with the Giants ahead of the 2023 season. After an up-and-down career in New York, Jones’ landing spot might offer some much-needed stability with a quarterback-friendly coach, Kevin O’Connell, at the helm. Jones was drafted as the heir to two-time Super Bowl champ Eli Manning. But over six years, Jones played under three headed coaches: Pat Shurmur, Joe Judge and Brian Daboll. The hope was that Daboll would bring in new energy and his quarterback transformation skills to New York when hired in 2022. Daboll had worked in Buffalo as the offensive coordinator with Josh Allen. It seemed to work for one season, with Jones playing his best football that first 2022 season, which culminated in a lights-out playoff victory in Minnesota. That earned him a four-year, $160 million deal. But injuries derailed his 2023 season and Jones never looked that sharp again during his tenure in New York. But perhaps a fresh start with former NFL quarterback journeyman O’Connell is just the recipe for Jones. — Charlotte Carroll, Giants beat writer This move makes a world of sense for the Vikings. The only quarterback they currently have under contract for 2025 is J.J. McCarthy, who is recovering from a torn meniscus. Adding Jones provides Minnesota with another potential path and does not eliminate any options. It does not rule out starting quarterback Sam Darnold returning next season. It does not get in the way of McCarthy taking over when he’s ready. It simply provides Minnesota with another potential backup option for 2025. Advertisement In the short term, Jones will be able to assist the Vikings’ quarterback room. The Vikings, meanwhile, will get to know him as a player. That shared relationship could give the Vikings an edge this offseason if Darnold signs elsewhere for a sizable contract, and if the Vikings feel Jones could back up McCarthy. That Jones chose Minnesota is a testament to O’Connell, whose work with Darnold this year warrants praise. Darnold is having his best-ever season, and he is one of the primary reasons the Vikings are 9-2. — Alec Lewis, Vikings beat writer (Photo: Luke Hales / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

A LIV Golf spokesperson declined to comment on the matter. O’Neil has worked as CEO of Merlin Entertainments since 2022, overseeing one of the world’s biggest operators of theme parks and resorts, including Legoland properties. Merlin announced Wednesday morning that O’Neil was departing for “another opportunity” and standing down as CEO effective at the end of 2024. Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox.
 Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox. With O’Neil expected to be announced as LIV CEO, it’s unclear how much power Norman, 69, will maintain. The two-time Open Championship winner is still a current member of LIV’s board of directors. O’Neil is most well-known for his time as CEO of Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, the parent company of the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Devils. In an eight-year run, he oversaw multiple construction projects and expansion opportunities and stewarded the merger of holdings between Sixers and Devils owners Josh Harris and David Blitzer. He oversaw “the process,” the Sixers’ much publicized, often celebrated, occasionally maligned, rebuilding that resulted in a franchise turnaround but, ultimately, limited playoff success. “I remember what it was like when we first walked in here, and to think we’ve grown this business, over $2 billion in value over six times in eight years, that’s what I do. Hypergrowth, super growth,” O’Neil told the Associated Press at the time of his 2021 departure. Advertisement In taking over LIV, O’Neil will steer the league through a cloudy future determined by lengthy negotiations between the PGA Tour and the PIF. The two sides, having first come together in June 2023 to create a new entity with combined assets (including LIV), have yet to finalize a structure. Negotiations blew past the original deadline earmarked for the end of last year. It is still anticipated that PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan and PIF governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan will ultimately finalize some agreement that will need approval by DOJ antitrust officials. Where LIV will fit in that remains to be seen. The league has evolved toward an increasingly worldwide schedule that, while growing the brand internationally, creates complications in securing a long-term TV carrier in the United States. With 10 of 14 events scheduled right now for 2025, only three are in the U.S. and none before June. O’Neil, an alumnus of Villanova and Harvard Business School, also held front-office positions with the New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, Philadelphia Eagles and New York Rangers.

Vicario suffered the injury during the first half of Tottenham’s 4-0 victory over Manchester City last Saturday but completed the full 90 minutes. Advertisement A scan revealed the extent of the damage and the 28-year-old had an operation on Monday. Postecoglou did not give a precise timeline for Vicario’s recovery but said he will be unavailable for months. Fraser Forster has started three games in all competitions for Spurs this season and will step up in Vicario’s absence. The 36-year-old has played nearly 150 times in the Premier League but his last appearance was in May 2023. Brandon Austin and Alfie Whiteman both came through Tottenham’s academy but have never played for the senior side in a competitive fixture. While Vicario is unavailable, Forster will be expected to play in crucial league games against Chelsea and Liverpool as well as the Carabao Cup quarter-final tie with Manchester United next month. Postecoglou was asked before Tottenham’s Europa League tie against Roma on Thursday evening if they would consider signing a goalkeeper who is out of contract. “That’s not going to happen,” he said. “That’s why we’ve got a squad of players here. I don’t think signing a free agent now is going to help us. “Fraser I’ve known for a long time and he’s such a strong character within the group and ready to play. Brandon’s improving all the time and Alfie’s been at the club for a while. Whenever they’ve been asked, in terms of the training capacity they bring, we’re happy with what we’ve got.” Tottenham could decide to sign a goalkeeper from another club in the January transfer window. Postecoglou said Vicario’s injury has not affected their transfer plans but did not definitively rule out a new goalkeeper. “We’ve got an injury, and I think any club that gets a significant injury in their goalkeeper assesses where they’re at,” he said. “It’s not just another injury but at the same time, like I said, it is just one injury. We’ve been dealing with setbacks for a while. There’s a lot of work. Advertisement “We talk about depleted squads. We had two school boys on the bench at the weekend. We’ve been very shallow for quite a while but because I don’t come up here and highlight it every week, it doesn’t dismiss the fact that we’ve kind of learned to deal with these things, and this is another challenge for us. “January, we’re always working towards the next window of what the best scenario is for us, and a lot of that will depend on where we’re at from the squad perspective and the game’s perspective. Just this injury doesn’t change any plans for January.” Tottenham return to Premier League action against Fulham on Sunday.

Oregon, Ohio State, Texas and Penn State remained the top four in the rankings and Notre Dame moved up to No. 5. Miami (10-1) moved up to No. 6, Georgia (9-2) was No. 7, and Tennessee (9-2) is now No. 8, up three spots from last week. Continue reading here. GO FURTHER College Football Playoff rankings: Alabama, Clemson on outside looking in as Arizona State surges As the season approaches its final two weeks, jostling for at-large bids continues for teams in the upper echelon of College Football Playoff competition.  At this point, there are teams with CFP hopes both as a conference champion and as an at-large. There are others, such as Big 12 contenders BYU and Colorado, which need to win their conference to reach the Playoff. The same scenario exists for Group of 5 squads Boise State and Tulane. Continue reading here. GO FURTHER College Football Playoff at-large contenders: Cases for, against and fatal flaws Advertisement This point can’t be made enough as we head toward a College Football Playoff with four teams from the second-best conference and three from the best: The more bloated a league gets, the less its collective might matters. So, yeah, the SEC has the most quality teams as usual. But it is down this season in terms of elite teams. It might not have one at all. It has savaged itself. And even with a Playoff bloated to 12, the largest collection of pretty good to really good doesn’t win you anything. GO FURTHER Is SEC football mediocre this season? College Football Playoff rankings don’t lie Getty Images The selection committee claims it will value teams that make it to the conference championship and lose. So it will be fascinating if SMU and Miami face off in the ACC championship and Clemson beats South Carolina — would the committee dare put the Tigers in over the loser of that game? Or if Texas A&M beats Texas and then loses to Georgia in the SEC championship, how will it treat what would be a four-loss A&M compared to potentially three-loss Alabama or Ole Miss? I’m sure the committee is just hoping to avoid these scenarios. I, however, would love to see how it unfolds. Getty Images Clemson has the most ordinary resume of any team on the board and to be No. 12 is surprising. The Tigers have played just three FBS teams with winning records and lost two of those games. The only win came last week against Pittsburgh. I wonder if a win this week against No. 15 South Carolina could elevate the Clemson past Indiana. On the flip side, could a South Carolina win against No. 12 Clemson move the Gamecocks past Ole Miss and Alabama despite losing to both teams? Getty Images As bad as Saturday seemed for the SEC, was it a bit too reactionary? The newest rankings have three teams comfortably in the field - No. 3 Texas, No. 7 Georgia, No. 8 Tennessee - and three more looming in the top 15, plus No. 20 Texas A&M, which can get the automatic bid by winning its next two games. Yes, it's still more likely the SEC only gets three teams rather than the four or even five it looked like it might get last week. But you look at these rankings and wonder if the committee still respects the SEC so much there's going to ultimately be a fourth team in, whether or not Texas A&M wins out. Getty Images Warde Manuel says the committee was ""impressed with some of the things Indiana did"" in its 38-15 loss to Ohio State. Presumably, more with the opening touchdown drive and garbage-time touchdown drive than with the dropped punt, OSU punt return for a touchdown and 45 minutes in which the Hoosiers' offense was absent. Advertisement Getty Images The projected top-four seeds that go to conference champions and receive a bye in the first round also remained the same as last week: Oregon (Big Ten), Texas (SEC), Miami (ACC) and No. 11 Boise State (Mountain West) are in those spots. Getty Images Alabama dropped to No. 13 in the latest College Football Playoff rankings Tuesday night and Mississippi fell to No. 14, leaving the SEC with only three teams in the projected field of 12 heading into the final weekend of the regular season. Getty Images I do not understand how Clemson can be ranked No. 12 right now, ahead of two SEC teams in Alabama and Ole Miss that beat Georgia, when Clemson was blown out by Georgia. Beat South Carolina and we can start the conversation. But by doing this now, it feels like we’re setting up a situation where Clemson could jump Indiana or even an ACC championship game loser (if it’s SMU vs. Miami) into an at-large spot. Getty Images We're all figuring out how this expanded playoff will work, and it can be confusing when the rankings and seeds don't match up. That dynamic has the potential to be very, very interesting. The SEC hasn't been shy about its desire for more spots. What if Alabama beat Auburn and Clemson loses to South Carolina? Then we're looking at the possibility of the No. 12 Crimson Tide being left out of the field in favor of, say, an Iowa State team that rises to 15th. I'm fine with that scenario, but it lead to some fascinating reactions. Getty Images The race for the four seed should be fun to track the rest of the way. If Boise State wins out, will the Big 12 champ have done enough to jump the Broncos? The conference will need either Arizona State, Iowa State or BYU to win out to have a chance. Can Tulane sneak in if Boise stumbles and/or chaos continues in the Big 12? And similarly, if UNLV can knock off Boise State to win the Mountain West, could the Rebels jump Tulane for one of the five automatic bids? The four conference-winning byes is sure to draw some criticism in the coming weeks, but that fourth seed will make for good drama. Advertisement 1.Oregon  2. Texas  3. Miami  4. Boise State ------------------------ 5 OSU vs 12 Arizona State 6 PSU vs 11 Indiana 7 Notre Dame vs 10 SMU 8 Georgia vs 9 Tennessee It is worth noting that Arizona State, the top ranked Big 12 team, is ranked 16th overall. Clemson is ranked 12th in the actual rankings and Alabama is 13th.  Getty Images Army falling out of the rankings is worth noting. I was curious whether there was a semi-realistic scenario where the Big 12 beat itself up so much that the American Athletic Conference champion slid ahead of, say, a 10-3 Big 12 champion. Barring complete chaos, I don't think that can happen. If Tulane wins the AAC, the victory over Army wouldn't be enough to push the Green Wave ahead of an Iowa State or BYU. It's also hard to see Army going from outside the top 25 to ahead of the Big 12 champ.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Hunter Dickinson's ejection brings the best out of Kansas' leaders in closing out Duke,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5951710/2024/11/27/hunter-dickinson-ejection-kansas-duke/,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 12:45:47 GMT","Dickinson's flagrant-2 foul will be the water cooler conversation, but Kansas may have learned more about itself after he left the floor.","NCAAM LAS VEGAS — Longtime Kansas assistant Norm Roberts delivered a motivational speech to the Jayhawks before their game against No. 11 Duke and its star freshmen. “No cares about the names on the back of the jerseys,” Roberts said was his message. “All they care about is the name on the front. This is Kansas versus Duke.” Advertisement In this transactional era of college basketball, Roberts would usually have a stronger point. But Kansas has two key contributors who have spent a combined 10 years on campus in Dajuan Harris Jr. and KJ Adams. It feels a little more special to the fan base to see players they’ve come to know almost as well as family put on that jersey on big stages. A game that nearly turned on a kick that led to Kansas star Hunter Dickinson’s ejection instead ended in a 75-72 win for the Jayhawks. And the difference? “Harris and Adams, in particular, how many games have they been in like this?” said Duke coach Jon Scheyer, who has a group still getting to know each other and feel what it’s like to play in these big games. “I think it showed. Their poise down the stretch, their toughness.” One reason for Roberts’ message was the worry that Adams would make this game personal. Adams had not played to his standard lately since injuring his ankle in a win against North Carolina on Nov. 8 and said he’s been operating around 70-80 percent. The one-year anniversary of his mother Yvonne’s death after a long battle with cancer was on Nov. 17. “It was a tough week,” Adams said. “It’s been a hard mental block these last two games.” GO DEEPER ‘I didn’t know, Mom’: The driving force behind the most improved player in college basketball Then came this game and the assignment to guard Duke’s Cooper Flagg, the most hyped prospect to come through college basketball in years. Roberts knew that matchup could decide the game, but he needed Adams to approach it in the right way and avoid foul trouble. “You kind of want to make it you versus him,” Adams said. “But when you do that and you mess up the team’s plan, that’s the last thing you want to do.” Adams picked up his second foul with 5:50 left in the first half and Kansas ahead 30-20. When he checked back in two minutes later, the lead was down to two and remained there at halftime. Duke was fortunate to be that close because Flagg took just two shots in the first half and scored one bucket, a pull-up jumper when Adams was on the bench. Advertisement Flagg finished with 13 points but scored only once all night on Adams, a tough lefty scoop with 2:29 to play. “I think KJ showed a lot of people tonight that you can be an elite player at this level and not be a prolific scorer,” Kansas coach Bill Self said. “Because he did it all.” Kansas had to have scoring from a wider cast of characters, though, because this was not Dickinson’s night. Dickinson missed five straight shots in 80 seconds during a stretch midway through the first half when Kansas could have stretched its lead back to double-digits after a hot start. Then came the kick. With Kansas ahead 57-55, Dickinson missed a jump hook over Duke’s Maliq Brown, and the two tumbled to the floor as Brown tried to box out Dickinson. While on the ground, Dickinson’s right foot made contact with Brown’s face. A long review ensued, with the officials determining Dickinson’s kick was intentional and assessing a flagrant-2 foul, which ejected Dickinson from the game with 10:26 remaining. Hunter Dickinson was ejected after being assessed a flagrant 2 foul for kicking Maliq Brown. pic.twitter.com/lXR91RTiWX — ESPN (@espn) November 27, 2024  “I thought it was a good call,” Self said. “I thought the flagrant-2 may have been a little severe. I thought it was a definitely a flagrant-1. It’s a good lesson to learn. But the best thing about Hunter not being in the game was that Flory (Bidunga) was.” A year ago, losing one of Dickinson, Adams or Harris would have squashed Kansas’ chances. But Self brought in reinforcements for this season, signing five perimeter players out of the transfer portal and a backup for Dickinson in the five-star freshman Bidunga. On the possession after Brown made one of his free throws, he tried to attack the basket and Adams met him in the paint and took the ball from him like a bully on the playground. Then Brown fouled Bidunga, the second of four straight whistles against the Blue Devils, sending the freshman to the line. Bidunga made both and followed up a game-tying 3 by Duke’s Tyrese Proctor with an alley-oop dunk on a feed from Adams to give Kansas back the lead. Advertisement From there the final nine minutes featured two more lead changes, three ties and action almost good enough to make fans forget the kick. And every time Kansas needed a bucket late, it was Harris who set it up. Harris, who is often at his best in big games, led the Jayhawks with 14 points, nine assists and three steals. Twice Flagg got switched onto Kansas’ sixth-year point guard on defense, and both times Harris got by him and jumped in the air for assists, finding first Rylan Griffen for a go-ahead 3 and then Zeke Mayo for a runner that proved to be the game-winning basket. RYLO WHEN WE NEEDED IT‼️#PayHeed x @GriffenRylan pic.twitter.com/yaDVl1M3Rf — Kansas Men’s Basketball (@KUHoops) November 27, 2024  Harris had a name for the move where he jumps over the baseline — “the Juando drill” — explaining that the Jayhawks practice it and he knows exactly where he’s going with the ball when he leaves his feet. “These guys come up with a lot of crap that we don’t even know about it,” Self said when he heard of his point guard’s explanation. “I’ve never heard of a Juando drill. If he said it, it must be true.” The truth is Self trusts his point guard in any situation, whether he leaves his feet with a plan or not. There’s nothing Self loves more than his veterans finding a way when their back is against the wall. And although it felt like Kansas was in control for most of the game, Duke did have the ball down one in the final minute with a chance for a walk-off win. In a similar situation two weeks ago against Kentucky, Scheyer drew up an isolation play for Flagg, which backfired when the freshman spun and lost the ball. The design this time was similar — a ghost screen to try to distract the defense and an isolation for one of his best players — only this time the ball went to freshman Kon Knueppel, with Flagg running by on the ghost, which led to Adams switching onto the ball handler. That was the worst thing that could happen for Duke. Adams cut off Knueppel, who spun and left his feet, seeing both Adams and the long arm of Bidunga in front of him, and lost the ball. Griffen pulled it down, was fouled and made both free throws with three seconds left to put KU ahead by three. It was redemption for Griffen, who also had a key and-one bucket in the second half after going into halftime on Self’s bad side when he shot a 3 with 16 seconds left in the first half and the shot clock off, giving Duke back the ball and setting up a Proctor 3 that cut the lead to two at the break. Those are hiccups that happen with transfers who haven’t yet been programmed to play how Self wants. Adams and Harris are not perfect, but they’re close to it in their coach’s eyes. And there was Adams again when Knueppel heaved one last prayer at the buzzer, switching onto Knueppel and challenging the shot without fouling. Advertisement Self said afterward that it’s too early to call this a pivotal moment, but he’s felt like he’s had a team without an identity so far and now his guys might have one. The Jayhawks can win ugly and win without Dickinson carrying the offense, which he’d done in the Champions Classic against Michigan State. Adams echoed Self, saying it’s early and the Jayhawks cannot get too high because a lot of things could change. But later in the night, away from the microphone, after visiting with his family, Adams admitted this moment mattered. “To have a game like this kind of flipped the script,” he said. “I know she’s watching over me. And just to get my emotion back felt amazing today.” (Photo: Ethan Miller / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

But Acheampong appears to be back in the fold after joining in training with the senior side — in front of the watching media — ahead of their Conference League match at Heidenheim on Thursday night. Advertisement He was not part of the group that flew to Germany on Wednesday afternoon, however, but the fact the 18-year-old participated in the session at all is a positive sign.

Wesley Fofana, Romeo Lavia, Cole Palmer, Marcus Bettinelli and Ben Chilwell also stayed behind as they are not registered for the competition. Chelsea opened talks over an extension with the Acheampong, whose deal expires in 2026, earlier this season. The club thought an agreement was close only for negotiations to stall. Chelsea responded to the sudden delay by telling Acheampong he would not represent any of the youth sides, let alone Enzo Maresca’s senior team, and he has not seen any competitive action since. Maresca said last month it was “a shame” that Acheampong was out of the first-team picture and hoped a resolution could be found.

Davies signed a three-year deal in the summer of 2022 when Antonio Conte was manager. Like his close friend and Spurs captain Son Heung-min, Davies’ contract expires at the end of this season. In both cases, Tottenham intend to trigger the option that will keep the veteran players at Spurs for next season too.  GO DEEPER How will Spurs - and Fraser Forster - cope in Guglielmo Vicario's absence?  Even though Davies is no longer an automatic first-choice player at Tottenham, it is clear how highly is rated by Postecoglou and everyone at the club. He does not have the physical power of Destiny Udogie but is very capable of filling in at left-back when required. And when brought in to centre-back recently he has been immaculate. He was excellent at the Etihad Stadium last Saturday alongside Radu Dragusin, as they shut out City and put Spurs on track for one of the club’s greatest-ever victories.  When Spurs beat City in the League Cup last month, Davies had to come on for Cristian Romero in the second half and helped them see out the win. What is so telling about Davies is that he tries to defend as Postecoglou would want him to: high up the pitch, aggressively trying to win the ball back. When Spurs beat Villa on 3 November, the crucial goal that put them 2-1 ahead came when Davies aggressively stole the ball from Ollie Watkins, setting up an attack that ended up in Dominic Solanke scoring. He is a loyal and adaptable player who tries to carry out the manager’s instructions to the letter, just as he has been for different Spurs managers for over 10 years now. Advertisement Davies is the longest-serving Spurs player left, having joined in the summer of 2014 when Pochettino took over. That makes him and Son the last links left with that era and makes their experience especially important at the club today. At the start of this season, Postecoglou talked about how vital that was for the new generation of Spurs players. “They [Davies and Son] are both great guys, they understand what the football club is about,” he said. “It’s great when you have 18-year-olds walking into a dressing room and probably two of the first people who will go and greet them are Sonny and Ben. “They are outstanding people apart from being fantastic footballers. I think it is great and only right they get heralded for not just their longevity, but the service they have provided.” Now Son and Davies are both set to continue that service into next year as well.

The deal, which comes into effect on January 1, 2025, means Puma will produce the kits for the Portugal men’s and women’s national teams in addition to Portugals’ futsal, beach soccer, and e-Sports teams. Advertisement Puma already have existing deals in place with Manchester City, Milan, Borussia Dortmund, Palmeiras, and Marseille as well as the national teams of Austria, Iceland, Czech Republic, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Morocco, Egypt, Switzerland, and Paraguay. Puma CEO Arne Freundt said on the deal: “Associating with a top national team was one of our priorities in soccer and I am very excited to have a team as popular as Portugal in the PUMA Family. Given the large number of Selecao fans around the world and the great potential of the new generation of players, we are looking forward to the next major tournaments, such as the 2026 World Cup.” Puma signed a deal with former Portugal international Eusebio in the 1960s, going on to make the famous Puma King boots in honour of the forwards’s performance at the 1966 World Cup where he won the Golden Boot award. It is yet to be seen how the deal will affect Portugal’s all-time appearance maker and goalscorer Cristiano Ronaldo, who has been signed to Nike since 2003 and is one of the brand’s most recognised athletes. In 2016, the 39-year-old renewed his partnership with Nike in a new lucrative deal worth around €24m (£20m; $27m) per year. Upon signing that deal, the forward said: “I have an excellent relationship with this brand, I have great friends here and we work as a family. This is my brand.” Prior to their first deal with Nike in 1997, Portugal have previously had kit partnerships with Adidas, Olympic, Carne, and Marlec. Fernando Gomes, the President of the FPF, said: “We were very enthusiastic about the way PUMA interacts with fans and how it tells the story of each team it represents. We are very keen to develop an interesting range of products to satisfy our large fan base and supporters around the world.” Portugal are next in action against Denmark in the quarter-finals of the Nations League in March 2025.

The former Chelsea and England midfielder made a strong initial impression in an interview with Coventry owner Doug King last week and discussions have intensified over the past 24 hours. Lampard, 46, is now close to agreeing a two-and-a-half-year contract as the successor to Mark Robins, who was controversially sacked earlier this month after seven years in charge. Advertisement Joe Edwards and Chris Jones, who were part of Lampard’s coaching staff at Everton and during both spells at Chelsea, are expected to join him at Coventry. If an agreement is reached, it will be Lampard’s fourth permanent management job following spells in charge of Derby Country, Chelsea and Everton. He has been out of work since briefly returning to Chelsea on an interim basis towards the end of the 2022-23 season. King has faced criticism from Coventry supporters following his decision to sack Robins, who was the longest-serving manager in the Championship and the third longest-serving in the top four tiers of English football. After a turbulent period in their history, Coventry enjoyed a resurgence under Robins and reached the Championship play-off final in 2022-23, losing to Luton Town. They finished ninth last season having been in play-off contention for much of the campaign. Robins was sacked on November 7 after a poor start to this season left Coventry 17th in the Championship, with only goal difference keeping them out of the relegation zone. Writing in Coventry’s match programme on Saturday, King spelt out the importance of steering clear of relegation trouble and, ultimately, trying to return to the Premier League after a 24-year absence. He said he could not risk “squandering the launchpad” that was built under Robins’ management. Coventry remain 17th after taking two points from three matches under interim coach Rhys Carr, who said after Tuesday night’s 2-0 defeat at Burnley that he was managing day to day while waiting for clarification on an appointment. Wycombe Wanderers coach Matt Broomfield was another leading candidate for the Coventry job. Ruud van Nistelrooy was reported to have applied for the job following his spell in interim charge of Manchester United, but vacancies at Premier League side Leicester City and former club Hamburg are likely to hold more appeal for the former Netherlands forward. Advertisement Burnley, meanwhile, were interested in appointing Lampard after Vincent Kompany’s departure to Bayern Munich in the summer, before appointing Scott Parker as their new manager.

GO FURTHER Bayern Munich 1 PSG 0 – Paris risk Champions League exit, Dembele’s nightmare, ‘captain’ Kimmich Josh Musoke/The Athletic A Champions League table that makes extremely unpleasant reading for PSG fans. They need a huge upturn in European form if they are to make it into the next round. As for Bayern, they are still not quite where they would like to be but they are trending in the right direction. Inter are unbeaten and top of the pile while Manchester City... well, the less said about them the better! Advertisement Getty Images Not content with 40 goals across nine matches tonight? Well, you're in luck as there are nine more games coming tomorrow: 5:45pm GMT / 12:45pm ET 8pm GMT / 3pm ET *Covered live on The Athletic Getty Images Joshua Kimmich ran the show for Bayern Munich in the first half and while his influence may have faded a little in the early moments after the break, he was crucial to Bayern avoiding any slip-ups once PSG went down to 10 men.  He was central to everything good Bayern did in possession, putting in a fantastic performance on an important night for Vincent Kompany’s men. The Athletic's Oliver Kay, Sebastian Stafford-Bloor and Anantaajith Raghuraman delivered some brilliant, instant analysis from the Allianz Arena — check it out below. GO FURTHER Bayern Munich 1 PSG 0 – Paris risk Champions League exit, Dembele’s nightmare, ‘captain’ Kimmich Getty Images Luis Enrique took a risk by starting Matvey Safonov in goal over Gianluigi Donnarumma, and it's hard to overlook his mistake on a Joshua Kimmich corner as the difference in the match.  It's fairly easy to guess what Donnarumma was thinking as he looked none too pleased on the bench, while Bayern celebrated Kim Min-jae's goal off Safonov's error. That said, Safonov came through several times to keep PSG within striking distance in the second half, including a spectacular fingertip save off a fierce Jamal Musiala effort.  The Russian got just enough on that one to deflect the ball against the post and keep the deficit within a goal, and ultimately was not at fault for his team-mates' inability to score despite creating some quality chances while a man down. Getty Images After this defeat, PSG are in a real fix. As it stands, they are going to be eliminated at the first hurdle. They sit 26th out of 36 teams and 18 teams have a game in hand on them! And the only home game PSG have left is against Manchester City... Advertisement The Athletic  The Athletic’s signature match dashboard offers insights into the differences across the two teams tonight.  Bayern were cohesive across the pitch, with a structure that allowed them to dominate, while PSG were disjointed and struggled to feed their frontline or get their creative midfielders involved consistently. Getty Images At full-time Neuer, Kim and Upamecano celebrated as a little group on their own goal-line.  They looked secure tonight. Much, much more stable than against Barcelona and far less frantic.  A big improvement and as a measure of that progress, it’s now seven consecutive clean sheets as a trio. Getty Images With respect to Joshua Kimmich and Manuel Neuer, it was Kim Min-jae who had multiple key clearances as 10-man Paris Saint-Germain got closer to an equaliser than they probably had a right to, after Ousmane Dembele was sent off.  Add in the fact he was the lone goalscorer tonight, with credit to Matvey Safonov's error on Kimmich's corner kick, and Kim had perhaps his best night in a Bayern shirt since his 2023 arrival. PSG had their moments but in truth, most of that game went against them and they struggled to show the quality to force the issue themselves. Ousmane Dembele’s red card on 57 minutes didn’t help either. Here’s how the numbers looked… FT: Bayern 1-0 PSG Bayern did enough and deserved it, although PSG did at least carry a threat throughout the majority of the 90 minutes. They will hope that carries them through their remaining league phase fixtures.   So many goals in the Champions League tonight but the headline is, undoubtedly, Manchester City — on a run of five-straight defeats, remember — squandering a 3-0 lead and drawing 3-3 against Feyenoord at home. Elsewhere, there were massive wins for Barcelona, Bayer Leverkusen, Atalanta and, perhaps most impressively, Arsenal. Advertisement I’m glad Ed Mackey has brought up Harry Kane, because when you watch him play you can understand where some of the criticism comes from. There is now limited involvement in games when a team is not directing everything they do through his goal threat. He is having to search out the ball, but is now doing it with seemingly reduced mobility.  You can’t deny the quality of his goals record but this was another example of why the England skipper’s game is starting to feel less effective at times. Getty Images In the build-up to the match, Harry Kane faced criticism from former Bayern midfielder Didi Hamann for his reputation of rarely turning in the big games. And, despite the England's captain defence of himself in the pre-match press conference, his performance this evening did little to dispel the myth. He looked sharp at times with his build-up play in the first half but was a passenger for the majority of the second half. To his credit, Kane did create three chances for his team-mates but had just one shot and two touches inside the PSG penalty area.  Ousmane Dembele entered tonight's fixture with the most shots and touches in the opponent's box among all Champions League players who had yet to score a goal this season. The PSG winger will have to wait even longer to open his account for the season after being sent off in the 57th minute. Dembele showed his studs on a slide tackle against Alphonso Davies and though his feet did make fleeting contact with the ball, the Frenchman was handed his second yellow card of the evening. Before his removal, Dembele only added to his unsuccessful attempts total with five more shots and two on goal to give him 21 and five, respectively, on the season. Now, he will miss PSG's Champions League fixture against Red Bull Salzburg on December 10, meaning he will not have a chance to get on the scoresheet in Europe this season until 2025. Getty Images FT: Bayern 1-0 PSG There it is. The final whistle. Kim’s header, Safonov’s error, Dembele’s red card. Those are the headlines on a much needed Champions League win for Bayern — and an increasingly desperate situation for PSG in Europe this season.  90+3' Bayern 1-0 PSG One more chance? It’s a PSG corner and Safonov comes up for the delivery. Bayern win the header, keep PSG from getting the ball back into the box. Eventually Bayern win a throw-in, deep on their right. Advertisement Getty Images 90+1' Bayern 1-0 PSG We have FOUR added minutes on the way, and it remains Bayern pushing for a second goal — far more than PSG’s 10 men trying to force an equaliser. It looks like they’re run out of gas now. 89' Bayern 1-0 PSG This is starting to feel over now for PSG, as we enter the final moments. Muller breaks free again and sends a ball to the far post for Gnabry — but he can’t get a proper connection to turn it towards goal. 84' Bayern 1-0 PSG Time for another booking! This time, it’s Gnabry taking out Hamiki from behind to stop a counter. For those keeping count, that is the equaliser for Bayern. It’s now 3-3 on bookings, although that doesn’t include the second one that saw Ousmane Dembele sent off just before the hour mark."

Herbert failed to record a passing touchdown for only the second time this season. He completed 21 of 36 passes for 218 yards while rushing four times for 29 yards and one score.  The Chargers also lost the only other game Herbert failed to record a touchdown pass this season, a 17-15 road defeat to the Arizona Cardinals in Week 7. Getty Images The Los Angeles Chargers recorded just one sack against Lamar Jackson tonight.  It marked the fewest number of sacks in a game for Jesse Minter's defense this season since recording zero in a 17-15 loss to Arizona in Week 7.  Despite totaling 35 sacks this season, the Chargers will need to get more pressure on opposing quarterbacks going forward with six games to play.   Derrick Henry totaled 140 rushing yards on 24 carries tonight, hitting triple digits for the sixth time this season.  His total of 1,325 yards on the ground this season ranks second in the league, trailing only Saquon Barkley's tally of 1,392.   The Chargers will look to rebound on the road in Atlanta during Week 13 before heading to Kansas City to battle the Chiefs in Week 14.

Baltimore will then face the Giants in New Jersey during Week 15 before a matchup at home against the Steelers in Week 16. The Athletic After their battle on Monday Night Football, the Ravens and the Chargers have swapped positions in the wild-card standings in the AFC, with Baltimore overtaking Los Angeles for the No. 1 wild-card spot.  With the Broncos currently holding the third wild-card position, it is worth noting that Los Angeles and Denver will face off for the second time this season in Week 16 at SoFi Stadium. The Chargers beat the Broncos 23-16 in Denver during Week 6.   Following their loss against Baltimore, Los Angeles is now three full games behind Kansas City for the lead in the AFC West. The Chiefs beat the Panthers Sunday on a last-second field goal and the Broncos beat the Raiders comfortably in Las Vegas.  With the win over the Chargers, the Ravens cut into the Steelers lead in the AFC North, now trailing Pittsburgh by just a single game in the loss column. Pittsburgh lost a snowy affair to the Browns in Cleveland on Thursday Night Football while the Cincinnati Bengals were on a bye.  Getty Images Baltimore's three-headed rushing attack ran rampant over the Los Angeles Chargers tonight.  The Ravens totaled 212 rushing yards on 37 carries, averaging 5.7 yards per rush. Veteran tailback Derrick Henry led the way with 140 yards while Justice Hill added 55 yards, including a 51-yard touchdown.  It marked the fourth time this season that Baltimore rushed for 200+ yards in a game. John Harbaugh's squad now leads the NFL in rushing with 2,162 yards in 12 games.  Advertisement IMAGN Ladd McConkey was the lone bright spot among the Chargers wide receivers tonight.  McConkey registered six catches for 83 yards, continuing a productive rookie season. He's now registered four catches or more in 10 of 11 games this season.  His season totals are up to 49 catches for 698 yards and four touchdowns.   The Baltimore Ravens defense made things tough for Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert as tonight's game went on.  Zachary Orr's defense registered four sacks of Herbert, giving them 39 total this season.  Kyle Van Noy, Brandon Stephens, Josh Tupou, and Odafe Oweh each had one sack on the night.  Baltimore has now recorded the third-most sacks this season, sitting behind the Denver Broncos (44) and Houston Texans (42) for the league lead.   Lamar Jackson's dual-threat abilities helped the Baltimore Ravens pick up a crucial road win in Los Angeles.  Jackson threw two touchdown passes and rushed for one score tonight, marking the sixth time this season that he registered three touchdowns or more in a single game.  It's also the third time in Jackson's seven-year career that he's reached 30 combined touchdowns in a single season.   Justice Hill has been a key receiving threat out of the Ravens backfield this season, but the 27-year-old's longest career run truly iced tonight's win.  Hill's 51-yard scamper with 7:24 to play helped Baltimore ice an eventual 30-23 road win in Los Angeles. Hill's longest rush previously was a 17-yard run against the Dallas Cowboys back in Week 3.  He finished the game with 64 all-purpose yards on five touches.  Getty Images Derrick Henry continues to be a dominant force for the Baltimore Ravens, dicing up the Chargers defense on Monday Night Football.

That one is so on top of my mind right now.” Astute fans might remember that the San Francisco 49ers had slipping issues the last time the teams played, in the 2023 divisional round of the playoffs at a wet Levi’s Stadium. As was the case in January, the 49ers had all sorts of footing issues, but the Green Bay Packers had none. “There were definitely issues with the footing,” coach Kyle Shanahan said Monday. “It happened to our quarterback on a number of plays, but it happened to a bunch of guys throughout the game. Guys were fixing their cleats. Some did it pregame, some did right after the game (started). But that’s an issue at Lambeau that time of year.” The Packers had a 2-to-1 advantage in time of possession at halftime and finished with an advantage of 36:43 to 23:17. Thanks to two fumbles, an interception and two turnovers on downs, Green Bay’s average starting position was its own 44. The 49ers’ was their own 25.  The 49ers played 72 snaps on defense and 49 on offense, their fewest of the season. Here’s how the individual snaps broke down.

GO FURTHER Woody Johnson has given up on the season — what that means for Jets coaches and players (Getty Images) The Broncos have waived tight end Greg Dulcich, the team announced Monday. Dulcich, a 2022 third-round pick out of UCLA, had a promising rookie season with 33 catches and 411 yards in 10 games, but his progress was stalled by injuries. He was limited to only two games in 2023 by persistent hamstring injuries, followed by an issue with his foot. Dulcich was lauded by Denver's coach staff for his effort to get healthy ahead of his third season, but he struggled to make an impact in the first four games of the season and had been a healthy scratch on game days for the Broncos since Week 5. (Getty Images)              Are the Texans further away from being an AFC contender than we thought? Our writers react: Mike Jones: Entering the season, it seemed realistic to expect the Texans to take another step forward after last year’s success. I never saw them as a team capable of challenging for the AFC title, but improvement certainly was realistic. Instead, this team has seemed off all season. Maybe it’s a sophomore slump, maybe it’s C.J. Stroud struggling with the weight of expectations, but he hasn’t been as consistently effective this season. Injuries at wide receiver have hurt; so too has the continued struggles of the offensive line. The defensive struggles are a bit perplexing. And that’s a lot to have to clean up over the next several weeks if the Texans aim to contend in the AFC. They’ll still win their division, but they’re just not on the level of Kansas City, Buffalo, Baltimore or Pittsburgh. So, I don’t view the Texans as legit AFC title contenders. Dan Pompei: The Texans are not the quality of team most of us thought they would be. They’ve had two bad losses now, to the Jets and Titans. They will have a chance to change the narrative of their season, however. They have huge games remaining against the Chiefs and Ravens — wins would put this team in a different light. But given they have had difficulty winning the games they are supposed to win, you have to wonder if they will defeat the Jaguars, Dolphins and Titans. Unless their offensive line makes significant improvements, which is unlikely, the Texans will probably have a disappointing finish. Ted Nguyen: All year, there were signs the Texans offense was deeply flawed despite their weapons on the outside. Their offensive line is one of the worst in football. They can’t run-block, so Stroud is forced into a lot of third-and-longs — but they also can’t pass-block, so Stroud has to deal with a lot of pressure in passing situations. Early in the season Stroud was able to play hero ball, but that was unsustainable. On the final drive, with the Texans down three points, Stroud was under siege. I’m not sure how much this offensive line can improve. The offense still has big-play ability but the negative plays caused by the line issues are a lot to overcome. GO FURTHER NFL Week 12 takeaways: Is the Commanders offense collapsing? Are the 49ers out of time? (Getty Images)              The Washington Commanders may need to snap their three-game losing streak without a trio of offensive starters. Running backs Austin Ekeler and Brian Robinson, and right tackle Andrew Wylie were injured during Sunday’s surprising 34-26 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. Updates from head coach Dan Quinn on Monday afternoon suggest uncertain status for each player in the Week 13 home game against the Tennessee Titans. Ekeler, along with Wylie, is in concussion protocol. The running back took a blow while returning a kickoff in the final moments of Washington’s failed comeback. Down on the field for several minutes, Ekeler walked off the field wobbly. The team sent him to the hospital following the game for observations. Scans came back,” good,” Quinn said after visiting earlier on Monday with Washington’s third-leading rusher (355 yards) and receiver (33 catches). Ekeler previously sat out one game after a concussion in the Week 3 victory over Cincinnati. Having already missed three games with hamstring and knee injuries and limited in another, Robinson only received five carries after suffering an ankle injury on Washington’s opening drive. The power back received treatment on Monday. “We'll see how much work he does during the week,” Quinn said. “I'll have a better sense …  as we get further along.” The 7-5 Commanders are 2-3 in games either without Robinson or when he carries the ball less than 10 times. Should Ekeler or Robinson miss the upcoming home game against the Titans, Jeremy McNichols is the only active running back on the roster. Washington released Chris Rodriguez this weekend to open a roster spot. Rodriguez offers the best chance to replace Robinson’s interior running if he re-signs to the practice squad. GO FURTHER The Commanders split apart on the field Sunday, continuing an ill-timed reversal of fortune When the Baltimore Ravens met as a team in preparation for Monday night’s game against the Los Angeles Chargers, coach John Harbaugh wanted to get ahead of the most prominent storyline of the week. Yes, the Chargers are coached by Jim Harbaugh, John’s younger brother. And yes, the connections between the two franchises run deep. The Chargers’ front office, coaching staff and roster is loaded with former Ravens. Yet, John wanted his players to know that none of that mattered inside the building this week. “We’ve told some stories in the past, but not this week,” Harbaugh said. “Really this week, for the players and the coaches, it’s not about that. We have such a challenge. The challenge is playing the game. Getting in that game and playing that game against that team is the biggest challenge you could have, and that’s what everybody is focused on.” Harbaugh’s Ravens are 7-4 after last weekend’s deflating defeat by the Pittsburgh Steelers. Issues with penalties and their normally reliable kicker, and injuries in the middle of their defense, are concerns for the Ravens, who have two tough games in six days. A loss by the Steelers (8-3) to the Cleveland Browns on Thursday keeps the Ravens in striking distance of first place in the AFC North. Yet, a second consecutive defeat Monday would be damaging, particularly with the Philadelphia Eagles arriving in Baltimore on a short week for a game Sunday. The third matchup between the head-coaching brothers — John won the first two, including a victory over Jim’s San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII nearly a dozen years ago — comes at a time when the Chargers have rattled off four consecutive wins to emerge as contenders in the AFC.

Two meager wins and nine disappointing losses for the frustrations of a season to boil over for New York Giants rookie wide receiver Malik Nabers. It took 11 games for the rookie to be ready to stand at his locker and spill to reporters how disgusted he felt after yet another Giants defeat, their sixth straight. The overall message wasn’t surprising — “I’m tired of going out there and losing” — but the rookie didn’t mince words when asked how he’d describe the team’s effort during Sunday’s 30-7 drubbing at the hands of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. “Soft as f—,” said the No. 6 pick in the 2024 draft. To be clear, Nabers wasn’t the only person in the Giants locker room delivering scathing remarks about the team’s poor performance Sunday. “We played soft,” team captain Dexter Lawrence said. “And they beat the s— out of us today.” That Nabers was among the players speaking out only demonstrates how far off the rails this season has gone. The receiver was selected out of LSU to help lift the Giants offense and lend it a new explosive dynamic. Instead, the Giants offense has become the league’s worst, and Nabers is fed up with it. Read more here. GO FURTHER Giants’ Malik Nabers is ‘tired of losing,’ sick of trying to explain why offense is inept The New York Jets’ roots as a brash and unapologetic upstart, cemented by Joe Namath’s Super Bowl III bravado, differentiated them from the old-guard New York Giants for decades. When the Jets had bombastic and playful Rex Ryan as their coach, the Giants had stern taskmaster Tom Coughlin. When the Jets were going all-in on the polarizing Aaron Rodgers, the Giants were hoping the fifth and sixth seasons of nice guy Daniel Jones might turn out differently. If the Jets aspired to be cryptocurrency, the Giants hoped to be the S&P 500. What’s the difference when both are competitively bankrupt? The Pick Six column leads this week by examining how the Giants resemble the Jets, in results if not always process. If Tampa Bay’s Baker Mayfield mocking Giants fill-in Tommy DeVito during a 30-7 Buccaneers rout at MetLife Stadium helped drive home the point, great, but the evidence has been accumulating for years.

It’s getting harder to tell: Sando’s Pick Six (Getty Images)              The Indianapolis Colts are one game away from entering their Week 14 bye. The time away should help them refocus over the final stretch of what’s shaping up to be an eventful conclusion to the regular season. It’s not just that the Colts, despite losing four of their past five games, remain in the playoff hunt. It’s that the teams they’ll face down the stretch give them a realistic shot to earn their first postseason berth since 2020. Indianapolis’ final five games feature matchups against the Patriots, Broncos, Titans, Giants and Jaguars. Excluding Denver, which is 7-5, the other four opponents are a combined 10-35. In other words, these are very winnable games. Of course, the Colts still have their own issues to figure out if they hope to take advantage of their soft schedule. Quarterback Anthony Richardson has played better since returning from his benching, but the offensive line has struggled, running back Jonathan Taylor has become a non-factor, and too much is being asked of a middling defense that was bad to start the season but has made significant strides to give Indianapolis chances it keeps squandering. So, now I’ll turn it over to you. What’s on your mind amid yet another up-and-down Colts campaign? Whether it’s schedule-, coaching- or personnel-related, please share your questions here, so I can answer them in a post-Thanksgiving mailbag! GO FURTHER Submit a question for James Boyd’s Indianapolis Colts mailbag Advertisement Jourdan Rodrigue writes that between all the Saquon Barkley big runs and explosive plays by the Eagles and harassment of Matthew Stafford, the Rams didn't look like a team ready to hang with the NFL serious contenders “You just go back to work. I don’t know any other way to go about it,"" Rams coach Sean McVay said after the Eagles beat them up Sunday. ""Sunday Night Football"" live blog GO FURTHER Rams can’t run with the big-time postseason teams if they can get run over (Getty Images)              Indianapolis Colts wide receiver Josh Downs sustained a right shoulder injury in his team’s loss to the Detroit Lions on Sunday, and he is considered week-to-week, a league source told The Athletic on Monday. Downs’ availability for next week’s game at New England is also in question, though the belief is that he did not suffer a severe injury. Downs got hurt after making a 7-yard catch and being tackled with about 11 minutes left in Sunday’s game. His right shoulder appeared to be driven into the turf as Lions linebackers Malcolm Rodriguez and David Long Jr. took him to the ground. Downs immediately grabbed at his right shoulder and stayed down before eventually getting up and walking off the field. He reentered the game on the Colts’ next series and wound up playing 29 of a possible 55 offensive snaps. Indianapolis could choose to be cautious with Downs since it only has one game left before its bye week. If Downs is held out against the Patriots, it would be a significant blow to the Colts’ offense. The second-year pro missed the first two games of the season due to a right high ankle sprain, but he still leads Indianapolis in targets (78), catches (53) and receiving yards per game (59.4). Downs is also tied with fellow wideout Alec Pierce for the team-high in receiving touchdowns (four). Pierce got banged up as well in the second half of Sunday’s contest. He had his right ankle re-taped by trainers on the sideline, and he was walking gingerly in the locker room after the game. Despite his gait, Pierce is “good,” a league source told The Athletic, and there’s no reason to be overly concerned about his status moving forward. Pierce is averaging a league-high 23.3 yards per catch this season. NFL Network's Ian Rapoport first reported the news of Downs' shoulder injury. GO FURTHER Colts ask too much of QB Anthony Richardson in sloppy loss to Lions After a hot start with Russell Wilson, the Steelers' offense has hit a rut. Let's take a closer look at which areas need improvements. 8 — times sacked Even though the Steelers have invested heavily in their offensive line, they have not done a great job of protecting the quarterback at any point this season. Through the first nine games, they allowed 2.67 sacks per game, tied for the 11th most. Over the last two games? That’s jumped up to four sacks per game. The underlying numbers have also regressed. Over the first nine games, the Steelers allowed a sack on 8.9 percent of dropbacks (ninth-highest rate) and pressure on 38.6 percent of snaps (fifth-highest). Over the last two, that’s up to 11 percent and 40 percent, respectively. When it comes to identifying the problem, it’s really been a mix of everything. In some instances, individual players have been exposed. Both offensive tackles, in particular, have had their rough moments. Other times, the Steelers haven’t adapted well to the opponent’s schematics. For example, the Browns confused the Steelers’ offensive line with several stunts, including when Myles Garrett twisted inside to blow right past center Zach Frazier. It was one of the few times in his young career Frazier has looked like a rookie. There have also been several times when Wilson has held the ball too long. He led the league in sacks taken in two of the previous five seasons. The Steelers will need to reverse this trend, or the offense might continue to sputter. Read here for more stats. GO FURTHER Explaining the Steelers’ 7 touchdown-less quarters with 7 stats LANDOVER, Md. — Sunday’s game puts you in a strange spot as a fan. At 3-7, you assume your team’s season is over, so a part of you wants as many losses as possible, leading to the highest possible draft pick. But then your fandom kicks in. Your team has a chance to win a game they entered as double-digit underdogs. The Dallas Cowboys outlasted the Commanders in a wild finish Sunday at Washington. It ended Dallas’ five-game losing streak, its longest in the last nine years. But it also provided a significant blow to those who were hoping for a chance at the No. 1 overall pick. And by the looks of the rest of the schedule, it’s unlikely that the Cowboys will end up in the top 5 and maybe not the top 10. According to Tankathon.com, if the season ended today, Dallas would have the 11th overall pick. Heading into Sunday’s game, the Cowboys had worked their way up to ninth, a game and a half back of No. 1 overall. They’re now two games back of the Jacksonville Jaguars, New York Giants and Las Vegas Raiders, who all seem committed to legitimately competing for No. 1 overall. Of the 10 teams currently ahead of the Cowboys, three are still remaining on Dallas’ schedule: Thursday vs. the Giants (currently picking second), Week 14 vs. the Cincinnati Bengals (10th) and Week 15 at the Carolina Panthers (fifth). If your goal was to land Colorado superstar CB/WR Travis Hunter, the dream died in Landover, Maryland. The mock draft studying probably needs to shift to more of the 10-to-20 range.

MLB News,1 reason for every team to be thankful,https://www.mlb.com/news/reasons-for-every-mlb-team-to-give-thanks,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 02:20:45 GMT",,"Will Leitch Happy Thanksgiving, everyone. In the words of a great bird I once met, “Gobble, gobble.” Thanksgiving is not a holiday traditionally associated with baseball, but if you’re reading a baseball site on Thanksgiving Day, you know that in a just world, every holiday is one associated with baseball. So, today, on Turkey Day, we provide you with an old Thanksgiving staple: We give you something for every team’s fanbase to be thankful for. Even if the season didn’t go how you wanted it to, there’s still something you feel lucky to have. Here’s one thing for everyone to give thanks for. Enjoy the yams. AL EAST Blue Jays Last year was an absolute mess, and the sort of year that often leads to a reckoning. But if you are a Jays fan, you have been able to follow players such as Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette from their time as highly touted prospects through their maturation as big league stars. Both are scheduled to reach free agency next offseason, but rather than starting a rebuild, the Blue Jays are keeping the band together to make one last run at the playoffs. Orioles The playoffs have been frustrating the last two years, but this is still a team that’s the envy of baseball. Baltimore is packed with young talent, backed by a fanbase desperate to win, and has clear opportunities to upgrade in its first offseason under new ownership. It was a very rough decade for the Orioles faithful. These are now the good times. There are even better times coming. Rays First off, everyone’s grateful that the Rays are going to have a place to play in 2025, in a stadium that should actually prove a pretty terrific environment for the next year. This is a team with its usual share of young talent, and this could be the year Junior Caminero firmly establishes himself as the next big thing. Red Sox There are all sorts of signs that the Red Sox might be ready to spend big this offseason, and that’s coming off a year that was a lot more successful than many people thought it was going to be. The Red Sox have idled for a while now, but there’s a foundation of talent here, with the opportunity to grow, and a fanbase that is ready to, at last, get moving. Yankees Hey, you finally made that World Series you’d been waiting 15 years for. Sure, it didn’t end with a 28th championship, which means it’s somewhat disappointing. But the Yankees still have Aaron Judge and the money to bring back Juan Soto … if they can make it happen. And again, even though you didn’t win it, no one should be shaking their head at a World Series appearance. AL CENTRAL Guardians The Guardians have reached the playoffs six of the last nine seasons and won their division five times during that time. That is, essentially, the second-best stretch in franchise history, behind only those 1990s teams. There has been some playoff frustration, but these are in many ways the best of times for Guardians fans. Royals Royals fans get to watch Bobby Witt Jr. every day, which is pretty much the best possible gift, all told, especially when you consider that they’re locked into doing so for the next decade. He made his first playoff appearance this year. It won’t be his last. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Tigers That glorious September run didn’t just electrify the fanbase -- it served as a proof of concept for everything this franchise has been trying to do for a decade now. They look primed to add this offseason, and maybe make this the AL Central juggernaut moving forward. It’s a very good time in Detroit sports right now! Twins This year was disappointing, but this is still as stalwart of a franchise as this division has, with stars like Carlos Correa and Byron Buxton that would be the envy of any team. The question, as always, is health. And we should always try to be thankful for whatever health we have, every Thanksgiving. White Sox A trying 2024 is almost over. That’s something to be thankful for, and they also have a highly regarded new manager to help them turn the page. AL WEST Angels The Angels have already made some moves this offseason, making it clear that they’re not slinking away after some rough seasons. They’ve got more young talent than you might think, and you may have vague memories of a Mike Trout fellow who will be back for Opening Day. Astros Their incredible ALCS streak finally ended, but they proved in 2024, after a rough start, that they aren’t going anywhere. The Astros have been the team of the AL over the last decade, and there’s no reason to think that won’t remain the case for at least one more year. Athletics After an emotional goodbye to Oakland, the A’s will start a new adventure in Sacramento, and they’re hardly doing so with a bare cupboard: Who would have thought we’d have a second coming of the Bash Brothers with Brent Rooker and Lawrence Butler? Mariners That starting rotation, combined with Julio Rodríguez, gives them a high floor. One of these years, it’s all going to come together perfectly -- maybe it’s this one. Rangers The title defense was a bit of a dud, but a healthy Corey Seager (and a healthy Jacob deGrom?) would get them right back in the mix in 2025. And all that 2023 World Series champions merchandise you bought still looks pretty, doesn’t it? NL EAST Braves Just about everything other than Chris Sale went wrong for the Braves in 2024 … and they still made the playoffs. They’ll get just about everybody back for 2025, and their luck should improve. Thus, they may well be the NL favorites again. Marlins Every single member of the Marlins rotation and everyday lineup is currently under 30 years old. That sort of youth movement has sometimes worked out quite excellently for the Marlins in the past. Mets The Mets gave their fans the ride of a lifetime this October, and remember, they actually did it a year earlier than anyone expected. Now that we’ve seen where this team seems to be going, Mets fans have a whole offseason to watch their owner and front office add to it. This could get exciting. Nationals The last time we saw all this young talent in one place in a Nationals uniform, they were about to start a run of postseason appearances that would culminate with the 2019 World Series title. Phillies The recent run of frustrating postseason exits shouldn’t distract from the fact that the Phillies have a core that’s probably better than anyone else’s in baseball … a core they may well add to this offseason. Sure, they’re getting older. But hey, aren’t we all. NL CENTRAL Brewers Remember when everyone wrote off the Brewers because they lost their manager and their ace heading into the 2024 season? Well, they ended up sprinting away with the division anyway. Pat Murphy stepped in for Craig Counsell to win the NL Manager of the Year Award, and the team made its sixth postseason appearance in seven years. Cardinals The Cardinals look to be taking a step back this year, but it may just look that way, as they focus on young players such as Jordan Walker, Nolan Gorman and Masyn Winn. That should give them, and Cardinals fans, a concrete answer as to what the future of this franchise is really going to look like. Cubs The Cubs haven’t lived up to expectations the last couple of years, but they’re hardly shrinking from those expectations moving forward. This is still going to be a team worth coming out to see at glorious Wrigley Field anytime you have the opportunity to do so. Pirates Paul Skenes is reason enough to be thankful, of course, but don’t forget Jared Jones and Mitch Keller. If the Pirates are ever able to sneak in the playoffs -- and they just might in 2025 -- that’s a triumvirate no one will want to deal with. Reds Elly De La Cruz finished in the top five of NL MVP voting, and it still feels like he’s only scratching the surface of what he’s capable of accomplishing. And with Terry Francona now in charge, the Reds clearly have an arrow pointing up. NL WEST Diamondbacks The Diamondbacks reached the World Series in 2023 and were still probably a better team in 2024. Ketel Marte has officially reached full-on star status; Corbin Carroll may well be next. Dodgers They just won the World Series. Better yet, both the team and the fans got to enjoy the full-on celebration that the pandemic made impossible in 2020. Giants After years of frustration, the Giants have a True Giant in charge of baseball operations now, with Buster Posey providing much-needed direction for the whole enterprise. The Giants are doing everything they can to bring back those good old days. Padres Last year may in fact have been the best Padres team ever, one that came this close to beating those blasted Dodgers. The ascension of Jackson Merrill has elevated this whole franchise to a brand new level. Rockies The Rockies are always looking for someone to build around, and Ezequiel Tovar is sure starting to look like that guy, as a 23-year-old Gold Glove Award-winning shortstop."
MLB News,This team just upped its offer to Soto (report),https://www.mlb.com/news/juan-soto-rumors,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 22:17:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of the latest news and rumors surrounding Juan Soto. Nov. 27: Yankees increase offer to Soto (report)The Soto sweepstakes appear to be entering the next round, with the Yankees upping their initial offer in recent days, per a report from MLB Network insider Jon Heyman. While Heyman wrote for the New York Post that the Yanks have also touched base with Corbin Burnes and Max Fried -- as well as some of the other top free agents -- he said New York has not yet extended an offer to either player. Instead, the Yankees' main focus for the time being remains on bringing back Soto. Though it's unclear exactly what New York's latest offer is -- or what the original numbers were -- the club has reportedly told Soto it is willing to include opt-outs in a potential contract. There will likely be other teams also willing to extend that luxury, with the Mets, Dodgers, Red Sox and Blue Jays remaining the most likely landing spots for Soto if he elects to leave the Bronx. Nov. 26: Soto's decision coming before the Winter Meetings?The 2024 Winter Meetings in Dallas begin on Dec. 9. An annual highlight on MLB's offseason calendar, there is usually a flurry of player movement during the four-day event. Some of the best free agents agree to their next contract during the Winter Meetings. But the best free agent this year might agree to his deal before the Meetings begin. A source told Sean McAdam of MassLive.com that there is a “very good” chance Soto selects his next team even before the start of the Winter Meetings. This jibes with what MLB.com's Mark Feinsand reported recently; he wrote that ""the feeling around the industry"" is Soto could make his decision before Dec. 9. Five teams have already made an offer to Soto, a source told MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi: the Mets, Red Sox, Dodgers, Yankees and Blue Jays. However, those are not believed to be final offers as Morosi clarified Tuesday. Morosi said he thinks there is a ""real possibility"" that a Soto signing comes in the early days of the Meetings. If it comes on that first day, it would be the same date (Dec. 9) that Shohei Ohtani made public his decision to sign with the Dodgers last year, although that came after the Meetings concluded. Nov. 26: Red Sox 'stepping up efforts' to sign Soto (report)The Red Sox are one of the five teams that have made a contract offer to Soto, a source told MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi. No one knows the value of that offer, but it shouldn't be taken lightly as Boston is reportedly ""stepping up efforts"" to land the offseason's No. 1 free agent. More > Nov. 26: Five teams submit offers to Soto (source)To this point, Soto's free agency has been about meeting with teams and hearing their general pitches -- but that has changed according to MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi, who reports that five teams have submitted contract offers to the 26-year-old superstar: the Red Sox, Dodgers, Mets, Yankees and Blue Jays. ESPN's Buster Olney reported over the weekend that contract offers were expected to begin rolling in this week. Juan Soto has offers from 5 teams, source confirms the report by @RandyJMiller. Boston Red SoxLos Angeles Dodgers New York MetsNew York YankeesToronto Blue Jays @MLBNetwork Nov. 20: Soto has 'good meeting' with YankeesThe Yankees met with Soto on Monday in California, and team owner Hal Steinbrenner confirmed Wednesday that it was a ""good meeting"" with ""very honest back-and-forth dialogue."" Steinbrenner said that Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, manager Aaron Boone, president Randy Levine, and special assistant to the GM Omar Minaya were all in attendance during Monday's meeting. But he didn't divulge any part of the team's pitch to Soto or say if any offers were made during the meeting. ""It's been a priority,"" Steinbrenner said about signing Soto. ""We wouldn't have gone out to the West Coast if it wasn't. ... We'll be in the mix. I'll leave it at that."" As of Wednesday, Soto has had in-person meetings with the Yankees, Mets, Red Sox and Blue Jays. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Tuesday that Soto will also meet with the Phillies at some point. Soto also plans to sit down with the Dodgers this week, according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Steinbrenner said he has ""no idea"" if the Yankees will meet with Soto again or if he's confident that the club can re-sign the 26-year-old superstar. But he added, ""[W]e've got the ability to sign any player we want to sign."" Nov. 19: Phillies plan to meet with Soto (report)Yet another team has emerged as a potential suitor for Soto: the Philadelphia Phillies. According to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman, the Phils plan to meet with Soto at some point, though nothing has been scheduled yet. Soto reportedly has already met with the Blue Jays, Red Sox, Mets and incumbent Yankees and is scheduled to meet with the Dodgers next. Per Heyman, it's believed that no offers have been made to Soto yet. The Phillies already have one of the most complete rosters of any MLB team, but they are looking for ways to improve after failing to advance past the National League Division Series in 2024. Phillies ownership has shown a willingness to pay up for some of the top free agents on the market, with Bryce Harper, Trea Turner, Zack Wheeler, J.T. Realmuto, Aaron Nola, Nick Castellanos and Kyle Schwarber all signing lucrative deals with Philadelphia in free agency. Phillies managing partner and CEO John Middleton was candid in addressing Soto's market earlier this month, saying that he believes the outfielder wants to be in New York but adding that Philadelphia could get involved in the bidding anyway as a ""stalking horse."" Nov. 18: Cohen to best any Soto offer by $50 million (report)Yankees broadcaster Michael Kay said on his radio program on Monday that according to a source, Mets owner Steve Cohen is willing to beat any other club's offer to Soto by $50 million. ""I'll put it this way,"" Kay said. ""And I don't think this is something Yankees fans are going to want to hear. I don't think the Yankees are going to go [up to $700 million]. I don't. And then I've heard from somebody in baseball today that Cohen is willing to go $50 million over whatever anybody offers. So it looks like the Mets really want to get this guy."" Nov. 18: Dodgers expected to meet with Soto this weekSoto's decision on where to sign this offseason is the most anticipated in baseball, and according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, ""the feeling around the industry"" is that the decision could be made before the annual Winter Meetings get underway in Dallas on Dec. 9. Feinsand also writes that the Dodgers are expected to be the next team to meet with Soto, with plans to sit down with the superstar slugger sometime this week and perhaps as early as Tuesday. More > Nov. 18: Yanks meet with Soto (report)MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reports in an article for the New York Post that the Yankees met with superstar slugger Juan Soto in Southern California on Monday as they look to retain him after he helped lead them to the World Series. More > Nov 16: Blue Jays, Red Sox and Mets have met with Soto (reports)The Red Sox met with Soto and his representatives, including agent Scott Boras, in Southern California on Thursday night, according to a report from Sean McAdam of MassLive. It appears they aren't the only club that has chatted with the 26-year-old superstar. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Saturday morning that the Blue Jays, along with Boston, have made ""impressive in-person presentations"" to Soto. Heyman later added another team to the list, reporting that the Mets met with Soto on Saturday. He noted that ""all early signs suggest the meeting went extremely well,"" and that owner Steve Cohen and other ""high-ranking Mets officials"" made the trip. The Red Sox's meeting with Soto, which was of an introductory and informative nature, per McAdam, lasted for three hours and was deemed as “productive,” though neither money nor terms were discussed between the parties. Soto was reportedly “impressed” by Boston’s presentation, which included a video noting the franchise’s history of star players from the Dominican Republic, Soto’s native country. The Red Sox also detailed their plans for the future, highlighting a promising group of prospects who could potentially team up with Soto to help the club be successful in the years to come. Heyman reports that Soto is scheduled to meet with a fourth team, the Yankees, on Monday in California."
MLB News,Are the Sasaki sweepstakes a two-team race?,https://www.mlb.com/news/roki-sasaki-rumors,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 22:01:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of the latest news and rumors surrounding Roki Sasaki. Nov. 27: Sasaki sweepstakes could come down to Dodgers, PadresThe Dodgers have been considered the favorite by many to sign Sasaki once he is posted for MLB clubs. Even with Blake Snell joining the Dodgers (per sources), L.A.'s interest in the 23-year-old Japanese right-hander seemingly hasn't waned. During his Wednesday chat on Bleacher Report, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman indicated that the Dodgers remain involved for Sasaki. Yet there is one other team that has ""a true shot"" of signing him, according to Heyman: the Padres. ""I think they are the one team beyond the Dodgers that really has a true shot at Sasaki,"" Heyman said of the Padres. ""While everybody is going for Sasaki, I think, very likely, he is going to end up with one of those two teams."" MLB.com's Mark Feinsand heard something similar earlier this month from executives around the league, who believe these NL West rivals are the top contenders for the fireballing phenom. Nov. 20: Sasaki not expected to sign with MLB team until Jan. 15MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said Wednesday that Sasaki is expected to be part of the 2025 international amateur signing class, which means the Japanese right-hander likely won't sign with a club before Jan. 15. ""It looks like ... the signing will happen in the new pool period,"" Manfred said on Wednesday. This was always the expected route for Sasaki, who is subject to MLB's international amateur signing bonus pool rules because he is younger than 25 years old and hasn't reached six years of service time. That means the value of his big league contract is limited to the money available in a team's bonus pool. The Dodgers, with about $2.5 million, have the most money of any team left in its bonus pool during the current 2024 international signing period. But if Sasaki waits until Jan. 15, when the 2025 international signing period begins, he could sign a contract in the neighborhood of $7 million. MLB.com's Jonathan Mayo provided the complete list of international bonus pools for the 2025 signing period here. Before Sasaki can sign with a team, he needs to be posted by his Nippon Professional Baseball club, the Chiba Lotte Marines. However, the team announced earlier this month that Sasaki will be posted this offseason. Nov. 14: Could this be the deciding factor in the Sasaki sweepstakes?The Dodgers are viewed as one of the top contenders to sign Sasaki once he is posted by his Nippon Professional Baseball team, the Chiba Lotte Marines. However, The Athletic's Jim Bowden (subscription required) doesn't see it that way. Based on his conversations with league sources, Bowden thinks it's ""unlikely"" Sasaki will sign with the Dodgers. And Bowden mentioned a few reasons why. The main one has to do with money. Since Sasaki is younger than 25 years old and hasn't reached six years of service in a foreign major league, he is subject to MLB's international amateur signing bonus pool rules. He won't get anything close to the $325 million contract that Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto received last offseason. Instead, Sasaki's contract value will be limited to what a team has in its bonus pool. That could be somewhere in the neighborhood of $7 million if Sasaki waits to sign until after Jan. 15, when each team's bonus pool will be refilled for the start of the 2025 international signing period. So, how can Sasaki make more money outside of his contract? Bowden says the answer is simple: endorsements. But therein lies the possible issue with a Sasaki-Dodgers match. ""In Los Angeles, [Sasaki would] be in the shadow of both [Shohei] Ohtani and Yamamoto, which would lessen his endorsement ceiling,"" Bowden wrote. Conversely, if Sasaki signs with a team such as the Padres, not only would he share a clubhouse with his idol, Yu Darvish, the 23-year-old ""could potentially maximize his endorsements in Japan, positioning himself as a rival to the Dodgers’ Ohtani and Yamamoto rather than a teammate of theirs."" Furthermore, a massive contingent of Japanese media cover the Dodgers on a daily basis, and, per Bowden, ""that level of attention is not the best situation for a young, developing pitcher."" The Dodgers are known for being fantastic with how they develop young pitchers. But Bowden points out that teams such as the Padres, Rays, Mets and Braves also have strong pitching development programs, thereby possibly negating any advantage L.A. might have there. ""Based on what I’m hearing,"" Bowden wrote, ""I think the Padres, Rays, Mets and Braves are all more likely to sign Sasaki than the Dodgers -- and several other teams will be in the mix."" Nov. 9: Sasaki to be posted by Chiba Lotte MarinesSasaki appears headed to the Majors next season. Sasaki, the consensus top young pitcher in Japan, will be posted by the Chiba Lotte Marines of the Nippon Professional Baseball, the team announced. Sasaki, 23, should inspire an all-out pursuit reminiscent of Shohei Ohtani’s initial contract with the Angels, in league-wide interest and financial scope. Ohtani agreed to a $2.315 million signing bonus with the Angels in December 2017. An unfettered market would have yielded a much larger contract, but foreign-born players are subject to international bonus pool money restrictions unless they are at least 25 years of age and have played as a professional in a foreign league recognized by Major League Baseball for a minimum of six seasons. Ohtani was not yet 25 years old when he was posted by the Nippon Ham Fighters, so the Collective Bargaining Agreement classified him as an international amateur. Sasaki falls into the same category now. More >"
MLB News,"O's, Red Sox, Dodgers seen as contenders for Crochet",https://www.mlb.com/news/garrett-crochet-rumors,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 22:00:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of the latest news and trade rumors surrounding Garrett Crochet. Nov. 27: O's, Red Sox, Dodgers seen as contenders for CrochetSeveral teams have reportedly considered trading for White Sox ace Garrett Crochet. But a National League executive tells MLB.com's Mark Feinsand that one club is ""the team to watch on [Crochet], for sure."" That would be the Baltimore Orioles. The O's were in on Blake Snell before he agreed to a five-year contract with the Dodgers (per sources) on Tuesday. Although they could try to bring Corbin Burnes -- regarded as the No. 1 pitcher in this year's free-agent class -- back to Baltimore, the Orioles have been more often linked to other available hurlers such as Max Fried and Nathan Eovaldi. However, Crochet may be even more attainable for Baltimore given its wealth of prospect talent. The Orioles own the No. 3 farm system in baseball, per MLB Pipeline, and six of their top seven prospects are position players. That is what the White Sox are targeting in return for Crochet, who is under team control through 2026. Meanwhile, MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi is keeping an eye on the Boston Red Sox -- another reported Snell suitor before he landed with the Dodgers -- in the Crochet trade derby. Boston is loaded with highly touted position-player prospects, too, which could make it an attractive trade partner for the White Sox. Per a report from the Boston Globe (subscription required), the Red Sox are looking to add a top starter even if they can seal the deal with their primary target, superstar outfielder Juan Soto. Signing Soto would leave the team with less financial flexibility to do so, perhaps making Crochet a better fit for Boston than one of the top remaining arms on the free-agent market. Finally, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman said during his Wednesday chat on Bleacher Report that the Dodgers are also in on Crochet, alongside Baltimore and Boston. Even with Snell in tow, the 2024 World Series champs seem to still be a player in the pitching market as they have also been linked to Japanese ace Roki Sasaki and other hurlers. Nov. 25: Phils have had 'extensive talks' with White SoxThe Phillies and White Sox have discussed potential packages for Crochet that include All-Star third baseman Alec Bohm and highly touted outfield prospect Justin Crawford, per a report from USA Today's Bob Nightengale. Crawford is Philadelphia's No. 3 prospect, per MLB Pipeline, while Bohm is coming off his best season in the big leagues. The 28-year-old Bohm hit .295 with an .830 OPS in the first half on his way to his first career All-Star selection, but he put up just a .681 OPS following the break. The White Sox reportedly have some hesitation about that second-half dip, though Bohm has been a streaky hitter during his time in the big leagues. He's also had his troubles defensively, though he's coming off a much-improved showing at the hot corner in 2024. Nov. 22: These teams seem most interested in CrochetWith Crochet headlining the list of potential trade candidates this offseason, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman says four clubs -- the Orioles, Red Sox, Dodgers and Phillies -- are showing the most interest in acquiring the White Sox left-hander. Heyman wrote for the New York Post that the O's and Red Sox are in prime position to strike a deal based on the position-player talent that Chicago is likely seeking in return. Of course, there's still plenty of time for another team to enter the mix, with Heyman noting that others have also expressed interest. Nov. 13: These clubs could be involved in trade market for CrochetAlthough the White Sox didn't move Crochet prior to the Trade Deadline, there appears to be little doubt about their intentions for the left-hander this offseason. ""They're going to trade him this winter,"" a rival evaluator told ESPN's Buster Olney at the GM Meetings last week. ""It's not a matter of if; it's a question of when."" Olney shed some light on Crochet's potential market in an article for ESPN+ (subscription required) on Wednesday, noting that general manager Chris Getz is looking for ""a package of prospects constructed around at least one high-ceiling youngster to anchor the deal."" Chicago's preference is for that main piece to be a position player, but the team is open to a pitcher being the centerpiece, ""depending on the depth and quality of the prospects offered."" Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Based on conversations with industry sources, Olney names the Phillies, Padres, Yankees, Dodgers, Braves, Orioles, Red Sox and Mets as teams that could pursue a Crochet trade. Nov. 9: Mets showing interest in trading for Crochet (report)According to a report in the New York Post, the Mets are ""discussing"" Crochet, who is one of the most likely players to be traded this offseason. It would stand to reason given that three of New York's starters from 2024 -- Sean Manaea, Jose Quintana and Luis Severino -- are free agents. Though the Mets are certainly in position to spend big this offseason, Crochet would be considerably cheaper in his remaining arbitration years than spending toward the top of the free agent pitching market. Nov. 7: Crochet garnering trade interest from many clubs, but one stands outThe White Sox held on to Crochet through the 2024 Trade Deadline when they were receiving calls from many teams interested in acquiring the fireballing left-hander. Now, an even greater number of clubs are trying to maneuver a deal for Crochet, general manager Chris Getz said during this week's General Managers Meetings. Crochet entered this season with only 73 big league innings under his belt over parts of three seasons and a lengthy injury history. But from Opening Day on, he proved he could be an ace. Crochet received his first Major League start in that season opener and proceeded to strike out eight batters and allow one run over six innings. He eventually became a first-time All-Star and ended the season with 209 strikeouts in 146 innings. Given that big jump in innings, Crochet's workload was capped over the final few months of the season. He made it through the year without a stint on the injured list. What do the White Sox want in return for Crochet, who has two years of club control remaining? Getz has made it pretty clear. ""We need to improve our offense, it’s very clear,” he told reporters Tuesday. “With any trade or free agency, we are looking for ways to improve our offense."" One team that could be a match for Chicago in a Crochet trade is the Boston Red Sox. The Red Sox have six position players on MLB Pipeline's Top 100 Prospects list, including three in the top 10. They also have a few attractive pieces already at the big league level who are not yet eligible for arbitration. That group includes first baseman Triston Casas, catcher Connor Wong and Gold Glove outfielder Wilyer Abreu. With so much high-quality position-player depth, ""there’s a widespread sense that the Sox can trade for nearly anyone,"" according to The Boston Globe's Alex Speier (subscription required). MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi said Thursday from the GM Meetings that the Red Sox are ""the team I think a lot of people around here are looking at very carefully"" regarding a Crochet trade."
MLB News,Soto isn't the only elite FA the Blue Jays are reportedly pursuing,https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-rumors-trades-and-signings,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 16:17:00 GMT",LATEST FREE AGENT & TRADE RUMORS,"MLB.com We're keeping track of all the latest free agent and trade rumors. The Blue Jays are reportedly one of five teams that have made an offer to superstar free agent Juan Soto, but they clearly aren’t putting all of their eggs in the Soto basket this offseason. With Toronto seen as a “dark horse, at best,” in the Soto sweepstakes, SportsNet’s Ben Nicholson-Smith reports that the club is showing interest in third baseman Alex Bregman, outfielder Anthony Santander, left-hander Max Fried and right-hander Luis Severino. This is a pivotal offseason for the Blue Jays, who are coming off a disappointing 2024 campaign. While Toronto moved a number of players at the Trade Deadline, the club opted to hold onto most of its top trade candidates with an eye on contending in 2025 -- the final year Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette are under club control. However, the team is likely going to need an influx of talent to do so after posting the fourth-worst record (74-88) in the American League last season. Blue Jays president Mark Shapiro said in early October that he was expecting the team’s 2025 payroll to be similar to what it was in 2024, when Toronto had an estimated Opening Day payroll of $225 million (per Cot’s Baseball Contracts). Including projected salaries for arbitration-eligible players, Cot’s puts Toronto’s current payroll at roughly $184 million, which could leave the team with around $41 million to spend. According to Nicholson-Smith, the Blue Jays could stretch beyond their budget “for a special or unique opportunity” such as Soto. Losing Blake Snell is tough for the Giants, but losing him to the Dodgers? That has to sting L.A.'s longtime rival. San Francisco now has a massive void to fill in its rotation. There are a handful of high-quality starting pitchers left on the free-agent market, and the Giants might look toward the very top of it to find their Snell replacement. According to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, the Giants ""are believed to have significant interest"" in Corbin Burnes. More > The Yankees increased their initial offer to Juan Soto in recent days, per a report from MLB Network insider Jon Heyman -- but they've also checked in on some other top free agents. Heyman wrote for the New York Post that the Yanks have also touched base with Corbin Burnes and Max Fried, though the club has not yet extended an offer to either player. More > The Red Sox are one of the five teams that have made a contract offer to Juan Soto, a source told MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi. No one knows the value of that offer, but it shouldn't be taken lightly as it seems like Boston means business in its pursuit of the offseason's No. 1 free agent. Writing in the New York Post on Tuesday, Mark W. Sanchez and MLB Network insider Jon Heyman said the Red Sox ""are increasingly seen as a legitimate contender in the sweepstakes for the generational slugger as word is they are stepping up efforts to lure the superstar hitter away from their historic AL East nemesis."" The Red Sox are also continuing their search for a frontline starter. Per a report from the Boston Globe (subscription required), the Red Sox are looking to add one even if they can seal the deal with Soto. According to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, the Red Sox were in on Blake Snell before he reached a five-year deal (per sources) with the Dodgers on Tuesday. Boston is believed to be seeking a left-handed starter, so it could turn its focus to Max Fried now that Snell is off the market. The Red Sox are also a team to watch in the trade market for White Sox lefty Garrett Crochet. More > The Yankees and Red Sox are two of the top contenders in the Juan Soto sweepstakes, but might the two storied rivals also find themselves embroiled in a bidding war for another big-name free agent? MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand hears that the Yankees and Red Sox are both looking for a left-handed starter and were interested in Blake Snell before he reached a five-year, $182 million deal with the Dodgers (per sources) on Tuesday. Feinsand suggests that New York and Boston could now zero in on Max Fried, the top remaining southpaw on the free-agent market. However, there's a lot of competition for Fried, especially now that Snell is off the board. Three of the Yankees' AL East rivals -- the Red Sox, Orioles and Blue Jays -- have also been connected to Fried, but they are far from the only teams looking for starters. The Dodgers have been considered the favorite by many to sign Sasaki once he is posted for MLB clubs. Even with Blake Snell joining the Dodgers (per sources), L.A.'s interest in the 23-year-old Japanese right-hander seemingly hasn't waned. During his Wednesday chat on Bleacher Report, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman indicated that the Dodgers remain involved for Sasaki. Yet there is one other team that has ""a true shot"" of signing him, according to Heyman: the Padres. More > Few contenders have a greater need for a top starting pitcher than the Orioles, who are at risk of losing Corbin Burnes to free agency. O’s general manager Mike Elias made it clear at the beginning of the offseason that the team’s new ownership group was enabling him to explore the market for frontline arms, though Burnes may wind up being out of the club’s price range. The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required) reported on Nov. 21 that the Orioles appeared “more focused” on other options than they were on bringing back Burnes. However, one of their reported targets, Blake Snell, is now off the market after reaching a five-year, $182 million deal (per sources) with the Dodgers on Tuesday. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. While it’s possible Baltimore will pivot to the next best southpaw on the free-agent market, Max Fried, the club is also in the mix for some lower-cost alternatives. MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi reports that Baltimore is interested in free agent Nathan Eovaldi, who is a tier below Fried but has performed like a frontline starter in the postseason and can likely be had on a shorter-term deal as he heads into his age-35 season. MLB Trade Rumors projects Eovaldi for a two-year, $44 million contract. Right-hander Jack Flaherty, who won the World Series with the Dodgers this year, could be another possible avenue for Baltimore. The Orioles could face competition for Eovaldi from Fried’s former team, the Braves. MLB.com’s Mark Bowman reported on Nov. 5 that the Braves had Eovaldi near the top of their offseason wish list, and Morosi hears that Atlanta still has interest in him. If the Orioles strike out in free agency, they could also look to the trade market to fill their need for an ace, with White Sox lefty Garrett Crochet a potential option. In the opinion of one National League executive who spoke to MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand, the Orioles are ""the team to watch on [Crochet], for sure."" Jack Flaherty was born and raised in Southern California. He grew up a Dodgers fan. He said during the team's 2024 World Series championship parade that he never wants to leave Los Angeles. But after the Dodgers agreed to a five-year deal with Blake Snell on Tuesday night, per source, is re-signing Flaherty no longer an option for the reigning champs? MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi said Wednesday that the Snell move ""probably"" means Flaherty ""won't be back"" with the club in 2025. More > According to a report from The Athletic's Katie Woo (subscription required), the Cardinals have been exploring the potential trade market for third baseman Nolan Arenado over the past few weeks. Multiple teams have expressed interest thus far, and while talks haven’t yielded any substantive progress, there’s a “growing sense throughout the industry” that the 33-year-old will eventually be dealt. Discussions are likely to intensify as the Winter Meetings approach. Per Woo, Arenado is even open to playing more at first base to create roster flexibility for a potential new team, though it’s believed he would only be willing to waive his full no-trade clause to join a club set up to contend for multiple seasons. Arenado is coming off a down season with the bat (16 homers, 101 OPS+), but he was still worth 3.1 WAR (per FanGraphs) thanks in part to his plus defense at the hot corner. Arenado could be an attractive alternative to the top third-base options on the free-agent market -- Alex Bregman and Willy Adames, both of whom are expected to command a nine-figure deal and are tied to Draft compensation after declining a qualifying offer. Arenado has three years and $74 million left on his contract, but $10 million of that will be paid by the Rockies. Blake Snell is the first elite free agent to come off the board this offseason. The two-time Cy Young Award winner has agreed to a five-year, $182 million deal with the World Series champion Dodgers, a source told MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. Feinsand also reported that the Yankees, Red Sox and Orioles were in on Snell before he agreed to join the Dodgers. The left-hander had also been linked to the Blue Jays and the Giants, for whom he pitched this past season. The good news for those teams? There are still a good number of impactful starting pitchers still available. That list is topped by Corbin Burnes and Max Fried, with many of the aforementioned clubs also interested in those two hurlers. Snell's addition may hint that the Dodgers are moving on from Jack Flaherty, but MLB Network insider Jon Morosi recently identified teams such as the Yankees, Padres and Angels as other possible landing spots for the 2024 world champion. Granted, Morosi's report came before the Angels reportedly came to terms on a three-year deal with lefty Yusei Kikuchi. A couple of Japanese pitchers -- 35-year-old Tomoyuki Sugano and 23-year-old Roki Sasaki -- are on many teams' radars. The Dodgers have long been considered one of the favorites to get Sasaki, although he isn't expected to sign with an MLB club until Jan. 15, when the 2025 international signing period begins. There are also trade possibilities out there for teams looking to upgrade their rotation. The most talked about candidate is White Sox left-hander Garrett Crochet, who has been linked to a bunch of clubs, including the Phillies, Dodgers, Orioles and Red Sox. To this point, Juan Soto's free agency has been about meeting with teams and hearing their general pitches -- but that has changed according to MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi, who reports that five teams have submitted contract offers to the 26-year-old superstar. Those teams are the Dodgers, Mets, Yankees and Blue Jays as well as the Red Sox, who are reportedly ""stepping up efforts"" to sign Soto. That is obviously a significant step in the process, especially since MLB.com's Mark Feinsand has said that ""the feeling around the industry"" is that Soto's decision could be made before the annual Winter Meetings get underway on Dec. 9 in Dallas. On Tuesday, Sean McAdam of MassLive.com also reported that there is a ""very good"" chance Soto's decision comes before the Meetings begin. More > The Phillies are among the teams interested in acquiring White Sox ace Garrett Crochet, and Alec Bohm could be one of the players heading to Chicago if a deal is struck, according to USA Today's Bob Nightengale. If the Phillies trade Bohm and create a void at third base, Nightengale adds that Philadelphia ""is expected to make a strong play"" for Alex Bregman or Willy Adames. Bregman has also drawn interest from the Tigers and Red Sox. Adames has spent his entire seven-year Major League career at shortstop and hasn't played third base since 2013, his first year as a pro. However, he is reportedly open to moving to the hot corner ""for the right deal and the right team,"" according to MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi. Morosi said Tuesday that the Astros are also interested in Adames as a third baseman. Houston would have a clear need at the position if it can't re-sign Bregman. Adames, who received some down-ballot MVP votes this year, has been a plus defender at shortstop over each of the past three seasons, judging by outs above average. His talent on both sides of the ball and apparent willingness to accommodate a team by moving to third base has created ""broad"" interest in the 29-year-old, per Morosi. The Angels have been the most aggressive club in free agency this offseason and kept it up with their first big splash, agreeing to terms with lefty Yusei Kikuchi early Monday on a three-year, $63 million deal, a source told MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. Here is a breakdown of this move from all angles, via MLB.com experts. More > The Phillies and White Sox have discussed potential trade packages for left-handed ace Garrett Crochet that include Phillies All-Star third baseman Alec Bohm and highly touted outfield prospect Justin Crawford, per a report from USA Today's Bob Nightengale. More > The Braves could look to add an outfielder in free agency after non-tendering Ramón Laureano last week, Ken Rosenthal reports for The Athletic (subscription required). According to Rosenthal, the Braves would prefer a left-handed hitting outfielder, because their only current lefty bats are Michael Harris II, Jarred Kelenic, Matt Olson and switch-hitter Ozzie Albies. But they would also be willing to pursue a right-handed hitter. Even though Atlanta's outfield depth is currently thin, Rosenthal writes that the Braves don't necessarily need to go after one of the top-of-the-market outfielders -- Juan Soto, Anthony Santander, Teoscar Hernández and Jurickson Profar -- because Ronald Acuña Jr. is expected to return from his torn ACL a month or two into the 2025 season. The next tier of left-handed-hitting free-agent outfielders that the Braves could pursue includes Michael Conforto, Ben Gamel, Jason Heyward, Travis Jankowski, Max Kepler, David Peralta, Mike Tauchman, Alex Verdugo and Jesse Winker. Right-handed-hitting free-agent outfielders include Mark Canha, Randal Grichuk, Austin Hays, Connor Joe, Manuel Margot, Andrew McCutchen, Tyler O'Neill, Tommy Pham and Michael A. Taylor. The veteran first basemen on the free-agent market could be in demand among teams looking for a more affordable option than Pete Alonso or Christian Walker. The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal reports (subscription required) that the Pirates, Mariners, D-backs and Tigers all could be looking to upgrade at first base, but not for the price tag that Alonso and Walker will likely command. The Nationals could also join that list, although they still might pursue Alonso or Walker. Rosenthal believes that means there could be plenty of demand for first basemen like Paul Goldschmidt, Carlos Santana, Anthony Rizzo, Josh Bell and Justin Turner. The Tigers are interested in free-agent third baseman Alex Bregman, according to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman in an article for the New York Post. Heyman adds that the only club Bregman has played for in the Major Leagues, the Astros, have submitted a contract offer in an effort to re-sign the two-time All-Star, and that the Red Sox have ""inquired and could be a fit for Bregman if they move Rafael Devers to first."" If Bregman was to sign with Detroit, it would reunite him with his former manager in Houston, A.J. Hinch. Hinch was the manager when Bregman and the Astros won the franchise's first World Series title in 2017. With Garrett Crochet headlining the list of potential trade candidates this offseason, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reports in the New York Post that four clubs -- the Orioles, Red Sox, Dodgers and Phillies -- are showing the most interest in acquiring the White Sox left-hander. More > Dodgers right-hander Walker Buehler threw the final pitch of this season at Yankee Stadium, closing out Game 5 of the World Series in the Bronx. Might Yankee Stadium also be where Buehler throws his first pitch in 2025? MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi has been told that there is ""some mutual interest"" between Buehler and the Yankees, who are looking to augment their starting rotation this offseason. More > The Royals and Reds completed a trade Friday headlined by former college teammates, right-handed pitcher Brady Singer and second baseman Jonathan India, heading in opposite directions. The Reds bolster their rotation with Singer, who pitched to a 3.71 ERA over a career-high 179 2/3 innings this season. India, the 2021 National League Rookie of the Year, addresses one of Kansas City's top priorities for this offseason: adding more offense. The Royals also received 25-year-old outfielder Joey Wiemer, who hasn't hit much in his limited time in the big leagues but did record eight outs above average while playing for the Brewers in 2023. The Red Sox are definitely one of the teams vying for Juan Soto. However, will this year's No. 1 free agent actually end up with Boston? MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi said Friday that he will be ""surprised"" if that happens. If Soto does sign elsewhere, the Red Sox will have to pivot to some of the other big bats on the market, and Morosi considers Boston to be one of the top candidates to sign Teoscar Hernández. More > Roki Sasaki isn't the only marquee Japanese pitcher who is expected to make the jump to the Majors this offseason. The 35-year-old Tomoyuki Sugano doesn't possess Sasaki's top-notch velocity, but as a two-time winner of the Sawamura Award -- the Japanese equivalent to the Cy Young Award -- Sugano should have his fair share of suitors. MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi has identified two of them this week: the Angels and the Giants. More > Although outfielder/first baseman Cody Bellinger exercised his player option for 2025, it’s not a guarantee that he’ll be with the Cubs on Opening Day. According to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required), rival executives say that the Cubs want to trade the 29-year-old. More > MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said Wednesday that Sasaki is expected to be part of the 2025 international amateur signing class, which means the Japanese right-hander likely won't sign with a club before Jan. 15. ""It looks like ... the signing will happen in the new pool period,"" Manfred said via The Athletic's Evan Drelich. More > Thirteen players were tendered a qualifying offer (a one-year, $21.05 million deal for 2025) this offseason, but Reds right-hander Nick Martinez was the only one who accepted prior to Tuesday's 4 p.m. ET deadline. The following 12 players rejected the qualifying offer and will remain free agents: Since the system was implemented in 2012, only 14 players to receive a QO have accepted it.

MLB News,5 teams on the spot after Snell’s deal with Dodgers,https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-teams-with-more-pressure-blake-snell-dodgers-deal,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 15:48:43 GMT",,"Will Leitch No one thought the Dodgers were just going to rest on their laurels after winning their eighth World Series last month, but even for them, bringing in Blake Snell, the two-time Cy Young winner and best starting pitcher on the market, for five years and $182 million was jarring. Clearly, the Dodgers have gotten tired of running out of starting pitchers by the time they get to October; they’re going to make sure all those innings are filled by as many top-shelf guys as they can find. There aren’t that many more top-shelf than Snell, who won the National League Cy Young with the Padres two years ago but may have actually been even better in the second half of 2024. The Dodgers just won the World Series, and they already got better. Snell had other suitors, of course; every team needs great starting pitching. And that means Snell agreeing with the Dodgers puts pressure on all sorts of other teams who must now figure out how to react in the wake of such a massive move. These clubs might have to resort to fighting over the other top free agent arms available, namely Corbin Burnes, Max Fried and Jack Flaherty, or perhaps they'll now be jostling to trade for White Sox pitcher Garrett Crochet. Here are five teams on the spot, feeling pressure now that Snell is in Dodger Blue. 1. GiantsIt does make sense to start with the team that Snell is leaving. The Giants always knew that the deal they signed with Snell, loaded as it was with opt-outs, could only end up as a one-year stint, though you can understand, after he went 0-3 with a 6.31 ERA in the first half of 2024, if they thought he might be hanging around for a while. His incredible second half, 5-0 with a 1.45 ERA, assured he’d be peddling his wares, and that’s particularly disappointing because the Giants were otherwise a non-factor last season – it’s not like Snell’s campaign made much of a difference. The Giants have Buster Posey in charge now, and it’s clearly an imperative to him to make this team better, immediately. That just got a lot harder without last year’s ace. Posey has to figure out how to keep this rotation afloat after losing his star pitcher to the Giants’ hated rival … among, frankly, a to-do list that was already quite large. 2. MetsThe Mets were often included on the list of Snell suitors out of default – at this point, people assume they are in on every big free agent. However, the Mets seem more likely to follow their 2024 pitching strategy of finding a whole bunch of veteran innings eaters and seeing which ones stick. This strategy actually worked pretty well with Jose Quintana, Luis Severino and Sean Manaea last year, but those three guys are free agents themselves now and need to be replaced, too. For a team with the 2025 ambitions that the Mets have, they have several gaping holes in the rotation. Snell would have filled one of them. Now they need to find somebody else … in a market that just got established as more expensive than some might have thought. 3. OriolesHere’s a pattern you’re going to see this entire offseason, at least until the Orioles themselves step up and break it: A free agent who could fill a need for Baltimore signs, Orioles fans grumble and openly wonder if their team is ever going to make that aggressive move they’ve been waiting for, Baltimore brass will tell everyone to be patient … and then another free agent will sign. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. The Orioles may still bring back Burnes, but Snell in many ways made a ton of sense for them, a true ace that elevated the whole upside of the team – particularly in the playoffs, which have proven so vexing for Baltimore the last couple of years. And if the Orioles don’t bring back Burnes – who will have plenty of suitors himself – suddenly this team looks like they’re right back where they were a year ago. And the pattern will continue. 4. PhilliesNo, the Phillies were never considered suitors for Snell, and understandably so: One thing they probably don’t need is another veteran pitcher. (Not that they would have shaken a stick at Snell if he had decided to come to Philly, of course.) But they are still a team packed with guys in their 30s, desperate to win a World Series before everybody gets too old for them to do so, who just watched their most formidable NL competitors (who are also the defending champs) sign one of the best pitchers in baseball. It’s fair to say Philly would have loved to have seen Snell go to the American League, that’s for sure. The Phillies may still add this offseason, and you wonder if the Dodgers getting Snell puts even more pressure on them to do so. The Phillies don’t have many shopping days left until Christmas; they need to win right now, and the Dodgers made it more difficult for them to do so. 5. Red SoxThey’re in on everybody! This is what we keep hearing about the Red Sox this offseason, that you should consider them serious contenders for every major free agent, and you can forgive Red Sox fans if they chose to believe it when they see it. Starting pitching is the most obvious need for the Red Sox – though if they go big on Juan Soto, no one will complain much about that – and now there’s one fewer option on the board. And one that may have just set the market at a surprisingly high level. Mark Feinsand wrote last night that they were all in on Snell, and now they will likely have to target one of the other high-end lefties available. Bottom line: The Red Sox haven’t operated much like the Red Sox the last few years. Snell would have been a logical place to start returning to their old ways. They’ll now have to start somewhere else … if they start at all."
MLB News,544 feet?! This high schooler absolutely clobbered one off the Globe Life videoboard,https://www.mlb.com/news/high-schooler-hits-544-foot-homer-globe-life-field,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 18:05:22 GMT",,"Josh Jackson A post shared by POWER SHOWCASE World Classic 🌐 (@powershowcasewc) There are long balls, and then there are long balls. Easton Autrey, a junior at Corsicana High School in Texas, teed off with absolute moonshots on Tuesday during a showcase at Globe Life Field. In a 14-homer onslaught, the University of Texas commit hit one ball 544 feet and knocked out lights on the videoboard. A post shared by POWER SHOWCASE World Classic 🌐 (@powershowcasewc) Though Autrey was using a composite metal bat instead of a wood one, 544 feet is still plenty impressive for a high schooler. The blast is not only longer than any home run hit during a Major League game at Globe Life Field -- the Athletics' Seth Brown hit one 472 feet there in 2021, and the Angels' Mike Trout matched that in 2022 -- but it's nearly 40 feet longer than any home run hit in a Major League in the Statcast Era, period. It's 24 feet farther than the longest Home Run Derby shot in the Statcast Era, Juan Soto's majestic 520-foot moonshot at Coors Field in 2021. And Autrey, one of the top prep prospects from Texas in the 2026 Draft class, did not stop at one jaw-dropping jack -- the 544-foot blast was part of a pair of scoreboard shots. He hit homers to every level of seating in the ballpark, the showcase reported in a press release. The 6-foot-4, 233-pound corner infielder is the son of Corsicana H.S. coach Heath Autrey and brother of Sam Houston State first baseman Hunter Autrey. ""I’m ... looking forward to seeing how far I can hit a baseball at Globe Life Field,” the 17-year-old told the Corsicana Daily Sun before the showcase."
MLB News,These 15 hitters are thankful for the luckiest hits of '24,https://www.mlb.com/news/the-luckiest-hits-of-the-2024-mlb-season,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 02:19:34 GMT",,"David Adler Everyone can find something to be thankful for on Thanksgiving … especially these hitters. Not every home run is a no-doubter. Not every base hit is a scorched line drive. Sometimes, the batter just gets lucky. Let's look back at some of the most fun lucky hits of the year. Here are 15 of the luckiest hits of the 2024 MLB season. 1) Sean Bouchard, Rockies -- April 20 Fielders lose balls in the sun every year. But losing a ball in the snow? That you don't see every day. Believe it or not, it happened this year. In April, the Rockies and Mariners played a game while it was snowing at Coors Field. Bouchard skied a popup to first base. Ty France lost track of the ball in the snow -- white baseball, white snowflakes -- and it dropped to the infield untouched, giving Bouchard a once-in-a-lifetime kind of base hit. Based on his 88.5 mph exit velocity and 73 degree launch angle, Bouchard had a hit probability of (essentially) zero percent. But hit probability doesn't apply to snow baseball. 2) Justin Turner, Blue Jays -- June 27 Turner ended up with a hit on a 35.2 mph cue shot down the first-base line -- that's 60 mph below Statcast's hard-hit threshold of 95-plus -- thanks to the ball playing tricks on Yankees rookie first baseman Ben Rice. Turner's trickler looked like it was spinning foul, and Rice followed it down the line to try to let it go foul, but it never did. Rice still might have gotten Turner out … except the ball doinked perfectly off the first-base bag and bounced away from him, allowing Turner to reach safely with an RBI single. 3) Randy Arozarena, Rays -- June 16 Turner wasn't the only one to end up with a lucky hit thanks to the ball hitting a base. Arozarena did the same thing two weeks earlier, only he whacked a ball off the second-base bag for his own RBI single against the Braves. It should have been an inning-ending groundout, as Ozzie Albies was perfectly positioned to field the ball up the middle … until it caromed off the bag in front of him and bounced high over his head and into shallow left-center field. 4) Bryson Stott, Phillies -- Aug. 24 Here's one more crazy bounce. This one wasn't off a base, it was off the lip of the infield grass. Stott's routine chopper to second turned into a single when the ball kicked high into the air, over Royals second baseman Michael Massey's head and into the outfield. Stott gets lots of ground ball hits -- 50 of his 124 total hits in 2024, over 40%, were on the ground -- but even he couldn't expect this one. 5) Cedric Mullins, Orioles -- July 14 This might be the zaniest walk-off of the year. The Yankees had this game won against the Orioles, twice, but two crazy plays gave the O's the win. First, Anthony Volpe booted a ground ball at short that extended the game with two outs in the ninth inning. Then, this: Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Mullins flared a line drive to left field that Alex Verdugo should have tracked down easily. He had a 99% catch probability on the play, needing to cover just 46 feet in 4.4 seconds to get to the ball. But Verdugo broke in instead of back, and by the time he recovered, it was far too late. Verdugo went sprawling to the turf as he tried in vain to get back to the baseball, which landed beyond his reach and gave Mullins a walk-off double. 6) Enmanuel Valdez, Red Sox -- June 1 Home runs can be lucky, too, especially when they're a ""stadium special"" -- a homer that would only be gone in the exact ballpark it's hit in. Valdez hit a true stadium special home run at Fenway Park in June, tucking a fly ball just inside Pesky's Pole in the right-field corner. Valdez's home run was hit just 86.5 mph, and traveled just 318 feet. It was both the softest-hit and the shortest over-the-fence home run of the 2024 MLB season, and it would be a homer only at Fenway. 7) LaMonte Wade Jr., Giants -- May 12 Wade got lucky that he hit this ball at Oracle Park. The right-field wall in San Francisco is high, but not deep … and Wade hit the type of skyscraper that's perfectly designed to clear that exact wall. His home run against the Reds had a 50 degree launch angle, giving it enough height to clear the wall down the right-field line even with a projected distance of just 321 feet. That's not just the highest home run of the 2024 season -- it's tied for the highest home run of the entire Statcast era. There have only been three homers hit with a 50 degree launch angle: Wade's in 2024, Xander Bogaerts' on Aug. 13, 2021, and J.D. Martinez's on May 15, 2015. 8) Pedro Pagés, Cardinals -- June 16 Wrigley Field is always good for some wacky hits, thanks to the winds that carry the baseball all over the place. This one was a wind-blown home run that had no business being a home run. Pagés barely cleared the ivy in left field with a 93.6 mph, 36-degree fly ball -- not a hard-hit ball, which has to be at least 95 mph. In the Statcast era, there have been nearly 500 balls hit between 93-94 mph at a 36 degree launch angle, the same as Pagés'. Those balls are hits less than 10% of the time, and are home runs only about 5% of the time. Pagés' homer is almost always a flyout, unless you catch the Wrigley wind just right. 9) Rhys Hoskins, Brewers -- April 20 Hoskins has a big slugger's big swing. But in this game against the Cardinals, he got a hit on about as un-Hoskins-like a swing as you could imagine. Hoskins dinked a single over a drawn-in infield -- just off a leaping Paul Goldschmidt's glove -- with a half-swing that had no business even putting the ball in the air, let alone into the outfield. Hoskins' bat speed was just 34.1 mph, the lowest tracked bat speed on any base hit all season that wasn't a ground ball. 10) Gunnar Henderson, Orioles -- Sept. 20 Two different outfielders had a 99% catch probability on this fly ball by Henderson leading off the game: Tigers center fielder Parker Meadows, and right fielder Kerry Carpenter. Either one could have caught it; instead, each looked to the other to make the play, and neither did. Henderson's ball fell between them for a double. In a year when the Orioles star had 75 extra-base hits, this one was the biggest gift. 11) Bobby Witt Jr., Royals -- Sept. 14 Speaking of superstar hitters getting freebies they don't need -- here's Witt, the AL MVP runner-up, hitting his 43rd double of the season. But the only reason it was a hit at all was because Oneil Cruz, whom the Pirates converted from a shortstop to a center fielder late in the year, took a full-circle route to the baseball. Cruz started back on the ball before looping all the way around and back in, and he couldn't make a shoestring catch. It's hard to blame him when it was just his 15th career game in center, but Witt still got his lucky extra-base hit. 12) Eugenio Suárez, D-backs -- Aug. 16 Four different Rays could have caught this 226-foot-high popup by Suárez. It was in the air for 7.8 seconds -- the longest hang time on any base hit in MLB all season. None of them did. Left fielder Dylan Carlson and center fielder Kameron Misner both had a 99% catch probability, and shortstop José Caballero and second baseman Christopher Morel could both have easily tracked it down, too. Instead, all four Rays jogged toward the general vicinity of the ball, craning their necks toward the Tropicana Field roof. At the last moment, Caballero and Morel both went to make the play … and collided with each other, knocking the ball free and resulting in a popup double for Suárez. The Rays did get a little luck of their own on the play, though, as they managed to throw out Lourdes Gurriel Jr., who was trying to score all the way from first on the play. 13) Kyle Schwarber, Phillies -- May 27 Here's another popup that nobody got. The highest launch angle on a base hit all season belongs to Schwarber, who hit a single at 84 degrees -- almost perfectly straight up in the air (that would be 90 degrees) against the Giants. Schwarber's hit traveled just 18 feet out in front of home plate, but none of the Giants infielders could get a bead on it, and it dropped. But Schwarber's good fortune didn't stop there. The ball actually spun back into foul territory behind home plate after it hit the ground, which would have made it a foul ball … except it touched Giants catcher Patrick Bailey, who was standing in fair territory. Fair ball, base hit. 14) Luis García Jr., Nationals -- June 1 García was the beneficiary of a blooper you don't see often from a Major League fielder. On June 1 against the Guardians, he hit a routine fly ball to right field, but as Johnathan Rodriguez jogged in to make the catch, his feet slipped out from under him. Rodriguez plopped to the turf, and a second later, so did the baseball … only 16 feet away from where he'd started the play. García ended up with a hit on a fly ball where Rodriguez had a 99% catch probability. 15) Mookie Betts, Dodgers -- World Series Game 5 Let's finish it off with the Lucky Hit of the Year: Betts' ground ball to first base in the infamous fifth inning of Game 5 of the World Series. Betts squibbed this ball just 49.8 mph off the bat at a -12 degree launch angle -- that's a hit probability of just 11%, making it the least likely hit of the World Series. It should have been an out. And you know the rest. Anthony Rizzo fielded the ball at first base. Gerrit Cole didn't cover the bag. And Rizzo couldn't make it himself, allowing Betts to scamper through with a base hit that extended the inning, set up the Dodgers' five-run rally and helped them clinch the World Series. Betts can be extra thankful for his lucky hit, since it brought the Dodgers a championship."
MLB News,Two-time champ Crawford announces retirement after 14 seasons,https://www.mlb.com/news/brandon-crawford-retires,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 01:40:00 GMT",,"Maria Guardado SAN FRANCISCO -- Brandon Crawford, a two-time World Series champion who spent 13 seasons starring for his hometown Giants, announced his retirement from Major League Baseball on Wednesday. ""Baseball has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember, and for the rest of my life I will be thankful for the opportunities and experiences it has given me,"" Crawford wrote on Instagram. ""Time is precious. I'm incredibly grateful for all the years I spent playing the game I love, but now it is time for me to spend it with the people who I'm most thankful for."" Brandon Crawford has announced his retirement after 14 seasons, three All-Star selections, four Gold Gloves, a Silver Slugger Award, and two #WorldSeries championships. pic.twitter.com/OD1fR8d3re A Bay Area native, Crawford grew up attending games at Candlestick Park and dreamed of playing shortstop for the Giants. He accomplished that and more after being selected by San Francisco in the fourth round of the 2008 MLB Draft, developing into arguably the greatest shortstop in franchise history. A three-time All-Star and four-time Gold Glove winner, Crawford appeared in a franchise-record 1,617 regular-season games at shortstop and helped San Francisco capture World Series titles in 2012 and ’14. “It was an honor to get to know Brandon as a friend and as a teammate,” Giants president of baseball operations Buster Posey said in a statement. “From the first day we were both drafted in 2008 to our final year playing together in 2021, it was an honor to play alongside him for 14 years. Whether it was the clutch moments like the grand slam he hit in the 2014 Wild Card Game in Pittsburgh, the franchise-record, seven-hit game he recorded in Miami, or the dazzling defensive plays and acrobatic throws he made over and over again, Brandon made his mark in a way few athletes ever do. “I’m beyond grateful for our friendship and wish him all the best in this next chapter of life.” Crawford, 37, enjoyed his finest season in 2021, when he finished fourth in National League MVP voting after batting .298/.373/.522 with a career-high 24 home runs and 90 RBIs for the 107-win Giants. He became a free agent for the first time in his career after his two-year, $32 million contract extension with San Francisco expired at the end of the 2023 campaign, and Crawford chose to play one more season in St. Louis, where he batted .169 over 28 games before being released in August. Brandon Crawford loved @SFGiants fans and they loved him back 🧡 pic.twitter.com/LzZVaJktR7 Crawford finished with a .249 lifetime average, 147 home runs and 1,404 hits while accounting for 29.3 bWAR over his 14 big league seasons. The Giants plan to honor Crawford on April 26, when the club is fittingly scheduled to face Bruce Bochy’s Rangers at Oracle Park. “Watching Brandon play was an absolute privilege for not only me but for Giants fans everywhere,” Giants president and CEO Larry Baer said in a statement. “He was an All-Star, Gold Glove and Silver Slugger winner, a two-time World Series champion, and a Lou Gehrig and Willie Mac Award winner that always carried himself with class, honor and respect. The Giants have been incredibly blessed to have had Brandon as part of the franchise for 16 years -- really for his entire 37 years … as this chapter closes on his career, his legacy in the game will be celebrated by fans, teammates, and future generations of players who look up to him by the example he set.” We wish Brandon Crawford the best in his retirement! 🥳🎉The longtime shortstop and 14-year MLB vet got exactly 1,000 Minor League at-bats for 7 different clubs. pic.twitter.com/iRAsSiWHJw Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball."
MLB News,"Red Sox 'stepping up efforts' to sign Soto, also pursuing frontline arm (reports)",https://www.mlb.com/news/red-sox-rumors-latest-trades-and-signings,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 18:20:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of all the latest free-agent and trade rumors involving the Red Sox right here. Nov. 27: Red Sox 'stepping up efforts' to sign Soto, also pursuing frontline arm (reports)The Red Sox are one of the five teams that have made a contract offer to Juan Soto, a source told MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi. No one knows the value of that offer, but it shouldn't be taken lightly as it seems like Boston means business in its pursuit of the offseason's No. 1 free agent. Writing in the New York Post on Tuesday, Mark W. Sanchez and MLB Network insider Jon Heyman said the Red Sox ""are increasingly seen as a legitimate contender in the sweepstakes for the generational slugger as word is they are stepping up efforts to lure the superstar hitter away from their historic AL East nemesis."" Boston has been linked to many of the top free agents during the early portion of the offseason, including starting pitchers Corbin Burnes and Max Fried as well as infielder Willy Adames and outfielder Teoscar Hernández. According to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, the Red Sox were also in on Blake Snell before he reached a five-year deal (per sources) with the Dodgers on Tuesday. Boston is believed to be seeking a left-handed starter, so it could turn its focus to Fried now that Snell is off the market. Per a report from the Boston Globe (subscription required), the Red Sox are looking to add a top starter even if they can seal the deal with Soto. Signing Soto would leave them with less flexibility to do so, though CEO/president Sam Kennedy said last week that the Red Sox are open to pushing their payroll beyond the first Competitive Balance Tax threshold of $241 million. Including projected salaries for arbitration-eligible players, Cot's Baseball Contracts puts the Red Sox CBT number at roughly $164 million -- $77 million shy of the first tax threshold. If Boston does end up getting priced out of the market for the elite free-agent arms, the club could pursue a trade to fill its need for an ace. In Morosi's view, the Red Sox are a team to watch in the trade market for White Sox lefty Garrett Crochet. Boston is loaded with highly touted position-player prospects, which could make it an attractive trade partner for the White Sox. Nov. 22: Red Sox considered a top candidate for Teoscar if they don't sign SotoThe Red Sox are definitely one of the teams vying for Juan Soto. However, will this year's No. 1 free agent actually end up with Boston? MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi said Friday that he will be ""surprised"" if that happens. If Soto does sign elsewhere, the Red Sox will have to pivot to some of the other big bats on the market, and Morosi considers Boston to be one of the top candidates to sign Teoscar Hernández. ""If Juan Soto goes somewhere else ... get ready to listen to a lot of conversation about Teoscar and the Boston Red Sox,"" Morosi said during Friday's edition of Hot Stove. The 32-year-old Hernández is coming off a fantastic season with the Dodgers, highlighted by a career-high 33 home runs. That was his first season in the National League after eight years in the American League. During that time, Hernández posted strong numbers as a visitor in Fenway Park: That includes 14 home runs in 170 at-bats and a .282/.344/.606 slash line. Morosi considers the incumbent Dodgers as another top candidate for Hernández and said the Orioles may be interested in him as well. Last week, ESPN's Jeff Passan reported (subscription required) that the Dodgers are the ""favorites"" to bring back Hernández while also including the Red Sox, O's and Yankees as contenders. Nov 15: Soto has 'productive' 3-hour meeting with Red Sox (report)The Red Sox met with Soto and his representatives, including agent Scott Boras, in Southern California on Thursday night, according to a report from Sean McAdam of MassLive. The meeting, which was of an introductory and informative nature, lasted for three hours and was deemed as “productive,” though neither money nor terms were discussed between the parties. Soto was reportedly “impressed” by Boston’s presentation, which included a video noting the franchise’s history of star players from the Dominican Republic, Soto’s native country. The Red Sox also detailed their plans for the future, highlighting a promising group of prospects who could potentially team up with Soto to help the club be successful in the years to come. Soto is expected to continue to meet with more teams in Southern California over the next few days.

MLB News,30 reasons to be thankful -- 1 for each farm system,https://www.mlb.com/news/prospect-related-reasons-to-be-thankful-2024,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 00:30:00 GMT",,"Sam Dykstra This story was excerpted from MLB Pipeline's newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. Thanksgiving arrives in the United States on Thursday, and while we know football tends to rule the day, we know baseball will still be on the minds of fans as they give thanks between rounds of turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce. Some will be dreaming of the days when they can give thanks for the additions of Juan Soto and Roki Sasaki. Others will look to prospects already in-house to provide hope for the future.   We don’t want anyone feeling left out at the beginning of the holiday season. Here’s a reason why fans of each farm system should give thanks this week: More from MLB Pipeline:• Top 100 prospects | Stats | Video | Podcast | Complete coverage Jump to: AL Central | AL West | NL East | NL Central | NL West Blue Jays: Arjun Nimmala exploded for Single-A Dunedin after a brief midseason hiatus in the Florida Complex League, slugging .564 with 13 homers in 53 games from June 27 onward. The 2023 20th overall pick has the plus power to be Toronto’s next hitting prospect star. Orioles: Baltimore still boasts a deep pipeline of hitting talent, headlined by Top 15 overall prospects Coby Mayo and Samuel Basallo, and that depth could help the franchise pull off another Corbin Burnes-style trade for a frontline starter. Rays: Internal development of Top 100 prospects Carson Williams, Xavier Isaac and Brayden Taylor and a busy Trade Deadline that brought in Aidan Smith, Brody Hopkins, Jackson Baumeister and others put Tampa Bay at the top of MLB Pipeline’s Farm System Rankings at midseason. Red Sox: The Big Three (Roman Anthony, Marcelo Mayer, Kyle Teel) added a Major Fourth with Kristian Campbell’s breakout in his first full season, and Boston ended 2024 with four Top 25 overall prospects. No other organization has more than two. Yankees: George Lombard Jr., the club's 2023 first-rounder, made louder contact at Single-A Tampa than his .348 SLG would indicate (110.3 max exit velocity, 102.7 90th percentile EV), and his fielding ability routinely impressed scouts at shortstop, making him one of the best defenders in the Minors.  Guardians: Cleveland continues to play into its type with eight Top 10 prospects with hit tools of 55 or above. At the top of the list: No. 1 overall pick Travis Bazzana and his 70-grade bat. Royals: Jac Caglianone had the most prodigious power in this year’s Draft class, and his exit velocities in the Arizona Fall League were special, adding to the belief that he can be a one-way star even if his pitching doesn’t translate as well to the pro side. Tigers: Deadline pickup Thayron Liranzo and Triple Crown winner Josue Briceño were talks of the Arizona Fall League after packing a serious punch at the plate. They’ll be two of the most closely followed prospects in next year’s Spring Training as they compete to be Detroit’s backstop of the future. Twins: Walker Jenkins climbed to No. 2 overall in our Top 100 rankings at the end of the season after working around hamstring issues to show high-ceiling upside during a climb to Double-A in his age-19 season. White Sox: Noah Schultz and Hagen Smith are the top two left-handed pitching prospects in the game, and they play in the same system, making pitching a major point of strength during the South Side rebuild.  Angels: Christian Moore’s post-Draft run (.347/.400/.584, six homers in 25 games) was one of the biggest stories of the Minors’ second half, and the former Tennessee star could easily be the Halos’ next quick climber to The Show. Astros: Brice Matthews’ first full season, in which he hit 15 homers and stole 32 bags in only 79 games across four levels including Triple-A, should give Houston fans at least some hope for the future of third base if Alex Bregman departs in free agency. Athletics: The owner of a 70-grade hit tool, 2023 sixth overall pick Jacob Wilson retains rookie eligibility heading into '25, and his ability to hit for a high average and play a solid shortstop could put him in line for a Rookie of the Year run and a possible PPI pick. Mariners: Seattle has three Top 100 prospects at shortstop in Colt Emerson, Cole Young and Felnin Celesten, and it should be fun to see them sort themselves out at different levels again in 2025. Rangers: Sebastian Walcott has No. 1 overall prospect upside as an 18-year-old shortstop with plus power, above-average speed and a cannon of an arm.  Braves: Travis d’Arnaud’s departure to the Angels opens a catching spot on Atlanta’s roster. Good thing 23-year-old Drake Baldwin is practically ready for The Show after showing an all-around skill set behind the plate in the Minors, AFL and Premier12 tournament. Marlins: Thomas White’s K-heavy first full year gives the system a crack at a left-handed ace, while the midseason acquisitions of Agustin Ramirez and Deyvison De Los Santos provides hope that there could be a ton of power coming to Miami's lineup in the future. Mets: Be thankful Brandon Sproat granted the Mets permission to draft him a second time after not signing out of the third round in 2022. The 2023 second-rounder posted a 3.40 ERA and 131 strikeouts in 116 1/3 innings across three levels this year, including Triple-A Syracuse. Nationals: James Wood’s graduation would have left many other systems without a superstar outfield prospect. The Nats still claim Dylan Crews atop their mantle, and after showing steady improvements at each stop in the Minors, the 2023 second overall pick could explode as a Rookie of the Year candidate next summer. Phillies: Pitching for the first time in games since spring 2023, Andrew Painter looked like his old self as the AFL Pitcher of the Year, and his upper-90s fastball and special control could contribute to Philadelphia’s pitching depth next year.  Brewers: Jesus Made looks like Milwaukee’s next big international development story after slashing .331/.458/.554 with 21 extra-base hits, 28 steals and a 28/39 K/BB ratio in 51 games in the Dominican Summer League. The under-the-hood data is just as good for a 17-year-old, kicking the hype into another gear. Cardinals: Look to the middle infield. JJ Wetherholt might turn out to be a huge steal for St. Louis at the seventh slot in the 2024 Draft, and No. 4 prospect Thomas Saggese should be in play for the team’s starting second-base job after tamping down his aggression at the plate in the AFL. Cubs: Chicago has eight Top 100 prospects in Matt Shaw, Owen Caissie, Cade Horton, Moises Ballesteros, James Triantos, Kevin Alcántara, Cam Smith and Jefferson Rojas. No other organization has more than six. Pirates: What do you get a system that’s already produced Paul Skenes? How about another high-quality right-hander in Bubba Chandler, who shows upper-90s heat as part of a four-pitch mix that dominated Triple-A? Reds: The Wake Forest pitching lab. The Demon Deacons gave the Reds 2023 seventh overall pick Rhett Lowder, who debuted in Cincy in late August, and also developed Chase Burns into a No. 2 overall pick by the same club in July.  D-backs: Yu-Min Lin was the starting pitcher in Chinese Taipei’s 4-0 upset win over Japan in the Premier12 gold-medal game on Sunday. It was a terrific way for the 21-year-old left-hander to end 2024 after he missed six weeks with facial fractures suffered from a foul ball with Double-A Amarillo. Dodgers: Los Angeles remains one of the best organizations for identifying and developing talent despite low Draft picks. The AFL served as a reminder of that after Zyhir Hope (acquired from the Cubs in the Michael Busch trade) and Eriq Swan (2023 fourth-rounder) caught industry attention in the desert. Giants: Bryce Eldridge’s climb through four levels in his age-19 season gives the San Francisco system the shining star it so desperately needs. The 2023 16th overall pick has at least plus power from the left side, and his propensity for loud contact should help his average too. Padres: Breathe easy, San Diego. Ethan Salas rebounded from a rough season at High-A Fort Wayne with a solid Fall League, buoying his status as a future All-Star catcher who can impress from both sides of the plate. Rockies: After striking out 169 in 118 innings between High-A and Double-A in his first full season, Chase Dollander could be the high-end arm the Colorado system has always craved. His fastball, in particular, has the velo and carry to dominate at all levels."
MLB News,Will Yanks' focus on Soto cost them in SP market?,https://www.mlb.com/news/yankees-rumors-latest-trades-and-signings,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 22:22:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of all the latest Yankees-related free agent and trade rumors right here. You can follow the latest Juan Soto rumors here. Nov. 27: Yanks increase offer to Soto, eyeing backup plansThe Yankees increased their initial offer to Juan Soto in recent days, per a report from MLB Network insider Jon Heyman -- but they've also checked in on some other top free agents. Heyman wrote for the New York Post that the Yanks have also touched base with Corbin Burnes and Max Fried, though the club has not yet extended an offer to either player. That would likely change quickly if Soto signs elsewhere, as the Yankees could pivot to the likes of Burnes or Fried -- and other top free agents -- as part of a contingency plan. For now, though, the Yankees' main focus remains on Soto. Nov. 27: Yanks focused on Soto as FA pitching market heats upJuan Soto isn’t the only big-name free agent to whom the Yankees have been linked this offseason, but the club might be in a holding pattern until the Soto situation is resolved. According to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman, the Yankees’ “near total focus” is on Soto right now, which could hinder New York’s chances of landing an ace pitcher as the market begins to move. Blake Snell reached a five-year, $182 million deal with the Dodgers (per sources) on Tuesday, taking one of the Yankees’ reported rotation targets off the board. Per MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, the Bronx Bombers are believed to be seeking a left-handed starter, potentially putting free agent Max Fried on their radar. However, there's a lot of competition for Fried, especially now that Snell is off the board. Three of the Yankees' AL East rivals -- the Red Sox, Orioles and Blue Jays -- have also been connected to Fried, but they are far from the only teams looking for starters. Nov. 25: What might a Soto contingency plan look like?The Yankees are one of four teams -- along with the Mets, Blue Jays and Red Sox -- that remain most likely to sign Juan Soto, per a report from USA Today's Bob Nightengale. But what if Soto signs elsewhere? That same report from Nightengale suggests that one potential pivot for the Yanks would still bring in quite the haul. That would include signing free-agent first baseman Christian Walker, along with either Willy Adames or Alex Bregman to play third base with Jazz Chisholm Jr. shifting to second -- but that's not all. New York could also then attempt to swing a trade with the Cubs for outfielder Cody Bellinger, plus use some of the money it would have given to Soto to make a push for an elite starting pitcher. Of course, all of that hinges on whether the Yanks bring back Soto -- something that is still very much in play. Nov. 22: 'Mutual interest' between Yanks, RHP Buehler (report)Dodgers right-hander Walker Buehler threw the final pitch of this season at Yankee Stadium, closing out Game 5 of the World Series in the Bronx. Might Yankee Stadium also be where Buehler throws his first pitch in 2025? MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi has been told that there is ""some mutual interest"" between Buehler and the Yankees, who are looking to augment their starting rotation this offseason. Buehler was largely ineffective during the '24 season as he made his way back from a second Tommy John surgery. But he showed flashes of his former All-Star self late in the season, capped by six scoreless innings across two outings during the Fall Classic -- a five-inning start in Game 3 and that one-inning appearance out of the bullpen in the finale. The 30-year-old is a former first-round Draft pick who is not too far removed from being one of the best pitchers in baseball. In 2021, Buehler finished fourth in the National League Cy Young voting after recording a 2.47 ERA with 212 strikeouts over 207 2/3 innings. Nov. 20: Steinbrenner: Yankees 'in the mix' for SotoThe Yankees met with Juan Soto on Monday in California, and team owner Hal Steinbrenner confirmed Wednesday that it was a ""good meeting"" with ""very honest back-and-forth dialogue."" Steinbrenner said that Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, manager Aaron Boone, president Randy Levine, and special assistant to the GM Omar Minaya were all in attendance during Monday's meeting. But he didn't divulge any part of the team's pitch to Soto or say if any offers were made during the meeting. ""It's been a priority,"" Steinbrenner said about signing Soto. ""We wouldn't have gone out to the West Coast if it wasn't. ... We'll be in the mix. I'll leave it at that."" As of Wednesday, Soto has had in-person meetings with the Yankees, Mets, Red Sox and Blue Jays. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Tuesday that Soto will also meet with the Phillies at some point. Soto also plans to sit down with the Dodgers this week, according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. Steinbrenner said he has ""no idea"" if the Yankees will meet with Soto again or if he's confident that the club can re-sign the 26-year-old superstar. But he added, ""[W]e've got the ability to sign any player we want to sign."" Nov. 18: Yanks meet with Soto (report)MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reports in an article for the New York Post that the Yankees met with superstar slugger Juan Soto in Southern California on Monday as they look to retain him after he helped lead them to the World Series. Heyman noted that owner Hal Steinbrenner led a delegation from New York that included general manager Brian Cashman and manager Aaron Boone. Per Heyman, the Yankees are said to be ""gung ho"" about getting a deal done with Soto, who has met with three other clubs so far -- the Blue Jays, Red Sox and Mets -- and is reportedly scheduled to meet with the Dodgers. Nov. 14: Yanks reportedly 'in on everyone' in free agencyAlthough the Yankees are going to make a strong effort to bring back Juan Soto, there’s a real chance the superstar outfielder will sign elsewhere, which means New York needs to have a backup plan in place. That backup plan appears to leave no limits. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Thursday in the New York Post that the Yankees are ""in on everyone."" One day earlier, during his live chat for Bleacher Report, Heyman was a little more specific on which non-Soto players the Yanks might target. Heyman said he sees the Yankees becoming more aggressive in the corner-infield market if they don’t land Soto. In that scenario, the Bronx Bombers could target Pete Alonso to play first base, or pursue Willy Adames or Alex Bregman to handle third base. Adames is a natural shortstop, but he is reportedly willing to move to another position for the right team/contract. The Yankees ended the season with Jazz Chisholm Jr. at the hot corner, but they could move Chisholm to second base to replace free agent Gleyber Torres. Heyman also thinks the Yanks would “look more seriously” at signing a top starting pitcher such as Corbin Burnes or Max Fried to bolster their rotation and pursue switch-hitting slugger Anthony Santander to replace Soto in their outfield.

Nov. 11: Yankees among teams with reported interest in WalkerRe-signing Juan Soto is the Yankees' top priority this offseason, but the club also has a hole at first base that it needs to fill after declining Anthony Rizzo's 2025 club option. The position was a weak spot for the Bronx Bombers in 2024, with Yankees first basemen posting the second-worst wRC+ (76) in MLB. Accordingly, the Yankees are among the teams planning to ""aggressively pursue"" free-agent Christian Walker, per a report from USA Today’s Bob Nightengale. They aren't alone, however, as Nightengale reports that at least five other teams are eyeing the right-handed slugger. The Bronx Bombers have also been connected to Alonso, but the longtime Mets first baseman seems like more of a backup plan in case the Yanks aren't able to re-sign Soto, given the exorbitant cost it would take to sign both players. With the age disparity between Alonso (29) and Walker (33), the latter should come with a much lower price tag, perhaps leaving room in the Yankees' budget to re-sign Soto and add Walker. Walker doesn’t have quite the same power as Alonso, but he’s no slouch with the bat, having recorded 95 homers and an .813 OPS over the past three seasons. In that same time, Alonso has produced 120 homers and an .826 OPS. Walker, meanwhile, is a far better defender, winning three straight Gold Gloves and leading his position with +38 Outs Above Average since the beginning of 2022. Alonso has produced -17 OAA in that span. Nov. 8: Yanks set to meet with Soto soon (report)The Yankees have scheduled their own sitdown with Juan Soto as they get ready to make their pitch to re-sign their superstar slugger, according to a report from the New York Post on Friday. Yanks owner Hal Steinbrenner is expected to fly to California in about a week and a half to meet with Soto. The Mets are also reportedly visiting Soto next week, but per the Post's report, the Yankees have been assured that they will still be able to meet with Soto after that. The New York rivals are two of the favorites to land Soto, the marquee free agent on the market this winter. Soto had arguably the best season of his career in 2024 after the Yankees acquired him from the Padres in a blockbuster trade last December. The 26-year-old batted .288 with 41 home runs, 109 RBIs, 128 runs scored and a .989 OPS and led New York to the American League pennant. Nov. 7: Could Arenado be on the move? Are Yankees a fit?According to reports by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and USA TODAY, eight-time All-Star and 10-time Gold Glove Award-winning third baseman Nolan Arenado could be available in trade discussions if he's willing to waive his no-trade clause. The same goes for veteran starting pitchers Sonny Gray and Lance Lynn. Arenado, who will be entering his age-34 season in 2025, is coming off a year in which he produced the lowest offensive output in any full season (excluding the 2020 pandemic-shortened campaign) since his rookie year in 2013. He finished this past season with a .719 OPS and 16 home runs for St. Louis. Still, he's only two seasons removed from a third-place finish in NL MVP voting. Yankees announcer Michael Kay, on his ESPN Radio show on Thursday, suggested that Arenado would be a good fit at third base for New York as opposed to spending big money on free-agent first baseman Pete Alonso. Nov. 7: Yanks interested in numerous star FAs, 'aggressive' in bullpen marketThe No. 1 item on the Yankees' offseason to-do list remains re-signing Juan Soto. However, he is expected to take his time in making a decision, and the Yanks' roster has multiple areas of need. So while Soto remains the priority, New York has to look for options at other positions. According to MLB Network insiders Jon Heyman and Jon Paul Morosi, they are doing just that. Heyman wrote Wednesday in the New York Post that the Yankees have ""checked in"" on first baseman Pete Alonso and outfielder Anthony Santander, although both are viewed as ""backup plans"" in case Soto signs elsewhere. Although Soto's departure would leave a hole in the Yankees' outfield, Alonso would make sense as a secondary option since New York's first basemen recorded a 76 wRC+ this season, worst in the American League. Per Heyman, the Yankees have also expressed interest in the top starting pitchers in free agency, including Corbin Burnes and Max Fried. Yet Heyman adds that it's ""uncertain"" if the Yankees will be able to afford both Soto and a bona fide ace to slot in next to Gerrit Cole. The prices won't be as high in the reliever market, and the Yankees have been ""among the most aggressive teams"" in searching for bullpen help during this week's General Managers Meetings, per Morosi. The Yankees have Luke Weaver returning for 2025, but they have a handful of impactful free-agent relievers: Clay Holmes, Jonathan Loáisiga, Tommy Kahnle and Tim Hill. Morosi mentions Tanner Scott, Jeff Hoffman and Carlos Estévez as possibilities for the Yanks if they don't re-sign some of those aforementioned arms. ""The New York Yankees fully realizing that even with Luke Weaver at the back end of the bullpen, they need to be active in the relief pitching market,"" Morosi said during Thursday's edition of Hot Stove. Yankees are among the most aggressive teams in speaking with reps for free-agent relievers at the GM Meetings. One reason: Three members of their World Series bullpen -- Clay Holmes, Tommy Kahnle, Tim Hill -- are free agents. @MLBNetwork Nov. 4: Cole staying with Yankees on existing dealGerrit Cole is staying with the Yankees. The Yankees' ace will remain in New York on the same four-year, $144 million deal he originally opted out of. Cole and the Yankees will continue to discuss options for a potential contract extension, according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. But for now, the Yankees have secured their ace through the 2028 season. The Yankees had a deadline of 5 p.m. ET on Monday to decide whether to void Cole's opt-out and prevent him from reaching free agency by adding a one-year extension worth $36 million to his pre-existing deal. Instead, the Yankees and Cole were able to negotiate an agreement that excludes that additional year, but still keeps Cole in New York for the same contract that he would have had if he hadn't opted out, while allowing for the possibility of an extension later. Oct. 31: Soto: 'Every team has the same opportunities' in free agencyJuan Soto has been a free agent for less than 24 hours, but a bunch of teams have already been in contact with him, according to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman. Heyman writes in the New York Post that eight teams checked in with Soto in the hours after he and the Yankees lost to the Dodgers in World Series Game 5 on Wednesday. By Thursday morning, the number of interested clubs was up to 11. The incumbent Yankees are likely to make a strong effort to bring him back, but while Soto said after New York’s season-ending loss that he was happy with the team and the city, he also made it clear he’s not giving the Bronx Bombers an edge over any other potential suitor. “I feel like every team has the same opportunities when I go into free agency,” Soto said. ""I don't want to say anyone has an advantage, because at the end of the day we're gonna look at what they have and how much they want me."" Oct. 31: Re-signing Soto atop Yankees’ offseason prioritiesThe good news for the Yankees is that they finished the 2024 season with the best record in the American League and earned their first trip to the World Series. The bad news is that they were outplayed by the Dodgers in the Fall Classic, which Los Angeles ended with a Game 5 win Wednesday. For the Yankees, any season that doesn’t end with a World Series title is deemed by many as a failure. How their offseason is judged will hinge largely on one action: re-signing Juan Soto. The 26-year-old was phenomenal with the Yankees after being acquired prior to this season in a trade with San Diego. He hit a career-high 41 home runs, led the American League with 128 runs and had a 178 OPS+, his best in a full season. “I’m really happy with the city, with the team, how these guys do,"" Soto said after the Yankees' season-ending loss. ""But at the end of the day, we’re going to look at every situation, every offer that we get, and then take a decision from that.” The Yankees will face fierce competition for Soto’s services, perhaps most of all from the crosstown Mets. Even if Soto returns, the Yankees’ lineup will have a different look in 2025 as infielder Gleyber Torres and outfielder Alex Verdugo are slated to become free agents. Anthony Rizzo, who posted a .637 OPS, carries a $17 million club option for next season. The Bronx Bombers will likely try to add another impact bat to take some of the pressure off of Soto and Aaron Judge, who carried the Yankees’ offense throughout the year. A host of Yanks relievers are set to be free agents, including Clay Holmes, Jonathan Loáisiga, Tommy Kahnle and Tim Hill. Cole could also opt out of his contract, but the Yankees can void that decision by adding a 10th year onto his contract for $36 million."
MLB News,Breaking down the Blake Snell deal from all angles,https://www.mlb.com/news/blake-snell-signing-with-dodgers-analysis,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 15:31:12 GMT",,"MLB.com The defending World Series champions are improving their roster in a big way. The Dodgers and two-time Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell agreed on a five-year, $182 million contract Tuesday, multiple sources told MLB.com. Snell, 31, was a free agent for the second straight offseason after opting out of the final year on his two-year, $62 million deal with the Giants. The left-hander didn’t sign his deal with San Francisco until March 19, but he was clearly determined to resolve his second run at free agency much more quickly, becoming one of the first free agents to reach a deal this time. Lacking time for a proper build-up to the season, Snell struggled early on in 2024, recording a 9.51 ERA over his first six starts and making two trips to the injured list with lower-body ailments. However, Snell was able to recapture his ace form before long, pitching to an incredible 1.23 ERA over his final 14 starts -- including a no-hitter on Aug. 2. It was reminiscent of the way he concluded the 2023 campaign with the Padres, posting a 1.20 ERA over his final 23 starts en route to the National League Cy Young Award. Snell also won the 2018 American League Cy Young Award as a member of the Rays. He owns a 3.19 ERA with an 11.2 K/9 over nine seasons for Tampa Bay, San Diego and San Francisco. Snell by the numbers 2024: 20 GS, 104 IP, 3.12 ERA (124 ERA+), 2.43 FIP, 3.1 fWARCareer: 211 GS, 1096.2 IP, 3.19 ERA (128 ERA+), 3.35 FIP, 24.5 fWAR Here is a breakdown of this move from all angles, via MLB.com experts. What this means for the DodgersVia Dodgers beat writer Juan Toribio The Dodgers’ priority this winter was to add an ace to their starting rotation, and they identified Snell as their top target. The Dodgers previously pursued Snell before he signed with the Giants in March and again prior to the Trade Deadline as San Francisco fell out of postseason contention. They finally got their man on Tuesday. Snell joins a starting rotation that will feature Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Tyler Glasnow and Shohei Ohtani. The Dodgers are looking to add another starter this winter, with Japanese phenom Roki Sasaki among the many targets. It’s a starting rotation that is expected to be much improved from last season. By joining Los Angeles, Snell is reunited with president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman, who was the executive vice president of baseball operations for the Rays when the lefty was drafted in the first round by Tampa Bay in 2011. MORE > What this means for the GiantsVia reporter Thomas Harrigan The loss of Snell -- to the rival Dodgers, no less -- is a big blow to a San Francisco club that lacks star power and is facing a lot of rotation uncertainty behind durable ace Logan Webb. Internally, former Cy Young Award winner Robbie Ray, who returned from Tommy John surgery to record a 4.70 ERA with 43 strikeouts over 30 2/3 innings in 2024, will be counted on to step up in Snell's absence. The Giants could also look to the free-agent market to find a replacement for Snell. Hot Stove implicationsVia senior national reporter Mark Feinsand The Snell signing could have a domino effect on the rest of the starting pitching market. According to sources, the Yankees, Red Sox and Orioles were all in on Snell prior to his decision to sign with the Dodgers, leaving the three AL East clubs to continue their search for pitching. The Red Sox and Yankees are believed to be seeking a left-handed starter, which could ultimately mean a bidding war between the rivals for Max Fried. The Orioles are facing the potential loss of ace Corbin Burnes, who is considered to be the top free-agent starter available. The Giants, who now must replace Snell in their rotation, are believed to have significant interest in Burnes. The O's, meanwhile, could get involved in the Fried sweepstakes or pursue other arms including Jack Flaherty, Nathan Eovaldi or Walker Buehler. There's also the trade market, where White Sox lefty Garrett Crochet can likely be had for the right price.

Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. So far as what Snell offers, it’s no mystery. He’s probably not going to throw as many innings as you want (he’s topped 130 innings just twice in nine seasons), but the innings he does throw are going to be extremely effective. Over the last three years, 216 starters have thrown 2,000 pitches, and Snell ranks first in batting average and second (to Paul Skenes) in slugging, tied-fifth in strikeout rate, and so he’s sixth overall in wOBA, an OPS-like metric. He’s really good, is the point, even if far too many walks and nibbling around the zone drives up the pitch count and prevents those deeper outings. Of course, “starters going deep” isn’t exactly in vogue any longer, so this might not matter to the Dodgers. What Snell offers is excellent fastball velocity (95.9 mph, fourth-hardest among lefty starters) and three outstanding swing-and-miss pitches, as his changeup, slider, and curve all had whiff rates above 40%. There were a handful of pitchers (min. 150 pitches of that type) who had two pitches like that last year, like Griffin Jax’s sweeper and changeup. Snell was the only one with three. So long as you can live with the five-inning starts, the occasional inconsistency, and the near-refusal to just throw strikes -- it’s fair to say he’s more entertaining to look at on the stat sheet than to actually view on the mound -- it’s hard to find a more effective per-pitch starter than Snell. Stat to knowVia MLB.com research staff 24.2%: That was the difference between Snell’s strikeout rate (34.7%) and walk rate (10.5%) last season, the seventh-largest gap in MLB (minimum 100 innings pitched) and an improvement of six percentage points from the 18.2% mark he posted during his 2023 Cy Young season. Snell was still a bit wild in 2024 (3.8 BB/9), but he shaved 2.8 points off his walk rate from the previous year while adding 3.2 points to his strikeout rate."
MLB News,Rays volunteers helping Tampa area rediscover sense of normalcy,https://www.mlb.com/news/rays-assist-in-community-events-for-hurricane-relief,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 02:36:00 GMT",,"Adam Berry This story was excerpted from Adam Berry’s Rays Beat newsletter.

TAMPA, Fla. -- It wasn’t long after Hurricane Milton ripped through Florida’s Gulf Coast, tearing most of the roof off Tropicana Field and devastating communities still reeling from the impact of Hurricane Helene, that Rays staff members started to mobilize. Many were dealing with the effects the back-to-back storms had on their own lives and families. The homes lost, possessions ruined, neighborhoods littered with remnants of trees and fences and piles of debris. They were working remotely, unable to get back inside their damaged offices at the Trop, but nonetheless wanted to come together. “Our staff is people-first. We’re such a community-minded organization, and we’re a resilient bunch,” said Kim Couts, the Rays’ director of community engagement. “So many of our staff members had reached out to say, ‘How can we help? What can we do?’ Which was just a testament to the great people that work in this organization.” Over the past two months, between the consecutive hurricanes and the approaching Thanksgiving holiday, the Rays have filled 145-150 volunteer spots to serve 400 hours in response to Helene and Milton. Responding to their partners in the community and others in need, the Rays Baseball Foundation and team employees have taken part in numerous events and other volunteer opportunities to help where they can. “We had people that wanted to help and were able to work with our partners and find those projects and find out where the greatest needs were,” Couts said. Among the Rays’ hurricane relief efforts: • They packed and/or distributed 50,000 meals in partnership with Feeding Tampa Bay. Pitching in for our community. ⚾️🩵Rays staff and players came together today in front of @TropicanaField to help @FeedingTampaBay and @SPCATampaBay distribute meals and pet food to families impacted by Hurricane Helene and Milton. pic.twitter.com/WJcgEpmVj9 • They completed more than 1,800 loads of laundry for more than 500 people through the Laundry Project, which assists lower-income families with washing their clothes and linens. Our team gave laundry a spin, helping @CurrentLP provide free services to St. Pete residents! pic.twitter.com/wFDUkuNe0S • Team volunteers spent hours cleaning up debris at Girls Inc. Pinellas, in partnership with the United Way Suncoast, to make sure the 50 girls in that program had a safe outdoor space. • Rays staff volunteered with Tampa Bay Watch for an erosion prevention project, creating oyster reef balls that will eventually help filter 1.5 million gallons of water per day. Baseballs 🤝 Reef BallsToday, the team helped Tampa Bay Watch build more of these marine-friendly structures to combat erosion along Tampa Bay's shorelines and replace those that were damaged in the storms. pic.twitter.com/bCP32fYEIv • They recently teamed up with Team Rubicon, a veteran-led humanitarian organization, to clean up debris and brush at two homes in St. Petersburg. Along with the volunteer event, the Rays Baseball Foundation donated $25,000 to Team Rubicon. • In addition to their volunteer hours, the Rays Baseball Foundation committed $1 million to hurricane relief efforts in the wake of the storms, and that money has been distributed to many non-profit organizations serving the area. The Rays have also directed fans’ donations to the Rays Baseball Foundation toward hurricane relief. • All proceeds from the upcoming Running with the Rays 5K, set for Jan. 12, will benefit hurricane relief efforts in the Tampa Bay area. • Additionally, the Rays announced that all proceeds from purchases of the Tampa Bay Strong merchandise will benefit hurricane relief through the Rays Baseball Foundation. This work will continue for the Rays, as their employees continue to get back on their feet in a new office space near Tropicana Field and work to regain some sense of normalcy in their lives following two devastating storms. The Rays’ annual “Week of Giving” is set to return the week of Dec. 9, when they will partner with a number of local non-profit organizations, including some work related to hurricane relief.

Rays closer Pete Fairbanks was one of four players who took part in a food distribution event with Feeding Tampa Bay, loading cars and trucks with food, supplies and even pet food in Lot 9 outside Tropicana Field last month. For all the baseball-related questions the sight of the Trop might have inspired, and all the uncertainty the storms have created regarding the Rays' future, he understood there was more at play. “We all know people that were impacted by it, but also, there were a ton of people that we don't know that were impacted by it,” Fairbanks said. “To be able to help those that were affected, even though we were, from a baseball standpoint, kind of up the creek without a paddle while that's going on, I think, speaks to the people involved and their desire to bring everybody up and not just kind of get bogged down in, 'Oh, crap, we don't have a stadium. Things have been uprooted.’ Let's take that and try to do something positive and work through it together.”"
MLB News,"With Snell joining LA, is Flaherty still in Dodgers' plans?",https://www.mlb.com/news/jack-flaherty-rumors,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 18:18:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of the latest news and rumors surrounding Jack Flaherty. Nov. 27: With Snell in LA, is Flaherty still in Dodgers' plans?Flaherty was born and raised in Southern California. He grew up a Dodgers fan. He said during the team's 2024 World Series championship parade that he never wants to leave Los Angeles. But after the Dodgers agreed to a five-year deal with Blake Snell on Tuesday night, per source, is re-signing Flaherty no longer an option for the reigning champs? MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi said Wednesday that the Snell move ""probably"" means Flaherty ""won't be back"" with the club in 2025. As for where Flaherty could end up, MLB.com's Mark Feinsand wrote that he could be an option for the Orioles. The Yankees were interested in acquiring Flaherty at the 2024 Trade Deadline but couldn't agree to a deal with the Tigers before Detroit struck a deal with the Dodgers. The Bronx Bombers were recently mentioned by Morosi as a possible landing spot for Flaherty, along with the Padres, Dodgers and Angels. However, that report came before the Dodgers' addition of Snell and before the Angels came to terms with Yusei Kikuchi, per source. Nov. 12: Two teams that make sense for FlahertyThe Nationals and Yankees are among the teams that are fits for Flaherty in free agency, ESPN's Jeff Passan reports in his 2024-25 offseason preview (subscription required). Passan writes that Washington makes sense if the club decides to prioritize an anchor for its starting rotation, while the Yankees, who almost traded for Flaherty during the 2024 season, ""could be in again"" now. Passan believes Flaherty has a chance to get a $100-plus million deal in free agency, grouping him in a tier with Max Fried, but below Corbin Burnes and Roki Sasaki. Nov. 1: Flaherty: 'I never want to leave' Los AngelesThe 2024 World Series was a dream come true for Flaherty, who won a championship with the team he rooted for while growing up near Los Angeles. Now a free agent, Flaherty will be able to choose where he wants to continue his career. Maybe it will continue with him staying close to home. ""I love this city. I never want to leave,"" Flaherty said during the Dodgers' championship parade on Friday. A dream come true 🌟Jack Flaherty enjoys a #WorldSeries parade with his hometown team! pic.twitter.com/cZ5bf5ODSW Acquired at the Trade Deadline after posting a 2.95 ERA over 106 2/3 innings with the Tigers, Flaherty pitched to a 3.58 ERA with 61 strikeouts in 55 2/3 frames during the regular season for the Dodgers. His postseason was a roller coaster -- two stellar starts mixed in with three others in which he allowed at least four earned runs -- but the 29-year-old will be one of the most sought-after starters on the open market this winter. The Dodgers are seen as a good fit for Flaherty. We'll see if he remains with his hometown team. Oct. 31: Flaherty’s turnaround could land him big payday in free agencyFlaherty reached free agency for the first time in his career last offseason on the heels of a lackluster walk year that saw him post a 4.99 ERA with a 1.58 WHIP over 144 1/3 innings between the Cardinals and Orioles. He ultimately settled for a one-year, $14 million deal with the Tigers. One year later, things couldn’t be more different. Flaherty put together an outstanding rebound campaign in 2024, finishing the regular season with a 3.17 ERA and a 5.11 K/BB ratio (194 strikeouts, 38 walks) over 162 innings for the Tigers and Dodgers, who acquired him at the Trade Deadline. Flaherty went on to earn a World Series ring with Los Angeles, and though he had some hiccups in the playoffs en route to a 7.36 ERA over five starts, he could be poised to cash in on the open market this offseason. The 29-year-old righty is one of the top arms in this year's free-agent class, with MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand ranking him ninth overall -- fourth among starting pitchers -- on his list of the top free agents."
MLB News,Skenes sits down: Flamethrower talks rookie stardom in Q&A,https://www.mlb.com/news/paul-skenes-q-a-on-being-rookie-of-the-year-cy-young-finalist,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 15:01:16 GMT",,"Jim Lachimia The Pirates selected pitcher Paul Skenes with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 MLB Draft, and he took Major League Baseball by storm in 2024. The former LSU star made his MLB debut on May 11 against the Cubs at PNC Park and wound up going 11-3 with a 1.96 ERA in 23 starts. He was the starting pitcher for the National League at the All-Star Game at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas. After his stellar first season, Skenes was voted NL Rookie of the Year and was one of three finalists for the NL Cy Young Award. In the following Q&A, he shares his thoughts about his first season in the big leagues and the notoriety that he receives while looking ahead to the 2025 season. Having had time to reflect on the honor, what does it mean to you to be voted National League Rookie of the Year? Skenes: It’s cool to have that experience and the hardware that comes with it. Masyn Winn of the Cardinals was one of the best defensive shortstops in the league and he’s a tough out -- and he wasn’t even a finalist. That’s how good the rookie class was. The game is so young, and I’m very new to it. I’m part of that young group, and I need to continue to work toward getting an edge. What about being a finalist for the National League Cy Young Award along with Chris Sale of the Braves and Zack Wheeler of the Phillies, who both have much more Major League experience than you? Skenes: Truthfully, I think being a finalist for the Cy Young Award is a little more meaningful than Rookie of the Year -- because it’s all the pitchers in the league. It’s a tremendous honor to be up there with Sale and Wheeler. Obviously, they compete at a very high level and get a ton of strikeouts. But I think the biggest thing is their consistency every single outing. That’s something I strive for, and something they’re very good at. How are you able to stay level-headed with all the things you’ve accomplished and all the honors you’ve received? It often seems like you’re the person least impressed by all of that. Skenes: That’s how I’ve always been. Everything stems from the game and circles back to playing the game. That’s the only thing that matters. Because if you don’t execute and you don’t compete, then all that other stuff goes away. I appreciate them, but the awards are not why I play the game. How has your offseason been so far? Are you doing a good job of relaxing and doing things you’re unable to do during the baseball season, but also preparing for 2025? Skenes: I took three weeks off at the beginning of the offseason. Took a mini vacation to Florida for a few days. It’s just tough because my girlfriend [LSU gymnast Livvy Dunne] is in school and I’m trying to spend as much time with her as possible. A two-week trip to Italy or something like that? That’s not happening this offseason. People say, ‘Hey, do you want to do something?’ And I’m like, ‘We can do something, but we’ve got about 12 hours because I need to get back and lift in the morning.’ The biggest thing is getting my training in. As a champion gymnast and someone with a massive following on social media, your girlfriend Livvy Dunne is certainly a star in her own arena. Do the two of you help each other navigate all the attention you receive? Skenes: Yeah, I think so. She got to that point in her life a little bit earlier than I did. So, with the Draft and all of that, she was able to help me with those experiences. And I think I’m able to help her. We’re definitely able to share some of those experiences and help each other out. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. The Pirates were in the race for a playoff berth last season until experiencing a rough month of August. Do you and your teammates believe you can collectively achieve better results in 2025 and make a serious run at postseason play? Skenes: Yeah, the last couple months of the season -- especially that stretch in August -- left a bad taste in a lot of people’s mouths. We were in it up until then and then had a bunch of things not go our way. My hope is, we got that out of our system and we’re going to have more self-awareness in terms of how we’re going to be able to win moving forward. I know the talent here is going to get better. We just need to have an identity and some good camaraderie. From there, I’m not going to say nobody is going to stop us, but I like our chances because there are simple and straightforward ways for us to win a lot more games without any huge, sweeping changes. I know I can’t wait for Spring Training to start. Can you talk about how you’ve been embraced by the Pirates since they selected you No. 1 overall in the 2023 Draft? Skenes: Obviously, being drafted No. 1 overall was a huge honor, and since then I’ve had a fair amount of visibility and conversations with [chairman] Bob Nutting, [general manager] Ben Cherington and other team officials. And they listen. I was the No. 1 pick, who cares? Whatever. I was still a rookie last year, but they were listening. And they’re listening to guys like Mitch Keller, Bryan Reynolds and Ke’Bryan Hayes too. They’re receptive. They listen to what we think we need to do to win. Mr. Nutting is very approachable. He’s willing to listen because he wants to win, which is good because that’s not the picture that a lot of people paint of him. The only difference is we’re going to win in a little bit different way than the Dodgers and the Yankees. But we’re going to win. How do Pirates fans react whether they see you at the ballpark, at scheduled appearances or even at the grocery store or gas station? Skenes: It’s super humbling the way I’ve been accepted and embraced by Pirates fans, and I like to think of it as by the city of Pittsburgh as well. It’s really cool to see them show up at the ballpark and root for us. It’s one of the reasons why we play the game -- to see the fans in the stands. It’s just an awesome experience."
MLB News,Aggressive Angels sign Kikuchi to 3-year deal,https://www.mlb.com/news/yusei-kikuchi-deal-with-angels,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 02:42:00 GMT",,"Rhett Bollinger ANAHEIM -- The Angels have been the most aggressive club in free agency this offseason, and they kept it up on Monday with their first big splash, agreeing to a three-year, $63 million deal with left-hander Yusei Kikuchi. The deal, formally announced on Wednesday, is the Angels’ largest since Perry Minasian became general manager in 2020. Kikuchi is a solid upgrade to the rotation after the Angels also signed right-hander Kyle Hendricks to a one-year deal worth $2.5 million. Kikuchi immediately becomes an ace for the club and can help the Angels compete after their 99-loss campaign in 2024. The 33-year-old Kikuchi is coming off an intriguing season in which he put together one of the finest stretches of his Major League career following a midseason trade to the Astros. “He obviously had a strong finish with Houston after the trade, but we really like what we saw before that, too,” general manager Perry Minasian said. “When you look at his underlying numbers -- the strikeouts, the walks -- that was a quality year overall. And for our rotation, we wanted guys who attack the strike zone. And durability is very, very important. And we wanted some swing and miss. So he fits all those things -- and his makeup, obviously.” Kikuchi, who began his professional career with eight seasons in Nippon Professional Baseball, spent his first three Major League seasons with the Mariners before signing a three-year, $36 million contract with the Blue Jays ahead of the 2022 season. Between Seattle and Toronto, he pitched to a 4.72 ERA with a 1.38 WHIP. As with many previous Astros acquisitions, Kikuchi improved dramatically after his July 29 trade, making 10 starts down the stretch and posting a 2.70 ERA with a 0.93 WHIP and 76 strikeouts in 60 innings. Among the changes the Astros made to the veteran’s repertoire was a stronger reliance on his slider. By September, he was throwing 38.9% sliders compared to just 36.6% four-seam fastballs, increasing the effectiveness of both pitches. His fastball also averaged a career-best 95.5 mph. “There were some pitch-mix things, and his use of the slider, obviously, was increased in Houston,” Minasian said. “His effectiveness with his fastball, especially up in the zone and his ability to get ahead of hitters, was top five in baseball in the second half of the season. The combination of pitchability, stuff, left-handed power arm, swing and miss is really attractive and something we needed.” Kikuchi joins a rotation that includes lefty Tyler Anderson and right-handers José Soriano, Jack Kochanowicz and Hendricks. Other options include internal candidates Reid Detmers, Chase Silseth, Caden Dana and Sam Aldegheri. It has been a busy offseason for the Angels, who also traded for slugger Jorge Soler and signed free agent catcher Travis d’Arnaud, utilityman Kevin Newman and Hendricks to bolster their depth. They also traded for infielder Scott Kingery and claimed infielder/outfielder Ryan Noda on waivers. Kikuchi’s signing is the largest for the club since it signed reliever Raisel Iglesias to a four-year, $58 million deal before the 2022 season. But Minasian said the Angels are not done and could even add to the rotation. “We'd love to add more, so we're not close-minded,” Minasian said. “We're going to keep following the trade market, following the free agent market and see where it goes. But the rotation is still a spot that if we feel like there's an improvement out there, we'll look to do it. There's plenty of areas to improve, and we'd also love the lengthen the lineup.” Kikuchi is the club’s first Japanese player since the departure of Shohei Ohtani to the Dodgers last offseason. The Angels still retain a large Japanese fan base because of Ohtani’s six years with the club. Kikuchi attended the same high school as Ohtani, Hanamaki Higashi in Iwate, but is three years older. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. “There’s great talent in Japan,” Minasian said. “I've seen that league over the last 15-20 years, and it’s not a surprise the success they’ve been having over here.”"
MLB News,How Snell-to-Dodgers deal impacts starting pitching market,https://www.mlb.com/news/blake-snell-dodgers-deal-impact-free-agent-pitching,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 06:40:50 GMT",,"Mark Feinsand Blake Snell wasn’t wasting any time this offseason. One year ago, Snell’s free agency dragged deep into the winter before he signed a two-year, $62 million deal with the Giants on March 19. A few weeks ago, the two-time Cy Young Award winner opted out of the second year of that contract to test free agency again, a decision that paid off handsomely late Tuesday night. MLB offseason signings and trades• Latest free-agent and trade rumors• Top 25 free agents | Every free agent, by position• Tracking every team's offseason moves• FA guides: Soto | Burnes | Alonso | Bregman | Fried | Santander• Offseason dates, rules & terms explained Snell agreed to a five-year, $182 million deal with the Dodgers, jumping to the World Series champions with the first nine-figure deal of the offseason. Forget having a deal done prior to Christmas; Snell will now be able to sit back and relax at Thanksgiving, knowing his future is settled through the end of 2029. “The rich get richer,” a National League executive said. “He’s a stud when he’s on the field. His only issue is whether he can stay healthy – and five years is a long time. But in the Dodgers’ situation, there’s very little risk there.” Los Angeles’ rotation now includes Snell, Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Tyler Glasnow, while reigning NL Most Valuable Player Shohei Ohtani will likely join that group at some point early next season once he’s cleared to pitch. Clayton Kershaw is also widely expected to return for another season, giving the champs a solid rotation in addition to great depth (Dustin May, Bobby Miller, Tony Gonsolin, Landon Knack). The Dodgers are also expected to be among the favorites to land Roki Sasaki once he is officially posted by the Chiba Lotte Marines next month. The impact of the Snell signing on the Dodgers is obvious. But what does it mean for the rest of the free-agent pitching market? According to sources, the Yankees, Red Sox and Orioles were all in on Snell prior to his decision to sign with the Dodgers, leaving the three American League East clubs to continue their search for pitching. The Red Sox and Yankees are believed to be seeking a left-handed starter, which could ultimately mean a bidding war between the rivals for Max Fried. If one of those clubs signs Fried, the other could potentially pivot to the trade market, where White Sox lefty Garrett Crochet can likely be had for the right price. If both teams miss out on Fried, the White Sox could be in the driver’s seat, as Crochet is considered to be a notch above the rest of the left-handed starters on the free-agent market (Sean Manaea, Matthew Boyd, Andrew Heaney, Jose Quintana). “Totally different tier,” an NL executive said of Fried and Crochet. “Whoever misses out on Fried may have no choice if they’re hell-bent on adding an impact left-handed starter.” The Orioles are facing the potential loss of ace Corbin Burnes, who is considered to be the top free-agent starter available. Given Snell’s contract – which will ultimately be worth between $160-165 million in present-day value taking the deferrals into account – there’s no reason to think that Burnes’ deal won’t be worth more than $200 million. Burnes turned 30 last month, while Snell will be 32 next week. The Giants, who now must replace Snell in their rotation, are believed to have significant interest in Burnes. “Burnes definitely gets more years,” an NL exec said. “Not sure if the AAV is all that different, but the extra years should make it a much bigger number.” Regardless of Baltimore’s righty/lefty preference, the Orioles could get involved in the Fried sweepstakes or pursue other arms including Jack Flaherty, Nathan Eovaldi or Walker Buehler. Baltimore could also try to pry Crochet away from the White Sox, and given the depth of the Orioles’ Minor League system, they could be considered the favorites to land Crochet if they decide that’s the direction they want to take. “That’s the team to watch on him, for sure,” an NL executive said of the Orioles. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the Snell deal was the timing. Last year’s slog to his mid-March signing likely had an impact on Snell’s desire to get a deal done quickly, but we have already seen multiple free-agent deals get done. The Angels have been busy, signing Yusei Kikuchi (three years, $63 million), Travis d’Arnaud (two years, $12 million), Kevin Newman (one year, $2.8 million) and Kyle Hendricks (one year, $2.5 million), while the Royals inked Michael Wacha to a new deal (three years, $51 million) before they even had to make a qualifying offer. More than a half-dozen other players have already signed big-league free-agent deals, though Snell’s was the first nine-figure contract of the offseason. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Last winter, Aaron Nola re-signed with the Phillies for $172 million on Nov. 19, while the other three nine-figure free-agent deals of the offseason – Ohtani, Yamamoto and Jung Hoo Lee – all took place in December. But a number of free agents were forced to wait until the new year, most notably Snell, Matt Chapman, Cody Bellinger and Jordan Montgomery, all of whom signed in late-February or March. Could this offseason be different? Will the Hot Stove return to a low simmer following the Snell deal, or could we be in for an action-packed two weeks leading up to the Winter Meetings, which begin in Dallas on Dec. 9? “Everything is waiting on [Juan] Soto, I would imagine,” an NL executive said. “Snell might be the outlier because I can imagine he told [agent Scott Boras] that they needed to get it done quickly this time around.” The Yankees, Mets, Red Sox, Blue Jays and Dodgers have all met with Soto and are believed to have made initial offers, setting up expectations that he will make his decision sometime around the Winter Meetings. Once that domino falls, we could begin to see a number of top free agents start to sign, as those clubs that miss out on Soto will be forced to turn elsewhere to upgrade their respective rosters."
MLB News,One 2025 Rookie of the Year candidate for each team,https://www.mlb.com/news/2025-mlb-rookie-of-the-year-candidates-for-each-team,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 00:30:00 GMT",,"Sam Dykstra Jim Callis Jonathan Mayo A year ago, we provided one Rookie of the Year candidate for every team. How’d we do? We nailed the NL top rookie (Paul Skenes) and also picked out two others who received votes (Jackson Chourio and Mason Miller). That’s a good enough success rate to try the whole exercise again. We discussed who we thought were the overall favorites on a recent episode of the MLB Pipeline Podcast and you can read about it here. Below is a prospect for each team we think has the chance to bring in next year’s ROY hardware, all with the caveat that Roki Sasaki will jump to the top of any list once he signs with a Major League team. More from MLB Pipeline:• Top 100 prospects | Stats | Video | Podcast | Complete coverage Jump to: AL Central | AL West | NL East | NL Central | NL West Blue Jays: Will Wagner, 2B/1B/3B (No. 18)Acquired from the Astros in the Yusei Kikuchi deal at the Trade Deadline, Wagner had no trouble carrying his reputation as an above-average hitter to the Blue Jays system and was called up to the Majors after only seven Triple-A games. He went 25-for-82 (.305) in 24 games in The Show before being shut down with a left knee injury, and as things stand, he’s likely slotted in as Toronto’s Opening Day second baseman. The left-handed slugger rarely misses on swings in the zone, and he showed a little more pop than expected in his MLB debut. Orioles: Coby Mayo, 3B/1B (No. 1/MLB No. 8)He got his feet wet in Baltimore last year and undoubtedly learned from his 41 at-bat debut. There’s no question the power is ready for the big leagues after slugging .592 in the Minors last year and .564 in 2023. The O’s are going to have to find a spot for him in the lineup every day, with the chance for him to be a ROY frontrunner. Rays: Carson Williams, SS (No. 1/MLB No. 4)Starter-turned-dominant-reliever Mason Montgomery might be a dark horse candidate here, but Williams has a higher ceiling … if he can get to the Majors for long enough. The 21-year-old shortstop is a stellar defender with a rocket of an arm capable of being an MLB asset right now, and his power-speed combo (20 HR, 33 SB in ‘24) makes him such an intriguing prospect. His strikeout rates have trended downward but remain high, and he played all of last season with Double-A Montgomery. Right now, Taylor Walls and José Caballero are Tampa Bay’s main shortstop options, so it’s possible it won’t take much for Williams to squeeze past them and get enough MLB at-bats for ROY consideration. Red Sox: Roman Anthony, OF (No. 1/MLB No. 3)The Red Sox have four prospects ranked among baseball's 25 best, all of whom are nearly ready for prime time, and Anthony stands out the most. Signed for first-round money ($2.5 million) as a supplemental second-rounder out of a Florida high school in 2022, he has blossomed into an offensive force who profiles as a star on an outfield corner. He slashed .291/.396/.498 with 18 homers and 21 steals in 119 games at age 20, leading the Double-A Eastern League in slugging (.489) and OPS (.856) before posting even bigger numbers in Triple-A. Yankees: Jasson Domínguez, OF (No. 1/MLB No. 14)Domínguez might have pushed for Rookie of the Year honors in 2024 if he hadn't blown out his elbow the previous September and required Tommy John surgery. Famously signed for $5.1 million out of the Dominican Republic in 2019 as the most hyped international prospect ever, he's a potential center fielder with 20-20 upside. He batted .314/.376/.504 with 11 homers and 16 steals in 58 Minor League games between three levels (mostly in Triple-A) last year. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball.  Guardians: Chase DeLauter, OF (No. 2/MLB No. 41)Foot and leg injuries have slowed DeLauter's progress since he became the first first-round pick from James Madison (16th overall in 2022), but he'll be a franchise cornerstone if he can stay healthy. Few prospects can match his package of size (6-foot-3, 235 pounds), athleticism, performance and plate discipline. He slashed .261/.341/.500 with eight homers in 39 games between three levels (mostly in Double-A), then ranked as the No. 2 prospect in the Arizona Fall League for the second straight year. Royals: Noah Cameron, LHP (No. 12)Cameron made his Triple-A debut on July 31 and was at his best at the Minors’ top level, finishing with a 2.32 ERA, 62 strikeouts and only 11 walks in 54 1/3 innings for Omaha. His 78-81 mph changeup was particularly devastating, with a 46.7 percent whiff rate, but a full four-pitch repertoire (including a four-seamer, cutter and curveball) kept Triple-A hitters guessing. Cameron was an easy 40-man add when he became Rule 5-eligible this offseason, and he should head into Spring Training aiming to win a rotation spot. Tigers: Jackson Jobe, RHP (No. 1/MLB No. 5)Jobe is the top pitching prospect on our current Top 100 for a reason. He has four pitches that could all be classified as at least plus in his four-seamer, slider, cutter and changeup, and he put them all on display with four MLB appearances between the regular season and postseason in 2024. The 22-year-old right-hander is certainly a starter and he’d have to go well above his career high of 95 2/3 innings to be a true Rookie of the Year candidate. But the Tigers clearly trust him and his stuff already, and even if he takes a brief look at Triple-A first, Jobe is too talented to keep out of the MLB rotation for long, if healthy. Twins: Luke Keaschall, 2B/OF/1B (No. 3/MLB No. 63)The only thing making this pick “risky” is that Keaschall, the Twins’ second-round pick in 2023, had Tommy John surgery in August. But that was timed so he’d be ready to swing the bat in the spring. It’s pretty clear his advanced approach at the plate will help him get to the big leagues quickly after getting to Double-A in his first full season and finishing with a .903 OPS. He’s shown he can handle three positions, giving the Twins more options to get him in the lineup. White Sox: Colson Montgomery, SS (No. 3/MLB No. 37)Though Montgomery had a rough .214/.329/.381 season in Triple-A with 18 homers in 130 games, he finished strong before raking in the AFL. The 2021 first-rounder from an Indiana high school not only has the power potential expected from a 6-foot-3, 225-pounder, but also patience at the plate and surprising athleticism.  Angels: Caden Dana, RHP (No. 1/MLB No. 68)Dana’s big league debut was solid, and though his following two outings didn’t go as planned in September, that should just give him information he’ll use to make adjustments. The 2024 Futures Gamer will pitch all of 2025 at age 21, so there’s plenty of time here and he has advanced feel for a four-pitch mix that should allow him to find consistent success. Astros: Jacob Melton, OF (No. 1/MLB No. 89)When the Astros were negotiating the Justin Verlander trade with the Mets in 2023, they preferred to give up Top 100 prospects Drew Gilbert and Ryan Clifford so they could hold on to Melton. A 2022 second-round selection from Oregon State, he combines plus raw power and speed and slashed .253/.310/.426 with 15 homers and 30 steals in 105 games between Double-A and Triple-A. A’s: Jacob Wilson, SS (No. 1/MLB No. 24)If it hadn’t been for injuries, Wilson would have graduated off of prospect lists this past season and wouldn’t be under consideration. Assuming health, it’s easy to expect Wilson to keep doing what he’s done everywhere: hit. While he played just 53 games in the Minors this past season, he hit .433 with a 1.141 OPS, even showing more extra-base pop than some expected. Seeing him hit over .300 and play a solid shortstop in the big leagues should help his candidacy. Mariners: Tyler Locklear, 1B (No. 6)With a career OPS of .874 in the Minors and a couple of big league homers under his belt, there are some expectations that Locklear, the Mariners' second-rounder in 2022, should be able to bring some right-handed thump to the lineup in '25. The strikeout rate crept up in 2024, especially in his brief debut with Seattle, but he does draw walks to help offset that. Rangers: Kumar Rocker, RHP (No. 2/MLB No. 58)After the Mets drafted him 10th overall in 2021, Rocker endured a failed physical, shoulder surgery and then Tommy John surgery. But the former Vanderbilt star looks ready to repay the Rangers for their gamble to surprisingly select him with the No. 3 overall pick in 2022. He showed an upper-90s fastball and wipeout mid-80s slider this summer while compiling a 1.96 ERA, a .180 batting average against and a 55/5 K/BB ratio in 36 2/3 Minor League innings between three levels (mostly in Double-A) before making his big league debut in September.  Braves: Drake Baldwin, C (No. 5)Brought up as a sleeper pick for National League hardware in a recent Pipeline Inbox, Baldwin may not be under-the-radar anymore. He’s a solid receiver who reached Triple-A and hit 16 homers with a .370 OBP in the Minors, then had a .942 OPS over 13 AFL games before playing for Team USA in the Premier12 tournament in Mexico and Japan. Sean Murphy is in the big leagues, but after he hit .193 last year, the door could be opening. Marlins: Agustin Ramirez, C/1B (No. 3/MLB No. 96)Acquired from the Yankees in the Jazz Chisholm Jr. trade in July, Ramirez enjoyed a 20-20 season in the Minors -- a feat accomplished only twice by big league catchers in AL/NL history. Ramirez batted .267/.358/.487 with 25 homers and 22 steals in 126 games between Double-A and Triple-A and offers solid power and arm strength, though his defensive game still requires a lot of polish. Mets: Brandon Sproat, RHP (No. 1/MLB No. 40)The 2023 second-rounder’s first full season couldn’t have gone much better after he posted a 3.40 ERA with 131 strikeouts in 116 1/3 innings across three levels. Sproat finished out the year in Triple-A Syracuse, meaning he should enter his second spring with an eye on the Majors, and the Mets have rotation openings aplenty with Luis Severino, Sean Manaea and Jose Quintana hitting free agency. Even if New York makes additions (which it should), Sproat’s fastball, slider, changeup and cutter could all play in the bigs quickly and help him elbow his way into an early starting spot and enough success for ROY consideration. Nationals: Dylan Crews, OF (No. 1/MLB No. 1)Depending on where Sasaki lands, Crews should be the NL frontrunner. He’s shown steady improvement in approach and output at LSU and every Minor League stop he’s made, giving many confidence he’ll build on the modest success he showed in 31 games with the Nats in '24. His speed and defense are already Major League assets, and he’ll have many avenues to provide big league value in his age-23 season. The open question: whether he starts in center or right on Opening Day. Either way, expect him to be in the ROY mix. Phillies: Andrew Painter, RHP (No. 2/MLB No. 32)All eyes were on Painter as he made his return to the competitive mound this fall in the AFL after a two-year layoff due to Tommy John surgery. He certainly didn’t disappoint, earning AFL Pitcher of the Year honors after finishing with a 2.30 ERA, .189 batting average against, 0.89 WHIP and an 18/4 K/BB ratio (10.34 K/9, 2.3 BB/9) over 15 2/3 innings. The Phillies' brass have said they believe he will contribute at some point in 2025 and there’s no reason to think he won’t succeed.  Brewers: Jacob Misiorowski, RHP (No. 3/MLB No. 80)If Milwaukee decides to keep Misiorowski in a relief role (as it did with him at Triple-A), he could be this year’s Mason Miller or Cade Smith. The 6-foot-7 right-hander averaged 98 mph with his four-seamer with Nashville and touched as high as 100.7 mph. His low-90s slider and mid-80s curveball were also difficult to touch, but as always, control could be an issue (10 walks in 17 2/3 innings). The Crew continues to view Misiorowski as a starter but acknowledges he could be a dominant closer if shifted full-time. Cardinals: Thomas Saggese, INF (No. 4)Toss aside Saggese’s .204/.250/.306 line from last season’s 18-game MLB sample for a moment. More recently, the 22-year-old reined in his previously overaggressive approach in the Arizona Fall League, allowing his impressive bat-to-ball skills to result in better overall contact in the desert. If that holds, Saggese could be a candidate to flirt with a .300 average and produce 20-plus homers over a full Major League season at the keystone, aka prime Rookie of the Year numbers. Cubs: Matt Shaw, INF (No. 1/MLB No. 22)Shaw had a spectacular first full pro season after the Cubs drafted him 13th overall out of Maryland in 2023. He slashed .284/.379/.488 with 21 homers and 31 steals in 121 games, becoming one of four 20-30 players in the Minors, winning Double-A Southern League MVP accolades, increasing his production after a promotion to Triple-A and starring with Team USA at the Premier12 tournament in November. An advanced hitter with solid power and speed, he's capable of starting at second or third base. Pirates: Bubba Chandler, RHP (No. 1/MLB No. 15)Chandler not only reached Triple-A in 2024, he dominated, with a 1.83 ERA and 12.4 K/9 over seven starts, showing off elite-level stuff with plenty left in the tank. Even if he starts back at Indianapolis in 2025, it’s not difficult to envision a Skenes-like path for the 22-year-old right-hander, and we all know how that turned out this year. Reds: Rhett Lowder, RHP (No. 2/MLB No. 33)Lowder whetted the appetite of Reds fans with a 1.17 ERA over six starts, and he did that walking more and striking out fewer than usual. Cincinnati's recent acquisition of Brady Singer does make the rotation a little more crowded, but Lowder’s combination of stuff and command should allow him to cement a spot.  D-backs: Jordan Lawlar, SS (No. 1/MLB No. 9)The 2021 sixth overall pick likely would have graduated in '24 if he hadn’t been limited by right thumb and left hamstring injuries. He’s currently making up for the lost time with Tigres del Licey in LIDOM, where he’s getting consistent looks at shortstop (and a few extra at third base). Lawlar’s loudest tool is his plus-plus speed, and he shows above-average pop as well. He’d likely be a better hitter than Geraldo Perdomo if given the right amount of at-bats at short or he could be an option at third if Eugenio Suárez gets hurt or declines at age 33. Dodgers: Dalton Rushing, C/OF (No. 1/MLB No. 39)One of the best catching prospects in the Minors, Rushing started getting some time in the outfield late in the summer so the Dodgers could find a way to get him more at-bats behind Will Smith in 2025. He slashed .271/.384/.512 between Double-A and Triple-A, tied for second among Minor League catchers with 26 homers in 114 games and was named Dodgers organizational player of the year and the Double-A Texas League's top prospect. He features well-above-average raw power, a patient approach, solid arm strength and improving receiving skills. Giants: Carson Whisenhunt, LHP (No. 3)A 2022 second-round choice out of East Carolina, Whisenhunt owns one of the Minors' best changeups and sets it up with a low-90s fastball, upper-70s curveball and mid-80s cutter. He logged a 5.42 ERA with 135 strikeouts in 104 2/3 innings in Triple-A. Padres: Tirso Ornelas, OF (No. 17)Jackson Merrill 2.0 isn’t walking through that door. Ethan Salas (No. 1/MLB No. 19) and Leodalis De Vries (No. 2/MLB No. 28) are just too far away for a magical rookie repeat in San Diego. That said, Jurickson Profar and David Peralta are both free agents, meaning for now, the Padres have openings on the grass. Ornelas could at least be a fourth outfielder to begin the year -- one with decent pop from the left side and an ability to make above-average contact on pitches in the zone -- with the chance to win more playing time depending on what other moves are coming. Rockies: Drew Romo, C (No. 8)Romo had a really solid year in Triple-A (.297/.339/.499 with 14 homers and solid catch-and-throw skills) to earn his first callup to the big leagues. He’s a better backstop than Hunter Goodman, who can focus on other positions, so Romo should at least share time with Jacob Stallings behind the plate in Denver."
MLB News,"Hyeseong Kim, standout KBO second baseman, expects to be posted soon",https://www.mlb.com/news/hyeseong-kim-posting-for-american-teams,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 20:27:05 GMT",,"Brian Murphy Hyeseong Kim, one of the top hitters in the KBO, told reporters on Tuesday that he expects to be posted by his team soon, opening the door for the 25-year-old second baseman to become an MLB free agent. Kim told Jeeho Yoo of South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency that the posting process will begin after Thanksgiving and to expect a formal announcement next week. Kim said he will travel to the United States once he is posted. Kim has batted .304 and logged a .364 on-base percentage over eight seasons with the Kiwoom Heroes. Kim has also stolen at least 20 bases in each of the past seven seasons, reaching as high as 46 in 2021. A left-handed hitter, Kim slashed .326/.383/.458 with 11 home runs and 30 steals for Kiwoom this year. He is also a strong defender up the middle, as he has won a KBO Golden Glove at second in 2022 and '23. He won the same award at shortstop in '21. Update on 2B Hyeseong Kim from the great @Jeeho_1. The Mariners are among the teams interested in Kim, who will be posted by the Kiwoom Heroes.@MLBNetwork @MLB https://t.co/k2LIFwt94y The Mariners are among the teams interested in Kim, according to MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi. MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand has also identified Kim as a player who could make sense for the Mariners. Seattle second basemen recorded a .209 average, .658 OPS and 27.1% strikeout rate in 2024. Kim has a 16.3% K rate through 3,819 plate appearances in the KBO."

MLB News,Rewind: A Pedro-Clemens duel for the ages,https://www.mlb.com/news/pedro-martinez-vs-roger-clemens-2000-pitchers-duel-revived-on-hidden-classics,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 17:05:40 GMT","3 years before their famous ALCS clashes, Martinez and The Rocket put on a show","Matt Kelly In its new series ""Hidden Classics,"" MLB is digging into its archives and dusting off big games you might have forgotten about from your favorite stars of yesteryear. Stay tuned to MLB.com/HiddenClassics and MLB's YouTube channel for more Hidden Classic games later this month. Pitching showdowns of the early 2000s didn’t get any bigger than Pedro Martinez vs. Roger Clemens. Pedro and Roger were already must-see TV on their own, but the pair represented something bigger after the Yankees traded for Clemens in February 1999. These matchups became more than just ace vs. ace; it was Red Sox-Yankees, Boston’s best against New York’s best. Each pitcher’s competitive fire was the cherry on top. Fans streaming Netflix's documentary ""The Comeback: 2004 Red Sox"" are being treated to lookbacks of the two most famous Martinez vs. Clemens clashes: Games 3 and 7 of the 2003 ALCS. But, with a little concentration, diehard Sox and Yankees fans can probably recall a different Pedro-Roger matchup – when each ace truly lived up to the billing. What resulted was one of the best pitchers' duels of the era, featured on this week's installment of “Hidden Classics”. MLB’s “Hidden Classics” series dusts off old tapes from games you might not have seen in a while, forgotten about completely or just plain missed the first time around. This week’s installment turns back the clock to ESPN’s Sunday Night Baseball broadcast on May 28, 2000 at old Yankee Stadium. On the bump was prime Pedro (authoring his second straight Cy Young Award season, and one of the greatest two-season stretches by any pitcher ever) and Clemens, who was still mowing down hitters two months into his age-37 campaign. Clemens, the grizzled veteran, pitched like it was 1986, racking up strikeout after strikeout for the home Yankees. The younger Martinez was more economical but just as steely, matching The Rocket zero for zero deep into the Bronx night. This photo was taken 20 years ago today during a matchup against Roger Clemens and the Yankees... something tells me that the Yankees fans didn't like me back then... 😅 #redsox #bostonforever #rivalry #yankees pic.twitter.com/djrCf72soH After a combined 22 strikeouts, one late-game swing finally broke up the pitchers' duel. Relive how it all shook out by watching the condensed game in the video player above, or on MLB’s YouTube channel. “Hidden Classics” also recently revisited Ken Griffey Jr. and the Mariners’ last game at the Kingdome, and Albert Pujols’ 5-for-5, three-homer game against the rival Cubs.

MLB News,The HOF is in their future. But where will they pitch next season?,https://www.mlb.com/news/max-scherzer-justin-verlander-clayton-kershaw-free-agency-outlook,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 02:48:47 GMT",,"Will Leitch Someday – probably soon, certainly in the next decade – Max Scherzer, Justin Verlander and Clayton Kershaw are all going to enter the Hall of Fame. They’re all, obviously, locks. Between them, they have a combined nine Cy Young Awards, two MVP Awards, 27 All-Star Game selections and six World Series rings. These are the three best pitchers over the past 15 years. Zack Greinke, who last pitched in 2023, is perhaps the only one who is close. They are also, well, pretty old. Next season, Verlander will be 42, Scherzer will be 40 and Kershaw a relatively spry 37. And while their runs at Cy Young Awards are probably in their past -- though Verlander did just win one in 2022 -- they are all still planning on pitching again in 2025. They are also all free agents. MLB offseason signings and trades• Latest free-agent and trade rumors• Top 25 free agents | Every free agent, by position• Tracking every team's offseason moves• FA guides: Soto | Burnes | Alonso | Bregman | Fried | Santander• Offseason dates, rules & terms explained We can respect the history of these great pitchers, and the Cooperstown speeches they will someday give, while still looking dispassionately and rationally at what they might have to offer a hypothetical team on the mound in 2025. So today, we look at these three pitchers, what we might reasonably expect from them, and what teams could end up being interested. These guys aren’t ready to leave yet, which works out great: We’re not ready to say goodbye. None of these three pitchers threw 100 innings in 2024, but Verlander threw the most, putting up 90 1/3 for the Astros. Unfortunately, they might have been the worst 90 innings of his career. Verlander was knocked around for a 5.48 ERA – almost a full four runs higher than his 2022 ERA – and he had both the lowest strikeout rate and highest home run rate of his career. He was particularly rough after returning from a neck injury in late August, putting up an 8.10 ERA in seven starts over 33 1/3 innings down the stretch, and he didn’t even make the Astros’ roster for the AL Wild Card Series. Verlander is on record saying that he wants to reach 300 wins, which is going to be an uphill climb. He has 262, which means he’s almost certainly going to have to play at least three more seasons. That’s asking a lot at his age. And if he’s going to pitch long enough to win 300 games, he’s going to have to get through 2025 first. Verlander has said he feels “like I have a lot more to give pitching-wise,” and he mostly blames the neck injury for his inability to ever quite get right last year. While neck injuries aren’t great for pitchers, they’re certainly better than arm injuries, and remember, this was the best pitcher in baseball just two years ago. Verlander isn’t going to be anybody’s ace anymore, but for a contender, he can eat innings and give his team a chance to win every single night. And if he gets that neck injury fully healed, he may well be a lot more than that. The Astros could bring him back, though any team that’s willing to take a chance on a one-year deal and wants to win a World Series makes some sense. It’s hard not to get excited about the potential possibility of him coming full circle and returning to the Tigers, the team he broke in with back in 2005. He sure would look great in that uniform again. Either way, someone will give Verlander a chance to reestablish himself as a rotation mainstay. We’ll all be the more fortunate for it. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. First off, batters will be intimated to face Scherzer staring down the mound at them when he’s 83. I’m a little scared of him, just typing this. Scherzer was more effective than Verlander was in 2024, but he only made nine starts and was never really a factor for the Rangers, who were never much of a factor themselves. Scherzer opened 2024 on the IL while recovering from back surgery, later dealt with arm fatigue and nerve issues, and ultimately missed the end of the season with a hamstring strain. So much of Scherzer’s value was always wrapped up in his ability to take the ball every fifth day -- he made 30 starts or more every year for a full decade -- but that’s obviously not something anyone can count on anymore. But when he is healthy, he’s still Max freaking Scherzer. And he made 27 starts in a season as recently as 2023. You’re not going out on that much of a limb. Like Verlander, the presumed one-year deal that Scherzer would get opens him up as a possibility for just about everybody. You can totally see him as a Yankee -- it’s kind of surprising he hasn’t been a Yankee already, actually -- and the Phillies love those veterans making one last rodeo. He could also go back from whence he came, returning to up-and-coming teams in Detroit (where he turned into an ace) or Washington (where he won a World Series). Kershaw is a half-decade younger than both of these guys, but it’s easy to understand why it doesn’t seem that way. The three-time Cy Young Award winner hasn’t been an innings-eater in a decade, last throwing more than 130 innings in 2019 and last reaching 180 in 2015. Sometimes, his pitching can feel like a tightrope act: He’s doing something amazing, but you know he might fall any minute. This offseason has already been an active one for Kershaw, who underwent surgeries on both his left foot and left knee but says he’s going to “crush” his rehab and be ready for 2025. He also said that he is a “Dodger for life,” which should take care of all those Kershaw-to-the-Rangers rumors we heard around this time last year. “I’ll be back, somehow. I don’t care. I’ll be back,” he has said. It is worth noting, you may remember, that the Dodgers did end up a pitcher or two short last year, particularly in the rotation, and you can be certain that they’ll leave a spot for Kershaw whenever he is ready. He’s different than Verlander and Scherzer in that no one would expect him to even try to be an innings-eater, which is why he may in fact be perfect for the Dodgers: They just need some pitchers to still be standing come October, which should allow them to let Kershaw take all the time he needs before resuming his pursuit of 3,000 career strikeouts. (He’s 32 away.) Kershaw won’t put up any vintage numbers, and you won’t see him on the mound in 2025 nearly as often as you’d like. But you almost certainly will see him on the mound, in Dodger Blue … and that is a gift in and of itself."
MLB News,J-Rod's toy drive 'such a beautiful thing to do',https://www.mlb.com/news/julio-rodriguez-sponsors-toy-drive-for-seattle-dominican-republic,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 17:42:17 GMT",,"Daniel Kramer This story was excerpted from Daniel Kramer’s Mariners Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. BURIEN, Wash. -- Julio Rodríguez may only be 23 years old and at the cusp of what could be a long MLB career, but the Mariners’ star center fielder is already preaching the importance of giving back. During this holiday season, Rodríguez is spearheading a toy drive through the philanthropic organization he established earlier this year, No Limits Foundation, to aid underserved communities in both Seattle and his native Dominican Republic. The initiative held its largest event so far earlier this month when Rodríguez welcomed fans at Rairdon’s Honda in Burien for a one-hour session, where he exchanged photos and autographs with dozens of fans for donations of toys and baseball and softball equipment. Specifically, the donations made from mid-October through Thanksgiving will go to children in his hometown of Loma de Cabrera, and everything after that through the holiday season will go to those in the Puget Sound region, to youth-based charitable organizations that he will identify through guidance from the Mariners Care Foundation. “It's not just me,” Rodríguez told MLB.com at the event, pointing to the fans in attendance and their generous gestures. “People from here in Seattle, everybody is kind of coming together. And I feel like that is such a beautiful thing to do. I hope that people, moving forward, keep cooperating, keep working together and keep building things like this, being able to reach out and help out people in need.” Rodríguez estimates that the donations will impact 400 to 600 children in the D.R., where a massive giveaway will take place on one of the country’s most beloved holidays, Three Kings Day, held on Jan. 6 every year. The day marks the visit of the Three Wise Men (or Three Kings) to the newborn Jesus in Bethlehem, according to Christian tradition, and the day is especially focused on children. Rodríguez says that for most children in the D.R. -- and certainly himself growing up -- it was celebrated as specially as Christmas, which represents more of a familial gathering than a gift-giving event in his homeland. “Every time it was Three Kings Day, I was expecting a toy,” Rodríguez said. “I was expecting some sort of little gift for myself. And I just want to keep that tradition that was kind of brought on to me from my family, and just kind of spread out in my hometown, and just kind of keep doing that.” The picture that Rodríguez and the Mariners shared in the immediate aftermath of him winning the American League Rookie of the Year Award in 2022 -- Julio as a toddler hoisting a Spider-Man action figure -- was taken on Three Kings Day way back when. A post shared by Seattle Mariners (@mariners) “It's obviously about the kids on that day,” Rodríguez said. “They're the future. And I feel like anything that I can do to help out and just kind of create a smile on a kid’s face, I feel like that's something that I would like to do. Because that's what that day represented for me -- joy and giving back to the youth.” The vessel behind the toy drive is No Limits Foundation, whose mission statement is “to create opportunities that inspire children to believe in their boundless potential, education and mentorship.” For all of his extensive interactions with fans over the past three seasons, enhanced through his outgoing personality, Rodríguez has consistently put an extra emphasis on connecting with kids. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Some of that is tied to that he still thinks of himself as one of them in so many ways. “I'm so blessed and grateful to see everybody to be able to inspire and motivate so many people,” Rodríguez said. “Having little kids running around in my jersey, that's something that I've never really thought about when I was [growing up] in Loma de Cabrera. I feel like being able to see all those things that bring people a lot of joy, it motivates me to continue to keep going and doing the right thing.” This isn’t the first large-scale charitable effort that Rodríguez has made since breaking into the Majors in 2022. During the offseason after his rookie year, Rodríguez donated an ambulance to the city of Loma de Cabrera, which he said was the town’s first. The toy drive is the first of what he hopes are many in the years to come. For how far he’s come, and at such a rapid rate, Rodríguez still remembers where he hails -- perhaps because he’s not so far removed from the path that got him here."
MLB News,The 7 oddest stat lines for winning pitchers in 2024,https://www.mlb.com/news/most-unusual-pitcher-wins-of-2024,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 02:48:39 GMT",,"Sarah Langs It’s Thanksgiving week, which means it’s time to take stock of what we’re thankful for. Every baseball fan is familiar with certain moments, outcomes and games attributed to luck -- things that feel extra worthy of gratefulness. Sometimes, it’s a ball that seems like a certain flyout off the bat carrying for a homer. Other times, it’s a pitcher earning the win on a day he wasn’t at his best. Whether it’s thanks to strong run support, a well-placed line drive, or a lucky bounce, sometimes you end up in the win column regardless of how well you pitched. To be clear: a win is a win, and this is all in good fun. But sometimes a box score line really stands out, and taking a look at these has become an annual tradition. We did this in 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020 and 2019. With those concepts in mind, here are seven times this season a pitcher had reason to give thanks. Stats: 5 2/3 IP, 9 H, 6 R (5 ER), 1 BB Final score: CIN 10, MIL 8 Ashcraft’s six runs were tied for the most by any pitcher in a win this season, and he was the first to do so (Tajuan Walker on April 28, Zach Eflin on July 4, Cooper Criswell on Aug. 16). The key to winning when allowing six-plus runs? Your team scoring 10, including nine while Ashcraft was the pitcher of record. Those nine runs included a six-run fourth inning by the Reds, making it 8-0. That means that when the Brewers scored three in the top of the fifth, it was still a healthy lead at 8-3. When Ashcraft left the game, the score was 9-6, and the bullpen never surrendered the lead. Stats: 5 2/3 IP, 7 H, 2 R, 0 BB Final score: STL 4, NYM 2 Mikolas’ line may look harmless enough, but five of those hits he allowed were extra-base hits, tied with six other pitchers for the most in a win this year. He had just a single one-two-three inning, but was able to work out of trouble, with only two of those extra-base hits scoring runs. He allowed a solo homer in the fifth inning and an RBI double in the sixth. The rest of his hits were stranded by a double play, five strikeouts and more defense behind him. Stats: 5 IP, 3 H, 0 R, 6 BB Final score: AZ 3, CHC 0 Gallen did not allow a run, but he still makes this list because of how impressive this scoreless start was. He walked six batters, tied for the most by a pitcher in a game where he got the win this season (Andrew Abbott June 27). But the other instance involved allowing a run, something Gallen did not do. He was one of just two pitchers to walk at least six batters in a scoreless outing in 2024, along with Javier Assad in relief two days later. All but one of Gallen’s walks came with two outs, and he was aided by his defense and four timely strikeouts to keep those runners from scoring. Stats: 7 IP, 8 H, 5 R, 0 BB Final score: STL 9, ATL 5 Gray allowed five extra-base hits, tied with six others, including his teammate Mikolas noted above, for the most in a win this season. Four of those extra-base hits were home runs, tied for the most by a winning pitcher this year (Kutter Crawford Aug. 2). A good way to win even when allowing four home runs is to make sure that none of those homers come with anyone on base, as Gray did. The other extra-base hit he allowed, a leadoff triple to Jarred Kelenic, did come around to score, but other than that, Gray racked up 10 strikeouts and did not walk a batter. Gray is the only pitcher since at least 1901 to win a game where he recorded 10 strikeouts while giving up four-plus homers and zero walks. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Stats: 7 IP, 10 H, 1 R, 1 BB Final score: DET 8, CLE 2 The unanimous AL Cy Young winner makes this list thanks to a day when he worked in and out of trouble to allow just one run. Skubal allowed 10 hits, tied for the second-most by a pitcher in a game where he got the win this season. His one run was the fewest among the 123 instances of a pitcher allowing at least 10 hits in a game this season. He’s one of just four pitchers since the start of 2020 to allow one run or fewer on at least 10 hits in a game, with Ranger Suárez in 2023, Mike Minor in ’22 and Chris Flexen in ’21. Stats: 3 1/3 IP, 9 H, 6 R, 4 BB Final score: BOS 12, BAL 10 Criswell is the only relief appearance to make our list, but he did so in a bullpen game where he provided the bulk innings. He entered in the top of the second with the Red Sox up, 2-0. His six runs were tied for the most in a win, as noted above. He also allowed 13 baserunners, the second-most in a win this year, with nine hits and four walks. But the Red Sox offense was there to pick him up and then some, and Criswell departed with one out in the fifth and his team ahead 8-6. They would go on to add to that lead and eventually win, 12-10. Criswell was the first reliever to get a win while allowing at least 13 baserunners in fewer than four innings since Paul Zahniser on July 13, 1924. (If you were curious, and if you’re reading this story, you very likely may be, the most baserunners allowed by a reliever in a win since at least 1901 is 39 by Eddie Rommel on July 10, 1932, in a 17-inning appearance where he allowed 29 hits and his team won 18-17 in 18 innings.) Stats: 6 IP, 11 H, 5 R (4 ER), 2 BB Final score: LAA 9, KC 5 Anderson allowed 14 baserunners, the most by a winning pitcher this season. He yielded 11 hits and two walks and one batter reached on an error. But throughout all of the traffic, the Angels never trailed in the game, taking a 2-0 lead in the fourth. Anthony Rendon, Kevin Pillar and Logan O’Hoppe each had two RBIs in support of their starter, and Jo Adell, Jack Lopez and Zach Neto each added one. The Angels turned three double plays – two with Anderson on the mound, and one to end the inning where he was removed, erasing one of his runners left on."

Put down the fork and follow a feast of football here!","When a team benches — and then cuts — its starting quarterback in the middle of a season, any opponent would normally be licking their chops. The Dallas Cowboys, who have wins at Washington and Pittsburgh as part of one of the best road records in the league at 4-2, are hungry — not just for the postgame turkey legs and mac and cheese, but to be facing a new starting quarterback on a short week. The narratives surrounding the Cowboys' 0-5 home record — and massive blowouts on their home field — could change this week as the 2-9 New York Giants head to Texas for a holiday visit with yet another new face under center. Daniel Jones is reportedly on his way to Minnesota, and Tommy DeVito got his first start of the season on Sunday in a 30-7 loss to the Buccaneers. But DeVito is officially inactive with a forearm injury, and Drew Lock is starting for the Giants. Dallas has won its past two Thanksgiving Day games, including a 28-20 win over the Giants in 2022. Time: 4:30 p.m. ET Location: AT&T Stadium | Arlington, Texas TV channel: Fox Streaming: Fox Sports App, Fubo The Giants opted against an onside kick and kicked the ball back to the Cowboys with 2:18 remaining. Can the Cowboys run out the clock on a 27-20 win? The Giants aren't done yet. Drew Lock just capped an eight-play, 80-yard drive with an eight-yard touchdown scramble to cut the Cowboys lead to 27-20. Now what? Do the Giants kick it back to the Cowboys with two timeouts and 2:18 remaining? Or do they attempt an onside kick? Drew Lock runs it in!

The Giants have the ball back with 4:39 remaining and a 27-13 deficit. The Cowboys sacked Drew Lock for the sixth time of the day, and the Giants have punted with 6:59 remaining. Dallas will look to run off as much of the clock as it can. The Cowboys punted back to the Giants with 9:51 left in the fourth quarter. Can the Giants mount a rally? Drew Lock's shown little to demonstrate that a Giants comeback is feasible down, 27-13. Micah Parsons and Mazi Smith combined to sack Drew Lock on second down, and the Giants ultimately settled for a field goal. The Cowboys lead is down to two scores.

Dallas carries a 27-10 lead into the fourth quarter. The Giants will face second-and-5 from the Cowboys 25 to start the fourth. The Cowboys are in full control. Rico Dowdle capped a nine-play, 70-yard Dallas drive with a four-yard touchdown run to extend the Cowboys lead to 27-10 late in the third quarter.

Micah Parsons sacked him on third down to force a Giants punt, and the Cowboys have a chance to extend their lead to three scores. The Cowboys capitalized after the fumble by Cooper Rush was overturned. One play later, Rush found Brandin Cooks in the end zone to extend the Cowboys lead to 20-10 early in the third quarter.

But replay showed that his knee was down before he lost the ball, and the Cowboys hold on. Drew Lock fumbled on New York's first drive of the second half, and the Cowboys recovered. It's the second turnover for the day for Lock in his first start of the season. Again, it was DeMarvion Overshown on the ball. The Cowboys linebacker recovered the fumble on the strip sack by Eric Kendricks. Overshown scored Dallas' lone first-half touchdown on a pick-6 of Lock.

But New York's final drive of the second quarter ended with a sack of Drew Lock on first-and-10 from the Giants 40. It was a fitting end to a half with little to like from either offense. This game is struggling for offensive consistency. Tom Brady doesn't sound amused in the broadcast booth. In three drives, the Giants and Cowboys totaled 10 plays and 6 yards. It's never a good thing when the Fox broadcast flashes a graphic with your star receiver's image with the ""Dropped passes"" headline on it. We're up to 3 now for Dallas' CeeDee Lamb. Another punt forthcoming for the Cowboys, which is being greeted with boos from the crowd at JerryWorld. The Giants didn't move the ball much after starting on the Cowboys' 29-yard line. The drive for a first down ended on a Malik Nabers drop on third-and-9 (he was well short of the sticks, even if he caught it). Graham Gano's 46-yard FG narrows Dallas' lead. Giants punter Jamie Gillan pinned the Cowboys on their 1-yard line and New York forced a three-and-out. New York gets to start its drive in Dallas territory. CeeDee Lamb dropped his second pass today and the Giants stuffed the Cowboys on fourth-and-1 to get the ball back. The Cowboys forced a punt after Donovan Wilson sacked Drew Lock on third-and-8. DeMarvion Overshown blew up a screen play, intercepted Drew Lock and returned it 23 yards for a score.

Zeke Elliott with a 4-yard run in a fullback position was later followed by two Rico Dowdle rushes for 22 and 13 yards. Cowboys on the move heading into the second quarter on New York's 46. Drew Lock is off to an excellent start. The Giants quarterback scrambles 29 yards for what was initially called a touchdown. He was ruled out of bounds at the half-yard line after review, but Tyrone Tracy Jr. punched it in on the next play to give the Giants a 7-3 lead.

Dallas settles for a field goal after stalling out at the 4-yard line. Brandon Aubrey's good from 23 yards to give the Cowboys an early 3-0 lead. We're moments from kickoff. The Giants won the toss and deferred. The Cowboys have the ball first. As the football world recovers from the debacle that was the final moments of Lions-Bears, we've got another game to play.

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",NBA Power Rankings 2024-25: Celtics top 'Things to be Thankful for' edition,https://sports.yahoo.com/nba-power-rankings-2024-25-202836326.html,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 20:28:36 GMT",The Cavaliers and Thunder round out the top three on this Thanksgiving rankings,"Every team's fans have something to be thankful for this week — including some NBA Cup dreams that are still alive. (This week's NBC Sports NBA Power Rankings 2024-25 is out a day later than usual, which is because of my travel schedule, starting next week we return to Wednesdays). 1. Boston Celtics (15-3, Last Week No. 1). Boston fans should be thankful that Kristaps Porzingis is back in the lineup before Thanksgiving, much earlier than the expectation he would arrive with Santa Claus next month. KP played limited minutes (22) in one game against the Clippers, scoring 16, but his value in opening up the offense was instantly apparent as he was +32. Despite an NBA Cup opening night upset to the Hawks, if the Celtics can beat the Bulls on Friday night — especially if Boston can win big — they have a good chance of advancing to the knockout round (it will come down to point differential as the tiebreaker and the Celtics are +14 through three games — they need to run up the score to advance). 2. Cleveland Cavaliers (17-2, LW 2). Cavaliers fans should be thankful for Kenny Atkinson. His installation of a more motion-based offense, his trusting Evan Mobley with more playmaking (in a Draymond Green-style role Atkinson brought with him from the Warriors) and his trust of Darius Garland — and getting Donovan Mitchell to buy into all of this — has turned the Cavaliers into Boston's biggest threat in the East. That includes in the NBA Cup, where Cleveland has a big showdown with Atlanta Friday night. Win that, then run up the score next Tuesday on Washington, and advancing as the group winner or wild card is very possible. 3. Oklahoma City Thunder (14-4, LW 3). Thunder fans should be thankful Isaiah Hartenstein is back from a fractured hand — the team instantly looks better on both ends of the court (because Chet Holmgren is out with a fractured hip). Hartenstein has averaged 15.3 points and 12.7 rebounds a game, plus he solidified the team's paint protection since his return. The Thunder are 3-0 with him with a +25 point differential in those three games. OKC still has a chance in the NBA Cup, but the big game is Friday night: Beat the Lakers on the road, then blow out Utah to build up the point differential, and the Thunder could well advance to the knockout round as the group winner or the West wild card. Shai went OFF in the Thunder's road victory!⚡️ 35 PTS (3 3PM)⚡️ 9 REB⚡️ 5 AST⚡️ 2 BLK pic.twitter.com/pKRxivFzZN — NBA (@NBA) November 28, 2024 4. Houston Rockets (14-6, LW 5). The Rockets move into title contenders status not for what they might do in June, but because they might win the NBA Cup. Houston is 3-0 and one of only two teams to have already won its group and secured ints place in the knockout round. Rockets fans, be thankful for the intense, physical, gritty defense that Ime Udoka has instilled in this team, it will take them beyond just the NBA Cup. 5. Dallas Mavericks (11-8, LW 10). Mavericks fans, be thankful for depth. Luka Doncic has missed 5-of-6, but the Mavericks have won four of those five. Leading the way has been Naji Marshal, who is having a career year averaging 12 points a game with a .630 true shooting percentage well above the league average. Dallas has a key NBA Cup Game coming up next Tuesday: The Mavericks can't win West Group C (the Warriors have clinched) but beat the Grizzlies and the Mavs will be 3-1 in group play with at least a +41 point differential (plus whatever they would add against Memphis). That likely is enough to advance. 6. Golden State Warriors (12-6, LW 4). Be thankful for the road Warriors. Golden State has slipped back to third in the West standings after dropping three straight (the last without Stephen Curry, he's expected to just miss a couple of games because he's a little banged up). However, they continue to look like a threat in the West because this team is 7-3 with a +8.2 net rating away from the Chase Center (fourth-best road net rating in the league). A road win against the Pelicans secured the Warriors' top spot in West Group C in the NBA Cup — the Warriors will be in the knockout round. = 7. New York Knicks (10-8, LW 9). The Knicks are having an offensive outburst, just like we expect from Tom Thibodeau’s teams (*cough*) — they scored 130+ points in 3-of-4 games, all wins, before getting smoked by Dallas on Wednesday. The back-to-back 130+ point games against Phoenix and Washington last week were the first time the Knicks had scored 130+ in back-to-back wins since 1968. Knicks fans should be thankful that offense has them in the mix in the NBA Cup: Beat Charlotte on the road Friday and it sets up a big Cup showdown game next Tuesday against Orlando. 8. Denver Nuggets (10-7, LW 6). It’s too easy to say Nuggets fans should be thankful for Nikola Jokic — although they should be, he is playing at an MVP level again this season. Instead, be thankful for Peyton Watson finding a groove this season, particularly on the defensive end making some big clutch plays in the past couple of weeks. He’s not an offensive force, but he’s averaging a career-best 9.7 points a game and is shooting 34.9% from 3 — he is playing well. Denver’s loss to Dallas ended any NBA Cup dreams for this team. 9. Memphis Grizzlies (12-7, LW 15). Grizzlies fans, be thankful for Scotty Pippen Jr., who has emerged as a key part of their rotation and helped this team Stan strong through an early rash of injuries. He is averaging 12.5 points a game, shooting 39.7% from 3-point range, and stepped up and dropped a 30 spot in his father's old stomping grounds in Chicago last weekend. Good test next Tuesday against Dallas in a game the Mavericks will be motivated to play for NBA Cup reasons (the Grizzlies are 0-2 in Cup play and out of it). 10. Orlando Magic (13-7, LW 13). Magic fans should be thankful for the emergence of Franz Wagner, a guy comfortable being the No. 2 next to Paolo Banchero, but who has stepped up in a huge way since Banchero went down — and that includes a logo step-back 3-point game-winner to beat the Lakers. In his last 10 games Wagner is averaging 27 points and 7 assists a game, sparking the Orlando offense. Wagner has the Magic 2-0 in NBA Cup play with big games coming up against Brooklyn and New York. Franz Wagner. Clutch. He ices the victory for Orlando with the cold stepback 3 pic.twitter.com/Qk1AtBRt15 — NBA (@NBA) November 22, 2024 11. Los Angeles Clippers (12-8, LW 14). Clippers fans, be thankful for Jeff Van Gundy’s defense — the Clippers are 5-1 in their last six games, and in each win they held their opponents under 100 points. Over the last six games, the Clippers have a 100.3 defensive rating, which is second in the NBA in that stretch. Tyronn Lue brought in Van Gundy and turned the defense over to the veteran coach, and the results have spoken for themselves. The Clippers are 1-1 in NBA Cup play but are still alive for the wild card spot in the West, they just need to blow out Minnesota and Portland in upcoming games (point differential is the key tiebreaker). 12. Phoenix Suns (10-8, LW 11). It's obvious, but Suns fans need to be thankful for Kevin Durant — this team is 9-1 in the games he's played this season. Durant has put up MVP numbers this season — 27.4 points and 6.6 rebounds a game — plus played quality defense. Phoenix is outscoring teams by 4.2 points per 100 possessions when he is on the court (and getting outscored when he is off the floor). Key NBA Cup game for the Spurs next Tuesday: win and the Suns will be 3-1 in West Group B with a real chance to advance to the knockout round as either group winners or the wild card (although they will need a blowout win and some point differential help to get the WC). 13. Los Angeles Lakers (11-7, LW 7). Laker fans are rightfully thankful that Dalton Knecht fell to them at No. 17, the rookie brings much-needed shooting to the rotation averaging 43.6% from deep, scoring 11.7 points per game, and he has been part of a couple solid Lakers five-man units. As his defense improves, so will the minutes coach J.J. Redick can trust him on the court. The Lakers have a chance to advance in the NBA Cup and defend their crown, but to do it they not only need to beat Oklahoma City on Friday night at home, Los Angeles needs a blowout to improve its -16 point differential. It's a big ask. 14. Milwaukee Bucs (9-9, LW 21). Milwaukee fans should be thankful they play in the East. After a dreadful 2-8 start to the season and a lot of noise around the team, the Bucks used a soft spot in the schedule to find their footing, they have won five in a row (including beating Houston and Miami), and that has them sitting as the No. 5 seed already in the East (9-9 doesn't even make the play-in out West). That win streak has timed out well with the NBA Cup — the Bucks are 3-0 and can clinch their group with a win over Detroit next Tuesday. 15. Miami Heat (8-8, LW 16). Heat fans need to be thankful for — and appreciate — Tyler Herro is having his best season as a pro. He’s leading the team averaging 23.6 points and dishing out 5.1 assists a night. Don’t take my word for it, Bam Adebayo talked about it this week and how the game has slowed down for the Kentucky guard. “He’s just reading the game, man,” Adebayo said. “The game has slowed down so much for Tyler. He’s understanding how to get the ball, when to get the ball and he’s just making plays right now.” 16. Sacramento Kings (9-10, LW 12). Be thankful that Malik Monk is back, this team is not the same without him coming off the bench. Monk was out for seven games with a sprained ankle and the Kings went 2-5 (Domantas Sabonis and DeMar DeRozan have been banged up, too). It's not simply the 13.9 points a game Monk provides, the offense just flows better and the Kings outscore opponents by 4.7 points per 100 possessions when he is on the court (and get slightly outscored when he sits). If Monk can stay healthy for the majority of the rest of the season, he will again be in the mix for Sixth Man of the Year. 17. San Antonio Spurs (10-9, LW 18). The Spurs had a good week and fans should be thankful for the veteran presence that Chris Paul and Harrison Barnes have brought, getting this team a couple of big wins recently. However, if I were a Spurs fan, I would mostly be thankful for what I see so far from rookie Stephon Castle, who looks like he could be special. He's averaging 14.7 points and 4.8 assists a game as a starter (the last 12 games), and, more importantly, he and Victor Wembanyama are showing some real chemistry. 18. Minnesota Timberwolves (8-10, LW 8). Be thankful for Anthony Edwards' honesty. That's about all there is to be happy about in Minnesota right now, this team is a mess. Edwards says that is starting in the locker room, here he is talking about the 12-point blown fourth quarter lead vs. the Kings: ""We was down, nobody wanted to say nothing. We got up and everybody cheering... We get down again and don't nobody say nothing. That's the definition of a frontrunner... It's like we're not even happy for each other out there."" 19. Indiana Pacers (9-10, LW 19). This season's start is not a year ago, but Pacers fans should be thankful for Tyrese Haliburton — this is still the cornerstone of a very good and fun to watch offense. Haliburton is still averaging 17.4 points and 8.8 assists a game this season for Indiana. The Pacers open December with 7-of-8 on the road. 20. Brooklyn Nets (9-10, LW 22). Nets fans should be thankful for new coach Jordi Fernandez, who has an ill-fitting roster with trade rumors hanging over them, playing well with a top-10 offense in the league. That offense will take a hit in the coming weeks with Cam Thomas out 3-4 weeks with a hamstring injury, they will miss his 24.7 points a game and his 38.9% shooing from 3. 21. Atlanta Hawks (8-11, LW 17). Hawks fans should be thankful for Dyson Daniels, who has broken out as an elite defender tis season — he leads the NBA at 3.1 steals a game — who also is scoring 14.2 points a game. He was buried and not used well in New Orleans, give Quin Snyder credit for getting him in better positions. Daniels has taken full advantage of his opportunity. 22. Detroit Pistons (8-12, LW 20). There are a lot of players and things on the court to be thankful for in Detroit — Jaden Ivey and Cade Cunningham showing some chemistry might be at the top of that list — but Piston fans should be most thankful for J.B. Bickerstaff. The new coach is at the heart of an improved Pistons defense (13th in the NBA, a big step forward from 25th in the league a year ago. That has them 2-0 in NBA Cup games so far, with big games this week against Indiana (Friday) and Milwaukee (Tuesday). 23. Chicago Bulls (8-12, LW 24). Bulls fans, be thankful that guys mentioned more in trade rumors or as bad contracts — Zach LaVine and Nikola Vucevic — took it personally and showed up ready to show this season why they got paid. LaVine is averaging 21.6 points a game shooting 43.4% from 3, while Vucevic is averaging 20.4 points and 9.9 rebounds a game. The Bulls are 2-1 in NBA Cup East Group C and have a real chance to advance to the knockout stage, but need to beat the Celtics in Boston Friday night to do it. That's a big ask. 24. Toronto Raptors (5-14, LW 27). Be thankful Scottie Barnes is back — this team went 2-9 when he was out injured and is 2-2 since he returned. Barnes is averaging 20 points, 8.4 rebounds and 6.4 assists a game for Toronto this season, and he needs time on the court to develop chemistry with the young core of Immanuel Quickley, RJ Barrett and Gradey Dick. 25. Charlotte Hornets (6-12, LW 23). Hornets fans should be thankful that LaMelo Ball has been healthy this season, and he and Brandon Miller are developing some real chemistry. Miller has been hot of late — in his last five games Miller is averaging 28 points a game while shooting 48.1% from 3 on 10.8 attempts a game. Charlotte is an entertaining team to watch and should be one of your league pass favorites. 26. Portland Trail Blazers (7-12, LW 25). Blazers fans, be thankful for Shaedon Sharpe — and pray for his continued health. Sharpe is averaging a career-high 18 points a game for the season, a number that will go up when he finds his 3-point rhythm again. In a league where everyone playing has won the genetic lottery on some level, Sharpe is a standout, electric athlete you just love to watch. Portland, as a whole, has been feisty and they are not out of the NBA Cup knockout round mix, but the Blazers need to blow out the Kings and Clippers to up their point differential enough to have a chance. 27. Philadelphia 76ers (3-14, LW 28). Philadelphia fans have to be thankful for Jared McCain. In an otherwise dismal start to this season, it’s become clear Maxey and Jared McCain are the backcourt of the future. If the vote were held today, McCain likely would run away Rookie of the Year. To be fair, we are 17 games into a very long season — if the NBA regular season is a marathon, we just passed the mile 5 marker — but he has stood out as a bright spot on a team desperately in need of bright spots averaging 16.5 points a night while shooting 37.4% from 3. 28. Utah Jazz (4-14, LW 29). Lauri Markkanen has been good this season — 19.5 points a game, 6.6 rebounds, shooting 41.6% from 3 (on 5.9 attempts a game) — but he has not played at the All-Star level we saw from him the previous two seasons. It's a concern if the Jazz did plan to rebuild around him (as some fans wanted), and it doesn't help his trade value if the Jazz decide to move on next summer. If you want something to be thankful for in Utah — other than this being the right year to be bad with this draft coming up — its the continued development of Keyonte George, who looks like a player. 29. New Orleans Pelicans (4-15, LW 26). Pelicans fans, be thankful your team controls its own first-round draft pick this season. This season has gotten off to a disastrous start, Zion Williamson will not be returning anytime soon (still no timeline on his hamstring) and even as others on this team get healthy it's hard to find positives. However, this is a deep draft with potential franchise cornerstones at the top, so if the Pelicans were going to be bad this was a good year to do it. 30. Washington Wizards (2-15, LW 30). The one thing to be thankful for with the Wizards is that young players Bilal Coulibaly and Alex Sarr continue to both show improvement and flashes of what they might become. Those guys may not be the cornerstones of this roster in five years, but they are guys who can be a part of what is being built. Also, it's a good year to control your own draft pick, so there's that."

Just a couple of days after making their initial bid to the superstar outfielder, Jon Heyman of the New York Post reports that the Bronx Bombers have upgraded their offer. The Mets, Red Sox, Dodgers, and Blue Jays are the other four teams with offers on the table. Exact terms haven't been revealed just yet, but Soto is said to be seeking something in the 15-year range rather than a high-AAV short-term pact, and he's expected to set a new record for contract value with team willing to exceed $600 million. According to Heyman, the Yankees and others have told Soto that they'd be willing to include opt-outs in the package. New York has also been in contract with top of the market starting pitchers Corbin Burnes and Max Fried, but their main focus at the moment is trying to retain the 26-year-old slugger who helped carry them to an AL Pennant last season. Soto put together as good of a contract-year as you can get, as he took home his third career Silver Slugger after hitting a career-high 41 homers and driving in 109 runs across 157 games."

DeVito said later that day that the plan was for him to play against the Cowboys. ""I think if it was a regular week, Tuesday is usually when things settle in to your body.

DeVito did not fly to Dallas with the team on Wednesday and instead stayed behind to undergo further evaluation. After being listed as questionable to play, he traveled later in the day. DeVito was set for his second start of the season after being named the Daniel Jones' replacement after the longtime Giants starter asked for his release. Jones is expected to sign with the Minnesota Vikings practice squad this week.

Earlier this season, they ran a hook-and-ladder play to Penei Sewell, their fantastic 335-pound left tackle. Sewell is a freak athlete. He has a 9-yard catch in his career too, which came on a third-and-7 to seal a win over the Minnesota Vikings. But having Sewell pass the ball? The Lions are just messing with everyone now. It sure seemed like that was the plan. Sewell took a handoff on a reverse and it sure seemed like he was going to pass it downfield. Nothing came open downfield so he had to eat it for a 1-yard loss, officially ruled a sack for the Bears. Chicago defensive lineman Austin Booker and linebacker Jack Sanborn probably didn't plan on each getting a half-sack on a Pro Bowl lineman on Thursday.

They love this Lions team, love Sewell and clearly enjoy offensive coordinator Ben Johnson's wicked sense of humor when it comes to creating crazy trick plays. Sewell didn't get to pass it, so we didn't get to see what kind of arm he has. Knowing the Lions, he'll get another chance."

The way they had played in the second half of losses to Denver and Phoenix had players wondering whether all the work the team had put in over the last two months had been worth it and all the effort and time spent trying to change had mattered. When Denver pushed the familiar pressure points, the Lakers crumbled. When the offense went cold and the rims got tight in Phoenix, they folded. Their body language said what no one dared mutter publicly: “Here we go again.” But when the Lakers took the floor Wednesday evening, they took on the persona of their coach, JJ Redick, who said before the game, “I don’t think I’ve ever dwelled on the past."" Energized in part by a new starting five and in part by a fresh chance to get back to winning, the Lakers played one of their most consistent games of the season on both ends of the court in a 119-101 win against the San Antonio Spurs. Read more: Lakers look to ramp up defense with return to physical play “I'm very proud of our group,” Redick said. “The response was great. And it's funny because it's literally what I talked about with them before the game. It's just you got to let go of the past. You got to let go of the recent past and you got to get on to the next thing. And like they've done already on several occasions, they've responded.” Redick moved rookie Dalton Knecht back into the starting five, moving Cam Reddish to the bench, and the group responded by winning each of the four quarters. Defensively, the Lakers caused havoc and dictated the game with their physicality, pushing Spurs phenom Victor Wembanyama away from the paint. Offensively, the ball popped, baskets almost always coming as result of crisp passing, the Lakers recapturing vibes that had evaporated during their three-game losing streak. “We win games when we do that,” guard D'Angelo Russell said of the Lakers’ passing, which produced 31 assists. When the Lakers have had 27 or more assists, they’re 9-1. When they’re below that number, they’re 2-6. Knecht led seven players in double figures with 20 points, LeBron James had his sixth triple-double and Anthony Davis had 19 points, 14 rebounds and seven assists. Russell had one of his best games of the season, scoring 17 off the bench. Max Christie added 12. Davis’ passing, in particular, energized the team and neutralized San Antonio’s defense. “We're just trying to get good looks, run our offense and live with the results,” Davis said. “And put guys in actions that we thought that we had an advantage with. We're able to get some lobs, some pocket passes, some open threes. But we just stayed with it.” The Lakers' NBA Cup chances are still alive, but they need a win Friday against Oklahoma City, while needing the Spurs to upset the Suns. More importantly, though, the Lakers found reason to believe that this version of themselves can be who they are moving forward — and not the rickety version from the previous three games, which featured, in one way or another, gut-churning collapses. “We came out with force, came out with intensity,” Christie said. “Yeah, I don't think we really slacked. I thought we did a really good job.” Sign up for our weekly newsletter on all things Lakers. This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times."

Ahead of Thursday's three-game slate and Friday's Raiders-Chiefs matchup, the biggest news of the week features a player who won't even be on the field. After quarterback Daniel Jones was released by the Giants last week, he's reportedly found a new home with the Vikings, who plan to sign him to their practice squad. It's a move that makes sense for several reasons, as Yahoo Sports' Jori Epstein wrote last week. The 14-year veteran defensive end was having a great game against the Rams when he exited after having moved into third place on the Eagles' all-time sack list. After the game he said he'd been dealing with some tendonitis in his left triceps, and confirmed the tear. He'll miss the rest of the season — one that could be his last, after signing a one-year, $4 million contract this past offseason. He's one of just three players on the team, alongside tackle Lane Johnson and kicker Jake Elliott, who won Super Bowl LII at the end of the 2017 season. Also on the Eagles' defense, cornerback Darius Slay Jr. suffered a concussion and did not return to the game.

Dobbins suffered a knee sprain during Monday night's 30-23 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. The injury is expected to keep him out for some time, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. Dobbins will definitely miss this week against the Atlanta Falcons. His status beyond that is to be determined. Gus Edwards will likely step into the No. 1 role. In 11 games this season, Dobbins has 766 rushing yards and eight touchdowns. Cowboys ruled out Jake Ferguson for the Thanksgiving game vs. the New York Giants due to his concussion. His replacement, once again, will be Luke Schoonmaker. — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) November 27, 2024 Chiefs head coach Andy Reid said the two will play ""as long as they're OK.

He is Green Bay’s second-leading receiver with 34 catches for 483 yards and two TDs. Also out for the Packers is cornerback Jaire Alexander, still recovering from a torn PCL in his right knee. Linebacker Edgerrin Cooper will also miss his second consecutive game with a hamstring injury. Brock Purdy was cleared to throw and is participating, though limited, in the 49ers practice on Wednesday, reports the Mercury News' Cam Inman. The hope is that he can play in Sunday night's game versus the Bills but that will depend how the QB responds. Last week at this time, Purdy only did light throwing and left Thursday's practice before having an MRI. He was eventually ruled out of San Francisco's 38–10 loss to the Packers. Dolphins receiver Tyreek Hill and defensive back Jalen Ramsey were full participants in practice on Wednesday. Both are expected to be active for Thursday night's matchup with the Packers.

The former New York Giants quarterback is expected to sign with the Minnesota Vikings, according to NFL Network. The move came shortly after Jones requested his release from the Giants after losing his starting job earlier this month. According to ESPN, the Vikings will pay him $375,000 for the rest of the season while the Giants will pay him $11.8 million. Jones will reportedly sign with Minnesota's practice squad, which would give him the opportunity to work with a non-Giants NFL coaching staff for the very first time in his career. And considering starting QB Sam Darnold's impressive turnaround with the Vikings this season, there may not be a better place for a struggling quarterback to land. Read the full story here. Lawrence last played on Nov. 3 and has been dealing with a shoulder injury. Surgery was reportedly an option the Jaguars quarterback was considering, but getting back on the field this week is an encouraging sign for his status for Sunday's game against the Texans.

Encouraging sign of him playing Sunday, Pederson said. — Michael DiRocco (@ESPNdirocco) November 27, 2024 The Commanders have placed Seibert on IR and will likely bring up Zane Gonzalez from the practice squad for Sunday's game against the Tennessee Titans. Seibert missed two extra points during their loss to the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday. Prior to Week 12 he had been perfect on extra points this season — 22 for 22. He has already missed two games this season with a hip injury.

Ulbrich also denied knowing anything about reports that Rodgers has been resisting medical scans offered by the Jets. The NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported earlier this week that Rodgers didn’t want to “reveal the severity of his injuries out of fear of having to come off the field,” which is why he apparently has denied the medical scans.

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",San Jose State transgender controversy: Boise State withdraws from Mountain West volleyball tourney rather than play Spartans,https://sports.yahoo.com/san-jose-state-transgender-controversy-boise-state-withdraws-from-mountain-west-volleyball-tourney-rather-than-play-spartans-025516570.html,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 02:55:16 GMT",The Broncos had already forfeited two matches against the Spartans based on moral grounds. Now Boise State has done so a third time with a lot more at stake.,"Twice during the regular season, the Boise State women’s volleyball team took a moral stand by forfeiting matches against San Jose State rather than competing against a player believed to be transgender. Now the Broncos are doing so a third time with a lot more at stake. Boise State announced late Wednesday night that it is pulling out of its conference tournament rather than play second-seeded San Jose State in Friday's Mountain West semifinals. The sixth-seeded Broncos advanced to the semifinals earlier Wednesday evening with a four-set quarterfinal victory over third-seeded Utah State. The forfeit loss comes at a time when Boise State (18-10, 10-8) was potentially only two victories away from securing the Mountain West's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. Now the Broncos' season is almost certainly over as they have little hope of receiving an at-large NCAA bid or an invitation to any other postseason tournament. ""The decision to not continue to play in the 2024 Mountain West Volleyball Championship tournament was not an easy one,” Boise State said in a statement. “Our team overcame forfeitures to earn a spot in the tournament field and fought for the win over Utah State in the first round on Wednesday. They should not have to forgo this opportunity while waiting for a more thoughtful and better system that serves all athletes."" As Boise State celebrated its victory over Utah State on Wednesday evening, it wasn't immediately clear that the Broncos' season was over. Boise State athletics media relations director Doug Link told Yahoo Sports and other outlets that the Broncos were undecided whether to play San Jose State or forfeit. He would not address if a decision would come down to a team vote or external factors. Boise State's subsequent decision to forfeit sends San Jose State to the Mountain West title game without even having to step on the court a single time. The Spartans received a bye to the semifinals by virtue of receiving a top-two seed in the six-team tournament. ""In this time of Thanksgiving, we are especially thankful for those who continue to engage in civil and respectful discourse,"" San Jose State said Thursday in a statement. ""We celebrate and support all of our students, including our student-athletes as they compete for our community on this holiday weekend. While we are disappointed in Boise State’s decision, our women’s volleyball team is preparing for Saturday’s match and looks forward to competing for a championship."" In late September, Boise State became the first Mountain West school to announce that it would not play San Jose State and that it would instead accept a forfeit. The decision set off a cascade of forfeits throughout the conference as Wyoming, Utah State and Nevada each followed suit. In each instance, the schools chose not to explain why they wouldn’t play San Jose State. In each instance, the announcements were followed by a social media post from a Republican state senator or governor praising the decision to protect women’s sports. Yahoo Sports is not naming the San Jose State volleyball player in question because neither she nor her university have publicly commented on her gender identity. San Jose State has said that all its women’s volleyball players are eligible to participate under NCAA and Mountain West Conference rules. The NCAA allows transgender women’s athletes to compete if they meet the eligibility criteria set by their sport’s individual governing body. For women’s volleyball, that means transgender women’s athletes must submit documentation of their testosterone levels for at least the previous year to prove they do not exceed the “normal female reference range for their age group.” Two weeks ago, Boise State sisters Kiersten and Katelyn Van Kirk and a handful of other current Mountain West players filed a lawsuit against the league seeking emergency injunctive relief. The lawsuit sought to ban the San Jose State player believed to be transgender, to strip the Spartans of six league wins obtained by forfeit and prevent the team from participating in the Mountain West tournament. On Monday, U.S. District Judge Kato Crews rejected the players’ request, arguing that the late timing placed “a heavy lift” on the Mountain West and that the “plaintiffs “could have sought injunctive relief much earlier.” That ruling was upheld Tuesday by an appeals court. Before it found itself at the center of the national firestorm surrounding transgender athletes, San Jose State women’s volleyball could not have been more obscure. This is a program that last won a conference title in 1985, last made the NCAA tournament in 2001 and that seldom draws more than a few hundred fans to home matches. The player believed to be transgender had already played at San Jose State prior to this year for two seasons without incident. She first made an all-conference team on Tuesday when she earned honorable mention all-Mountain West honors. Her presence first drew attention last April when Reduxx published a story alleging that a San Jose State women’s volleyball player was transgender and had withheld her biological sex from teammates and opponents. The self-described “pro-woman, pro-child” outlet said it had begun reporting the story after receiving a tip from the mother of an opposing player. In September, San Jose State setter Brooke Slusser joined a federal lawsuit challenging NCAA policy allowing transgender athletes to participate in women’s sports. Slusser roomed with the player in question after transferring from Alabama last fall but learned about her teammate’s alleged gender identity only after Reduxx outed her. In the legal filing, Slusser insisted that her allegedly transgender teammate strikes the ball with such power that it provides San Jose State “an unfair advantage” and poses a safety risk to other players during practices and games. Slusser claimed the player’s spikes in practice were traveling “faster than she had ever seen a woman hit a volleyball.” Those comments from Slusser tossed a lighted match on a pile of kindling. Local and national media outlets began covering the story, activist groups attacked San Jose State and right-wing politicians exerted their influence. San Jose State navigated the chaos, finishing second in the conference with six of the victories via forfeit. Slusser served as San Jose State’s primary setter all season. The allegedly transgender player started at outside hitter and led the Spartans in kills during Mountain West play. “No one could have imagined what we would go through together as a program over the past few months,” San Jose State coach Todd Kress told reporters last week. “It has been a roller coaster ride with some big ups and downs. “Through it all, these student-athletes have shown the grit and determination to stay together as a team, to stand together on the court and to play the game we all love while enduring an experience unique in the history of college sports,"" he continued. ""Some days I don’t know how we have done it. The pain, the conflict and the relentless negativity directed at this team in the media and the bleachers could have broken us but it didn’t. We kept playing and there may be no bigger achievement than that.” San Jose State players and coaches attended the Boise State-Utah State quarterfinal on Wednesday evening, scouting both teams in preparation to play the winner. Hours later came the late-night announcement from Boise State that it's pulling out of the tournament. Kress said his team finished the season playing some of its best volleyball. Now San Jose State will have to wait for the Mountain West title game for a chance to show it."

Further specifics on his injury are not yet known. Grill was fighting for a rebound in the lane during the contest at Mizzou Arena in Columbia, but he was awkwardly hit in the head at just the right angle that caused his neck to snap back hard as he was in the air.

He was responsive, talking the entire time when I was down there in the huddle with him. He even rolled out with his thumb up. So, that was a good sign to see in that respect."" Grill had two points and one steal in seven minutes when he went down with the injury. Grill, the team’s leading scorer, missed most of last season with a wrist injury. He’s averaging 15.5 points per game while shooting nearly 59% from the field and better than 55% from behind the arc. ""To my knowledge, he was responsive with us, leaving this arena with his thumbs up, rolling out,"" Gates said.

Shoot it up and tape it up. Fred Warner is playing.,"The San Francisco 49ers have dealt with plenty of injuries this season. Among those missing time have been running back Christian McCaffrey, receivers Brandon Aiyuk and Deebo Samuel, tight end George Kittle, offensive tackle Trent Williams, defensive end Nick Bosa and quarterback Brock Purdy. Linebacker Fred Warner apparently wants no part of joining those teammates on the sideline. The seven-year veteran revealed on Wednesday that he's been playing for the past seven games with a fractured bone in his ankle. Warner, 28, says he suffered the injury during Week 4's 30–13 win over the New England Patriots. The fracture occurred in the first half and Warner didn't play the rest of the game. But he's been in the lineup ever since and intends to play on Sunday night versus the Buffalo Bills. ""It's something I deal with every game,"" Warner told reporters, via ESPN's Nick Wagoner. ""I get on that table before every game and get it shot up every single game just to be able to roll. ""But it's not an excuse. It's just what it is. That's the NFL,"" he continued. ""You're not going to be healthy. You've got to go out there, you've got to find ways to execute, to play at a high level and to win every single week."" In addition to Warner playing in each game since suffering the injury, he's also participated in every practice for the past seven weeks. Only during Week 5, after he sustained the fracture, was he limited in practice. Here is Fred Warner confirming that he did indeed have a bone fracture in his ankle during their Week 4 game against the Patriots. #FTTB | #49ers pic.twitter.com/V3zMk4C0Cg — Matt Lively (@mattblively) November 27, 2024 What probably shouldn't be a surprise is that Warner still leads the 49ers with 84 tackles (50 solo) despite the fracture in his ankle. He's been San Francisco's leading tackler for each of the previous six seasons. Warner is well on his way to exceeding 100 tackles for the seventh consecutive year. Additionally, he has two interceptions, four forced fumbles and one sack. However, Warner's play has been affected by the injury. Of his 11 missed tackles, nine have occurred since hurting his ankle, according to the Associated Press. He's also allowed 31 catches on 31 targets. The three-time All-Pro later said he probably shouldn't have said anything about his ankle, but added that the fracture probably won't heal until after the season. ""Any time you fracture a bone, if you just continue to play on it, the bone is usually not going to be able to heal itself,"" he added. ""So, just got to continue to just fight through."""

The Timberwolves have dropped four straight and 7-of-9, and in that stretch they have the 25th-ranked offense in the league. The defense that propelled this team to near the top of the West is pedestrian this season (12th in the league). Anthony Edwards had a harsh assessment of what is wrong with the Timberwolves after they blew a 12-point lead midway through the fourth quarter to fall to a shorthanded Kings team on Wednesday night, with quotes from his rant via Chris Hine of The Minnesota Star Tribune and Jon Krawczynski of The Athletic. ""I don't like frontrunners. Myself, I'm not a frontrunner. I hate to have frontrunners or to think we have frontrunners on the team. I don't think we have any of those. It look like we was frontrunners tonight, 100%. ""We was down, nobody wanted to say nothing. We got up and everybody cheering. … We get down again and don't nobody say nothing. That's the definition of a frontrunner. We as a team, including myself, we all was frontrunners tonight.” ""It's like we're not even happy for each other out there,"" he said to Rudy Gobert as he walked out. ""I've never seen nothing like this in my life.""... ""We soft as hell as a team, internally,"" Edwards said. ""Not to the other team, but internally, we soft. We can't talk to each other. Just a bunch of little kids. Just like we playing with a bunch of little kids. Everybody, the whole team. We just can't talk to each other. And we've got to figure it out because we can't go down this road... ""However many of us it is, all 15, we go into our own shell and we're just growing away from each other,"" he said. ""It's obvious. We can see it. I can see it, the team can see it, the coaches can see it. The fans f****** booing us. That (stuff) is crazy, man."" Two things are very different from last season to this season in Minnesota — how much of them is due to the pre-season trade of Karl-Anthony Towns for Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo is up for debate. Although, it's certainly part of it. For example, DiVincenzo played 1% of his minutes at the point last season in New York, this season he's had to do it 66% of the time and that's not his natural fit or strength. It shows. The first thing that's different is what Edwards ranted about — an obvious lack of cohesion in the locker room that is carrying onto the court. Last season, all the word out of the Minnesota locker room was about how together they were, and nightly they would simply play harder than the team they were facing. That won them a lot of games. As Edwards laid bare, that is not the case this season. The second thing is defense. Last season that was this team's identity, the Timberwolves were the best defense in the NBA. This season they are 12th in the league (and a little worse, 15th in the league, over the last nine games). The team's defensive net rating was 3.7 points per 100 possessions better a season ago and could keep them in games — or win them games — for a night (or a quarter) when the offense struggled. Not this season. Neither of these issues are simple fixes."

Robinson was pulled over around 5:15 a.m. on Monday after officers said they saw him driving more than 100 miles per hour on a Los Angeles-area freeway. They then “observed objective signs and symptoms of alcohol impairment,” and he was arrested on suspicion of a DUI. He was cited and then released.

The 13-year veteran, who was first selected in the second round of the 2012 draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers, will join his ninth team in the league once his deal with the Kings is official. He averaged 6.2 points and 3.2 rebounds per game last season in Milwaukee. Crowder helped lead both the Miami Heat and the Phoenix Suns to the NBA Finals in back-to-back years, though he’s yet to win a championship. Crowder became a free agent this past offseason, and he worked out with the Kings over the summer, though he was unable to strike a deal to land with any team. The Kings are dealing with significant injuries, and have lost seven of their last 10 games entering Wednesday’s contest in Minnesota. Forward Trey Lyles is out for at least three weeks with a right calf strain, which he sustained in Monday’s loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. DeMar DeRozan will also miss Wednesday’s game with lower back muscle inflammation, though it’s unknown how long he’ll be sidelined. Third-year coach Mike Brown was fined $35,000 on Tuesday after he chased down an official in their loss to the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday, too. Though it’s unclear what his role will be with the franchise just yet, Crowder should be able to provide some much-needed depth in the frontcourt behind Keegan Murray and Domantas Sabonis at least in the near future. We’ll see if he’s the missing piece to lift the Kings out of their slump."

The former New York Giants quarterback is expected to sign with the Minnesota Vikings, head coach Kevin O'Connell announced on Wednesday. The move came shortly after Jones requested his release from the Giants after losing his starting job earlier this month. According to ESPN, the Vikings will pay him $375,000 for the rest of the season while the Giants will pay him $11.8 million. ""Good addition to our quarterback room,"" O'Connell said of Jones. ""I've always been a fan. Love, really like the person, the human being, the makeup. And then the player Daniel Jones, I think there's so much out in front of him that are going to be really good things that we get to personally be a part of. I can't wait to work with him."" Jones, who is expected to arrive in Minnesota on Friday, plans to sign with Vikings' practice squad, which would give him the opportunity to work with a non-Giants NFL coaching staff for the first time in his career. And considering starting QB Sam Darnold's impressive turnaround with the Vikings this season, there may not be a better place for a struggling quarterback to land. ""The player development side and the quarterback development side is something that is a huge passion of mine,"" O'Connell said. ""I just love getting opportunities to work with guys, no matter what point in their quarterback journey they're at. ... Really, our system is built to hopefully try to help guys realize their truest potential."" Jones got his start in the league with the Giants, who selected him with the No. 6 overall draft pick in 2019 out of Duke as the eventual replacement for Eli Manning. While he was the team’s starter consistently over the past six seasons, he struggled to find much success — especially recently, which was made only worse after the team signed him to a four-year, $160 million contract in March 2023. That led to the departure of running back Saquon Barkley, who is now in the midst of a career season with the Philadelphia Eagles. After a very solid campaign in 2022 — when Jones led the team to a 9-7-1 record and to the playoffs — his play has largely gone downhill ever since. Jones threw for 2,070 yards with eight touchdowns and seven interceptions this season. He led the Giants to five straight losses before the team benched him in favor of third-string quarterback Tommy DeVito ahead of its loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday. That dropped Jones to the team’s third-string quarterback, behind backup Drew Lock, and sent him to the scout team. He read a long statement that sounded like a goodbye to the organization days later, and then he asked to be released on Friday. The team quickly granted that request. Jones went 22-44-1 over six seasons as a starter and had one winning season. ""There have been some great times, but of course we all wish there had been more of those,"" Jones said in a statement before his release. ""I take full responsibility for my part in not bringing more wins. No one wanted to win more games worse than me and I gave everything I had on the field and in my preparation."" Landing with the Vikings could lead to something bigger for Jones if he's able to learn and grow. Darnold's contract with the Vikings is for one year, which means the only QB they have signed for 2025 is J.J. McCarthy, their 2024 first-round pick who is recovering from a torn meniscus. If Jones impresses the coaches, it's possible he could play himself into a job in Minnesota. And if he impresses other NFL teams, he could be high on the list of replacements if another starting QB misses time this season. It’s unclear what will happen with Jones after this season, or if he will be able to work his way back into a starting role in the league. But with the way his career was going with the Giants, who have some very clear issues of their own to work through that go beyond struggles at quarterback, a departure from the franchise felt inevitable. Now Jones gets a chance to restart somewhere else."

For as cold as it'll feel in Green Bay Thursday, the 8-3 Packers head into Thanksgiving night as one of the league's hottest teams, having won six of their last seven games. The only loss in that span was to the Lions, who have staked their claim as the league's best team. Not bad for the Packers, who've dealt with injuries to starting quarterback Jordan Love in his second year at the helm after the Aaron Rodgers show moved to New York. The Dolphins, meanwhile, have also been on a run — one that's coincided with the return of QB Tua Tagovailoa. Miami is 4-3 in games he's started this season and has won three straight, with the offense looking like it did last season as he's gotten settled back in. Tagovailoa has thrown for 605 yards and seven touchdowns with no interceptions over the Dolphins' last two games, and he'll need to be sharp again if the 5-6 Dolphins want to stay connected in the the AFC wild-card picture. As for the weather, temperatures will be in the upper 20s at kickoff and throughout the night. With winds around 15 miles per hour and gusts nearing 25 miles per hour, the feels-like temps will be in the mid-teens.

Luke Schoonmaker, Nick Westbrook-Ikhine and Roschon Johnson had touchdowns and Will Dissly was solid, as usual. We like that. But Quentin Johnston toasted a bagel on Monday (so many soul-crushing drops) and there were some other bricks. Here's hoping you don't need a lot of sleepers in your Week 13 lineups. All 32 NFL clubs are in action this week and you are probably jostling for playoff position. The stakes are rising. But if injuries or underperformance have bitten you, perhaps some of these names can help out. At this stage of the game, we know what Edwards is — a two-down pounder who offers almost nothing in the pass game. However, he's going to be the first look at the goal line with J.K. Dobbins (knee) set to miss time, and the Falcons present a rushing defense that's slightly below average in most metrics. Edwards probably needs a touchdown to pay off his projection, but I'd give him a better than 50% chance to get that score here. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Here's another back who's shown nothing in the pass game (just two receptions), but McNichols has been efficient when asked to carry the ball (in a mild surprise, his success rate is actually slightly higher than Brian Robinson Jr. and Austin Ekeler). You'll have to do your injury diligence with Washington this week, with Robinson dealing with an ankle injury and Ekeler in the concussion protocol. If both of them can't go, McNichols is in play against an average Tennessee rushing defense. Here's your Black Friday special, a pass-catching specialist who might see a favorable game script against the heavily favored Chiefs (assuming Alexander Mattison and Zamir White are unavailable again). Abdullah's rushing skills are modest, but he's posted a useful 8-53-2 role in the passing game the last two weeks. Let Kansas City build a lead and watch Abdullah peck away with those receptions, especially fun if your league has any PPR component in the scoring. Bo Nix isn't the only rookie winner in Denver; Vele's role continues to expand and he's been impressive. Vele is coming off his busiest and most productive game of the year (6-80-0, nine targets) and the Monday draw is favorable, up against a Cleveland secondary that's allowed the fifth-most points to opposing wide receivers. Boundary specialist Courtland Sutton is the undeniable alpha in the Denver passing game, but Vele will probably see a target share of 20% or higher in this spot. One of the biggest fantasy stories from Week 12 was the emergence of Bryce Young, who looked poised and in control against the intimidating Kansas City defense. Young wasn't fazed by the blitz packages and made several on-target throws despite challenging pressure. It appears the Panthers knew what they were doing when they gave Young a temporary benching; he's looked like a different player since the return. This means we can start attacking the Carolina receiver room with some level of confidence. Thielen's resume probably makes him the more comfortable sleeper play, off a solid 3-57-0 line in his return from injury, but we also have to note Moore saw heavy usage in the Kansas City game (6-81-1) and drew a team-best 10 targets. The Buccaneers play a lot of shootouts, with a capable offense and a leaky secondary. Perhaps the Panthers can uphold their end of the bargain. Some fantasy managers didn't want to hold MVS through the bye week and I get it, given his history of inconsistent performance. And even in two smash games, they've come with limited volume — just seven targets led to his 5-196-3 line the past two games. The hope is that Valdez-Scantling will make one big play to justify your faith, and at least there's little downfield competition in this offense. The Rams secondary has been a plus matchup for most of 2024. It's becoming a cut-and-paste case with NWI, a low-target player who somehow has scored in 6-of-7 games. NWI is seeing snap shares over 90% each week in the aftermath of the DeAndre Hopkins trade, making him the second-most important target in his offense. I'm not afraid to dial him up against an average Washington defense; the Commanders are heavy favorites, which could push Tennessee into a more proactive passing game. I'm surprised his roster tag has remained so low, after Schoonmaker gave us 6-56-0 and 3-55-1 in consecutive weeks. Cooper Rush has been a competent quarterback in both games, and the Cowboys won't have Jake Ferguson (concussion) on Thanksgiving. There's a good chance Schoonmaker will be the second read in the Dallas offense — the guy to look for when CeeDee Lamb isn't open. New York's tight end coverage has been strong this year, although it hasn't faced a difficult schedule. Ferguson did get them for seven catches back in Week 4."

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",What can the Detroit Tigers do this winter to build on their surprise postseason run?,https://sports.yahoo.com/what-can-the-detroit-tigers-do-this-winter-to-build-on-their-surprise-postseason-run-221110803.html,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 22:11:10 GMT","After a successful 2024, the Tigers are in prime position to strengthen their roster with a few key free-agent additions.","It appears that the Detroit Tigers have finally emerged from the ashes of their long and grueling rebuild — and not a moment too soon. Detroit was baseball’s biggest surprise this past season, as the team went from being a seller at July’s trade deadline to knocking off perennial World Series contender Houston in the postseason. Despite a flawed roster with various holes, thanks to the combination of gritty players, some good fortune and a manager in AJ Hinch who kept everything together, the Tigers found a way to become 2024’s Cinderella team. And now, this offseason provides Detroit a unique opportunity to build off their success and get back to being a powerhouse in the AL Central. Detroit has quietly developed a handful of talented players at the big-league level, including Riley Greene and Kerry Carpenter. Greene is a budding star who earned his first All-Star appearance this past season and is a staple in the middle of Detroit’s lineup. Carpenter has become one of the better left-handed bats in the American League, and while he spent time in '24 on the injured list, he posted an impressive .932 OPS with 18 homers and looked very comfortable hitting in the postseason. The crown jewel of the Tigers’ turnaround is none other than 2024 AL Cy Young Award winner Tarik Skubal. He has been one of the best pitchers in baseball since his return from left flexor tendon surgery in late 2023. His performance skyrocketed last season as he turned himself into arguably the best starter in MLB. While many wondered during his phenomenal season if the Tigers would trade Skubal, the decision to not move the young star was arguably the biggest turning point of Detroit’s season. And as Skubal continued to dominate in the season’s second half, Detroit continued to win. Coming off their surprise success in '24, the Tigers still have a young and inexperienced roster. The team’s moves this winter should be focused on raising their ceiling while supporting the core pieces on the current roster so they can take the next jump. From an offensive standpoint, the Tigers were one of the more left-handed lineups in baseball last season. They would benefit tremendously from adding a right-handed bat or two. One of the most intriguing options available is third baseman Alex Bregman. He would bring a boatload of veteran and postseason experience to a young team on the rise and fill a big hole at third. Not to mention, this pairing would give him the opportunity to play for his former manager in Hinch. The other question for Detroit to answer on offense is what will the Tigers do with Javier Báez and Spencer Torkelson? Báez has been a disaster in Detroit and missed most of the second half of 2024 due to a hip injury. Detroit acquired rookie shortstop Trey Sweeney in the July trade that sent Jack Flaherty to the Dodgers, and now Sweeney needs a place to play. Báez will have to at least show that he can hit against left-handers if he hopes to see time consistently next season. As for Torkelson, he has not lived up to the hype that accompanied him when he was the No. 1 pick in the 2020 MLB Draft. His inability to hit consistently at the big-league level has been a speed bump in the Tigers’ rebuild. While Torkelson will likely get one more opportunity to show he belongs in the big leagues, there are possible upgrades on the market. Free agent Christian Walker would provide Detroit with some serious thump and elite defense at first. If the Tigers aren’t looking to spend at that level, someone such as Carlos Santana could provide similar traits for much less. Detroit could also use a few veteran arms to add to its rotation behind Skubal. Detroit's rotation, or lack thereof, was one of the main reasons its season came to an end in the ALDS. The Tigers didn’t have enough starting pitching for a full postseason series and were forced to go with openers and bullpen games. The Tigers would particularly benefit from some experience to go with their relatively young rotation. Starters such as Walker Buehler and Sean Manaea could be the type of experienced arms that would fit the Tigers’ needs. The AL Central surprised the entire sport this year, with three teams reaching the postseason in the Tigers, Royals and Guardians. All three advanced at least one round. Going forward, the advantage the Tigers have over the other teams in the division is their ability to spend. Their payroll for 2024 was $98.5 million, and they have a projected payroll of just $79 million for 2025, which would rank 27th in the league, according to Spotrac. Historically, the Tigers have never been afraid to flex financial might in free agency or make a big splash in the trade market. And outside of Báez, who is owed $73 million over the next three years, the Tigers don't have huge financial commitments, and most of their roster is still pre-arbitration. With the retired Miguel Cabrera’s massive contract finally off the books, Detroit has the kind of financial flexibility the organization hasn’t enjoyed in more than a decade. In his two years with the Tigers, president of baseball operations Scott Harris has been methodical in his approach to building the roster. But after Detroit’s standout 2024 with a team that had some holes, a few key additions this winter could give the Tigers a strong chance to make back-to-back postseasons for the first time since 2013-14."

But they're still in position to qualify for the knockout rounds because of a format their president despises.","Real Madrid lost at Liverpool on Wednesday, and in a previous era, that might have been that. Three Champions League defeats in five tries were, once upon a time, crippling. Losses to Lille and AC Milan would have endangered any European campaign. A third, 2-0 at Anfield, might have ended it. Real Madrid, though, are very much alive in the 2024-25 competition precisely because of the new Champions League format their president detests. ""[The] new model will have more games and less interest. It's an absurd competition,"" Florentino Pérez said last November. Now, it's the only reason his club are still title contenders. Los Blancos stumbled yet again Wednesday, on a boisterous evening in northwest England. They caved to Liverpool pressure early in the second half. Their only shot on target prior to stoppage time was their best chance to equalize — a penalty that Kylian Mbappé failed to convert. Their obvious excuse is injuries. They've been debilitated by a growing list of absentees that now includes Aurélien Tchouaméni, Rodrygo, three key defenders and Vinícius Júnior. But the stars that remain have been dim. Mbappé was dreadful Wednesday. On early matchdays, the entire team looked disjointed, disinterested or both. And the results have been grim. They needed late rallies to beat Stuttgart and Borussia Dortmund. They fell in France, then at home to struggling AC Milan. For decades, such a start to the Champions League would have put their progression to the knockout stage squarely in the balance. The old format — 32 teams, eight groups of four, top two in each group advance — was stale but relatively unforgiving. It granted some leeway; and as inequality within European soccer deepened, giants rarely fell. But when they floundered repeatedly, like Manchester United in 2020 and 2023, they'd perish. In response to pressure from superclubs such as Real Madrid, however, UEFA expanded and overhauled the format. Now there is a ""league phase,"" from which 24 (out of 36) teams will progress. Through five rounds, with three remaining, Real sits squarely on the bubble of the 24, on six points, in 24th place. In other words, the Galacticos, the preseason favorites, have been subpar; but as things stand, they'd still go through to the first knockout round. They'd still be favored, no matter their opponent, to win and advance to the Round of 16, as they have for 27 consecutive seasons. And their savior would be the new Champions League structure that Pérez thinks is ""absurd."" He says that because he is the leading proponent of a European Super League. He was the architect of the project that failed in 2021. He was the most powerful force behind attempts to revive the Super League last December. ""The Super League is more necessary than ever,"" he said last year. So he hated the compromise, UEFA's new Champions League format, which created more giant-vs.-giant matchups in the league phase, but watered down the competition. He reiterated his criticism this past Sunday. “The new Champions League format has proved not to be a solution, as we predicted,"" Pérez said in a long speech at Real Madrid's annual general meeting. ""It has increased the number of matches but reduced the value of each match. The competition will only arouse the passion of the fans at the end and not at the beginning, as expected.” And then, three days later, his floundering team aroused the passion of fans by losing again. Real Madrid has been so bad that, suddenly, their league phase matches have actually become meaningful. Next up is a trip to Atalanta on Matchday 6 (Dec. 10). A defeat there, in Bergamo, Italy, would leave Los Blancos on the outside looking in at the knockouts. But still, even then, wins in their final two games — against Salzburg and Brest — would almost certainly be sufficient. Pérez, in many ways, is right — the new format has devalued these early round games, by making losses relatively inconsequential. It is far too merciful. And in the most ironic of twists, it is his club, the defending champions, the kings of Europe, Real Madrid, who will probably benefit."

Fantasy football analyst Chris Allen breaks 'em down.,"I’d wager my days of watching football (slightly) differ from yours. First off, I’ll admit it: I tinker with my lineup until rosters lock. I’ll recheck defensive matchups, weather conditions (my specialty) and weigh my alternatives. And, yes, seeing players with higher projections on my bench still makes me nervous. Again, I’m not perfect. Maybe (likely) they know something I don’t. Regardless, after kickoff, it’s like I’m back in school. I take notes, bookmark informative tweets to reference later and pull data as the games unfold. Fourth-quarter shenanigans disrupt my flow (thanks, Dallas and Washington), but I’ll have a good sense of what’s happened shortly after the games to distill it down for you all. However, this week will be a little different. The top storyline for this week is the Thanksgiving slate. However, the short practice schedule injects some uncertainty. We’ve got injuries stemming from Sunday and divisional games that add an extra layer of chaos. Finding ways to tease out fantasy nuggets becomes a bit tougher. And like most of you on Thursday, I’ll be fighting a tryptophan coma while waiting to see if my ill-formed multi-leg parlay hits. Anyway, even with all the excitement in store, I’ve got a couple of narratives from each game I’ll be monitoring. The Bears’ rookie finally gave the franchise something we hadn’t seen since Week 6. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a game-winning drive. All the same, at this point in the season, hope is just as valuable. Caleb Williams beats the free runner and drops one in while on the run pic.twitter.com/xAciqGC71l — Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) November 24, 2024 The highlights show Williams making multiple “this is why” throws. His 40-yard dart over two defenders to Keenan Allen is (part of) why Chicago drafted him. With the game on the line, the Bears needed a QB who could quickly move them into scoring position. Once more, Williams’ arm talent highlights why they took him. And the data backs up the clips: Air Yards per Attempt: 7.8 (Weeks 9-10), 6.9 (Weeks 11-12) EPA per Dropback (When Pressured): -0.62, -0.08 Scramble Rate: 5.5%, 10.8% In the two weeks before the offense was de-Waldron-ized, I noted the conflict the offense put Williams in between his high pressure rate and the receiver’s route depths. Against the Packers and Vikings, the former Trojan used his legs to limit negative plays and averaged nearly a full yard less per attempt. For reference, through just Weeks 9 and 10, Williams ranked 29th in EPA per dropback if under duress. He’s in the top 12 after the OC switch. Williams’ decisiveness has been a boon for his receivers. He’s getting the ball out faster (3.01-sec average time to throw to 2.39) and at shorter distances, allowing his receivers to work after the catch. DJ Moore found the end zone for the first time in almost two months. Rome Odunze is getting in sync with his QB. But of the Bears’ WRs I’m looking to for on Thursday, the old vet has my eye: Week 10: 25.0% (Target Share), 25.0% (Air Yard Share) Week 11: 26.0%, 32.0% Week 12: 35.0%, 41.0% Keenan Allen’s targets and air yards have been on the rise over the last three weeks. On the flip side, Lions’ slot CB Amik Robertson has allowed top-10 marks in receptions and yards to interior receivers since Week 9. Detroit is already dealing with injuries in their secondary. With Williams and the offense on the rise, Detroit’s offense may need another 40-point outing to keep the offense on a roll. And their backfield gives them their best shot. David Montgomery & Jahmyr Gibbs have each scored a rush TD in the same game for the 9th time.That's tied for the 3rd most by teammates in NFL history. 🔥@Lions | @FedEx pic.twitter.com/QwIxTTt0Uk — NFL (@NFL) November 24, 2024 It’s the arrogance of the offense (complimentary) that makes the Lions America’s team for me. They’re 27th in early-down passing rate. Defenses know what’s coming in long-down-and-distance situations. We know. And yet, Sonic and Knuckles have combined for the second-highest rushing success rate (51.7%). Oh, you don’t care about down-to-down efficiency? They’re also top-three in explosive gains on the ground. David Montgomery’s desire to face his former team may override any injury concerns after a nasty blow to the shoulder on Sunday. But a limited rushing attack is in play. In either case, relying on Jared Goff to keep the offense afloat isn’t a bad plan, either. Explosive Pass Rate: 18.3% (2nd) EPA per Dropback: 0.24 (3rd-highest among active starters) Third-Down Conversion Rate: 40.0% (9th) Five-interception game aside, Goff has been more than a passenger prince in the offense. After seasons of buckling under pressure, the Lions’ QB sits at 13th in EPA per dropback when the pocket has collapsed. However, Detroit’s injury bug has infected more than their ground game. Amon-Ra St. Brown’s knee took the brunt of a tackle after the Sun God took over as the punt returner. Kalif Raymond had to exit Sunday’s game with a foot injury and now heads to IR. Luckily, the Lions have some depth at the position. Jared Goff. More than a pocket passer in 2024.The #Lions QB buys some time with his legs and connects with Tim Patrick for a nice gain.pic.twitter.com/qfmg2NMDSC — Hobie Artigue (@HeyItsMeHobie) November 24, 2024 Tim Patrick has popped up for four targets in back-to-back games. In Week 12 alone, three of his catches went for first downs. Surprisingly, the former Broncos receiver is second amongst Lions WRs in target rate from the slot over the last two weeks. Both Patrick and St. Brown have the same number of looks when Goff has had to create out of structure. With Raymond likely sidelined, Patrick’s routes and opportunities will be one of the underrated topics for the Thanksgiving opener. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. We can look past a lot of things as long as it’s entertaining. Tommy DeVito's story from last year is a perfect example. From living with his mom to his agent’s attire, ""Tommy Cutlets"" was a sensation. Of course, three straight wins helped, but the spectacle was a breath of fresh air. With all the fanfare, it was hard to see DeVito for what he was (a backup QB). But there were signs. EPA per play: 27th (out of 32 qualifiers) Passing Success Rate: 30th Completion Percentage over Expected: 18th Shockingly, after getting yanked for Tyrod Taylor in ’23 and serving as the backup until last Sunday, DeVito hasn’t improved. The offense cratered. His 43.6% pressure rate was the fourth-highest of either NYG QB this season, and his sacks don't get any easier to rewatch. Malik Naber's comments in the aftermath of their 30-7 loss to Tampa didn’t help either. But, despite the bad vibes, there’s a path for fantasy managers to get some value out of the offense. Credit where it’s due, HC Brian Daboll had the right plan for DeVito. Keep things short. Get the ball out quickly. Of DeVito’s 31 attempts, 64.5% were either to the short area of the field or behind the line of scrimmage. His average time to throw when not pressured was 2.23 seconds. Plus, even with the lack of looks until late in the game, there was a plan to keep Nabers involved. We’re used to seeing the Giants’ WR1 all over the place. But his aDOT was down over a full yard from his season-long average. Over half of his routes were in-breaking routes (e.g., crossers, slants), enabling more yards after the catch. Dallas is fourth in blitz rate. On the surface, Drew Lock starting in place of the injured DeVito looks like a stylistic change. But, looking at his time in Seattle, it also fits what Daboll wants from his QBs. (2023, Weeks 14-15) Average Time to Throw: 2.44 Passing aDOT: 7.5 Scramble Rate: 4.1% Seattle had a similar game plan for Lock when Geno Smith had to sit. Over 60.0% of his attempts were less than 10 air yards. Tyler Lockett and Jaxon Smith-Njigba combined for over 40.0% of Lock's attempts. JSN's route trees have looked similar to Nabers', lending credence to the idea that Lock can lock (pun intended) onto his WR1. But with Lock's (relatively) quicker processing speed, Nabers can get involved in the game earlier rather than once the Giants are trailing in the game. On the other side of this game, I’m skeptical of Cooper Rush’s performance. Yes, he threw twice as many TDs as the week prior. Nevertheless, there’s a stark difference in his game environment from Week 11 to Week 12. Number of Pressures: 16 (Week 11), 4 (Week 12) Blitz Rate: 8.2%, 23.5% The Commanders threw more defenders at him than the Texans but could only muster a quarter of the pressures. Meanwhile, with fewer bodies in the secondary, Rush had more room to operate. Per NextGenStats, CeeDee Lamb’s average yards of separation jumped up nearly a yard between the two games. Sunday was also a game the Cowboys largely controlled (until Jayden Daniels tried to cook up some magic at the end). To be fair, New York's loss of OLB Azeez Ojulari (second-most sacks on the defense) may render my pessimism moot. Rush’s passing success rate climbed by nearly 20 points in Week 12. Lamb hoarded 37.5% of the attempts. Other than who wound up with the ball in the end zone, all went as planned. But one of the unsung heroes on the offense from Sunday was Rico Dowdle. Dallas Cowboys RB Rico Dowdle had 19 carries during Sunday's win over the Washington Commanders.It was only the second game this season where a running back has had 19 carries for the team. The other was Rico at Pittsburgh.It was only the 10th game of such kind since 2022.… pic.twitter.com/JnzdRYLBUo — RJ Ochoa (@rjochoa) November 25, 2024 Admittedly Dowdle fumbled early in the Week 12 game. But he still handled 70.0% of the team’s carries and earned a 10.0% target share. And it’s not just the volume that should make him appealing to fantasy managers. Dowdle has taken over 50.0% of the totes over the last four games. Over that span, he has top-10 marks in rushing success rate and adjusted yards after contact per attempt. With the Giants ranking as a top-10 unit in fantasy points allowed to RBs, Dowdle’s usage and situation should make him a popular option for gamers on Thursday. As Miami makes its way up north in the later part of the year, the elements come into our calculus when evaluating its play. The “warm-weather team in the cold” narrative becomes a talking point. And it’d remain a lesser topic if we didn’t see the Dolphins flounder in lower temperatures about 10 months ago. This is a pistol play that featured motion and shows that Tua could indeed throw the rock hard frozen ball downfield. Was one of the few times Chiefs weren’t in quarters D. pic.twitter.com/yM3ACHFDy3 — Omar Kelly (@OmarKelly) January 19, 2024 Let’s set aside the fact that Tyreek Hill was still dealing with an ankle injury suffered the previous month. Or that Tua had just thrown for less than 200 yards the week before against another tough defensive opponent in the Bills. Honestly, it was probably just a coincidence opposing passers were averaging 199.5 passing yards against the Chiefs over their six games leading up to the playoff matchup. We should also disregard the negative-four-degree temp at kickoff. The cold is what short-circuited Miami’s offense. To be clear, I’m kidding. However, the sub-30-degree scene at Lambeau Field will give off similar vibes. Most will expect Tagovailoa to take a step back. But, if anything, Tagovailoa’s evolution as a passer puts him in a position to excel in the poor conditions. In '22 and '23, Tua was throwing downfield and creating explosives on a weekly basis. His 10.1 and 8.1 passing aDOTs were well above the league average. But, since coming back from injury, he’s at just 5.2 air yards per attempt. And Tua has more than his WRs to keep the offense moving. Jonnu Smith’s 5.3-yard aDOT fits Tagovailoa’s current style of play. Plus, with Smith’s route-running skills, the drop in passing depth hasn’t equated to a loss in overall efficiency. Yards per Route Run (since Tua’s return): 2.18 (3rd amongst TEs – min. 10.0% target share) First Downs per Target: 0.54 (5th) YAC per Reception: 8.1 (5th) But, even with Smith and De’Von Achane emerging as consistent receiving options, the fantasy community will have their eyes on Jaylen Waddle. After his 144-yard outing in Week 12, the fourth-year WR has more 100-plus-yard games this season than Tyreek Hill. But after nine games of less than 60 yards, it’d be fair to look at last Sunday as a fluke. I’m not so sure. (Week 12) Slot Snap Rate: 30.0% (season-high) Air Yard Share: 45.4% (team lead) (Hill) Slot Target Rate: 0.0% (season-low) Seeing Hill or Waddle leading the team in air yards isn’t a surprise. But Waddle’s alignment from the interior and his displacement of Hill on the inside was a significant shift. The change left Hill facing the Patriots’ top corner instead of using Waddle as the sacrificial X-receiver. Packers CB Jaire Alexander is out for Week 13, which helps, but moving Waddle into an even more advantageous defensive matchups puts him back in play for fantasy managers fighting for a playoff spot. Besides, Miami will need to do all it can to keep up with Green Bay’s offense anyway. Josh Jacobs hat trick! 🎩 🎩 🎩📺: #SFvsGB on FOX📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/eP1rFbnUj6 — NFL (@NFL) November 25, 2024 Josh Jacobs has touched the ball 48 times in the last two games. Much to the delight of his fantasy managers, HC Matt LaFleur’s run-heavy approach since coming out their bye (-11.0% dropback over expectation rate) has vaulted Jacobs to consecutive top-five finishes. But Miami presents a challenge for the former Raider. The Dolphins are a top-10 defensive unit in rushing EPA and success rate allowed. Put another way, they’ve yet to give up a 100-yard game to an opposing rusher. Jacobs has scored over 20.0 PPR points in two straight weeks. Just two rushers have topped that mark against Miami all season (James Cook and Zach Charbonnet). The environment calls for more passing, but finding the right Packers’ pass-catcher to roster has been a season-long challenge. I’ll give you two. Love to Kraft to start things off!#SFvsGB pic.twitter.com/29GZwc7mau — Green Bay Packers (@packers) November 24, 2024 Even with the limited pass volume, Tucker Kraft still finds a way to get into the end zone. Since Jordan Love’s return to the lineup, Kraft has just two fewer targets than Romeo Doubs (out for Week 13) and leads the team in red-zone targets (11). Also, the Dolphins may be without two of their LBs, freeing up space in the middle of the secondary for Kraft. Miami’s given up the 13th-most fantasy points to the TE position, making Kraft an ideal option when Love takes to the air. Along with Kraft, Dontayvion Wicks should be a productive pass-catcher, too. We did “Dontayvion Wicks Day” back in Week 5 when Doubs was inactive. Our prize was a whopping 1.9 PPR points after multiple drops from everyone’s favorite sleeper WR. However, Jayden Reed’s target share hasn’t been above 20.0% since Week 6. Plus, in that Week 5 contest, Reed played none of the snaps when the team had two TEs on the field. It was Malik Heath and Wicks. Christian Watson will likely see Jalen Ramsey giving Wicks some space to operate. Wicks earned a 25.0% share the last time he was a larger part of the rotation. In what should be a back-and-forth environment, he’ll have the chance to come through for fantasy managers on Thanksgiving."

The team was on its way to an 0-16 season, the first in NFL history at the time. High above in a nearby jail sat the city’s former mayor, convicted on two counts of obstruction of justice (he’d later serve federal time as well). A nearby casino had just filed for bankruptcy and the city government would soon follow. General Motors, headquartered down the block, recently received a $13 billion emergency loan from the government to stay afloat. As the tailgaters were wrapping up turkey, dressing and desserts to head inside, a downtrodden man came by, in need of some food. They fixed him a plate. He took a few bites, but didn’t seem too impressed before noting to Alessandri, “It’s kind of dry, isn’t it?” The tailgaters could only laugh at the chutzpah. Welcome to Thanksgiving in Detroit. For years, America groaned that the early game on the national holiday was populated by the lowly Lions. The franchise invented the concept in 1934 — trying to capture crowds of downtown parade goers to check out the team. They remained because television networks determined that it didn’t matter, ratings wise, who played on Thanksgiving. A captured audience was going to watch, so why waste a good game on the time slot? Yet the Lions — other than a few seasons of Barry Sanders brilliance — were the team no one wanted to see. There was a 66-year stretch when they won just a single playoff game. Six or seven wins were often considered a good season. Former QB Joey Harrington was a former first-round draft pick who never played for a winning team in Detroit, but once called his time there the franchise’s “hey-days.” He wasn’t all wrong. Thanksgiving was often Detroit’s only national television appearance, going 37-45-2 all time on the holiday. The Lions are just 4-16 the past two decades and on a current seven-game losing streak. It’s a new day, though. The city and area around Ford Field are far more developed than in the past — luxury high rises, and packed restaurants and bars. And the Lions, too, are much better — not just 10-1 and a Super Bowl betting favorite coming off an NFC championship game appearance, but with a dynamic offense and one of the most exciting teams in the league. No one, perhaps oddly or perhaps appropriately, represents the mood around the team and the city quite like a blond-haired 30-year-old from Marin County, California, who came here against his will. Jared Goff is his name and you’ll hear it chanted all over not just Ford Field or Detroit itself or even the state of Michigan, but anywhere anyone who once lived in those places now resides. “JAR-ed Goff! JAR-ed Goff!” isn’t just a salute to the starting quarterback, but a battle cry for a discarded city and fan base, a can-you-believe-it bit of bravado. You’ll hear it at Lions road games, of course, where Honolulu-clad fans have begun to overwhelm the stands, but also Detroit Red Wings or Detroit Tigers games across the continent. Or at destination weddings full of Michiganders. Or among passing fans in a far off bar, airport or store. It’s not “Let’s go, Lions.” It’s not, “Here we go, Detroit.” It’s “JAR-ed Goff.” Let 'em hear you all the way back home 📣 #OnePride pic.twitter.com/y5sUnE3TXE — Detroit Lions (@Lions) November 24, 2024 It’s a chant that emerged last January when the Lions hosted (and won) their first playoff game since the 1991 season. The pregame Ford Field crowd wanted to acknowledge their current QB over their former one, Matthew Stafford of the Los Angeles Rams. Stafford was a hero here too, but he was shipped off for a slew of draft picks in the Lions' latest rebuilding effort. Goff, the former No. 1 overall draft pick, was tossed in in return as an almost valueless add-on. He had his moments with the Rams, but had become an interception machine the team didn’t believe could win a Super Bowl. Then he became the catalyst for this wild, victory-filled ride in Detroit, the perfect symbol for everything. The fans that day last January wanted Goff to know they believed in him. “The people here are special, man,” Goff said after that playoff victory that led to a run to the NFC championship game. “I’m grateful. It meant a lot. I love these guys.” Once discarded and beaten down, Goff is now soaring and making the rest of the country believe in his team, which just happens to represent a city long discarded and beaten down that desperately wants the rest of the country to believe in it as well. Rather than regress or give up when he arrived in Detroit, Goff found a second life among kindred spirits. Rather than push back at leaving sunny, glamorous Los Angeles for the industrial Midwest, he found a home. He’s better than ever, a legit MVP candidate this season. This, it bears repeating, is one of the great stories in the NFL. “To see us come from where we were, to see us where we are, and the fans have experienced that,” Goff said. “This place is special to me. Like I said, these people are special.” And so the Lions will be back on everyone’s television this Thanksgiving — 12:30 p.m. ET per usual — hosting Chicago. Only this time they will be 9.5-point favorites. Only this time the hope will not center on avoiding embarrassment. Only this time, America will happily tune in because everything has changed. “JAR-ed Goff,” they will no doubt chant — the unlikely centerpiece of this unlikely renaissance, a long way from the desperate and hungry critiquing a free slice of turkey in a parking lot outside the home of a winless team in a broke and broken city."

Then the head coach of the 49ers, Harbaugh wanted to see if Manning had made a full recovery from his injury. “But they didn’t want to tell anybody they were pursuing me,” Manning said. “So, Harbaugh watched the whole workout from his car in a Bill Belichick hoodie. I was out there throwing, and he’d say, ‘I want to see you come back to the left. I want to see you throw on the run.’ “The reason he didn’t want to be seen is he wasn’t sure if [ESPN NFL insider Adam] Schefter was going to be hiding in the trees, which he easily could have been ... “I had a great workout. We played burnout after the workout and Jim wanted me to see how well he still threw the ball, but that was back in 2012 at Duke University. He was in the hoodie, he looked like Belichick.” While Harbaugh successfully resurrected Alex Smith’s career after arriving in San Francisco in 2011, the coach was open to the idea of replacing him with a more dynamic quarterback. Manning eventually signed with the Denver Broncos, however, and Colin Kaepernick ultimately took over for the 49ers under center and led them to Super Bowl XLVII. Given how close San Francisco came to winning that Super Bowl, it’s enough to wonder what could have been if Manning had decided to sign with the 49ers. While with Denver, the legendary signal-caller won his fifth NFL MVP award and Super Bowl 50, so he still had plenty left in the tank. Download and follow the 49ers Talk Podcast"

Previous mock drafts: 1.0 It’s hard to deny that Hunter is the best player in this draft class with his combination of athleticism, ability to play both sides at a high level and overall love for the game. Hunter is more polished as a cornerback right now, with legitimate shutdown ability on one side of the field. He’s raw in some of the more finer parts of wide receiver play, but that’s exciting because he’s already an incredible playmaker in that area of the field. For a team like the Jaguars that need talent on both sides of the ball, Hunter makes sense. — Charles McDonald Even before Daniel Jones' benching and release, the Giants were going to be doing homework on QBs.

But Ward has rapidly improved every year in college and would bring excitement to the position for a team long needing a spark at the spot. — Nate Tice The Raiders are desperately in need of a franchise quarterback and while they might have to squint a bit to find one in this class, Sanders at least has a chance to be that guy. What he lacks in overall physical talent he makes up for in knowledge of the position and good enough accuracy. That’s better than anything the Raiders have on their roster right now. The Patriots need a lot of help on offense to even get to league average. That's the reality of the barren cupboard Bill Belichick left. Arizona’s Tetairoa McMillan gets a long look here to pair Drake Maye with a real No. 1 receiver. (A trade back would also help the Pats accumulate more picks to replenish their personnel.) Instead, the Patriots take Campbell, a technician and good athlete with clean footwork and the ability to bend in both the run and pass games. Campbell is an intelligent player, too, who would help solidify one of the league’s weakest units. Keeping the franchise QB upright should be the first priority. BPA, BPA, BPA. The Panthers might be able to avoid forcing a pick at quarterback if the recent improvement from Bryce Young is real and sustainable. That would be great if so, because this team needs elite talent in the worst possible way. Johnson has had a quiet season this year as he nurses a lower body injury, but he has dominant CB1 tape when he’s on the field. That works for Carolina. The offensive line hat trick! After taking linemen the previous two years (Peter Skoronski and JC Latham), the Titans continue to solidify their front and give o-line coach Bill Callahan another toy to work with. While Banks might be best as a guard at the next level, he has the movement ability, length and footwork to have a chance to stay outside. Either way, Banks will shore up the right side (right tackle has been a dry spot for the Titans for a while) and give Tennessee a young and talented set of blockers to build their whole team around. It’s unclear at this point what the Jets’ quarterback situation will look like this time next year, but they need bodies on both sides of the ball. There might not be an edge rusher in this class with better traits than Carter and he would make for one hell of a tandem with Will McDonald off the edge for the future. Walker is a dynamo as a pass rusher but is also a talented off-ball player as well. Either way he constantly impacts the game at Georgia and would give the Browns another speedy player next to Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah (or to fill in for in case his scary neck injury is significant), while also giving defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz another piece to throw QBs on passing downs. Another NFC South team taking the best player available. The Saints will probably have more pressing needs than a safety, but they have so many needs right now. Taking good players and continuing to chip away at their massive salary-cap debt over the next few years is probably the smart way to handle this. Between Mason Graham and Williams, the Bengals have a couple of pristine options here to help inject talent into their front seven. Williams is still a work in progress but has really flashed after coming back from injury this season. He’s long, strong, can move across the defensive line, and will give the Bengals a player with high-end upside. Williams needs polish but can push the pocket and finally give Trey Hendrickson some help to take down the QB. Dallas has been run on relentlessly this year, and has a dire need to get better up front and become a more stout team. Graham helps with that and he has the potential to be a real enforcer up front, which the Cowboys are desperately missing right now. Why not? Interior offensive line is still a need for this team (no great options here), and the Bears could use a defensive tackle as well. AND the Bears signed D’Andre Swift as a free agent. But the presence of Swift should not preclude this team from adding even more firepower around Caleb Williams, especially considering the caliber of player Jeanty is. He would turboboost this run game and his ability to play all three downs as a receiver and pass protector add only more value to his rare big-play ability from the backfield. Anthony Richardson probably won’t be replaced after this season, putting the Colts in a spot to upgrade the offense around him. The Colts' line, which was once a great strength of this unit, has become mediocre. Ersery might not be a household name, but he’s a stout player who can help the Colts' offense get back to being consistently productive. Harmon is one of the biggest risers this season. He’s listed as a defensive tackle, but can play across the line of scrimmage depending on the play-call. Harmon impacts the run and pass, and can fill a variety of roles. He could be a great early down replacement for Calais Campbell and would add even more juice to the Dolphins' front that includes Zach Sieler and the emerging Chop Robinson (and Jaelan Phillips when he’s healthy) on passing downs. First trade up in the draft! The Broncos are settling into life with Bo Nix as their quarterback and have an incredibly high floor for the future as long as its defense can continue to play at an elite level. Adding to their core of skill players would only help Nix and head coach Sean Payton realize the vision for this offense, which has a better base of talent than previously realized. Despite an early season ACL injury and playing at East Carolina, Revel has already displayed enough talent to keep his name in the first round. The Rams have rebuilt their defensive front in recent drafts and now look to rejuvenate the back end. Revel has prototypical size and is a fluid mover with real No. 1 cornerback upside. He would help this Rams unit tremendously when L.A.'s pass rush isn’t able to affect the passer like it has been able to lately. Another trade! Pearce hasn’t had the season he was hoping to have this year, but he still has the pedigree to get drafted highly in the NFL. The Falcons need a pass rusher, so here’s a guy who has at least flashed some big-time potential. The Cardinals are building through their lines and Conerly would give them a player to bookend their offensive line with emerging star Paris Johnson Jr.. Conerly is a very good athlete with light feet and has displayed improved strength this year, and would add more talent to a team that already has a bully mindset. One of the areas of the 49ers' offense that’s really taken a step back is offensive line. Savaiinaea can play tackle or guard, which is what the 49ers need. At times, their blocking is really holding them back and they should consider spending more premium assets there. Whether it’s Abe Lucas insurance or just adding a monster to slot next to Charles Cross, Williams will help reinforce an offensive line that has hindered any consistency on this side of the ball (although they’ve been greatly improved in recent weeks). The Seahawks could go in a few directions here (Michigan tight end Colston Loveland was tempting), but I defaulted to the line. Washington has had a great start to the Dan Quinn-Jayden Daniels era, but its defense is still very weak and the Commanders could use some more help up front. Scourton has the ability to go much higher than this. For now he’s a nice potential inside-out player who Quinn has usually valued highly in his defenses. Enough is enough. I’m tired of talking about the Texans' line hindering their offense, so let’s add more talent. While I would love to add a center or guard to this line, Simmons has been a hard riser up boards before suffering a season-ending knee injury. Whether it’s to replace Tytus Howard at right tackle and move him elsewhere or to start inside as he recovers, Simmons is worth having on your line somewhere, and would be a vast improvement. He’s even best on zone runs that offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik prefers. Tampa Bay gets a stud slot receiver in Burden who can jump in as a starter. The Bucs might not need this player depending on Chris Godwin’s health for next season, but it certainly couldn’t hurt to add a player like Burden to the offense. This is a match that felt even better as I marinated on it. It felt right that Jim Harbaugh added one of his former Wolverines and the Chargers further bolstered their pass catching corps. Interior offensive line and defensive back are other spots to look at here, but giving Justin Herbert another talented option to pair with Ladd McConkey isn’t the worst thing in the world. Loveland’s skills also synergize well with Will Dissly. And he would fit Harbaugh and Greg Roman’s preferred passing game concepts, too. The Ravens can always use more beef, and the 340-350 pound Walker brings a lot of that to the table. Unlike most players his size, Walker has the athleticism to end up as a serious penetrating talent in the interior. Not sure if the Steelers would break their streak of not taking a wide receiver in the first round, but in this exercise they do exactly that. Egbuka plays like a Steeler: He’s smart, tough, and is a good overall player who is a QB’s best friend. He can play inside and out, is willing to do the dirty work, has a great feel against zone coverage and perfectly complements George Pickens (Mike Tomlin and Arthur Smith will love Egbuka, too). Considering the Steelers' revamped offensive line and once Roman Wilson returns from injury, the Steelers have an intriguing group of young players on offense. Now if they can figure out the long-term QB. The Packers need to get much more consistent on defense and the easiest way to do that is to make sure their front seven is strong. Williams has had a good season on the interior and would make sense here for the Packers. This might be a little rich for Zabel, but this would let the Vikings move on from Ed Ingram, who has been a glaring weakness on this line. Zabel has experience across the offensive line and would shore up the interior for future QB J.J. McCarthy and one of the league’s most explosive attacks. Another trade! The Titans jump back into the mix and grab a potential franchise quarterback in Nussmeier. He has a lot of fans in the scouting community and may wind up drafted higher than this if he declares, despite LSU’s struggles this year. The Bills always want to add to their defensive line. Grant would be a valuable player as part of their preferred rotations and a replacement for DaQuan Jones, who's about to turn 33. The jumbo-sized Grant (6-foot-3, 339 pounds) would be a great player to complement the gap-shooting Ed Oliver in the Bills' future interior line. Kansas City’s defense is still good, but the Chiefs need a little infusion of talent on the defensive line. Nolen, a transfer player having a great year for Ole Miss, would be a boost of talent next to Chris Jones on the interior. The Lions could go down a few paths here, maybe adding another offensive lineman to maintain their elite play in the future. Instead we go with Tuimoloau, a tough, pocket-pushing edge player who is productive against the run and pass. He fits the Lions' personality perfectly and would be another strong player upfront with Alim McNeill and Aidan Hutchinson. The Eagles don’t have many holes on their roster, which puts them into the “just draft an edge rusher” class of teams. Umanmielen is another transfer defensive linemen for Ole Miss who has a chance to move forward as a top pick in next year’s draft."

The Cowboys trailed Washington, 16-3. Starter Roger Staubach suffered an injury. Enter Longley. Longley led the Cowboys on three touchdown drives, before finding receiver Drew Pearson for a 50-yard touchdown for the last-minute 24-23 win. For the game, Longley completed 11 of 20 passes for 203 yards and two touchdowns. Legend has it that Longley was completely unprepared to play in the game. Cowboys guard Blaine Nye called the performance, ""The triumph of the uncluttered mind."" It was Longley's lone contribution of any significance to the NFL. He ultimately appeared in six games with one start for the Cowboys, when Dallas rested Staubach for the playoffs in the 1975 regular-season finale. The next year, Longley notoriously sucker punched Staubach during training camp. Staubach told the story at the time, calling it ""premeditated"" and ""gutless."" The sucker punch came after a more formal fight between the two men. Pearson personally witnessed Staubach essentially kicking Longley's ass. “I saw Clint’s feet up in the air, and Roger slamming him to the ground,” Pearson said. “I don’t know what Roger did. He put one of them Vietnam holds on him, that kung fu fighting.” Dan Reeves, a Cowboys assistant coach at the time, broke up the brouhaha. For one very important reason. “If I hadn’t gotten there, Roger probably would have killed him,” Reeves once said. “And I didn’t want my starting quarterback in prison.” The Cowboys sent Longley not to prison but to the Chargers. After one year in San Diego, Longley was out of the NFL after nine games, five touchdown passes, and four interceptions."

The NFL had six games on Thanksgiving that first season. Over the years the tradition as we know it took shape: The Detroit Lions hosted their first Thanksgiving game in 1934 as a way for the team to drum up attendance, the Dallas Cowboys happily volunteered to be the host of a second game starting in 1966 and the league added a third rotating game for Thanksgiving night in 2006. The NFL has become a staple for the holiday. For the three games this season, let's compare the quality of each of the three games to a dish on the Thanksgiving table: For years, there was a steady drumbeat for the Lions to get kicked out of their annual Thanksgiving spot. Detroit was terrible. Why have one of the three (or, for many years, two) games on Thanksgiving ruined by a terrible team. That has changed in a big way. This is the main course of the day because you get a chance to see the best team in football. Yes, that's the Lions. Seriously, the Lions are the best team in the NFL. Again: The Detroit Lions are the top team in the National Football League. That's the first time we can say that in our lifetimes, unless you were born before 1957. That's the last time the Lions won a championship. They are capable of winning a Super Bowl this season. They've never been to a Super Bowl in their history. Will this be a great game? Probably not, but we saw the Packers upset the Lions on Thanksgiving last season. The Bears aren't a great team but they're interesting to watch because they have No. 1 overall draft pick Caleb Williams, who is still a compelling watch amid an up-and-down rookie season. The Bears can at least give us a good show to start off the day. Hopefully, because if we don't get a good game to start the day ... The NFL releases its schedule in April or May and sometimes we get unlucky with key matchups. Sometimes injuries or bad play from a team the league wanted to highlight in prime time or other standalone game will ruin the matchup unexpectedly. We all could have predicted Giants at Cowboys wasn't going to be great. The NFL really believes we want to watch the Giants in marquee spots all the time, and that's not the case. That's how we get stuck with the Giants on Thanksgiving. The Cowboys being bad wasn't part of the plan. They struggled early and their season cratered. They at least got a nice win on Sunday against the Washington Commanders. The Giants haven't won since Oct. 6 and if they don't win Thursday, it's possible they won't win again before 2025. New York cut quarterback Daniel Jones last week, started Tommy DeVito hoping to recreate DeVito's fun story of last season, but DeVito struggled badly and the Giants' season somehow got worse. DeVito is questionable on the Giants' injury report, so perhaps the team will be forced to go to Drew Lock in his first Giants start. This is a game between two bad teams. And it might not matter, in terms of viewership. Last season's Cowboys game on Thanksgiving drew 41.4 million viewers, the third-most viewers in NFL regular-season history. And people will watch again this year, even though they shouldn't. But hey, just because that side dish on the table looks weird and you can't pronounce what it is, it doesn't mean it doesn't taste good. You'll want to save room for dessert. On paper, the 5-6 Miami Dolphins at the 8-3 Green Bay Packers isn't the greatest matchup. But it should be a good game. The Dolphins got off to a bad start this season due to a Tua Tagovailoa injury and some bad luck in close games once he came back. Miami has won three games in a row, with Tagovailoa playing like a top-five quarterback, and is desperate to keep stacking wins and and get in the AFC playoff bracket. The Dolphins might need an upset win at Green Bay to stay in the race. They're a team better than their record indicates, they're desperate, and that makes them dangerous. The Packers are one of the best teams in football. They've won six of seven games, with the only loss coming to an excellent Lions team. Green Bay is getting better offensively with Jordan Love getting past some early season injuries. The Packers just happen to play in the NFL's toughest division; they might be the best third-place team you'll ever see. It should be a good way to end a day full of family, food and football. Even Giants-Cowboys is better than having no football at all."
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Rivalry Week means more this year than it ever has before,https://sports.yahoo.com/rivalry-week-means-more-this-year-than-it-ever-has-before-173545812.html,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 17:35:45 GMT",One of many happy unintended consequences of the expanded College Football Playoff is the new importance of rivalries.,"Family squabbles are best kept behind closed doors. When families fight in public, everyone else tends to turn away as the uncomfortable and deeply personal secrets spill out. That is, unless you’re talking about the reality TV that is the 2024 college football season … where everyone has a substantial investment in how everyone else’s family squabbles go. It’s Rivalry Week in college football, traditionally a time when programs — much like family members — reunite with their oldest foes. And much like a Thanksgiving dinner where you’re interrogated on why you’re not as successful as your cousin, Rivalry Week has had intensely local implications. Most years outside of Georgia, it’s not particularly significant who wins Georgia-Georgia Tech; outside of Tennessee, the Tennessee-Vanderbilt score is a crawl across the bottom of the screen and nothing more. Most years. One of many happy unintended consequences of the expanded College Football Playoff is the new importance of rivalries outside their state borders. In days gone by, a loss in a rivalry game might eliminate one school from championship contention. Now, a loss in a rivalry game can start a cascade that opens up playoff spots, championship game berths, even first-round byes. Consider how much could change in the CFP picture based on who wins the family fistfight this weekend: The Palmetto Bowl (Clemson vs. South Carolina): A win here keeps Clemson in the hunt for an ACC championship and a playoff berth. A victory for South Carolina would legitimize the Gamecocks’ season, provide hope for the future … and provoke some regret that the LSU game got away from them. Plus, it would clear one hurdle for Alabama or Ole Miss to sneak back into the CFP. Tennessee vs. Vanderbilt: An irrelevancy at best prior to this year, the Tennessee-Vanderbilt game now carries substantial weight. Vanderbilt has shown it has the ability to knock out top-flight SEC teams, and Tennessee cannot afford another loss in order to remain comfortably in the CFP. Notre Dame vs. USC: At long last, the Jeweled Shillelagh trophy is once again as important as its participants believe it is. At stake here: Notre Dame’s spot in the CFP field. The Irish’s strength of schedule is already suspect, and that early-season loss to Northern Illinois lurks out there just waiting to wreck Notre Dame’s season. A loss to 6-5 USC would eradicate Notre Dame’s playoff chances. No pressure, Irish. Indiana vs. Purdue: Another of the most important games of the weekend, hands down. Ohio State knocked the shine off Indiana’s immaculate season last week; Purdue could knock it into the ditch entirely. A two-loss Georgia, Tennessee or Ohio State could make the playoff; a two-loss Indiana likely would not. And as with Clemson, Notre Dame and Tennessee above, an Indiana loss would raise hopes at multiple other programs. Texas vs. Texas A&M: Resuming for the first time since 2011, and the stakes couldn't be higher: CFP or bust. Whichever team loses this one is almost certainly out of the playoff hunt; whichever one wins has a shot at a first-round bye in the SEC championship. Now that's how you restart a rivalry. Clean Old-Fashioned Hate (Georgia vs. Georgia Tech): Georgia has already locked up a spot in the SEC championship, meaning its path to the CFP is clear. But a loss to the Yellow Jackets would make Georgia’s task in the SEC championship imperative: Win or else. Duel in the Desert (Arizona State vs. Arizona): The stakes for Arizona State are clear: win, and the Sun Devils are in the Big 12 championship and playing for a CFP berth. (There’s one remote scenario where an Arizona State win doesn’t lead to a championship berth, but that’s a narrow road.) A loss, and suddenly BYU, Iowa State and Colorado have new playoff hopes. The Iron Bowl (Auburn vs. Alabama): Whatever faint hopes Alabama still has to make the CFP field rest on this game. Alabama must win, and preferably win big, to keep its flickering chances alive. Good thing nothing weird has ever happened in an Iron Bowl. The Game (Ohio State vs. Michigan): This is really more of a job-security issue for Ryan Day than playoff positioning, since Ohio State could afford to lose this one and still make the CFP field. But Day is 1-3 all-time against Michigan, including three straight losses, and if his Buckeye battleship can’t take out a hobbled Michigan this year, the murmurs will get louder. The Egg Bowl + Florida State vs. Florida: Mississippi State, Ole Miss, Florida State and Florida all played themselves out of contention this year, whether it was last weekend (Ole Miss) or before September (Florida State). But these two rivalries ought to have significant impacts on two separate conferences soon, if these teams can get their acts back together. The kind of chaos that spills forth from these games — remember the dog-peeing penalty that changed college football? — deserves national playoff implications. Worth noting: Rivalry games have more meaning because outside of the opening-round byes, there are no prescribed slots set aside for conferences. The SEC could end up with as few as two slots this year … and we wouldn’t have that kind of drama if the league were gifted four slots. It’s all the more reason why preseason predictions and conference chest-beating are fine, but the on-the-field results are paramount … and the drama they create should be preserved. All of this together means that Rivalry Week means more this year, in the aggregate, than it ever has before. So yes, we are now all paying attention to your family squabbles. Act accordingly … and don’t lose."

It’s a tale so old, you forget how remarkable it is that seemingly every time Durant steps back on the floor after an absence he doesn’t look hobbled or winded or out of place. Tuesday night’s game against the Los Angeles Lakers was the latest example of his basketball majesty, continuing his torrid start to the season and helping the Phoenix Suns get back in the win column after a five-game losing streak. Durant’s 23 points were easy and smooth, effective and non-disruptive to the offensive flow. He could’ve scored 30 without blinking, but the 27-point win didn't call for it. When he plays, the Suns are 9-1 this year and look every bit the contender nobody believed they would be this season. You can put Durant onto any team in the league and they’re instantly better, without having to adjust scheme or gameplan — his basketball acumen allows him to blend into any system without him having to be the system, without him having to dominate the ball or attention. And if his health holds up, the Suns could very well be the biggest party crashers in a crowded Western Conference this spring. It’s early, and ensuring availability is no guarantee for any team in this NBA, particularly for the Suns, who have two stars in their mid-30s with Durant and Bradley Beal. But they looked dominant against a formidable Lakers team that had their number last year. They waxed the Lakers by 25 in the second half, and while taking into account the Lakers have had problems with competing on defense against good competition (Orlando, Denver) over the last week, these are the games the Suns should win in order to establish hierarchy in the West. Minnesota was a trendy pick to make the Finals after its surprising run to the West finals last year, buoyed by the Timberwolves’ sweep of Durant’s Suns in the first round, but they’re under .500 after losing to Houston — and out of the Play-In at the moment. Dallas, even before Luka Dončić’s wrist injury cost him time, was struggling to find consistency. The Los Angeles Clippers, with no sign of Kawhi Leonard being anywhere near a practice court, sit in a top-six spot. And the second and third spots are occupied by Golden State and Houston — developments no one would’ve predicted a month ago. Oklahoma City, like last year, sits atop the conference, but hasn’t proven it yet with a long playoff run. The Thunder still have youth on their side while teams like the Suns need near-perfect conditions to get through the treacherous West. But let’s assume Durant has the health he had last season, when he played 75 games and debunked the whole injury-prone label he’s carried since his Achilles injury during the 2019 NBA Finals. Let’s assume that, at 36 years old, he keeps up the same performance and efficiency of the other two graybeards the collective public gives earned grace to, LeBron James and Stephen Curry. Then there’s no reason to easily dismiss Durant or his team in the postseason. Who knows if this 10-game sample size is merely a matter of fresh legs to start the season as opposed to the fatigue that’s bound to set in, but it seems like a smart bet to believe Durant will land near 55 percent shooting, 44 percent from 3-point range, 27 points, six rebounds and three assists. It falls in line with Durant’s production of 28.2 points, 6.9 rebounds and 5.4 assists on 53/41/89 splits, and those aren’t his career numbers — those are his numbers post-Achilles, when he didn’t play again until after his 31st birthday. We’ve become so accustomed to talking about other things with Durant — his supposed unhappiness, his wont to leave franchises, his leadership, his health. The bottom line is he’s been as reliable a performer when he’s been on the court no matter where he’s been. The conversation around Durant has gone between wholly unfair and reasonable, but rarely is the focus on his play. Usually, that’s unassailable. And these Suns aren’t a complete roster, they’re depending a lot on decision-making, and the dirty work of Jusuf Nurkić and Mason Plumlee as a backup, to get them through. That doesn’t always inspire a lot of confidence if one is picking them to improve on a 49-win season last year. But it does feel like the most complete roster Durant has played on since leaving the Bay Area. That Brooklyn Nets team that looked like world-beaters in 2021 until Kyrie Irving and James Harden got hurt in the second round against the Milwaukee Bucks, leaving Durant alone to carry an undermanned roster? They would merely overwhelm you with talent and explosiveness, and we saw what happened when they lost their fastball. This Suns team isn’t as explosive, not nearly, but with Durant settling in, it takes pressure away from Devin Booker, who had to carry the offense in Durant's absence and saw his efficiency decline with the added attention. They’re both best when the ball swings to them as opposed to staring down five sets of eyes on defense, and having Mike Budenholzer as head coach and Tyus Jones as table-setting point guard takes a load of weight off them. Durant is at his best when the game is simple, because he makes the game look easy better than anybody in the league — still, at his advanced age. Budenholzer, to this point, realizes Durant doesn’t need the most complicated actions, but just enough movements where he can flow into a dribble and pull up, or catch and shoot. And Budenholzer has gotten all three scorers to buy into shooting more 3s to get along with the times of today’s game. Last year, the Suns were 25th in attempts despite being fifth in efficiency. This year, even with Durant’s absence, they’re sixth in attempts and bound to rise with their big three playing together more. Tuesday night was the Suns' 99th regular-season game since the Beal trade was made to bring all three together, and the 49th time they’ve been on the floor at the same time. Perhaps it’s a fallacy to believe in the Suns, but in the absence of a Celtics-like team in the conference, one stands to believe with a healthy Durant they have as good of a shot as any at making a deep playoff run."

The No. 61 across his chest more so resembles a reliever at the back of the bullpen making his major league debut than a NBA player injecting life into a team without Steph Curry. Yet, Pat Spencer was the perfect answer Warriors coach Steve Kerr called upon at the end of the bench to start the second quarter as his team trailed the Oklahoma City Thunder by 16 points, 39-23, through the first 12 minutes of Wednesday's game. The Warriors eventually lost, 105-101, falling short in their valiant effort of a comeback against the top-seeded Thunder, but Spencer won over the Chase Center crowd -- something he already has done long ago among his coaches and teammates. “Fantastic,” Kerr said of Spencer’s near 15 minutes in the tough loss. “You love to see a guy come in and play with force and great energy and push the ball and find shooters. He just plays the game. I thought Pat changed the game. “As soon as he got out there, the game finally opened up for us and we started to move the ball.” With Curry out to bilateral patellofemoral pain, Brandin Podziemski served as Golden State’s starting point guard. Point-forward Kyle Anderson stepped into a ball-handling role, too, but it was clear once Spencer hit the floor, he had the extra oomph and juice the Warriors have been searching for the past few games. Down by 18 a minute into the second quarter, Spencer, upon the ball hitting his hands, immediately fed it to Buddy Hield right into his shooting pocket for a 3-pointer that sprung an 11-0 Warriors run where Spencer and Hield twice connected for three. Buddy Buckets from the corner 👌 pic.twitter.com/yglAKx8EDh — Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) November 28, 2024 Kerr knew the cards he was dealt without Curry. He had an idea Spencer, a 28-year-old two-way player who is in his second NBA season and had played a total of four minutes and 35 seconds this year coming into the night, could be needed. What he couldn’t have predicted was just how much. But knowing the attitude and demeanor of the former college lacrosse star who didn’t play college basketball until using his graduate year to suit up for Northwestern, forgoing being the top pick in the 2019 Premier Lacrosse League draft, already had Kerr plenty confident in the man who looks more suited to cross up washed uncles at the park than NBA players. “The guys’ a gamer,” Kerr said. “I mean, he’s one of the greatest lacrosse players of all time. He’s a competitor, he’s an athlete, he has worked his tail off to get to this point. Incredible teammate and he’s a damn good player.” Spencer went through three long days of practice with the Santa Cruz Warriors at Chase Center, and even had a full lift ahead of Golden State’s game against Oklahoma. Once he was active, he had an idea his number could be called and took advantage of the opportunity. Kerr knew he could trust Spencer as much as anybody else at the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth, too. How Spencer sees the game was most evident when the Warriors took the lead in the first minute of the fourth quarter, 86-84, on a Kyle Anderson 3-pointer – giving them their first lead since it was 9-6. Screening for Hield, Spencer darted to the paint and caught a bounce pass from Draymond Green. Spencer could have tried a two on Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, but instead lifted off two feet and found an open Moses Moody at the right wing beyond the arc. The pass forced Dillon Jones to leave Anderson wide open in the right corner. Swish. Three points and an eruption from Warriors fans. SLO-MO PUTS THE DUBS ON TOP 🤑 pic.twitter.com/ph3FQfnOVA — Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) November 28, 2024 Nowhere in the box score does Spencer get credit for the huge play. And that’s just fine with him. “Just trying to play good basketball,” Spencer told NBC Sports Bay Area in the locker room. “There’s an open man and if that guy makes the right read and makes one more pass – I’m not out there for numbers and my impact won’t show in numbers. “It never has. Just try to play the game the right way at a high level and I feel like I have a feel for the other guys, too.” The numbers show Spencer played 14 minutes and 31 seconds, his most minutes of real action ever in the NBA. Spencer finished with six points, four rebounds and three assists, none of which jumped off the page. He also hadn’t even come off the bench in over three weeks when Spencer played the final 30 seconds of a blowout win against the Washington Wizards. And still, his plus-9 was the best plus/minus of any player for either team. Fear isn't in Spencer’s blood, heart or head. He gave ample credit to fellow two-way players Reece Beekman and Quinten Post for their ultimate sacrifice of keeping him ready, and stars like Curry and Green spoke to him on the bench like he’s a fellow four-time champion. Why? Because his fearless actions and words together have earned their admiration. “He’s just solid, man,” Green said. “He’s very opinionated in a good way. He’ll share things that he sees. Extremely smart, on and off the court. He’s just always steady. Gets his work in, doesn’t bother anyone, but is not afraid to say something, and I respect that.” The fire-breathing Warriors intimidator used examples of Spencer telling him and Curry what he sees and what he believes they can do better. Some stars might not take kindly to that. Spencer’s opinions and observations have been earned. “When guys are like that, you respect it,” Green continued. “That’s what Pat’s meant for this team, and it’s good to see him get an opportunity tonight and take advantage.” Curry and Green jerseys flooded the Chase Center stands. Old friends like Klay Thompson and Jordan Poole were represented, and even a Sleepy Floyd jersey was seen. There might never be a day where Spencer’s No. 61 is a best-seller or even a thrift store find. So what. Respect from those who are in the trenches with you always trumps manufactured love. Every second Spencer sprinted around the floor was warranted. What’s next for him is unknown, though nobody will question if he’ll be ready for the moment. Download and follow the Dubs Talk Podcast"
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games","Fantasy Football Panic Meter: Hope is fading for Kyler Murray, Marvin Harrison Jr.",https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy-football-panic-meter-hope-is-fading-for-kyler-murray-marvin-harrison-jr-154840306.html,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 15:48:40 GMT",Fantasy football analyst Dalton Del Don provides some insight into players we're most worried about heading into Week 13.,"It can be so easy to panic in fantasy football. After all, we have a very limited amount of time to witness and analyze a player's performance. But never fear — Dalton Del Don is here to gauge exactly how worried we should be — if at all. McCaffrey continues to test his fantasy managers’ patience, as he would be just the RB29 in half-PPR fantasy points per game (10.9) on the season. Last week can be blamed on a San Francisco offense missing Brock Purdy and Trent Williams, but CMC’s numbers are down across the board over three games since returning. He’s getting a career-low 3.5 YPC and his fewest yards per target since 2020. McCaffrey likely isn’t the same player while returning from bilateral Achilles tendinitis, but the 49ers offense has also struggled at times since losing Brandon Aiyuk. However, McCaffrey’s usage remains elite — he had a 93% snap share and saw all 15 RB opportunities before the final two drives of San Francisco’s blowout loss last week. The 49ers may be reeling in the win/loss column, but their offense has gotten the second-most yards per play (6.3) this season despite last week’s ugly performance with a backup QB and LT. San Francisco has the second-best yardage-differential in the NFL. The 49ers rank bottom five in red-zone TD percentage (50.0%) after ranking first (68.0%) last season, so scoring regression should be coming. Given CMC’s role in this offense, even a lesser version can easily be a top-five fantasy back down the stretch — but we need a healthy Purdy for that to happen. Few coaches love a player more than Sean McVay does Williams, but the running back has fumbled four times (losing two) over the last four games. Williams has an NFL-high five fumbles (among non-QBs), and he lost two during one of L.A.’s final games last season. Williams is getting just 4.0 YPC and hasn’t seen one target over the last two games. It’s possible he’s wearing down given the incredibly high usage (third-most RB snaps) and his size. That said, Williams saw a 90% snap share and 16-of-17 RB opportunities after coughing up the ball in last week’s game. Another fumble or two could quickly change things, but his workhorse role appears intact for now. Matthew Stafford is averaging 287.5 passing yards and 2.2 touchdowns with Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp this season, so the Rams offense is one of the best in the league when healthy. Moreover, Williams’ schedule has been the league’s 10th toughest up until now, but he gets the third easiest moving forward. Williams could still have a big fantasy finish, but fantasy managers will be constantly worried he fumbles again. Stroud is the QB26 in fantasy points per game, just ahead of the recently released (and now new Viking) Daniel Jones. Stroud has just two weekly top-five QB finishes during his career, with both coming last season. He ranks 24th in EPA/dropback and 32nd in completion percentage over expectation. He's also been the most pressured QB in the league. Stroud has taken a step back as a sophomore, and he’s the latest example of the risk of drafting a quarterback high in fantasy who doesn’t run. However, there is some hope now that Nico Collins is back fully healthy. Stroud has averaged just 197.2 passing yards and 1.0 TD passes without Collins on the field this season, but he’s averaged 269.9 and 1.3 with him on it. Houston also sees a significant boost in pass rate (61.7%) and PROE (+7.1%) with Collins on the field compared to when off (53.0%, -2.2%). Stroud would still be just the QB19 (15.8 fpg) during games with Collins, but it’s worth noting the duo had two long touchdown connections (totaling 110 yards) nullified by shaky penalties over the last two weeks. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Stefon Diggs isn’t returning, but Tank Dell could be more explosive the further he’s removed from leg surgery (like Tony Pollard last year). Moreover, the Texans’ QB schedule is the eighth-most favorable in the league moving forward, including a prime matchup this week. Stroud should start putting up better stats down the stretch, but he’s been one of this season’s biggest fantasy busts. Murray’s up-and-down season continued with a dud last week, when Arizona scored just six points in a matchup with one of the week’s highest projected totals. But Seattle’s defense has been playing far better recently, as the Seahawks rank fourth in EPA/play allowed since trading for Ernest Jones. Moreover, Michael Wilson caught a touchdown that was called back by a penalty, while Marvin Harrison Jr. couldn’t get a second foot down in the end zone on the next play. Murray’s had the league’s hardest QB schedule up until now, but he gets an average one moving forward. Murray has been a top-five QB the same number of weeks (four) this season as he’s been bottom-10, so expect more inconsistent play down the stretch. Harrison Jr. hasn’t seen more than seven targets in a game since Week 3 and didn’t experience a rookie bump coming out of Arizona’s bye last week. No wide receiver in the top 60 is averaging fewer fantasy points per game if you removed touchdowns. This isn’t all Harrison Jr.’s fault, as his role in Arizona’s offense has been a major hurdle to production. But the rookie wideout also ranks #84 in ESPN’s Open Score and #55 in Average Separation Score. MHJ has fewer catches (36) this year than Jalen Tolbert, Will Dissly, Javonte Williams, Ray-Ray McCloud and Zach Ertz, among many others. Harrison Jr. has a teammate who led the league in first-read target rate (58.8%!) last week, and Arizona sports one of the lowest pass rates over expectation (-6.0%). Rookie wide receivers typically perform better late in the season, and the Cardinals’ WR schedule goes from the third toughest up until now to the sixth easiest moving forward. Still — Harrison Jr. is on track to be one of this year’s biggest fantasy busts."
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Battle for the logo: How NIL is changing the relationship between donors and universities,https://sports.yahoo.com/battle-for-the-logo-how-nil-is-changing-the-relationship-between-donors-and-universities-152717901.html,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 15:27:17 GMT","In an era where universities are now asking donors for money to pay players, a group at Mississippi State is asking for something in return: change the logo.","They are all quick to acknowledge that among a list of problems facing the world today — or even their favorite football team — the fate of Mississippi State’s old “Interlocking MSU” logo doesn’t rank particularly high. Yet they are Bulldogs supporters, locked in a rough year (2-9) heading into Friday's Egg Bowl as a nearly four-touchdown underdog against their rival, Ole Miss. As such, they wistfully recall better times, such as the 1990s, when Jackie Sherrill — “Coach Jackie” — made them a regular in the top 20. Sherill’s teams wore the interlocking letters of M, S and U. They want the logo back. They’ve gathered on message boards, created petitions and raised noise about it, whether out of nostalgia, out of preference, out of their own ideas about branding or, well, just because. This is college football; it doesn’t have to make complete sense. “Fan is short for fanatic,” noted Bulldog supporter Brian Martin, 38, of little Raleigh, Mississippi. In the past, no one inside an athletic department would pay much attention, especially since the group is made up of everyday fans, neither massive nor monied. An athletic director could hear the suggestions/complaints and, if they chose, just ignore it. After all, go try and tell Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones you think he should replace the silver star and … well, you wouldn’t even get a meeting. You’re the fan. I’m the owner. This is a new era in college athletics, though, one in which schools are begging fans to not just renew their seats or even donate to a facility upgrade. They are asked to contribute money to “collectives” — the Bulldog Initiative, in this case — to directly pay the actual players. The relationship feels different. It’s not that Martin and his fellow “interlocking letters” devotees think they own the team … but, then again, if they are helping pay the “employees,” isn’t it kind of like they own the team? “You are asking me to fund the roster,” Martin notes. The “Interlocking MSU” logo was replaced in 2004 by what is called the “Banner M” logo. The Banner M remains for the institution as a whole — a long-term attempt to brand the university not just among football fans, but to potential students and stand out from other “MSUs” such as Michigan State or Missouri State. “We are just a small part of the university,” athletic director Zac Selmon said. The “State Script” logo — basically State written in cursive — has been used on the football helmet since 2023. The interlocking MSU, however, made an appearance at a special 25th anniversary game for the 1998 Bulldogs that reached the SEC title game. That got a group of small, but quite passionate fans, excited. “A lot of fans don’t care about the logo,” said Isaac Sparks, 28, of Mathison, Mississippi. “The ones that do overwhelmingly favor the ‘Interlocking MSU’ though.” The school isn’t budging; you don’t just switch up brand-building plans on a whim, although Selmon said he would “continue to listen and when we can connect the dots and showcase history” in a “purposeful way,” then who knows? Regardless of the details or outcome, we have an intriguing moment — and tangential debate — of the NIL era. Does a fan get more of a say if, rather than donating to a new locker room that might take years to complete, you now give a more “active dollar” that pays the quarterback? “It’s throwing a bone to the people you are asking to donate to NIL so you can buy the players,” Sparks said. “It’s more expensive than ever to be a fan.” Selmon, who took over as the AD 18 months ago, met with Sparks for 45 minutes to discuss the issue, an opportunity Sparks greatly appreciated. That alone was something that might not have occurred in the past. “He didn’t have to do that,” Sparks said. “He’s been put in a tough spot.” Selmon said he was happy to do it. He tries to listen, if not meet, with all constituents, including grassroots fans. This is MSU after all, not some massive department such as Ohio State or Georgia. “I came up on the fundraising side,” said Selmon, who previously worked at Oklahoma and North Carolina, “so I’ve always been about personal relationships and listening to people. I’ll always filter that with how it aligns with the long-term goals of the athletic department and our values as a whole. “Isaac has great passion for Mississippi State,” Selmon continued. “His research was really good. I think we both left there thinking we are on the same team.” There was a similar movement this fall at the University of Arkansas. A group of fans yearned for the return of the so-called “Slobberin’ Hog” Razorback logo that was used during the glory days of the basketball program under coaches Eddie Sutton and Nolan Richardson, who led Arkansas to the 1993 national title. Arkansas AD Hunter Yurachek posed a challenge in October, asking them to raise $500,000 in a 24-hour period for the school’s NIL Collective. If they did it, the money would be matched by a single donor. For that $1 million total, the Slobberin’ Hog would return to the center court of Bud Walton Arena. The money was drummed up with time to spare. “HOG YEAH,” Yurachek wrote on social media when the goal was hit. “Center court logo [was] added this morning as promised.” If nothing else, the perspective of the fans, even smaller donors, has changed. Just getting a voice is important when they are asked to fork over more and more money. “It makes you feel like you are truly involved in the university,” Martin said. Selmon and modern athletic directors want that. In the end, someone has to make a decision, but in the relentless battle for money, you need everyone pulling the rope. The so-called little guy can matter as much as the millionaire. “This is the passion that drew me to come [work for] Mississippi State,” Selmon said. “This state and this fan base, they come from all walks of life and they love the Bulldogs. It’s what makes the place special.” They're even especially passionate about their old logo."

Here's a look at the lay of the land in each of the six groups as the tourney presses on: There are two more nights of Group Play, which concludes on Tuesday, Dec. 3, with the top eight teams in the East and West — the winners of Groups A, B and C, plus two “wild cards” (the team from each conference with the best record in group-play games that finished second in its group) — advancing to the single-elimination knockout rounds. Because of the small number of games, tiebreakers will likely come into play (even for the wild card), with the advancing team being decided by: (1) head-to-head in group play; (2) non-overtime point differential in group play; (3) total non-overtime points in group play; (4) 2023-24 regular-season record and finally; (5) a random drawing. The four quarterfinal games will be played Tuesday, Dec. 10, and Wednesday, Dec. 11. The four winners will advance to Las Vegas, where the semifinals will be held on Saturday, Dec. 14. The championship game for the NBA Cup will take place on Tuesday, Dec. 17, at 8:30 p.m. ET on ABC. It will be the only game in the entire tournament that won’t also count toward the participating teams’ regular-season records or their players’ statistics. The teams that don’t make it to Las Vegas won’t just be chilling at home, though. During the knockout rounds, on the days where no NBA Cup games are scheduled — Thursday, Dec. 12, Friday, Dec. 13, Sunday, Dec. 15 and Monday, Dec. 16 — the 22 teams who didn’t qualify for the knockouts will each play two regular-season games. The four teams that lose in the quarterfinals will each play one regular-season game against one another, too. • As the winners of West Group C, the 3-0 Warriors were the first team to punch their ticket to the knockout round, which is as pretty as it gets at this point. • With a win on Tuesday, the 3-0 Rockets clinched West Group A on Tuesday. • The 2-0 Magic and 3-0 Bucks lead East Group A and B, respectively, with 20-plus-point leads in the point-differential department over their 2-0 counterparts, the Knicks and Pistons, putting both Orlando in Milwaukee in strong position to either win their groups or contend for the East’s wild-card spot. Technically, everybody but the Pelicans, Jazz, Raptors and Wizards. But the Hornets, Pacers, Kings and Grizzlies remain winless. There are also five 1-2 teams still hanging on: the 76ers, Nets, Nuggets, Heat and Timberwolves. The other 17 teams in the league are all either 3-0, 2-0, 2-1 or 1-1, and still alive for a spot in the knockout round. [Check out the NBA Cup Standings] 1.

But how and why did they land on this specific format? Here's the behind-the-scenes story from its architects.,"INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. — Deep within Jack Swarbrick’s home, down a flight of stairs, across a basement floor and inside a small closet, the original relics of the expanded College Football Playoff format exist. These note-filled papers are artifacts of an 18-month-long endeavor to create the largest and most significant postseason concept in college football history. They are kept safe and secret here, buried inside a brown box, only to be unearthed as evidence of a process that, perhaps, changed the sport forever. “Some of them are in a landfill somewhere,” Swarbrick says, “but the ones I thought would be useful if I ever wrote a book are here with me in Indianapolis.” These notebooks tell quite a tale: how four college athletics executives spent nearly two years, in secret, covertly meeting at airport hotels, while using masking tape to cover conference room walls with drawn-up brackets, finally arriving at the 12-team playoff model used today. The working group of three conference commissioners, Bob Bowlsby (Big 12), Greg Sankey (SEC) and Craig Thompson (Mountain West), and one athletic director, Swarbrick (Notre Dame), examined nearly 100 playoff models — from four teams to 32 — during gatherings that spanned a global pandemic and, in the end, produced the format’s public rollout in June 2021. Three-and-a-half years later, following a drama-filled approval process, the fruits of their labor are now more tangible than ever. Bracket selections are less than two weeks away — a historic and momentous occasion for an industry that, for decades, resisted such a multi-round postseason tournament. “It’s so beautiful what the 12 has done,” said Bill Hancock, the former CFP executive director who assembled the working group in 2019 and was one of the few people involved in their meetings. “The real beauty is the value it places on conference championships. We’re seeing that. The premium it places on conference championships … it’s magic.” Entering the final week of the regular season, roughly 25 teams remain alive for the playoff. Twenty-two games this week — many of them a collision of fierce rivals — will impact the postseason race. A half-dozen teams can eliminate or severely impact their arch-rival’s chances at an at-large berth, such as Vanderbilt (vs. Tennessee), USC (vs. Notre Dame) and Purdue (vs. Indiana). A few matchups even pit playoff contenders in possible elimination duels, including Texas at Texas A&M and South Carolina at Clemson. At least two Group of Five conferences — the Mountain West and American — are still in line for one of their champions to get a spot. At the power conference level, Miami, Texas A&M and Ohio State all need to win to advance to their league’s title bout and avoid a loss that could doom them their playoff chances completely. Meanwhile, the Big 12 race is a chaotic mess where a whopping nine teams are still eligible to make the championship game. The 12-team format has made games that were completely irrelevant in the four-team system significantly impactful to a 12-team field. There’s 6-5 West Virginia at 7-4 Texas Tech, which could affect Big 12 tiebreakers; and a game featuring, of all teams, six-loss Oregon State, which can spoil Boise State’s playoff hopes; and don’t forget about three-loss Nevada’s mission to ruin rival UNLV’s shot at a conference title and a potential playoff spot. “I felt like those who said, ‘Well, if you expand, you’ll negatively impact the regular season!’ They missed two things,” Sankey said. “The four-team playoff already did that. When someone lost once and certainly twice, they were out. And secondly, by adding teams, you bring a lot more people into the conversation in the month of November. We have results that confirm that thesis.” At a meeting in the spring in Dallas, Hancock, in one of his last duties before retirement, gathered a half-dozen media members together to walk them through the particulars and peculiarities of the 12-team format. We need your help with messaging. We need people to understand how it works. Seven months later, despite the media’s best efforts, many college football fans are left confused by the format that Bowlsby, Swarbick, Sankey and Thompson created. The most simplified explanation starts with this: The CFP selection committee, a 13-member panel of former coaches and current administrators, ranks their final top 25 teams, and those teams are then seeded into a 12-team bracket under the following rules: (1) Conference champions: The five highest-ranked conference champions in the committee’s rankings get auto bids. Of those five, the four highest-ranked champions are seeded Nos. 1-4 based on their ranking order and receive first-round byes (conference champions are the only teams eligible for a bye and a top-4 seed). (2) At-large berths: The remaining eight spots in the bracket — seeds Nos. 5-12 — are filled by the next seven highest-ranked teams (at-large berths), as well as the fifth conference champion. They are seeded based on their order in the committee’s rankings. (3) Schedule: Seeds 5-8 host first-round games on campus against seeds 9-12; the quarterfinals and semifinals are played in a rotation of six bowls; in the quarterfinals, the top four seeds are each paired with their conference’s historic bowl relationship (ie: the SEC champion this year is in the Sugar Bowl). The goal of the format was clear: reward conference champions with a first-round bye and grant home field to the next best four teams. “We put a premium on winning a conference championship as a difficult accomplishment and one deserved to be heavily weighted,” Bowlsby said. Not everyone agrees with the format. The concept has taken its share of criticism for a seeding process that disadvantages teams actually ranked higher. For instance, if the playoff was today, No. 12 Clemson and No. 13 Alabama would miss the field while No. 16 Arizona State would advance through an auto bid as, presumably, the Big 12 champion. The same can be said for the situation over the first-round byes. No. 11 Boise State is in line to be the No. 4 seed, passing six teams ranked above it. “The aim of it was to maintain the vitality of the conferences,"" Swarbrick said. ""I think it’s done that, because there are some conferences that without the conference championship provision might not be in this year.” There are plenty of misconceptions out there about the format. The most notable one: that the five automatic bids for conference champions are designated to specific leagues. In reality, the bids are reserved for any of the 10 FBS conferences — whichever five champions are ranked highest. The five auto bids and the first-round byes were not designated to specific conferences to avoid the scrutiny of congressional lawmakers, who, in the past, skewered the old BCS concept for creating a caste system. Under the 12-team format, the four power league champions and the highest-ranked champion from the Group of Five will most often get into the field. When applying the format, just once in the previous 10 years would a power league’s champion be ranked behind two Group of Five champions and left out of the field (the Pac-12 in the COVID-shortened 2020 season). But could it actually happen this season? In the committee’s latest rankings, Boise State is five spots ahead of the Big 12’s highest ranked team, No. 16 Arizona State. Just one spot back: No. 17 Tulane. How the working group reached consensus on a format is even more complicated than explaining the format itself. Many of those answers are in Swarbrick’s notebooks, buried in that basement. “I remember we were swimming in format options,” recalls Hancock. “The guys vetted all of them. Some options went by the wayside quickly, like 32 teams. And then, the working group is noodling things over and someone said, ‘Hey, what about 12?’” The fuse that ignited the expansion conversation happened in San Jose, California, in January of 2019. The CFP’s highest governing body, the Board of Managers, gathered for their annual meeting hours before the kickoff of the 2018 national championship game that featured Alabama and Clemson. They delivered to Hancock a directive: We are ready to talk expansion. The request, most specifically, came from the Pac-12 and Big Ten representatives on the board: Washington State president Kirk Schulz and Penn State president Eric Barron. At that point, the four-team CFP had produced four consecutive champions from either the SEC or ACC. Dating back to the final years of the BCS, those two leagues had won 12 of the previous 13 titles. The Big Ten and Pac-12 wanted change. From that request, the four-member CFP working group was born in the summer of 2019. They began to meet regularly — until the world shut down. For many Americans, March 2020 will forever be marked by the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. For those on the working group, the month also represents a breakthrough in what was then six-plus months worth of exploring playoff expansion models. During the first week of March 2020, about two weeks before life in America paused, the four men met in the Grand Hyatt at the DFW Airport and reached a consensus. They would recommend a 12-team playoff. And then, they did not meet again in person for 13 months. The virtual meetings “slowed” the process, Swarbrick says, as well as the pandemic-related crises unfolding. But before that March 2020 meeting, the four men and two others — Hancock and Dave Marmion, the CFP chief financial officer — met at least a half-dozen times, usually in small hotel conference rooms, equipped with two easels of paper, masking tape and markers. By the end of the meeting, the walls would be completely covered in mock playoff brackets. How would this model and that model have played out in years past? Each person took individual notes, and Hancock’s staff kept the brackets and models to keep some consistency from one meeting to the next. Some of the meetings would last an afternoon. Others spanned two days. “Every so often somebody would say, ‘Somebody keep these!’” Thompson recalled in a past interview. “There is copious note taking. It was a very legitimate process. When we would think something was quasi solved, one of the members would say, ‘Wait a minute! If we did this, it would mean that!’” In the early days, they established one very important goal: grant access, in some way, to the Group of Five. From there, things got easier. They spent the majority of their time modeling five potential brackets: a seven, eight, nine, 10 and 12-team playoff, each with a half-dozen or more variations (the seven- and nine-team brackets were equipped with play-in games). They attempted to poke holes in each of their models. For instance, 16 and 24-team models would be too many extra games in college football’s restricted window between title games and NFL playoffs. An eight-team model — one of the heavy favorites early on — posed other problems. Guaranteeing five or six conference champions a spot in an eight-team model meant that only two or three at-large teams got in. Sankey was against such an eight-team model, describing the decreasing number of at-large selections from the four-team playoff as “counter-intuitive” to expansion. While he and Swarbrick supported an eight- or 12-team at-large model — often described as “best eight” or “best 12” — they acknowledged the expectation from others to have guaranteed access. They compromised. “On the national stage, we were the outlier in resisting any notion of playoff expansion,” Sankey said. “We could be the contrarian or have the responsibility to shape the process.” They seriously weighed keeping the model at four teams, the commissioners say, but with a twist. The selection committee wouldn’t pick the participants until the major bowls were played. The bowls would be, in many ways, quasi quarterfinals. In the end, the men wanted to grant more access. It’s why, in a somewhat stunning turn of events, they settled on 12. Even Swarbrick acknowledges that he originally entered the negotiations thinking 12 was too many. “No one saw that coming when we started,” he says. In a modeling of the previous seven years (2014-20), the 12-team proposal would have only included four teams that finished outside the committee’s final top 12 rankings, the worst of which was ranked 20th. All four were Group of Five conference champions. Ironically, the very first year of the expanded model could present a peculiar issue. The Big 12 champion could finish ranked outside of the top 12 and may be forced to play in the first round. According to the committee’s latest rankings, Boise State is in line for the bye and No. 4 seed if it wins out. Earlier this week, Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark told Yahoo Sports that there is “no rationale” for such a decision from the committee and that his champion should earn the bye. One team never has the opportunity to get a bye: Notre Dame. Perhaps no one on the working group compromised as much as Swarbrick. As an independent, the Irish will not have the opportunity to ever land a first-round bye. It’s a tradeoff, he says, for not having to play a league championship game. “I said to the room, ‘Let’s have the byes just go to conference champions, and they all looked at me like I was crazy,’” he recalls. “I thought, ‘I’m going to get the s*** beat out of me back home,” Swarbrick said. Well, did you? “Oh yeah.” Nearly two years of work, hundreds of hours of meetings, reams of notes, rolls of masking tape and dozens of catered meals later, the expanded 12-team format will make its debut soon enough. Three of the four members of the working group retired from their positions over the last two years. Bowlsby, after a short stint as interim athletic director at Northern Iowa, moved back to Dallas and spends his days with family. Thompson remains in Colorado, and Swarbrick still lives in Indiana. Both men have remained involved in college sports — Thompson assisting on coaching and administrative searches; and Swarbrick helping with a new concept for the future of college football dubbed Project Rudy. Hancock retired as well. If he’s not traveling or with family, he’s watching football. In fact, he’s fascinated to see how the committee handles what he refers to as the three “stress points” in a 12-team bracket: (1) Which four conference champions get the first-round byes? (2) Which four teams get the home games? (3) And, perhaps most important, which teams are the last in the field as at-large selections? “The light really went on with everybody on the working group when we realized the three stress levels: get in, get a home field, get a bye,” Hancock said. “We were like, ‘Wow, look at this. How cool is this going to be?’ We are seeing the fruits of that. It’s awesome. It’s remarkable.” The Big Ten, SEC and ACC champions seemingly have the first-round byes secured. But the fourth remains a question between Boise State and the Big 12 champion. As for home games, Penn State and Notre Dame, if they win, seem all but assured of hosting in the first round. The same goes for the Big Ten championship game runner-up (Oregon or Ohio State, likely). The at-large berths are much more complicated. If all favorites win this weekend, the committee will likely be left with a decision between three teams for two spots: Indiana, Clemson and the ACC championship game runner-up (SMU/Miami). However, chaos looms. What if Texas A&M upsets Texas to reach the SEC title game and Syracuse upsets Miami to instead send Clemson to play SMU for the ACC crown? Either way, upsets of Alabama and Ole Miss last week have put the ACC in an advantageous position to get two or three teams into the field. It’s ironic in a way. More than a year ago, during Swarbrick’s presentation of the 12-team format to each league group, ACC coaches expressed more opposition to it than virtually anyone else. Clemson coach Dabo Swinney led a push against the expanded model, and North Carolina’s Mack Brown held similar feelings. They peppered Swarbrick with comments and concerns. “At one point, I had to tell them, ‘Look, guys, I am just relaying you the information,’” he recalls, laughing about it now. In the end, after a near two-year approval process that featured heated arguments, hurt feelings and meeting storm-outs, conference leaders agreed on the format. In many ways, it was historic. At least five times since 1976, college sports leaders deeply examined a football playoff only to abandon the idea for various reasons — the influence of anti-playoff executives from lucrative bowl games; the academic calendar; and athlete health and safety concerns. Now, weeks away from kickoff to this historic happening, the future format remains ambiguous. This past spring, CFP leaders — the 10 conference commissioners and Notre Dame’s athletic director — re-evaluated the format when they agreed on a new six-year extension that begins with the 2026 playoff. They didn’t settle on a format, instead only agreeing to protections that guarantee (1) the five highest-ranked champions an automatic berth, (2) the field to be 12 or 14 teams in size and (3) Notre Dame to receive an at-large bid if it is ranked inside the top 12 or 14, depending on the field size. Some are already wanting change. The Big Ten and SEC contend that they hold decision-making powers over a future format. During negotiations in the spring, the Big Ten proposed a 14-team playoff featuring multiple automatic qualifiers for the power conferences: three each for the SEC and Big Ten; two each for the ACC and Big 12; one reserved for the best G5 champion; and three at-large spots. The 3-3-2-2-1 concept was roundly rejected. In an interview with Yahoo Sports from Big Ten football media days in July, commissioner Tony Petitti suggested that such a model isn’t off the table. “You want to see what happens first,” Sankey said this week in an interview with Yahoo Sports. “One of the lessons from the creators of the CFP is not to sit there and tweak it all the time. I’m not jumping out to say we need to do this or that.” Asked for his thoughts on conferences having multiple automatic qualifiers, Sankey deadpanned, “I don’t have any today.” Others are more opinionated on the subject. “Anything that is artificial or invitational, I’d push back on,” ACC commissioner Jim Phillips said. “You don’t reward conferences or teams at the beginning of the year, you reward them at the end of the year by their play. At the end of the day, what happens on the field should matter.” Phillips said commissioners “made an agreement” to study how the 12-team playoff transpires this year before making any future decisions. Many believe that the CFP will eventually grow to either 14 or 16 teams. “Bracket creep,” says Hancock, is a very normal process for any tournament. In fact, the NCAA is exploring expanding the men’s basketball tournament by four or eight teams. Bowlsby, like many of the architects of the format, feels as if he holds some “ownership” of it, he says. He’d hate to see it changed and so soon. He’s against the Big Ten’s proposal. “It’s really important that this is something that raises college football,” he said. “It isn’t about raising the SEC and Big Ten or any other individual conference. It’s about a celebration of college football at the end of the year. I suspect there would be some one-sided games, but I think it is important that everyone that plays at FBS has legitimate access to the playoff.” Soon, just days from now, college football will be introduced to its first-ever multi-round College Football Playoff. On-campus postseason games, first-round byes and bubble-bursting decisions, the relics can be found buried deep in Swarbrick’s basement. And that’s right where they’ll stay. “It’s creating the interest that we hoped it would,” Hancock said. “Some people use the word anger. I use the word interest instead. There’s just a fascination with what is going to happen. “That’s what we wanted it to be.”"

His former team, the Philadelphia 76ers, are off to a dreadful 3-14 start to the season. Don't mistake that for a ""Simmons is coming back to Philly"" reunion, but Simmons did call Joel Embiid and try to patch things up, reports Ramona Shelburne of ESPN in a fantastic story about the 76ers’ slow start. He'd even reached out to Embiid and others last summer, league sources said, hoping to mend fences. Simmons, who is in the final year of his contract in Brooklyn, has shown how he can still impact a game with his passing, length and defense. But in the second quarter of the game Friday, he also missed the rim on a layup in a clip that quickly went viral -- reminding everyone of how his time in Philadelphia went awry. Could they ever try to figure it out together again? One source called it unlikely, but stranger things have happened. Especially with the Sixers. Stranger things have happened, but in the case of the 76ers they would have to deal with a fan backlash if they brought back Simmons that would not be worth the price. Also, it's not like these two were ever tight, Simmons had said previously there was not much of a relationship between them even when he was in Philly. Simmons will land a new contract with an NBA team next offseason, but one much closer to the league minimum than the $40 million a season he is making this year. And it won't be in Philly."

Ridley continued his strong second half of the season in Week 12 when he caught five of six targets for 93 yards. He’s now played five games since DeAndre Hopkins was traded and has averaged an elite 32% target share across these contests. Since Week 8, Ridley has averaged 14 fantasy points per game which ranks eighth among all receivers ahead of Puka Nacua and Terry McLaurin. Ridley has benefitted from Will Levis playing better the past month. During this time, Levis ranks fourth among all QBs, averaging 9.6 yards per attempt. This week, Ridley gets a beneficial matchup against the Commanders. Washington ranks 29th in coverage this season according to PFF and they allow the fifth-most touchdowns to wide receivers. The Titans are six-point underdogs this week so there’s an increased chance they play from behind. If so, this could lead to more targets and production for Ridley. Make sure he’s in your lineup this week. Addison is coming off a big week against the Bears. He produced 162 yards on eight catches and found the end zone. Addison was the No. 1 fantasy receiver on the entire week after this career-high performance. He benefitted from the Bears focusing most of their attention on Justin Jefferson. This allowed Addison to see plenty of one-on-one matchups and he took advantage of these. Addison has now finished as a top-24 receiver in three of his last four games. He’s coming off back-to-back games of at least eight targets and a touchdown. The most impressive part about all of this is he’s found so much success despite difficult matchups against the Titans and Bears. But this week Addison finally gets a good matchup. He’ll face the Cardinals this week who allow the 10th most efficiency per passing play this season. Last week, Jaxon Smith-Njigba totaled 77 yards and a touchdown against the Cardinals. Expect Arizona to focus most of their attention on Jefferson and for Addison to see lots of one-on-one matchups again. He’s a start this week. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Irving had a great matchup last week against the Giants who allow the most rushing yards per play. We deemed him to be in the best spot of the week in Week 12 and he came through for us. Irving turned 18 touches into 151 total yards and a touchdown. He posted his first top-five finish of the season and even saw an improvement in his receiving-game usage. The Bucs rookie ran 59% of the team's routes, his second-highest mark in a game this season, leading to six receptions. This week, Irving gets another elite matchup against the Panthers. Carolina allows the most rushing yards per game and second-most rushing touchdowns this season. Opposing backfields average 29.3 fantasy points per game against the Panthers, the most in the league. Even if you’re loaded at the running back position, make sure Irving is in your lineup this week. McConkey is coming off a rare game where he didn’t lead the Chargers in target share. In Week 12, McConkey earned 17% of the team's targets in a strong matchup against the Ravens. He saw two fewer targets than teammate Josh Palmer. Despite this, McConkey still led the team with six catches and 83 yards. He’s now averaging 103 yards the past two weeks and continues to look great as a route runner. There’s a chance the Chargers feature McConkey even more moving forward given Quentin Johnston’s drop issues. This week the quality matchups continue for McConkey against the Falcons. The last time we saw Atlanta was in Week 10 before their bye, when they gave up 307 yards and four touchdowns to Bo Nix and the Broncos. Atlanta allows the seventh most receiving yards per game and ranks 31st in pressure this season according to PFF; Justin Herbert should have plenty of time to throw this week. McConkey is once again a top-20 option and start this week. Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy has claimed multiple times this season that Dowdle is the team’s lead. We’ve seen glimpses of Dowdle operating as the clear No. 1 at times this year, but Week 12 was the best usage we’ve seen for him this season. He played 64% of the snaps and handled a season-high 70% of the backfield carries. This resulted in 98 total yards on 22 touches. Ezekiel Elliott earned just three yards on 12 snaps in this game. We finally saw workhorse usage out of Dowdle. This increased role comes at the perfect time. In Week 13, Dowdle will take on the Giants on Thanksgiving Day. New York allows the most rushing yards per play this season according to NFL Pro. Last week, Bucky Irving totaled 151 yards and a touchdown against the Giants. Irving averaged 8.4 yards per touch against this New York defense that allows the second most explosive runs of 10+ yards. Dowdle is a top-24 RB this week and worth starting in most 12-team leagues."

There’s a lot at stake for the College Football Playoff and in the Big 12. Nine teams enter Week 14 with a chance of winning the Big 12 title, though some teams’ chances are a lot better than others. Arizona State, for example, is in the title game with a win over Arizona. West Virginia needs to beat Texas Tech and then hope for a whole lot of unlikely outcomes. Rivalry week only features two games between ranked teams, but don’t let that make you think it won’t be an entertaining weekend of football. Just look at what happened in Week 13 when three SEC teams in the hunt for the playoff all lost to unranked opponents on the road. Here’s what to watch for Week 14. (All times are Eastern and all odds are from BetMGM.) Time: Noon | TV: Fox | Line: Ohio State -21 | Total: 43.5 There’s no better opportunity than now for Ohio State coach Ryan Day to finally get a win over Michigan. The Wolverines have won three straight games after Ohio State took down the Wolverines eight straight times from 2012 through 2019. We can envision Michigan’s defense making it tough for Ohio State’s offense to move the ball. The Wolverines aren’t as good as they were a season ago on that side of the ball, but are still plenty talented. However, it’s hard to see how Michigan’s offense does much of anything against Ohio State. The Buckeyes’ front ran rampant on Indiana’s offensive line and wreaked havoc in their Week 13 win. Michigan averages fewer than five yards a play and QB Davis Warren averages less than six yards per passing attempt. TE Colston Loveland is the focal point of the passing attack as Michigan’s wide receivers have statistics that look like they came from the 1940s. Semaj Morgan leads all UM wide receivers with 23 catches. He has 134 yards. Morgan and Tyler Morris are the only two wide receivers with more than eight catches. They’ve combined for 45 catches for 368 yards and three scores. Ohio State’s No. 3 receiver Carnell Tate has 35 catches for 525 yards and four scores all by himself. Ohio State appears just too well-rounded for Michigan to pull the upset. But this is a heated rivalry game. And Michigan doesn’t have any pressure. Time: Noon | TV: ESPN | Line: Clemson -2.5 | Total: 49.5 South Carolina is still on the outside of the College Football Playoff even after the mess that was Week 13 in the SEC. The Gamecocks have been fantastic over the second half of the season, but their 27-3 loss to Ole Miss will probably end up being a playoff dealbreaker. Clemson is still alive for the ACC title, but the Tigers need help and this rivalry game has no impact on that. Clemson is in the ACC title game against SMU if Miami loses at Syracuse. If the Hurricanes win, Clemson is sitting out conference championship weekend. However, a big win over South Carolina would go a long way to boosting the Tigers’ playoff hopes. If Clemson can beat South Carolina by two scores, it’ll have one fewer loss than a team like Alabama and a more convincing home win. The Gamecocks lost 27-25 to the Tide in Tuscaloosa. Clemson’s ability to stop South Carolina’s staunch defensive front and derail LaNorris Sellers will be key. Sellers has been the key to the Gamecocks’ five-game win streak as he’s made massive strides as a passer this season. The redshirt freshman is 77-of-128 passing for 1,317 yards and 13 TDs with just two interceptions in those five wins. Time: 3:30 p.m. | TV: CBS | Line: Notre Dame -7.5 | Total: 51.5 The Trojans can help salvage a frustrating season and potentially derail Notre Dame’s playoff hopes with an upset. USC used a 10-point fourth quarter to beat UCLA 19-13 in Week 13. Jayden Maiava was 19-of-35 passing for 221 yards and a TD in his second start after taking over for Miller Moss. Moss was benched following the team’s 26-21 loss at Washington. USC ranks just 56th in the country at 29 points per game and hasn’t scored more than 28 since a 42-20 win over Rutgers on Oct. 25. Can the offense reliably move the ball against a Notre Dame defense that’s been fantastic recently? Notre Dame allows just 11.6 points per game and no opponent has scored more than 14 points since Louisville had 24 in late September. Those 24 points are also the most that anyone has scored against Notre Dame this season. Opponents are averaging just 273 total yards and 4.2 yards per play against the Fighting Irish this season and quarterbacks are bearing the brunt of those struggles. The numbers are skewed a bit because of games against Army and Navy, but opposing QBs are completing under 48% of their passes for 140 yards a game. The Irish are also a very bad matchup for a USC defense that allows over five yards a carry. Notre Dame’s run game is one of the best in the country as Jeremiyah Love has turned into a home-run hitter. Love has 121 carries for 850 yards and 14 TDs. Time: 7:30 p.m. | TV: ABC | Line: Texas -5.5 | Total: 48.5 It’s fantastic that these two longtime rivals are finally playing each other again. And it’s made even better by the stakes. The winner will play Georgia for the SEC title on Dec. 7. The Longhorns and Aggies haven’t played since 2011, when Texas needed a late field goal in College Station for a 27-25 win. That was A&M’s final game in the Big 12 before moving to the SEC. All signs point to Quinn Ewers playing on Saturday night after suffering an ankle injury against Kentucky. Ewers hasn’t thrown a pick over his last three games since tossing two against Vanderbilt on Oct. 26. He’s thrown for nine TDs in that span and completed two-thirds of his passes. However, he’s thrown for fewer than 200 yards in each of Texas’ last two games despite attempting over 30 throws in either game. A&M found itself in a 21-0 hole against Auburn before coming back to tie the game before halftime and even took a three-point lead late in the fourth quarter. Amari Daniels rushed for 90 yards and a score, but also had the game-tying two-point conversion go through his hands in the fourth overtime of the loss. If the Aggies can trouble Texas’ defense with Daniels and Marcel Reed, they have a real chance to pull the upset. Opponents rush for just over three yards a carry against the Longhorns. Time: 7:30 p.m. | TV: Fox | Line: Iowa State -3 | Total: 51.5 Farmageddon has serious Big 12 title implications. Both teams are alive for the conference title, though Kansas State will know by kickoff if it still has a chance. If there’s a four-way tie at 7-2, Iowa State is in the Big 12 title game against Arizona State. If the Cyclones lose, they’re out of the title race. The Cyclones escaped with a 31-28 win at Utah in Week 13, though the Utes got a pick-6 and also scored a TD on a blocked punt. It was the fourth game Iowa State has played this season that was decided by three or fewer points and the Cyclones are 3-1 in those contests. Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel have been the most productive receiving duo in college football this season. Higgins has 77 grabs for 1,015 yards and eight scores while Noel has 61 catches for 976 yards and five TDs. No other Iowa State player has more than 16 catches. Kansas State’s special teams have been rough lately, though QB Avery Johnson appears back to full strength. The Wildcats ran all over Cincinnati in Week 13 as Johnson had three total touchdowns and DJ Giddens rushed for 143 yards and two scores on just 15 carries. Opposing teams have gashed Iowa State’s run defense this season. The Cyclones have allowed over 200 yards rushing in three of their last five games and give up over five yards a carry. Memphis at No. 17 Tulane (Thursday, 7:30 p.m., ESPN): Don’t be too quick to rule out the Green Wave from the College Football Playoff. Tulane could make some noise with convincing wins over Memphis on Thanksgiving and then against Army in the AAC title game. If there’s a mess in the Big 12, Tulane could kick the conference out of the playoff entirely. Oregon State at No. 11 Boise State (Friday, Noon, Fox): Boise State currently holds the fourth and final bye in the College Football Playoff bracket. Oregon State is playing to get to a bowl game. Ashton Jeanty is playing for the Heisman Trophy. This game is at the same time as Colorado’s regular-season finale vs. Oklahoma State. Get your remote thumb ready to flip back and forth between the top two Heisman contenders. No. 8 Tennessee at Vanderbilt (Noon, ABC): The Commodores have the chance to beat both Alabama and Tennessee in the same season. Vanderbilt has already clinched its first bowl berth since 2018 and is looking for an eight-win season for the first time since 2013. Tennessee, meanwhile, just needs to win. A victory likely cements the Vols’ place in the College Football Playoff. Auburn at No. 13 Alabama (3:30 p.m., ABC): Don’t rule out any outcome after what happened in Week 13. Alabama scored just three points in a 21-point loss at Oklahoma and Auburn beat Texas A&M in four overtimes. Remember fourth-and-31 a season ago? We sure do. No. 6 Miami at Syracuse (3:30 p.m., ESPN): This could be a sneaky test for the Hurricanes. Miami is a 10.5-point favorite and the 67.5-point total for the game is the highest of any Week 14 contest. Syracuse’s passing offense has been explosive with former Ohio State QB Kyle McCord outside of the disastrous game at Pitt. The first one to 40 wins."

But what about the things I’m NOT thankful for??? How about that? Can I write that? Cause I’m pissed about the Commanders' loss to Dallas last week. Seriously, man, make a kick. An extra point. Either one of them. Or a field goal. Or make a tackle on a kickoff return. Or don’t fumble when you’re finally driving down 13-9. I’m angry about all of it. Or maybe try throwing deep to Terry McLaurin before it’s the end of the game. Cause I’m not thankful about THAT either. Or the fact they left Luke Schoonmaker WIDE OPEN on a busted coverage. Not real thrilled about any of that. You know what else I’m not thankful for? Texas A&M (I grew up in College Station) losing to a 4-6 Auburn team in FOUR overtimes by dropping a two-point conversion. That sucked. Not thankful I wasted my Saturday night watching THAT. Or that I was second-screening it with Alabama (my son is a sophomore at Bama, so I’ve been Roll Tiding for two years now) getting their butts kicked by Oklahoma. Jalen Milroe drives me crazy. Not thankful for playing against Saquon Barkley in four leagues last week. That wasn’t fun. Or that, when the game was over, and the Eagles were just trying to run out the clock and the Rams KNEW what Philly was going to do the Rams STILL couldn’t stop a 70-yard TD run by Saquon… AGAIN! How many of those can a defense give up before you just get cut from the league? Blew the Under on the game which totally should have hit, he said bitterly. Not thankful about Quentin Johnston dropping what would have been a very long play or maybe a score on Monday night. Not real thrilled with Keenan Allen and Jaylen Waddle going OFF last week while, you know, SITTING ON MY BENCH. Oh, you know what else I’m NOT thankful for. My ""Ride or Die,"" Kyler Murray, being the ONLY QB in the last four games to NOT have at least 17 points against the Seahawks. Like, he was playing so well. And they were coming off the bye. He had TWO weeks to prepare and yet... ARGHHH! Would it kill him to throw ONE touchdown to Trey McBride? Just one? So yeah, not feeling that these days either. Had the second highest score last week in my NBA fantasy league only to realize I was playing the highest scoring team in the league. Good times. Good times. So, yeah, as you gather around the table this week with your loved ones, remember there’s lots of stuff to NOT be thankful for. Definitely bring it up, loudly and often, hopefully after a few drinks. That’s what the holidays really are about. HA. Okay, I feel better now. There are some things I’m grateful for. Having this column that allows me to vent like that. Having a column like this that allows me to blatantly promote stuff. Like, at FantasyLife.com where we are doing a 50% OFF sale for Black Friday (you heard me… FIFTY PERCENT OFF).

And the column is useless if no one is reading it. My bosses here at NBC are very, very happy which means so many of you have graciously followed me and found your way here and I am incredibly grateful for that. So, thank you. Seriously. I am thankful for my health, family, friends, and my NBC family. I can’t tell you how many times my wife has heard me laugh out loud and turn to me, saying “what?” And I just hold up my phone. “It’s my show group chat.” We laugh way too much doing our shows. And I’m thankful to my producer Damian Dabrowski, who, as always, has helped me with, well, everything, including this column at various points. Life’s too short. We have a few days off here. So, between football and food, take a few moments over the next few days to tell someone they mean a lot to you. You never know when you won’t have that chance again. It takes just a few moments, and it’ll mean a lot to you and to them, you know? You will never regret doing it. By the way, hey, you mean a lot to me. Let’s get to it. After mocking Tommy DeVito’s hand gesture celebration last week, Baker Mayfield was asked postgame if he has any Italian heritage. He responded: “I haven’t done a 23andMe.” Well, I have looked into Mayfield’s ancestry, and it turns out he is 73% QB1 on his fantasy side. Mayfield is QB4 on the season and has finished as a top 10 QB in eight of his 11 starts this season (there’s that 73%), along with five weeks finishing in the top five. Now he faces a Panthers team that is allowing touchdown passes at the highest rate. Carolina also ranks 32nd in pressure rate. The QB1s are a proud people, and I see Mayfield making them proud again this week. He’s my QB6 this week. Over the past four weeks, the Raiders are allowing 24.0 fantasy PPG to opposing quarterbacks. During that same stretch, they are also allowing touchdown passes at the highest rate in the league and, going back to Week 5, Vegas has given up 18-plus points to a quarterback in six of its last seven games. Meanwhile, after a very slow start to his fantasy season, putting up less than 15 fantasy points in four of his first six games of the season, Patrick Mahomes has now bested that mark in five straight games. He has also thrown for three touchdown passes in three of his last four games. When you’re giving thanks on Thursday, remember to save a thank you for the fantasy gods for restoring Mahomes’ fantasy production to us. Mahomes is a top 10 fantasy QB in Week 13. Others receiving votes: Only one time this season has C.J. Stroud put up more than 18 fantasy points. That came back in Week 4 when he went for 23.5 on the Jaguars. Last year against Jacksonville, Stroud had games of 20.6 and 30.9 fantasy points against them. Not many people know this, but C.J. stands for Crushes Jaguars Stroud. True fact. But I see Stroud having another big game this week against a Jaguars defense that is allowing a league-high 8.5 yards per pass attempt. Get this: Seven of the last nine quarterbacks to face Jacksonville have gone for 20-plus fantasy points. … Yes, Matthew Stafford doesn’t have a cool first name like Crushes Jaguars. Because he has the COOLEST name of all: Matthew. Glad we all agree on that. Anyway, Stafford has a great matchup this week against a Saints defense that – over the last four weeks – has the league’s 31st ranked pass defense. And, of the last seven quarterbacks the Saints have faced, five of them have thrown for at least 275 yards. Since Week 5, Jordan Love has finished as a top 12 quarterback just three times. It’s been even worse recently. Over the past four weeks, Green Bay ranks top three in rush rate overall and in the red zone. Not surprisingly, in Green Bay’s three games over that stretch, Love has scored less than 15 fantasy points in two of them. I know, I know … the Packers are trying to play the kind of ball-control style that translates to success in the postseason. But that does nothing for people who have Jordan Love and are trying to get into the fantasy postseason, now does it. What’s more important: ONE team’s postseason, or the postseason fortunes of TENS OF THOUSANDS of Jordan Love managers? Exactly. The Packers are selfish. Anyway, it’s likely we see with our eyes (on NBC and Peacock, I’m a company man) another disappointing fantasy performance from Love this week against Miami. So far this season, only three quarterbacks have scored 17-plus fantasy points against the Dolphins. Miami also allows the fourth-fewest yards per pass attempt. Add in the fact the Mike McDaniel is likely to try and run the ball a lot since Tua has struggled so much on the road in cold weather and it’s unlikely Romeo Doubs plays (this is the Thursday night game and Doubs is in the concussion protocol) I have Love outside the top 20 at the QB position this week. Thanksgiving is a great time to see family. Grandparents, nieces, nephews, uncles, aunts, cousins. But if I may, I’d suggest you avoid one particular cousin this Thanksgiving: Kirk Cousins. It’s a short week and you get the jokes you get. I apologize for nothing. Anyways, Cousin Kirk is facing that tough Chargers defense this week and Atlanta’s implied team total is just 23 points. That matters because when the Falcons score less than 30 points this season, Cousins is averaging just 10.3 PPG. And that Chargers defense is truly tough on quarterbacks. Only two quarterbacks have thrown for 250-plus yards on LAC this year (Lamar Jackson just threw for 177 against them on Monday night). And get this: Five of the six QBs to score 18 or more fantasy points on the Chargers this season did it with either a rushing score or by running for more than 40 yards. And while I don’t know if Kirk is a kissing Cousins, he’s definitely not a running Cousins. I have him down at QB22 this week. Kyren Williams’s ball security issues popped up again on Sunday night, fumbling twice against the Eagles and losing one of them. That’s the bad news. The good news is that fumbles equal minus-2 fantasy points, while rushing scores equal plus-6. Yes, it’s true: 6 > -2. I’m very smart. I’m also smart enough to know that Williams has a good opportunity to get multiple plus-6’s against a Saints team that has allowed multiple rushing scores to running backs in four of their past six games. Don’t forget: Williams ranks second in both red zone and goal-line rushes this season. Williams should also be able to do some damage against the Saints before reaching the end zone. New Orleans allows the second-most YPC (5.1) to running backs this season and six of the last seven RBs to face the Saints scored at least 16 fantasy points. I have Williams as RB4 this week. In the three games since Zack Moss was placed on injured reserve, Chase Brown has averaged 27 touches per game. That includes a full 100% of the team's RB touches over that stretch, along with a 17% target share and five-plus receptions in every game. Granted, Zac Taylor said this week that he wants to manage Brown’s usage a little more going forward, but let’s first manage our panic over Taylor saying that. Cincinnati is in must-win territory now, so Taylor is still going to lean on his best back. And hey, if Brown’s workload drops 10%, he’s still getting NINETY PERCENT of Cincinnati’s RB touches. I like that a lot against a Steelers defense that has allowed 20-plus fantasy points to running backs in eight straight games. As anyone with kids under 5 know, Chase is on the Case! Bucky Irving (two first names, always a crowd pleaser) is coming off season-highs in touches (18), scrimmage yards (151) and target share (20%). He also out-snapped Rachaad White last week for the first time in a game in which they were both healthy. What a showoff. But I like Irving to show out again this week against a Panthers defense that has allowed the most fantasy points to running backs this season. And to be clear, it’s not just because of one good Week 12 performance. Since Week 6, Irving is RB10 in PPG with 15-plus points in five of six games during that stretch. By the way, did you know that an anagram for “Bucky Irving” is “Big Curvy Kin”? But I suppose I already touched on kissing cousins earlier. Irving is a top 20 back for me this week. Others receiving votes: Over the past four weeks, Chicago is allowing the second-most rushing yards per game to running backs. During that same stretch, the Bears have also given up the third-most rushing touchdowns (6). Now they face a back who leads the NFL in goal-line rushes, David Montgomery, who may be bent on revenge facing his former team. Okay, maybe not revenge. I suppose that going from the Chicago Bears to these modern-day Lions wouldn’t make anyone vengeful. Let’s say Montgomery is bent on gratitude. Either way, assuming he plays (he got banged up last Sunday but as of this writing is expected to play) I like his Week 13 matchup. … I also like the matchup for Tony Pollard this week, unfortunately, against my Washington Commanders. Over the past four weeks, teams facing Washington are averaging the third-most RB rushes per game at 28.3. The Commanders have also allowed the fourth-most rushing touchdowns to backs since Week 6. … The Giants have allowed 17-plus fantasy points to a running back in each of their past three games and, over the past four weeks, the Giants are allowing 133 rushing yards per game to RBs. Maybe the Giants can bring former scout team safety Daniel Jones back and give him a go at linebacker? It’s an idea. Anyway, give me some Rico Dowdle, who is coming off a season-high 22 touches last week, this week against the Giants. The Vikings have not given up double-digit fantasy points to an opposing running back in four straight games. Over that same stretch, Minnesota is allowing only 37 rushing yards per game to backs and 2.7 YPC. It’s just more of what the Vikings defense has been doing all season. Only three RBs have rushed for more than 51 yards against the Vikings this season. For good measure, Minnesota also limits running backs in the passing game, allowing the second-lowest catch rate to running backs. So, Conner will have a tough go trying to run on the Vikings, and he will have a tough go catching passes against the Vikings. Outside of the Cardinals letting Conner throw the ball or attempt field goals, I’m not very optimistic about his fantasy upside this week. I have him outside my top 20 at the position. Those who are 3 years old and younger can’t understand this, but having to watch the Detroit Lions on Thanksgiving used to be a bad thing about the holiday. Heck, not only do my toddler league mates struggle to grasp this, but many of them also still struggle with object permanence. Idiots. But times have changed. The Lions being bad at football was way back when kneecaps weren’t even a Thanksgiving spread staple. But the Lions are good now. Very good. And that’s very bad for D’Andre Swift. Only three running backs this season have scored 15-plus fantasy points against the Lions. Over the past four weeks, Detroit is allowing the third-fewest PPG to backs. A big reason for that is that the Lions rank top three in fewest receptions and receiving yards allowed to the position. It’s a bad matchup for Swift. His Thanksgiving upside is further impacted by the fact that over the past two games, Roschon Johnson has seen 86% of Chicago's red zone rushes and three of its four goal-line carries. I’m putting Swift outside my top 25 at the position this week, even though most in my toddler league can’t count past 25. The dummies. Since Pittsburgh’s Week 9 bye, Jaylen Warren is averaging more yards per game than Najee Harris and has played only seven fewer snaps. Also, since the bye, Harris is averaging only 2.9 YPC and he has less 3.6 YPC in all three of Pittsburgh’s games. (Remind me to not go on vacation wherever Najee Harris spent his bye week.) Anyway, over that same four-week time period, Cincinnati ranks top 10 in fewest fantasy points and rushing yards allowed to running backs. All that is more than enough to put Harris outside my top 30 RBs this week. Back when the Texans and Jaguars played in Week 4, Nico Collins put up a 12-151-1 line on 15 targets for 33.1 fantasy points. He shredded Jacksonville. But instead of the Jaguars defense viewing that as a low point to try to improve from, it seems they decided to just live at that low point for the rest of their existence. Because for the season, Jacksonville is allowing the most yards per game and most touchdowns on deep passes. And, over the past four weeks, Jacksonville is allowing the most yards per game to wide receivers and the third-most PPG to the position. I have Collins as WR3 this week. Since Russell Wilson became the starter, George Pickens has a 29% target share and, over the same span, Pickens also leads all wide receivers with eight end zone targets. He also leads the league in fans saying, “wait, what the hell did he just do?” But, even so, it’s hard not to feel good about Pickens heading into a matchup against a Bengals team that has allowed 18-plus fantasy points to an opposing WR in five straight games. Pickens has nearly unlimited upside in this game. Maybe not enough to take on the Mr. Unlimited nickname, but a lot. He’s a top 10 wide receiver. Courtland Sutton reworked his contract this offseason and the result was a more incentive-laden deal. Heading into Week 13, he is six yards away from earning a $250,000 bonus and 321 yards away from getting $1.5 million. While Sutton could easily get the six yards in the first few plays of the game, he won’t reach that second one by game’s end Sunday. I mean, I think he won’t. He probably won’t. But he might get close. Because get this: Since Week 8, Sutton leads the NFL in receiving yards and is WR3 in PPG (20.3). He’s had at least a 25% target share and 70 receiving yards in all five games during that stretch. Over that same timeframe, Cleveland is allowing the fourth-most yards per game to receivers. Sutton is money this week. Both figuratively and literally. The Packers are allowing the third-highest catch rate to tight ends this season, and TEs who have seen a 20% target share against Green Bay this season are averaging 16.7 PPG. Considering Jonnu Smith has a target share of at least 22% in three of his past four games, and four of his past six, he could be in line for a nice night on Thursday. Well, as nice a night as someone who lives in Miami can have in 20-something degree Wisconsin weather. Smith is TE5 this week. Others receiving votes: Over the past four weeks, the Commanders are tied for the second-most touchdowns allowed on deep passes. Now they face Calvin Ridley who, since the DeAndre Hopkins trade, is sixth in the NFL in receiving yards per game at 90.2. … Since Week 3, Jakobi Meyers has just a single game with fewer than seven targets. Even with Aidan O’Connell or Desmond Ridder (maybe we see both!) at the controls, I like that kind of usage for Meyers against a Chiefs team that is allowing the fifth-most PPG to WRs over the past four weeks. … The offensive coordinator change sure has gotten more out of DJ Moore, amiright. Hey, I wrote that joke high out of my mind on tryptophan. Tis the season. But for real: Moore has seven receptions in both games since Shane Waldron was excused, compared to just one such game previously. Moore has also seen 82% of his receiving yards come after the catch in those games along with a 2.2 aDOT. Now he takes on a Lions team that allows the most receptions and yards to wide receivers on passes that go fewer than five air yards. … Since Week 7, Khalil Shakir ranks fourth among wide receivers in receptions per game (7.2) and he’s notched at least six receptions in every game he’s played over that stretch. He should have a good day this week against a 49ers defense that allows the fourth-most yards per reception to the slot. … The Panthers have given up the most touchdowns to tight ends this season. They have also allowed 14-plus points to a tight end in four of their past five games. So, give me some Cade Otton in Carolina this week. … Over the past four weeks, Tucker Kraft has seen 50% of Green Bay’s red zone attempts. That could even go up this week with Romeo Doubs unlikely to play. Kraft also has a good matchup against a Dolphins team that allows the fourth-most PPG to tight ends (21.4). Plus, and this is just a hunch, but if anyone is going to catch a touchdown pass in 20-degree weather on Thanksgiving night, a 6-foot-5, 258-pound Packers tight end from South Dakota feels like a safe bet. While Saquon Barkley was busy destroying the NFL and dominating the headlines, the Eagles quietly learned how to play pass defense. Since its Week 5 bye, Philadelphia is allowing the second-fewest PPG to wide receivers. The only WRs to score even 10-plus fantasy points against the Eagles over that stretch are Ja’Marr Chase, Puka Nacua, and Cooper Kupp – and Nacua is the only WR to have more than 60 receiving yards during that span. Is it possible Zay Flowers has a good game on Sunday? Sure, it’s possible. But not likely. I have him outside my top 20 WRs. The Jaguars have a bottom-six implied team total this week. So, points will likely be hard to come by on the scoreboard, and fantasy points will likely be hard to come by for Brian Thomas, Jr. especially. Houston allows the lowest completion rate on deep passes for the season. And, if that’s not bad enough, Thomas is likely to get the Derek Stingley, Jr. shadow this week. Sure, if Trevor Lawrence plays, Thomas gets a very slight upgrade. But I’m still keeping him outside my top 30 wide receivers this week. Kyle Pitts has less than three points in two of his past three games. Now, if Kyle Pitts was an NHL player and this was a fantasy hockey column, scoring less than three points wouldn’t be a huge cause for concern. But I have to inform you that this is not a hockey column. (Sorry to my Canadian readers.) Get this: Over the past four weeks, Pitts is TE37 in PPG and he has just one game all season with a target hare of 20% or more … and that came way back in Week 7. Now he gets a Chargers defense that is allowing the fifth-fewest yards per reception to tight ends. The Chargers have also allowed just one touchdown to a TE all season. I have Pitts down at TE20 this week. Or, for my Canadian readers who have stuck around … I have Pitts down at TEh20 this week."

MORE: 2025 Cup schedule | Silly Season moves for ’25 A new wave of drivers is finding its footing at NASCAR‘s highest levels, a group that includes Gragson, Riley Herbst, Zane Smith, Todd Gilliland and Harrison Burton among others. All are in the midst of their 20s, fighting for successful careers as stock-car racers. The intensity on the track is heightened with every lap logged, each door slammed and each flag waved. But there has to be a compromise once the checkered flag is unfurled. “They say bring your friends to the racetrack,” Gragson said ahead of the season finale at Phoenix Raceway. “But this is a grueling, grueling schedule and you’re pissed off by everyone else 38 weeks of the year. And you have to be around them 38 weeks a year. … So we can find that balance and race hard. We put each other in bad positions sometimes, and it doesn’t work out. But I feel like we all do a pretty good job at being able to find that balance and separation between, hey, when we’re inside the track, we’re here to compete against each other when we put the helmets on. But when we walk outside the gates, we got each other’s back at the end of the day.” The collection of competitors — including Gragson, Smith, Herbst, Gilliland, Burton, and 2025 Xfinity Series full-timers Christian Eckes and Sheldon Creed — shared a rental house together in Arizona after the 2024 campaign drew to a close, all in an effort to unwind. “It’s hard to have friends in this industry,” Smith said. “But fortunately, we do have a friend group that has a similar mindset of, hey, let’s leave everything on the track, and that’s work. Be mad at each other on the track, but put it behind you and move forward come the next week. We’re adults. We can hash it out or whatnot. But it’s definitely fun to have a few beers and hang out after races with a group of friends.” With his rookie year in the Cup Series complete, Smith added at Phoenix just how important his friend group has become. The 25-year-old piloted the No. 71 Spire Motorsports Chevrolet in 2024 through an agreement with Trackhouse Racing that was announced as a multiyear contract. Trackhouse, however, announced in late August that Smith would not return to the program in 2025, leaving Smith searching for options in the year ahead. All the while, he’s had plenty of support from those around him. “Time and time again, it’s the same group that’s behind me, and I won’t ever forget that,” said Smith, the 2022 Truck Series champion. “I hope I get to experience the easy days, because I always remember those ones that hung out with me during those [difficult] times. Super fortunate for those ones, and they know who they are. But we’ll continue to move forward, and we’ll be all right.” The tight-knit bond between these racers should not be confused for any on-track favors, though. Burton, who became the first of the group to score a NASCAR Cup Series win back in August at Daytona, said he’s seen some sentiment that racers who are friends “don’t race as hard as they used to.” “No chance,” he said ahead of the NASCAR Awards in Charlotte. “I can promise you, we race each other harder. I can think off the top of my head the amount of times me and Todd Gilliland have ran into each other, me and Noah having our fight or racing really hard.” Indeed, Burton had no problem exchanging both words and punches with Gragson after a 2020 Xfinity race at Kentucky Speedway after contact put Burton in the wall. “We’ve all had our moments where we don’t like each other,” said Burton, who returns to Xfinity competition in 2025. “Like me and Noah fought each other and now are friends, right? And we were friends before that and are friends after that. And I think it just shows there’s a fraternity there, and we all came up through the same roots together, race each other and then just get along good. We’re all just friends, right? But then when the helmet turns on, we race each other really, really, really hard, and obviously to the point where we’ll fight each other as well.” Next season, Gragson and Gilliland will reunite as teammates at Front Row Motorsports. The two previously raced together in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series for Kyle Busch Motorsports in 2018, but their connection dates back even further, competing in what’s now known as the ARCA Menards Series East with plenty of fierce battles both there and in late models. “It’s been really cool to see Todd’s evolution as a driver and his craft as a driver. It’s great to see,” Gragson said. “All of us drivers, we’re all competing against each other, but at the end of the day, we want what’s best for each other. We don’t want to see anybody else fail. We want to beat each other, but we don’t want to see somebody fail. And I think Todd’s done an unbelievable job throughout his career and building his brand and the driver that he’s become. So I think we can work together really well next year. We’re good buddies, which helps. We know each other. We’ve been teammates before. I think it’ll be a very easy transition.”"

Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",USC's improving offensive line faces big test against Notre Dame,https://sports.yahoo.com/uscs-improving-offensive-line-faces-013332210.html,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 01:33:32 GMT","With No. 5 Notre Dame and its fearsome front on tap Saturday, there's no denying the leap USC's offensive line has made.","It was the lowest moment of the season for USC’s young offensive line, a September nadir that seemed certain to linger long after the Trojans returned from their first Big Ten trip. But two months later, as Lincoln Riley looks back to where the tide started to turn for his Trojans front, the coach points, somewhat surprisingly, to that nightmarish afternoon in Ann Arbor. “Since then,” Riley said Tuesday, “I feel like we’ve been on a pretty steady incline the entire way.” Of course, there was nowhere for USC’s line to go but up after that 27-24 loss to Michigan. Against the Wolverines’ vaunted defensive line, the Trojans inexperienced front unraveled. New left tackle, Elijah Paige, looked lost. New right guard, Alani Noa, was benched before half. In all, USC allowed 22 quarterback pressures, the most since Riley became coach. What once felt like a promising future for the Trojans up front had, in the matter of an afternoon, turned particularly bleak. Fans turned their ire immediately toward Josh Henson, whose third season as USC’s offensive line coach was professed to be a litmus test of the Trojans’ long-term trajectory up front. But as USC dropped four of five games and frustration over Henson simmered, Riley urged patience. He’d seen the line’s progress with his own eyes, he promised. “We believe that group can be really damn good,” Riley said in September, “and I expect them to be that way this year.” Read more: Lincoln Riley confident USC offensive line can be 'damn good' despite Michigan loss Those assurances didn’t really land in late September. But now in late November, with No. 5 Notre Dame and its fearsome front on tap Saturday, there’s no denying the leap USC’s line has made. “We’ve just gotten better,” Riley said. “We’ve stuck with it. The leadership from coach Henson, from Jonah [Monheim], from Emmanuel [Pregnon], seeing some of these young guys grow up and get better and kind of take some of these challenges and really rise up to them, I think it’s a combination of all that, and it’s been obviously key especially in this stretch of late.” A strong second half of the season doesn’t erase all of the larger questions surrounding USC’s offensive line. It does, however, appear to have quelled any concerns about whether Henson will return for a fourth season. Asked about Henson’s performance last week, Riley pointed to the recent success of the rushing attack and the development of several young linemen, noting that Henson had “done a really good job.” Chief among those successes has been Paige, the 6-foot-7 tackle who turned heads through training camp. But against Michigan, in his first true test at left tackle, Paige looked completely overmatched. His confidence continued to waver in the weeks that followed, as he struggled through what Paige deems “growing pains.” The middle of this season, he admits, “was rough.” Through one four-game stretch, starting with his single half against Michigan, Paige allowed 15 pressures, the most of any Power Four linemen in the same span. But Riley kept his faith in Paige, reiterating his belief in the redshirt freshman whenever asked. And within the offensive line room, Henson’s message remained the same with Paige and all of his young, developing linemen: Stay the course. “Through hard work and through trusting the process, it’s all going to get better,” Paige said, “and it did.” Over the last month, as USC has won three of four games, Paige has allowed just four total pressures in the process. He hasn’t given up a sack since September. Read more: 'Like a zen thing': How USC's Eddie Czaplicki became college football's best punter “He’s just a young guy who had lumps early on, and this is what happens,” Riley said. “You take some of those. You keep battling. And all of a sudden, you look up and the guy is playing at a pretty darn good level. So he’s been pretty good for us the last several weeks, on a really good track, confidence is growing. And I think Josh has been a big part of that.” Where that track heads from here is still to be determined, with USC set to lose its two most consistent starting linemen in the coming weeks. Monheim is off to the NFL after the season, leaving a gaping hole at the center with no obvious heir apparent, while left guard Emmanuel Pregnon recently committed to play in the East-West Shrine Bowl, presumably signaling his intent to also declare for the draft. Neither will be easily replaced next season, with little in the way of proven interior depth waiting in the wings. But Tuesday, during a developmental period at the end of practice, Riley found himself watching his young offensive linemen closely, and feeling pretty good about where the future was headed up front. “We've got a lot of good looking young linemen that are talented and going to be good players,” Riley said. “It's been a while. Probably well before I was here until that was the case. Like, you're starting to see a couple of years worth of work and recruiting and development out here. “I think there's a lot of guys that are going to be big-time players for us.” Get the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.

That number must increase to 143 if he wants to do it in the same 16 games Eric Dickerson got in 1984. … Joe Mixon has finally been suppressed in two of his past three starts. It’s not going to be 3-of-4 vs. a Jaguars defense coughing up the second most RB fantasy points. … David Montgomery (shoulder) is good to go for Thanksgiving Day against the Bears. But is he good to go hard? With the Lions monumental 10-point favorites and the playoffs beginning to appear over the horizon line, it wouldn’t be surprising for the Lions to feature D-Mont a little less than usual. The Lions’ implied total is such that he still cracks the top 20, while Jahmyr Gibbs is rocking and rolling in the top 3-4. … Don’t look now, but Derrick Henry’s 1,325 yards rushing are already the fourth most of his career. … De’Von Achane is the RB3 by average PPR points since Tua Tagovailoa’s return. His extension of the running game receptions figure to be in high demand Thursday evening. Tyler Allgeier played a season-low seven percent of the Falcons’ snaps heading into the Week 11 bye. Undoubtedly a one-game blip in dire comeback mode, but it’s become impossible not to notice Bijan Robinson slowly but surely supplanting Allgeier in essentially every game situation, as he should. With the Falcons home ‘dogs vs. the Chargers, Sunday doesn’t really profile as an Allgeier script unless Atlanta gets an early lead and plays cowardly keepaway. … Christian McCaffrey has posted negative rush yards over expected in 2-of-3 appearances for the banged up 49ers. Now they are headed on the road as touchdown underdogs. This would normally be a spot where CMC goes off with his pass catching, but maybe the offense is too dysfunctional at the moment. He still projects for enough high-value touches to slot in as an RB1. … Alvin Kamara has finished in the top 18 both games since Dennis Allen’s firing. He is again leading in running back receptions. He has a great Week 13 setup as a narrow home ‘dog in a high-totaled contest with a bottom 10 run defense in terms of RB fantasy points allowed. Maybe post-bye is when Khalil Herbert finally gets more involved for the Bengals. We still wouldn’t bet on it after Chase Brown went into the off-date averaging a monumental 27 touches in three games since Zack Moss’ injury. … Kyren Williams remains stuck in something of a low-end RB1 holding pattern, commanding a modest 31 carries over the past two weeks to go along with zero targets. He also can’t stop fumbling. We are not expecting a committee to develop, but it seems clear Kyren has peaked for 2024. … Anthony Richardson’s return under center hasn’t gone as expected for Jonathan Taylor. The quarterback is not only stealing raw volume and goal-line carries, he’s making the Colts’ offense too predictable. Taylor’s rushing lanes are further closed instead of opening up. We are cautiously optimistic a matchup with the Patriots’ everything-funnel defense will change that. … Breece Hall (knee) is suddenly questionable for the collapsed Jets. In normal times, his absence would maybe make Braelon Allen a plug-and-play RB1. In this “when is Aaron Rodgers getting benched?” epoch, Allen woul cautiously slot into the top 24. Bucky Irving seems to have at long last seized command of the Bucs’ backfield. The lopsided nature of the Bucs’ 30-7 Week 12 victory over the Giants means he still played just 52 percent of the snaps, but that number would have been higher had the game been at all competitive. The Panthers do present something of a “Giants problem,” but Carolina has been better than New York of late. It’s possible Irving even starts seeing more goal-line work after Sean Tucker’s red-zone giveaway against the G-Men. … At long last the sole occupant of the Cowboys’ backfield, Rico Dowdle’s Week 13 setup is his best in a long time. The Cowboys are solid home favorites against a Giants defense that gets annihilated on the ground. You can never count your chickens before they hatch in a Cooper Rush-led offense, but Dowdle is an RB1 dark horse. … Opposing Dowdle will be Tyrone Tracy, who continues to look explosive: And lose critical fumbles. Good news still abounds. In looking-forward mode, the Giants can hardly consider a punitive benching for a rookie they must evaluate heading into the offseason. Drew Lock’s insertion under center also boosts the entire offense’s odds for Turkey Day. It appears Tony Pollard will again have the Titans’ backfield to himself with Tyaje Spears (concussion) yet to gain clearance. In theory, Pollard should flirt with RB1 value, though the Titans are somewhat sizable road ‘dogs vs. a decent Commanders run defense. You are starting Pollard, but in the RB2 mid-range. … Kareem Hunt has done heroic work as a plug-and-play RB2, but the party is stopping for Week 13 with Isiah Pacheco’s (leg) return. We don’t know what the workload split is going to be — OC Matt Nagy has said it will be determined in game — only that with all 32 teams active for Week 13, there’s too much uncertainty to insert either Hunt or Pacheco into the top 24. … The Commanders’ running back situation is all messed. Austin Ekeler (concussion) is out. Brian Robinson (ankle) is surprisingly practicing, but he is on his third injury in only a matter of weeks. It adds up to a situation where neither Robinson nor Jeremy McNichols can be trusted in the top 24. Chris Rodriguez remains an early-down option if B-Rob ends up sitting. … With Tank Bigsby the most game-script sensitive back in football, only Travis Etienne has any real FLEX potential against the struggling but still road-favored Texans."
CBSSports.com Headlines,UNC reaches out to Steelers OC Arthur Smith about vacant head coaching position,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/unc-reaches-out-to-steelers-oc-arthur-smith-about-vacant-head-coaching-position/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 23:45:48 +0000",Smith is staying focused on his current job,"Arthur Smith's work week included a notable phone call from his alma mater, the University of North Carolina, who called the Steelers offensive coordinator about the team's new head coaching vacancy.  Smith, who was an offensive lineman for the Tar Heels, broke into coaching as a graduate assistant on UNC's coaching staff. He summed up the conversation as a ""preliminary call"" with the Tar Heels, who recently fired longtime coach Mack Brown.   ""I appreciate it, love that place,"" Smith said of UNC, via ESPN. ""But that's not my focus. I mean, I've got one of the best jobs in football right now. There's a lot to be said too about [how you] can't put a price on personal and professional happiness, which I have here."" Smith is in the middle of his first season with the Steelers, who are currently 8-3 and atop the AFC North division. Pittsburgh's improved offense has played a considerable role in the Steelers' success so far.  The Steelers are currently 14th in the NFL in scoring, up from 28th in the league a year ago. They're currently in position to rank in the top 10 in rushing for the first time since 2007.  ""I've got an awesome job here,"" said Smith, who arrived in Pittsburgh after being the Falcons coach the previous three years. ""Love it here in Pittsburgh. [I] probably [have] a different mindset than I had five, four years ago where any head job, I probably would've walked there to take it. ""Now my perspective's different, and when you got something good like I got here in Pittsburgh right now, family loves it here. I like the working environment, love being a Steeler."" The majority of Steelers fans loved Smith, too, after Pittsburgh's offense averaged nearly 31 points per game during a recent four-game stretch. But the offense has cooled off since then; Pittsburgh scored 18 points against Baltimore in Week 11 and tallied just 19 points in last Thursday night's loss in Cleveland.  Over the past two weeks, the Steelers have begun infusing backup quarterback Justin Fields into the game for a handful of plays. On Thursday, along with talking about his call with UNC, Smith discussed the challenge associated with playing two quarterbacks.  ""Certainly, there's a plan, and sometimes you adapt to more,"" Smith said, via the team's website. ""So would you like to see more or less of Justin? And how do you weigh that? Maybe, is there disruption issue with Russ. These are all conversations. So guys are certainly cognizant of it. Every player is different. Nobody wants to come out of a game, but you've got a guy that can help you, and he's an explosive player. There's a fine line."""

CBSSports.com Headlines,Why is Saquon Barkley going off after halftime? Eagles RB having a Barry Sanders-like season,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/why-is-saquon-barkley-going-off-after-halftime-eagles-rb-having-a-barry-sanders-like-season/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 23:16:50 +0000",Barkley has second-half numbers the NFL hasn't seen since the legendary Lions RB,"PHILADELPHIA -- Saquon Barkley is putting up numbers the NFL hasn't seen in over a decade, making his argument to become the first running back to win NFL MVP in 12 years. There isn't an MVP case for Barkley without his rushing totals after halftime of games.  As dominant has Barkley has been, his second-half stats are off the charts. In the midst of Barkley's 1,392 rushing yards this season, 920 of which have come in the second half. Barkley has 116 carries for 920 yards and seven touchdowns in the second half of games, averaging 7.9 yards per carry.  That's the most by any player in the last 30 seasons ahead of Barry Sanders (6.9) in 1997 (minimum 100 carries). He has more second-half rushing yards than No. 3 and No. 4 combined (Chuba Hubbard and Najee Harris have a combined 902 second-half rushing yards).  How has Barkley been this dominant in the second half? Look what the Eagles running back has in front of him.  ""There's a lot of stuff you can game plan through throughout the week, and then, you know, you get to the game and they may show up in a different defense,"" Eagles offensive tackle Lane Johnson said. ""You have to make those adjustments after each series and like halftime, you know, some plays that maybe don't run the first half, run the second half. So I think I credit it to that."" As Barkley has gone in the second half, so have the Eagles. Philadelphia leads the NFL in rushing yards per game in the second half and overtime (118.8) and are second in yards per carry (5.9). Barkley is actually the fourth-leading rusher in the NFL when counting just his 920 rushing yards.  Saquon Barkley (Eagles) 1,392 Derrick Henry (Ravens) 1,325 Josh Jacobs (Packers) 944 Saquon Barkley in second half (Eagles) 920 The Eagles preach patience. They won't abandon the run just because one or two carries don't break for big gains.  ""Like the run game isn't always gonna hit off the first run,"" said Eagles right guard Mekhi Becton. ""It's one of those things where we gotta keep going and going and wait for it to just hit. I feel like we've done that every game this year.  ""We've came in the locker room, made our adjustments, and we dodged what we gonna do in the second half. That's the best I can explain it. It's one of those things where we just gotta keep chugging along. It's not one of those things where we gotta be perfect off the bat."" What Barkley and the Eagles run offense has been able to accomplish in the second half of games has been historic. There isn't a secret sauce toward Barkley's success, but just the Eagles using their identity to their advantage.  ""I do think there is an element of -- we pride ourselves on being a really physical run game, and those things wear on you as the game goes on when you get the opportunities we get,"" said Eagles offensive coordinator Kellen Moore. ""And the way the games have played out, you can keep grinding it out as the second half progresses, and those big plays eventually pop."""

Georgia has won 30 consecutive home games dating back to 2019, the longest active streak in FBS.  In terms of this historic rivalry, Georgia holds a 71-39-5 edge all-time with a 7-1 record in the Kirby Smart era and six straight wins in the series. Georgia Tech's motivation will be to play spoiler but also to cap off another impressive season under Brent Key, who in two and a half seasons as the Yellow Jackets head coach holds an 18-14 record overall with a 14-9 mark in ACC play.  This will be the first time since 1994 that Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate is played on a Friday during rivalry weekend and the first time since the mid-90s the game has not been played on Saturday. The 1993 and 1995 editions of the game were played in Atlanta on Thanksgiving Day.  Georgia's offensive line rounding into form: The Bulldogs have been dealing with injuries along the offensive line all season, but the return of senior guard Tate Ratledge has been a huge boost to the team's postseason outlook. Ratledge returned after missing four games for Georgia's win against Tennessee, leading the way in a spot where the Bulldogs did not allow a single sack and racked up 453 yards of offense against a stout Vols defensive front. That was a huge step forward after allowing five sacks in the loss to Ole Miss, showcasing how key Ratledge, and a healthy offensive line, is for Georgia's offensive success.  Yellow Jackets coming of a thriller in their ACC finale: Georgia Tech hosted NC State last Thursday night and finished a second-straight 5-3 record in ACC play with a 30-29 win. It marks the first time Georgia Tech has finished with back-to-back winning seasons in ACC play since 2013-14, but it did not come without dramatics. Freshman quarterback Aaron Philo led a seven-play, 75-yard drive in the final minutes that concluded with his 18-yard touchdown run. The Yellow Jackets have been using multiple quarterbacks throughout the season, and on Thursday it was veteran Haynes King and Philo both contributing to an offense that kept NC State on its heels and that diversity in the backfield will be something to watch for Georgia's defense.  Carson Beck looking to finish strong: Georgia's senior quarterback started the year as one of the favorites to contend for the Heisman Trophy and top picks in the 2025 NFL Draft, but a lot of that buzz started to calm when Beck's performance hid a midseason slump. In a six-game span from late September to mid-November, Beck totaled 10 touchdowns and 12 interceptions as the Bulldogs went 4-2, including three three-interception performances. Since then, Beck has six touchdowns and zero interceptions across back-to-back wins and he's looking ton continue that late-season form as the Bulldogs prepare for the postseason.  Date: Friday, Nov. 29 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ET Location: Sanford Stadium -- Athens, Georgia TV: ABC | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)  It would not be a surprise if Georgia Tech is frisky in this game early, so if you wanted to take the Yellow Jackets +10.5 in the first half that could be an option, but over the course of four quarters I do think the talent gap is exposed and the Bulldogs will look to close out their home schedule with another emphatic win. Georgia's offense can be a little slow to get going but once they start to lean on a defense they can pile up points in a hurry and that's where I think a close game becomes a comfortable against the spread cover later in the second half.  Pick: Georgia -19.5 Odds via FanDuel.

The Bears' head coach has drawn the ire of Bears fans after he chose not to use his final timeout in the waning seconds of Chicago's 23-20 loss to the Detroit Lions.  The NFL Today analyst JJ Watt spoke for essentially the entire Giants fan base when he posted the following shortly after Chicago's loss:  Man I feel for you Bears fans. That was just brutal. Literal coaching malpractice. Here's a look at the play in case you didn't see it. As you can see, the Bears let over 30 seconds drain off the clock before quarterback Caleb Williams' attempted a desperation heave on the game's final play. Adding insult to injury was the fact that Williams' throw didn't reach the end zone.  ""I can't believe they didn't take a timeout!""Lions win in a CRAZY finish over the Bears 😮 pic.twitter.com/iLqZLMKpDh When asked to explain that sequence, Eberflus said that the hope was that Bears would run a play with around 18 seconds left on the clock, throw the ball and then call the timeout. That obviously didn't happen, much to the chagrin of Bears fans everywhere.  The sequence soured what had been an inspiring performance by Eberflus' team. It was an especially big day for Williams, who threw for 256 yards and three touchdowns."

Miami has won three in a row following a three-game losing streak that ran their record to 2-6 while Green Bay has won six of their last seven games following their 2-2 start to 2024. However, the weather at Lambeau Field could play a significant factor in cooling off the Dolphins. Miami lost 11 consecutive games in which the temperature at kickoff was below 40 degrees, the longest active streak in the NFL. Sure enough, the predicted forecast for Thanksgiving night in Green Bay, Wisconsin is 17 degrees at kickoff. That's bad news for Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa who has lost the six coldest starts of his career with six passing touchdowns to eight interceptions in those games. Will Miami be able to overcome the cold and the host Packers at Lambeau? Or will Green Bay hand them another holiday loss just like their last meeting when they beat the Dolphins 26-20 on Christmas Day in 2022? Let's take a closer look at this matchup and project a winner.  Date: Thursday, Nov. 28 | Time: 8:20 p.m. ETLocation: Lambeau Field (Green Bay, Wisconsin)Channel: NBC | Stream: fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports App   NFL betting odds: Packers -3.5; O/U 47.5 (via Caesars) Tagovailoa is coming off of his best game of the season, throwing for 317 yards and a season-high four touchdowns in a 34-15 beatdown of the New England Patriots in Week 12. Much of his production went to wideout Jaylen Waddle who also hauled in season-highs in catches (eight) and receiving yards (144).  With Tagovailoa coming off his third NFL concussion in 2024, head coach Mike McDaniel has been more conservative with his offense than ever before. Tagovailoa has attempted a pass behind the line of scrimmage on 30.6% ohf is passes this season, which is the highest rate in the league, per NFL Pro, as well as 6.7% higher than his previous career-high rate of 23.9% just last season. As a result of that and Tagovailoa's midseason absence, All-Pro wide receiver Tyreek Hill is averaging the second-fewest receiving yards per game (51.9) in his entire career. When Tagovailoa does go deep, Packers safety Xavier McKinney will be waiting for him. McKinney co-leads the NFL with seven interceptions this season, and he leads the NFL with a 50% ball hawk rate this season, per NFL Pro, which is the highest rate in the NFL by 10% among those who have been targeted at least 15 times. For your information, ball hawk rate is a measure of how often a player disrupts a pass divided by targets as the nearest defender. Tagovaila may be forced to throw more than the Dolphins would like because their offensive line has struggled this season. Miami rushers have gained just under a yard (0.9) before contact per designed rush, per NFL Pro, which is their lowest since McDaniel became their coach in 2022. Naturally, they additionally have their lowest explosive run rate (12.2%) and their highest rate of contract behind the line of scrimmage (48.6%) since 2022.  Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley (1,392 rushing yards in 2024) and Baltimore Ravens running back Derrick Henry (1,325 rushing yards in 2024) receive a lot of deserved praise, but right behind them atop the NFL's rushing yards leaderboard is Green Bay Packers running Josh Jacobs with 944 rushing yards.  Jacobs bludgeoned the San Francisco 49ers defense over and over and over again in the Packers 38-10 Week 12 victory on Sunday, rumbling for 106 yards and three touchdowns on 26 carries. That effort made him the first 100-yard rusher against the 49ers since then-Chicago Bears quarterback Justin Fields in 2021, ending the longest streak of a team not allowing a 100-yard rusher since 1955, per CBS Sports Research. He will likely be a problem for  a Dolphins defense that has allowed 638 yards after missed tackles this season, the 11th-most in the league, per NFL Pro, since Jacobs' 58 tackles avoided are the fourth-most in the NFL this season. When Miami's linebackers and safeties start creeping up to the line of scrimmage to deal with Jacobs, that's when Green Bay quarterback Jordan Love will look to strike deep downfield. He has throw deep, throws of 20 or more air yards, at the second-highest rate in the entire NFL this season, 15.4%, and Love has connected on 17 of his 43 passes (39.5%) for 640 yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions. Those 640 deep yards are the second-most in the league, and Love's propensity to go deep feeds into one of the Dolphins biggest defensive deficiencies. Miami has allowed the sixth-highest completion percentage, 43.8%, and the third-highest passer rating (130.2) versus deep throws this season, per NFL Pro. It could be a long, cold night for the visiting Dolphins.  This matchup has doom written all over it for Miami. They're the owners of the longest losing streak (11 games) in the cold, when the kickoff temperature is below 40 degrees, and their defense is ill-suited to deal with one of the Packers signature elements, Jordan Love going deep. Tagovailoa may find a few more big plays downfield with Packers top cornerback Jaire Alexander out with a knee injury, but it's unlikely he'll see consistency in that area for the Dolphins given the weather conditions and McKinney lurking and waiting for Tagovailoa to try him. Green Bay wins going away.  Pick: Packers 31, Dolphins 18 Bonus: R.J. White, who is on a 73-30-2 roll on Green Bay Packers games, has released his best bets for the Week 13 Dolphins-Packers game.

CBSSports.com Headlines,Breaking down how the Bears bungled final drive and Thanksgiving comeback vs. Lions,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/breaking-down-how-the-bears-bungled-final-drive-and-thanksgiving-comeback-vs-lions/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 22:56:59 +0000",Chicago ran out the clock on itself,"The Chicago Bears looked dead in the water during the first half of their Thanksgiving matchup against the rival Detroit Lions. They were outscored in the first two quarters, 16-0, and picked up just 53 total yards of offense compared to the Lions' 279 yards. However, the script flipped in the second half. Caleb Williams threw three touchdowns as the Bears outscored the Lions in the final two quarters, 20-7. In fact, they even put together an impressive drive down three points in the fourth quarter that looked like it could be a potential game-winning possession, but the Bears completely bungled their clock management at the end of the game. Let's take a look at what happened on that drive: Despite a perfect Lions punt that landed at the Bears' 1-yard line, Williams took his offense into enemy territory while converting two third downs. Facing a fourth-and-4 at the Lions' 44-yard line, Cole Kmet was penalized for offensive pass interference, which set up a fourth-and-14 at the Bears' 46-yard line. Williams' pass appeared to fall incomplete, but Lions defensive back Kindle Vildor was penalized for pass interference. It was a 29-yard penalty that set the Bears up with a first-and-10 on the Lions' 25-yard line.  The Bears had to be feeling pretty good at that point. Down three points at the opponent's 25-yard line with time running down. What could go wrong? As it turns out, a lot. After an incomplete pass on first-and-10, Bears head coach Matt Eberflus used his second timeout with the clock already stopped. On second-and-10, Teven Jenkins was penalized for illegal use of hands. On the ensuing second-and-20 from the Lions' 35-yard line, Williams took a sack for a loss of six yards with 33 seconds remaining. Here's where things got crazy. Eberflus had a timeout in his pocket, but didn't want to use it just yet. The clock continued to drip as Williams struggled to get the play in while using no-huddle. There were about 33 seconds remaining when Williams was sacked, and when he finally got the ball off, it turned out it was the last play of the game. That pass fell incomplete. ""I can't believe they didn't take a timeout!""Lions win in a CRAZY finish over the Bears 😮 pic.twitter.com/iLqZLMKpDh You can understand why Eberflus wanted to keep that timeout for the NEXT play, but the offense wasn't going fast enough for there to be a next play. Eberflus told reporters after the game the plan was to run a play with 18 seconds left on the clock and then call the timeout. That didn't happen. The Bears should have used that last timeout after the sack, called a play to pick up five yards or so on the third-and-26, then run the special teams unit out and kick the game-tying field goal. There was enough time for that.  Afterwards, the NFL on CBS crew sounded off on the Bears, with Matt Ryan calling it a ""massive, massive fail.""  ""Your responsibility is to not panic in critical situations... That's a massive, massive fail by Matt Eberflus.""@M_Ryan02 cannot believe the Bears' clock management at the end of their loss 😬 pic.twitter.com/aXwXoEc4Ju ""I think it's just two times Matt Eberflus has froze at the end of a game,"" Bill Cowher said. ""33 seconds, you call timeout. You have a third down and 26, all you can do is run another play, get in field goal range and you have plenty of time to run your field goal team on to kick a field goal to go to overtime."" Man I feel for you Bears fans. That was just brutal. Literal coaching malpractice. My family is speechless in front of the TV. Wife has a lot of game management questions, her most pressing question is why do they still have a timeout at EOG Eberflus is already on the hot seat, and instances like Thursday aren't going to help. You have the best team in the NFL on their heels in their own stadium in front of a national audience -- and you run out the clock on yourself."

Stanford leads the all-time series between the Northern California programs 52-14-1. The Cardinal have won 10 of the last 12 matchups against San Jose State since the turn of the century, and this week will mark the first meeting in 11 years.  Stanford is coming off a 24-21 loss to Cal last weekend -- its seventh loss in eight games. The Cardinal started Year 2 of the Troy Taylor era 2-1 with wins over Cal Poly and Syracuse, but six straight losses derailed the program's hopes of getting to bowl eligibility for the first time since 2018. San Jose State enters Week 14 on a two-game losing streak after falling to Boise State and UNLV. The Spartans finished 3-4 in Mountain West play but became bowl-eligible for the third straight season after defeating Oregon State earlier this month.  Here is everything you need to know ahead of Stanford's showdown with San Jose State. San Jose State needs to feed Nick Nash: Entering the final week of the regular season, Nash trails Bowling Green tight end Harold Fannin Jr. by four receiving yards for the FBS lead. Nash has racked up 96 catches for 1,291 yards and 14 touchdowns this season. Nash only had one catch for nine yards last week against UNLV, so getting the star wide receiver involved in the game plan early and often will be key. Year 2 of the Taylor era has been a rollercoaster: After starting the season 2-1 with a win on the road over Syracuse, it looked like the program was heading in the right direction. But, after that win over Syracuse, Stanford dropped six straight games to Clemson, Virginia Tech, Notre Dame, SMU, Wake Forest and NC State before upsetting Louisville at home. Last weekend Stanford entered the fourth quarter with a 21-10 lead before allowing 14 unanswered points to Cal in the final 10 minutes of play. History of the Bill Walsh Legacy Game: San Jose State and Stanford's rivalry dates back to 1900. In 2007, this series was renamed the Bill Walsh Legacy Game in honor of the former Stanford coach and San Jose State alumnus. This will mark the 13th meeting between the programs this century and the first since 2013. Stanford has won the last six meetings.

Grab your family, grab some food and buckle up, because the NFL's best regular-season tradition is here: Thanksgiving football.  The Turkey Day action started with a wild game in Detroit where the Lions escaped with a 23-20 win over the Chicago Bears. The victory ended a seven-game losing streak on Thanksgiving for the Lions while improving their record to 11-1, which now gives them the best start in franchise history.  The second game of the day is be going down in Dallas where two disappointing teams will be facing in off in the Giants and Cowboys. Although the Cowboys have struggled this year, they're likely feeling thankful that the NFL scheduled them to play the Giants on Thanksgiving. Dallas has won seven straight games against the Giants and 14 of the past 15 in the series. The Cowboys are also a perfect 2-0 against the Giants on Thanksgiving with their most recent win coming in 2022.  The Thanksgiving nightcap will be taking place on the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field between the Miami Dolphins and Green Bay Packers. The kickoff temperature is expected to be slighly under 30 degrees, which isn't great news for a Dolphins' team that has struggled in cold-weather. Including the playoffs, the Dolphins have lost 11 straight games when the kickoff temperature is under 40 degrees, so they'll be looking to end that streak.  With that in mind, let's get to the Thanksgiving grades, starting with the Lions' dominant win."

A promising season has soured for the Rebels (8-3, 4-3 SEC) following a 24-17 loss at Florida. Now outside the 12-team playoff hunt, the Rebels can still claim a 10-win season for the third time in four years. Meanwhile, Mississippi State (2-9, 0-7) is limping to the end of a terrible debut season under first-year head coach Jeff Lebby. The Bulldogs are in danger of losing a 10th game for the first time since 2003 (Jackie Sherrill's final season) and going winless in the SEC for the first time since 2002.  Saturday is also a reunion for the coaches. Lebby served as Lane Kiffn's offensive coordinator at Ole Miss in 2020 and 2021, and helped lead the program to the Sugar Bowl three years ago. The two respect each other, though Kiffin hasn't been afraid to poke fun at the Mississippi State head coach on social media.  Ole Miss has won three of the last four in the Egg Bowl, but only one win was by double digits. It's a bad matchup for MSU's offensive line: Mississippi State figures to be in a load of trouble in the trenches against Ole Miss. The Rebels lead the nation with 4.5 sacks per game, including 25 in the last four games. Princely Umanmielen and Suntarine Perkins co-lead the team with 10.5 sacks. The Bulldogs' offensive line has been porous allowing 3.2 sacks per game, ranking 122nd nationally in the 134-team FBS.  ""I don't think there is a question about it: it's the most talented roster we've played all season long,"" Lebby said of Ole Miss. ""It's on the tape; you know what it is from a personnel standpoint."" Ole Miss' losses are kinda weird: How does Ole Miss have three losses on the schedule despite owning the nation's No. 2 offense and a top-5 scoring defense? It bucks the metric and makes this season all the more frustrating for the Rebels, who were built to win a championship and are likely set to fall short of a 12-team playoff. It's been a weird season, and weird things tend to happen in the Egg Bowl. How does Jaxson Dart respond? Jaxson Dart threw two costly interceptions near the end of the game -- including the game-sealing pick -- to hand Florida the win last week. He apologized to his teammates, coaches, and fans after the game in a scene reminiscent of Florida quarterback Tim Tebow's ""promise"" speech after losing to Ole Miss in 2008. Dart spent time at Kiffin's house Saturday night in Oxford, discussing the game and how to move forward.  ""He took it really hard,"" Kiffin said.  Dart has been exceptional most of the season -- Kiffin said receivers dropped passes that would have resulted in 100 more yards against Florida -- and is the winningest quarterback in Ole Miss history. He can become the school's all-time leading passer Saturday with 49 yards, surpassing Eli Manning's record of 10,119. Bulldogs don't do anything particularly well: Jeff Lebby promised the Bulldogs would score loads of points with his cutting-edge offense, but that hasn't happened. He wasn't expecting his hand-picked quarterback from the transfer portal (Blake Shapen) to be lost for the season due to injury, but averaging only 26.9 points per game (78th) is a non-starter for an offense designed to put defenses in terrible spots. Just last week, Missouri held the ball for more than 40 minutes. The defense is a disaster, too, ranking 127th in total defense (461.8 ypg) and 121st in points allowed (34.8). Unsurprisingly, MSU is 130th in time of possession. Date: Friday, Nov. 29 | Time: 3:30 p.m. ETLocation: Vaught-Hemingway Stadium  – Oxford, MississippiTV: ABC | Live stream: fubo (Try for free) One could argue that Ole Miss will come out on fire, motivated by its loss to Florida and looking to take out its frustrations with rival Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl. I understand the sentiment, but weird stuff happens in this rivalry, and I suspect the Rebels' disappointment in missing the playoff will lead to a flatter-than-expected performance. That's not to say the Bulldogs will win or make it close, but Mississippi State's performances in previous road games at Texas, Georgia and Tennessee (all covers) provide enough evidence to believe Jeff Lebby will keep this within the betting line.

They have jumped out to a quick  33-32 lead against North Carolina State.  If Purdue keeps playing like this, they'll bump their record up to 6-1 in no time. On the other hand, North Carolina State will have to make due with  a  5-1 record unless they turn things around (and fast).  Purdue Boilermakers @ North Carolina State Wolfpack Current Records: Purdue 5-1, North Carolina State 5-0  The Purdue Boilermakers will face off against the North Carolina State Wolfpack at 3:00  p.m.  ET on Thursday at LionTree Arena. The two teams are sauntering into the matchup backed by comfortable wins in their prior games.  Purdue took a loss when they played away from home  last Tuesday, but their home fans gave them all the motivation they needed  on Saturday. They simply couldn't be stopped as they easily beat Marshall 80-45. That looming  80-45 mark stands out as the most commanding margin for the Boilermakers yet this  season.  Purdue's victory was a true team effort, with many players turning in solid performances. Perhaps the best among them was   Camden Heide, who  earned 13 points. What's more,  Heide also racked up three  threes, the most he's  had since back in February. Another player making a difference was  Myles Colvin, who  posted 13 points.  Purdue was working as a unit and  finished the game with 18  assists. They easily outclassed their opponents in that department as Marshall only posted six.  Meanwhile, North Carolina State waltzed into their match  on Friday with four straight wins... but they left with five. They were the clear victor by  an  84-61 margin over the Tribe. The Wolfpack have made a habit of sweeping their opponents off the court, having now won three  contests by 23  points or more this season.  North Carolina State can attribute much of their success to   Marcus Hill, who  went 7 for 13 en route to 19 points plus two  steals, and   Ben Middlebrooks, who  had 11 points in addition to seven  rebounds and four  blocks. Hill continues to roll, besting his previous point total in each of the last three games he's  played.  Purdue pushed their record up to 5-1 with the  win, which was their 21st straight  at home dating back to last season. As for North Carolina State, their victory bumped their record up to 5-0.  Thursday's  matchup is shaping up to be a masterclass in shooting:  Purdue  just can't miss this season,  having  made 50.5% of their  field goals per game. However, it's not like North Carolina State struggles in that department as   they've  made 50.3% of their  field goals this season. Given these competing strengths, it'll be interesting to see how their clash plays out.  While fans of North Carolina State and Purdue were happy after their last outing, their bettors probably weren't as neither team covered. As for their next game, Purdue is the favorite in this one, as the experts expect to see them win by seven  points. This will be North Carolina State's first time playing  as the underdogs this season.  Purdue is a solid 7-point favorite against North Carolina State, according to the latest college basketball odds. The oddsmakers had a good feel for the line for this one, as the game opened with the Boilermakers as a 6.5-point favorite. The over/under is 146  points.

The Buffaloes fell to 8-3 after losing 37-21 to Kansas, in which their defense allowed 331 yards rushing and three touchdowns.  After being picked among the league leaders, Oklahoma State has suffered the worst season of the Mike Gundy era. The Cowboys missed a bowl for the first time since 2005 and are at risk of going winless in conference play for the first time since 1994, when the Cowboys were members of the Big Eight Conference.  Colorado and Oklahoma State have vied only once since the Buffaloes left the Big 12. The Cowboys decimated Colorado 38-8 in the 2016 Alamo Bowl, the only non-pandemic bowl appearance for the program since 2007. Phillip Lindsey had 166 all-purpose yards in the loss, while Biletnikoff-winner James Washington exploded for 171 yards and a touchdown.  Heisman hopeful: Colorado athlete Travis Hunter is one of the most electrifying players in college football history and could be making his closing Heisman statement against OSU. Hunter has cleared 80 catches, 1,000 yards and 12 all-purpose touchdowns for the Buffs, and added nine passes defended, three interceptions and a game-winning forced fumble. If he captures the Heisman, he will become the first defender since Charles Woodson in 1997 to win the award.  Messy running game: Oklahoma State running back Ollie Gordon II entered the season as perhaps the top offensive player in the Big 12 and returned the vast majority of his blocking production. Instead of capitalizing, the Cowboys have fallen apart. In one year, Gordon has fallen from No. 2 to 39 in rushing yards as the Cowboys have dropped to 11th in the Big 12. With the offensive struggles, Oklahoma State's nation-worst defense has nowhere to hide. Freshman quarterback Maealiuaki Smith played well in his first start with 316 yards and two touchdowns, but it wasn't enough to beat Texas Tech.  Big 12 title odds: After losing to Kansas last week, the Buffs have a tough path to reaching the Big 12 title game. However, some scenarios remain alive. If all the two-loss Big 12 teams win this week (Arizona State, BYU, Iowa State), the Buffaloes are out. Two of their opponents losing and Colorado winning puts them into the game. In addition, if Colorado gets into a three-way tie, they need BYU to lose to Houston and Texas Tech to beat West Virginia. Needless to say, Colorado needs to beat Oklahoma State to even begin the conversation.  Date: Friday, Nov. 29 | Time: 12 p.m. ET Location: Folsom Field -- Boulder, Colorado TV: ABC | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)  Colorado boasts one of the best offenses in the Big 12 and Oklahoma State defends worse than anyone. This will be a pride game for the Cowboys as they try to avoid a winless conference slate against a highly touted opponent, and freshman quarterback Maealiuaki Smith showed real promise to open up the running game for Ollie Gordon. The Buffs have to much firepower for OSU to pull off the upset, but expect plenty of scoring. Pick: Over 65.5 Picks via FanDuel.

However, that does not mean he is guaranteed to play this year. Barrett is contractually beholden to the Miami Dolphins, who own his rights. NFL Media reports the Dolphins have elected not to activate Barrett off the reserve/retired list, meaning he will not play for Miami this season. The Dolphins also do not intend to release him, meaning Barrett can't play for another franchise as teams gear up for playoff pushes. Given this development, it's worth revisiting Barrett's comments to the ""Up & Adams"" show back in late August where he told host Kay Adams that the only way he would come out of retirement would be to re-join the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  ""I wouldn't do it for any other scenario or any other team or anything like that,"" Barrett said at the time. ""I've got a lot of history down there.""  Barrett played five seasons for Tampa Bay up until he was released last March. The Bucs are currently 5-6 on the season, but lurking right behind the Atlanta Falcons (6-5) in the NFC South, albeit losing the head-to-head tiebreaker.  In his career, Barrett has tallied 400 total tackles and 59 career sacks in 131 regular season games.

That strong performance was nothing new for the team: they've now  pulled down at least ten  offensive rebounds in eight consecutive  contests  dating back to last season.  Meanwhile, Wake Forest earned  a  67-57 win over Detroit  on Saturday. The  victory made it back-to-back  wins for the Demon Deacons.  Hunter Sallis was the offensive standout of the  game as he  went 12 for 18 en route to 31 points plus three  steals and two  blocks. The team also got some help courtesy of  Tre'Von Spillers, who  posted seven points plus nine  rebounds and two  steals.  Florida pushed their record up to 6-0 with the  victory, which was their 12th straight  at home dating back to last season. As for Wake Forest, their win bumped their record up to 6-1.  Looking ahead, Florida is the favorite in this one, as the experts expect to see them win by 6.5  points. This contest  will be their seventh straight  as the favorites (so far over this stretch they are 3-3 against the spread).  Florida came up short against Wake Forest when the teams last played  back in November of 2023, falling  82-71. Can Florida avenge their  loss or is history doomed to repeat itself? We'll find out soon enough.  Florida is a solid 6.5-point favorite against Wake Forest, according to the latest college basketball odds.

Fortunately for them, they will be able to get back on the field in short order to try and erase that sour taste of the Week 12 loss as they'll square off against the Dallas Cowboys as part of the NFL's Thanksgiving tripleheader. Unfortunately for them, their new starting quarterback won't be in the lineup. Tommy DeVito was listed as questionable to suit up on Thanksgiving due to a right forearm injury. NFL Media reports DeVito will be the emergency third quarterback, which means Drew Lock will start. Tim Boyle will be the No. 2 behind Lock.  Giants head coach Brian Daboll noted earlier this week that he is ""hopeful"" DeVito plays Thursday, but it is not ""100 percent,"" per The Athletic. The Giants signal-caller briefly left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter but returned after missing a single snap.   DeVito, who was making his first start of the season after New York benched and later released Daniel Jones, took several hard hits during Sunday's loss. In all, he was sacked four times and hit nine times overall.  Specifically, DeVito left the game for one play on the Giants second-to-last possession of the day after a second-and-15 incompletion to Jalin Hyatt (which was negated due to a penalty). Lock came in for the second-and-10 snap, completed a 3-yard pass to running back Tyrone Tracy Jr., and DeVito then trotted back out for third down, where he was sacked for a 2-yard loss. DeVito finished his day completing 21 of his 31 pass attempts for 189 yards.  Lock has been the primary backup throughout the season, even when Jones was under center, and has 23 career starts under his belt (9-14 record as a starter)."

This will be the 134th meeting all time -- and the 117th consecutive game, which makes it the longest uninterrupted series in FBS history -- between the Badgers and the Golden Gophers in what has become one of this sport's most hotly contested feuds.  Minnesota and Wisconsin are 3-3 in the series since 2018, with the road team notably winning each of the past two matchups. Minnesota has won two of its last three games in Madison, Wisconsin after losing 11 straight from 1996-2016. Though the overall record is even over the past six years, only two games in that span have been decided by one possession.  Prior to 2018, Wisconsin won a series-record 14 straight from 2004-17. The Badgers also hold a very narrow lead all-time with a 63-63-8 record. That being said, this is a big game for Luke Fickell's squad.  After starting the year 5-2, Wisconsin has lost its last four games. It's the program's longest losing streak since 2008, and only the third time since 1992 that the Badgers have dropped four consecutive contests. Minnesota, meanwhile, has won four of its last six after posting a 2-3 record through its first five games.  Wisconsin's bowl streak on the line: The Badgers have a lot to play for when they take the field Saturday. They have made it to a bowl game in 22 straight seasons, which is the third-longest active FBS streak behind Georgia (27) and Oklahoma (25). The Bulldogs and Sooners have already qualified for the postseason this year. Wisconsin hasn't suffered a losing season since 2001 under former coach Barry Alvarez. Its 22 straight winning seasons lead the FBS. The Badgers are also trying to avoid losing five straight games for the first time since 1991.  Familiar foes on the sidelines: Minnesota coach P.J. Fleck and Wisconsin coach Luke Fickell go way back. Both were on staff at Ohio State in 2006 -- Fleck was a graduate assistant and Fickell was the co-defensive coordinator and linebackers coach -- under former Buckeyes coach Jim Tressel. Ohio State won a Big Ten title with a 12-0 regular season and went on to the BCS National Championship Game, where it lost to Florida and future Buckeyes coach Urban Meyer. Fleck spent just one season at Ohio State before moving on to become wide receivers coach at Northern Illinois, while Fickell remained on staff through the end of Tressel's tenure and was even interim coach of the Buckeyes in 2011.    Minnesota's dominant defense: Minnesota has won a lot of games this season behind one of the strongest defenses in the nation. The Golden Gophers are top-15 in the FBS in scoring defense (18.5 points per game), total defense (302.3 yards per game) and turnovers forced (20) this season. They have also allowed the fifth-fewest plays of at least 25 yards from scrimmage.  Freshman defensive back Koi Perich has been a huge star for Minnesota. The former top-100 prospect out of Esko, Minnesota immediately became a figurehead for Minnesota's defense. He currently leads the Big Ten with five interceptions, which he has returned for 63 yards. He also has 34 total tackles, 1.5 for a loss, and one forced fumble through 11 games.  Date: Friday, Nov. 29 | Time: Noon ET Location: Camp Randall Stadium -- Madison, Wisconsin TV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App (Free) Streaming on Paramount+ with Showtime (Try It Free)  All sports betting odds via Caesars Sportsbook.

Four ranked teams will be in action throughout the day, but there are some important games to keep an eye on outside of that.       For instance, Wisconsin hosts Minnesota at noon on CBS. The Badgers are trying to extend their streak of 22 consecutive seasons with a bowl appearance, while Minnesota has a chance to win seven games for the third time in four years under coach P.J. Fleck.       Also at noon, Colorado can keep its narrow Big 12 hopes alive with a win against Oklahoma State. In the afternoon slate, Ole Miss is looking to bounce back and send its year out on a high note against in-state rival Mississippi State. Stanford and San Jose State also close their regular seasons with an interesting nonconference clash on CBS.       In the evening window, Georgia has an opportunity to build momentum towards the SEC Championship Game against rival Georgia Tech, which already has one top-10 win under its belt after it knocked off Miami earlier in the season.       Be sure to stick with CBS Sports all day Friday for college football coverage from the opening kickoff onward. Let's take a look at our expert picks for the best games on Black Friday with cited picks from best sports betting apps available.                                       All times Eastern  Noon | CBS, Paramount+ with Showtime, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App -- The Big Ten West lives on, if in spirit only. The projected point total for this game on sports betting apps is absurdly low, and for good reason. Neither Wisconsin nor Minnesota fields what we would typically refer to as an explosive offense. In fact, the Golden Gophers have just seven scrimmage plays of 30-plus yards, which is far and away the fewest in the FBS. Meanwhile, Wisconsin is averaging just 24 points per game, which is in the bottom third of the Big Ten and ranks well below the national average. It'll be a struggle for both teams to consistently find the end zone. Pick: Under 43 (Caesars Sportsbook) -- Will Backus Noon | ABC, fubo (Try for free) -- Colorado boasts one of the best offenses in the Big 12 and Oklahoma State defends worse than anyone. This will be a pride game for the Cowboys as they try to avoid a winless conference slate against a highly touted opponent, and freshman quarterback Maealiuaki Smith showed real promise to open up the running game for Ollie Gordon. The Buffs have to much firepower for OSU to pull off the upset, but expect plenty of scoring. Pick: Over 65.5 (Fanatics Sportsbook) -- Shehan Jeyarajah  Noon | Fox, fubo (Try for free) -- This one is difficult to handicap. Both Boise State and Oregon State have been erratic this year. Yes, the Broncos are winning a lot, but two of their last three victories have come by one possession against teams with a losing record. Oregon State, meanwhile, went from losing 28-0 against then 2-7 Air Force to beating former top-25 Washington State in the honorary Pac-12 Championship Game in the span of one week. Both also have plenty to play for: Oregon State has bowl eligibility on the line, while Boise State is trying to stay in good standing for the College Football Playoff. One point of concern for Oregon State is the fact that it gives up 178.2 yards rushing per game and now has to face the nation's best running back in Heisman Trophy candidate Ashton Jeanty. All this to say, Boise State is going to win this game, but it will probably be closer than Vegas seems to think. Pick: Oregon State +18.5 (FanDuel Sportsbook) -- Will Backus  3:30 p.m. | ABC, fubo (Try for free) -- One could argue that Ole Miss will come out on fire, motivated by its loss to Florida and looking to take out its frustrations with rival Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl. I understand the sentiment, but weird stuff happens in this rivalry, and I suspect the Rebels' disappointment in missing the playoff will lead to a flatter-than-expected performance. That's not to say the Bulldogs will win or make it close, but Mississippi State's performances in previous road games at Texas, Georgia and Tennessee (all covers) provide enough evidence to believe Jeff Lebby will keep this within the betting line. Pick: Mississippi State +26 (DraftKings Sportsbook) -- Brandon Marcello  4 p.m. | CBS, Paramount+ with Showtime, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App -- With a win, Stanford can surpass its win total from last season and establish positive momentum heading into the offseason. Coming off an emotional rivalry loss to Cal, Stanford should be motivated to close out the season strong against a Northern California rival. If the Cardinal can find a way to contain Nash, they should cover and win outright as a slight underdog on sports betting apps. Pick: Stanford +3 (Fanatics Sportsbook) -- Cameron Salerno  7:30 p.m. | ABC, fubo (Try for free) -- It would not be a surprise if Georgia Tech is frisky in this game early, so if you wanted to take the Yellow Jackets +10.5 in the first half, that could be an option. But, over the course of four quarters, I do think the talent gap is exposed and the Bulldogs will look to close out their home schedule with another emphatic win. Georgia's offense can be a little slow to get going, but once they start to lean on a defense, they can pile up points in a hurry. That's where I think a close game becomes a comfortable against the spread cover later in the second half.

Tulane (9-2) has already clinched a date with Army in next week's AAC Championship Game, but it would like to finish its conference slate with a perfect 8-0 record and stay in the College Football Playoff hunt by knocking off the Tigers. Tulane is currently a +410 longshot to make the 12-team field. Memphis (9-2) would love nothing more to play spoiler, and in the process, clinch double-digit win seasons in back-to-back years for the first time in program history. Both teams had byes last week.  Kickoff is at 7:30  p.m.  ET from Benson Field at Yulman Stadium in New Orleans. The Green Wave are favored by 13.5 points in the latest Memphis vs. Tulane odds via SportsLine consensus, and the over/under is 54.5 points. Before entering any Tulane vs. Memphis picks, you'll want to see the college football predictions from the proven computer model at SportsLine. The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times. Since its inception, it has generated a betting profit of well over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college spread football picks, and it is a strong 27-17 on all top-rated picks over the past nine weeks of this season. Anyone following at sportsbooks and on betting apps has seen strong returns. The model has set its sights on Memphis vs. Tulane. You can head to SportsLine to see its picks. Here are several  college football betting lines for Tulane vs. Memphis: The Tigers simply bludgeon opponents on the ground. They are coming off back-to-back games with over 200 rushing yards in addition to four such games over their last five outings. Mario Anderson Jr.'s 1,115 rushing yards rank third in the AAC, while his 18 total touchdowns are seventh in all of college football. His backup, Brandon Thomas, could start for many teams and has at least eight rushing touchdowns in each of the last four seasons. He has six scores over his last six games, and in addition to his prowess around the goal line, he's a big play threat who's averaging 6.3 yards per rush.  As strong as Memphis is on the ground, it's just as effective in containing the other team's run game. Just one AAC team allows fewer than the Tigers' 3.8 yards per rush allowed. The team gave up just 28 rushing yards in its last contest, which was the fourth time in 2024 it held an opponent to under 40 rushing yards. The Tigers are also opportunistic on that side of the ball, as they are averaging 1.9 takeaways per game -- the second-most in the conference. See which team to pick here. Tulane is as balanced as any team in the nation, and that's evident by the Green Wave ranking fourth in the country in scoring offense and 10th in scoring defense. That makes it the only Group of Five team to rank in the top 10 of both, and the Green Wave are coming off arguably their most complete game. They shut out a Navy team that was ranked as recently as October with a 35-0 victory prior to their bye. The Midshipmen were averaging 259.1 rushing yards entering the contest but couldn't even top 100 yards versus Tulane. The Green Wave held Navy to just 2.9 yards per carry, had two takeaways and played turnover-free ball on offense. Protecting the ball has been a strength of Tulane all season as it has just three giveaways over its last eight games, all of which have resulted in victories. See which team to pick here.

Both teams' starting quarterbacks from Week 4 -- Daniel Jones for New York and Dak Prescott for Dallas -- won't be starting for either squad on Thanksgiving Day; Jones has been released while Prescott suffered a season-ending hamstring injury in Week 9 at the Atlanta Falcons. Cooper Rush has taken the place of Prescott, while last season's viral sensation Tommy DeVito has taken the place of Jones, but will miss Thursday's game due to a forearm injury.  Will the Cowboys begin a winning streak with a victory against the Giants after their 34-26 upset win over the Washington Commanders? Or will the Giants rebound from a deflating 30-7 Week 12 loss against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and stun a Cowboys squad starting to get some swagger back following a five-game losing streak? Let's dig into this matchup and project a victor.  Date: Thursday, Nov. 28 | Time: 4:30 p.m. ETLocation: AT&T Stadium (Arlington, Texas)Channel: FOX | Stream: fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports App   NFL betting odds: Cowboys -3.5; O/U 37 (via Caesars) Check out the latest Caesars promo code to get in the game. The Giants are a team in turmoil. They had multiple players, namely wide receiver Malik Nabers and defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence, use the word ""soft"" to describe the state of their team.  Nabers also specifically critiqued head coach Brian Daboll's play-calling and the team's inability to get him the football after he recorded no targets in the first half of a game for the first time in Week 12.  There is also uncertainty regarding their quarterback situation because DeVito won't play on Thursday after being a limited practice participant Tuesday with a right forearm injury. 2019 second-round pick Drew Lock, who signed with the Giants on a one-year deal in free agency, will start. Both players' mobility is what Dallas' defense is focusing on.  ""Both of them are pretty mobile, so I feel like they will get the same game plan,"" cornerback Jourdan Lewis said.  ""[DeVito's] ability to make plays in and out of the pocket is a real focus for us,"" head coach Mike McCarthy added. One other new piece in Week 13 is Giants fifth-round rookie running back Tyrone Tracy Jr. He received just four carries for two yards in the Week 4 matchup while Devin Singletary was the lead back with 24 rushing yards on 14 carries. Since Week 5, Tracy has been the lead back for the Giants, and his 558 rushing yards in that span rank as the ninth-most in the NFL. Tracy's 3.2 yards after contact per carry are the 12th-most in the NFL, and it's safe to say the Cowboys' 31st-ranked run defense will see a heavy dose of Tracy. New York possessed the football for about 11 more minutes than Dallas (35:37 to 24:23) in the Cowboys' 20-15 road win over the Giants in Week 4. That time of possession margin is the worst of Dallas' 2024 season, and Week 4 marked the only time this year its opponent possessed the football more than 10 minutes more than they did.  ""I think his ability to generate offense RAC, YAC, however you define it,"" McCarthy said when asked about what stands out about Tracy. ""The biggest thing I see is the combination of the run and the pass. ... What I see is I think they are trying to get a good balance of run and pass. You go back to the last game up there, they slowed it down. The pace of that game was very methodical. They tried to hold on to the ball and go long drives. ... I think they did do a good job in the first game of controlling the clock."" When they do decide to throw the football, everyone's eyes will be on Nabers, whose 103 targets this season are the third-most in the entire NFL. The 2024 NFL Draft's No. 6 overall pick racked up a career-high 12 catches for 115 receiving yards in the Week 4 meeting against Dallas, but he hasn't totaled 75 or more receiving yards in a game since. That's one of the reasons why he is dissatisfied with Daboll's playcalling.  ""He wants the ball, his aggression,"" Lewis said of Nabers. ""He understands how to locate the ball. ... He's really a smooth route runner. He understands where the defense is and where to settle in the defense. He's a poised pass catcher out there, and he knows that. He knows he's the guy. It's dangerous when a guy that young knows that he's supposed to be getting the ball, and he's supposed to be making those explosive plays. I feel like that's the key to this game.""  What the Cowboys need to do to beat up on the Giants is simple: run the ball. New York is surrendering the third-most rushing yards per game in the NFL (147.9). The problem is Dallas' run game is the second-worst in the NFL, averaging just 82.5 rushing yards per game. However, lead back Rico Dowdle plowed ahead for the second-most rushing yards (86) and carries (19) in any game of his career Sunday in Washington, perhaps showing the Cowboys are on the cusp of finding some sort of rhythm on the ground.  Dropping back to pass against New York could be a risky proposition for Dallas with a rookie at center (third-round pick Cooper Beebe), and with right guard Zack Martin (ankle and shoulder injuries) set to miss his second consecutive game. No interior defender has more sacks (nine) than Giants two-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence, and no team has a higher defensive sack rate generated (10.6%) than the Giants.  ""Dexter, he's always had our attention I know as long as I've been here,"" McCarthy said. ""I think he's maybe the top or one of the top inside players in the league. Just have a tremendous amount of respect for him. But yeah, I think like anything, not only in our division, if you want to be a playoff football team, you have to have it on both sides of the line of scrimmage. Guys like Dexter Lawrence is a great example."" However, the risk may just be worth it for the chance to put the football in either NFL receptions leader CeeDee Lamb's hands, or ""fastest person on this planet"" KaVontae Turpin. Lamb and Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase are the two scariest covers in the league based on how opposing defenses play them. Lamb's 28 targets when double-teamed are tied for the most in the NFL with Chase, per Pro Football Focus, and Lamb's 132 routes run while double-teamed are the second-most in the NFL behind Chase's 170, according to PFF. Defenses gravitating towards him have led to big plays for Turpin, who took a slant route 64 yards for a touchdown against the Houston Texans in Week 11, and tight end Luke Schoonmaker, who hauled in a wide open, 22-yard touchdown with under 5 minutes, 30 seconds to play Sunday that put Dallas up, 20-9, late in the fourth quarter against the Commanders.  ""I love it, I love it, and I can't preach it enough here,"" Lamb said of teammates scoring when he is doubled. ""I tell the guys, 'Make them guard me. If you're going to give me 1-on-1, that's cool. Let me do what I got to do and then at some point, they're going to bring another guy, and then y'all take over, you're 1--on-1.' I know when I first came (in as a rookie in 2020) I obviously had [Amari] Coop[er] and MG [Michael Gallup], so [opponents] couldn't double team anybody. I took it as disrespect. So I kind of told those guys like, 'Bro, if they're double-teaming me, take it as disrespect if they feel their guy can guard y'all 1-on-1 with no help.' That's crazy. So for that, I'm happy for the guys man. I'm always happy. I'm, if not the happiest, when Turp scores.""  Dallas scores first and then punishes DeVito or Lock with a Micah Parsons-led pass rush that helps generate multiple turnovers. Rush plays a turnover-free game for the second week in a row, and the Cowboys roll to a multi-score victory as well as their 15th win in their last 16 against the Giants.

It begins this Sunday. That means November is in the past, which is a good thing. I can't think of a worse November I've had picking games. It's been horrendous. My colleagues on CBSSportsHQ have taken to mocking me. Yes, it's that bad. I went 5-8 against the spread and 7-6 straight-up. That brings my season record to 80-96-3 ATS and 107-72-0 straight up.  Time to flip a coin to pick games? The coin would kill me.  As it is, I will stick to my own evaluations and hope it turns around. It won't be any worse. December is upon us.

Thursday, 12:30 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+) The Bears have lost four straight while the Lions have rolled to the top seed in the NFC right now. Playing the Lions on the road is never easy, but it's even tougher on Thanksgiving. Caleb Williams showed well last week and will here as well to keep the Bears close. Lions win it, but it's tight.  Pick: Lions 30, Bears 27 Bonus: Larry Hartstein, who is on a 98-63 roll on NFL games, loves one side of this matchup, and you can find out who to back over at SportsLine. Thursday, 4:30 p.m. ET (Fox, fubo try for free) The Cowboys upset the Commanders last week, so they have some life. The Giants have none. In a game where it's Cooper Rush against Tommy DeVito, give me the home team — even though Dallas hasn't been good at home this year. They find a way.  Pick: Cowboys 24, Giants 17 Bonus: Larry Hartstein is also on a heater betting Cowboys games, as he's won 27 of his past 37 bets involving America's team. While he's leaning under for this NFC East matchup, he shows a lot of value on the spread. To see which team he's backing, head on over to SportsLine. Thursday, 8:20 p.m. ET (NBC, fubo try for free) The Dolphins come here playing well, especially Tua Tagovailoa. But this is a proving game of sorts for he and the Dolphins. He has to show he can win against a good team on the road. Green Bay seemed to get it going on offense last week against the 49ers. I think that carries over. Packers take it.  Pick: Packers 28, Dolphins 22 Friday, 3 p.m. ET (Amazon Prime Video) The Raiders will start Aidan O'Connell here at quarterback after Gardner Minshew was lost for the year. That's not a good thing against the Chiefs on the road. Kansas City hasn't looked great this season, but this is the type of game that can get it rolling. It will. Pick: Chiefs 31, Raiders 14 Sunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+) The Falcons are coming off the bye, while the Chargers are playing on a short week on the road. That's a challenge. But the Falcons offense went away in the two games before the bye. This Chargers defense will slow them again as Justin Herbert gets the best of the Atlanta defense.  Pick: Chargers 30, Falcons 21 Sunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+) The Bengals are off the bye and have to win out to basically have a playoff shot. The Steelers lost to the Browns in the snow last Thursday. The defense let them down in that game, and now they get Joe Burrow and company. That's not easy. Burrow will find a way to win it.  Pick: Bengals 26, Steelers 20 Sunday, 1 p.m. ET (Fox, fubo try for free) The Jaguars are coming off a bye week with no changes made to the coaching staff. Quarterback Trevor Lawrence might be back for this one. But the defense has major issues. Look for C.J. Stroud to light them up as he gets it going again after a couple of so-so weeks.  Pick: Texans 33, Jaguars 20 Sunday, 1 p.m. ET (Fox, fubo try for free) The Cardinals are coming off a road loss to the Seahawks, while the Vikings are home for the first time in three weeks. The Arizona offense seemed to struggle last week at Seattle, and now it will be challenged by the Minnesota defense. I think the Vikings limit Kyler Murray, and the Minnesota offense will hit a few big plays to Justin Jefferson to win it.  Pick: Vikings 31, Cardinals 21 Sunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+) The Patriots are coming off two bad losses, especially bad for the defense. But the Colts struggled on offense last week. I think that changes here as Anthony Richardson and Jonathan Taylor both have good days to lead the Colts.  Pick: Colts 23, Patriots 17 Sunday, 1 p.m. ET (Fox, fubo try for free) This is a long trip for Seattle in between two division games against the Cardinals. The Jets are coming off a bye. Advantage, Jets. They haven't played well at all, but something says they rally here to find a way, as Seattle will be focused on Arizona next week. It's a classic sandwich game.  Pick: Jets 23, Seahawks 19 Sunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+) The Commanders suddenly don't look like the same team, especially on offense. The Titans are coming off an impressive road victory against the Texans. The Commanders lost at home to Dallas last week. They won't lose two in a row, but this will be close.  Pick: Commanders 24, Titans 21 Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET (Fox, fubo try for free) The Bucs seemed to get back on a good track last week, but this game might be tougher than expected. The Panthers pushed the Chiefs last week in a loss. Bryce Young was better than he's been, but I think the Tampa Bay defense will be good in this one as the Bucs start stacking victories.  Pick: Bucs 28, Panthers 17 Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET (Fox, fubo try for free) The Rams are off a bad loss to the Eagles, while the Saints are coming off their bye. They won two straight before the bye to keep them in the playoff chase. The loser is likely done here. I think Sean McVay will get his team back off the deck and find a way to win it behind Matt Stafford.  Pick: Rams 31, Saints 23 Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+) This is the game of the week, featuring two dynamic offenses that both have outstanding running games. But the edge at quarterback goes to Lamar Jackson, which will be the difference in this game. He will make some big-time plays with his legs and his right arm to pull out a shootout victory for the Ravens.  Pick: Ravens 34, Eagles 30 Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET (NBC, fubo try for free) The Bills are coming off their bye, while the 49ers are playing a second straight road game. The health of 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy is the key here. If he plays, they might stay in this game. If he doesn't, it's ugly. Either way, the Bills will win it as Josh Allen pushes for his MVP.  Pick: Bills 30, 49ers 20 Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET (ESPN, fubo try for free)  The Browns are rested after having upset the Steelers last Thursday, which should help as they play consecutive road games. The Broncos are playing well. They are playing good defense, which will cause problems for Jameis Winston here. Look for a big game for the Broncos defense.  Pick: Broncos 24, Browns 14"

After losing to Oklahoma last week, No. 13 Alabama (8-3, 4-3 SEC) will miss the College Football Playoff unless chaos unfolds around the sport. Auburn (5-6, 2-5) has disappointed throughout the season and is just playing for bowl eligibility at this point. The game might be lacking on a national scale, but that doesn't diminish the importance for both coaches.    First-year coach Kalen DeBoer has already overseen the worst Alabama team since 2010 and really can't afford an Iron Bowl loss to a six-loss Auburn team when it comes to fan buy-in and recruiting momentum. Second-year Auburn coach Hugh Freeze was largely hired for his ability to beat Nick Saban -- a feat he accomplished twice while at Ole Miss. While he can't do that again, he'd earn a lot of goodwill with a road Iron Bowl victory ahead of what is shaping into a critical third season for him on the Plains.   It will be hard to beat last year's thrilling fourth-and-31 touchdown finish, but this game has a way of delivering even when the nation's gaze is elsewhere.    Which Milroe appears? In a win over Georgia where he totaled four touchdowns and nearly 500 offensive yards, Jalen Milroe looked like a legitimate Heisman Trophy contender. In a loss to Oklahoma where he threw three interceptions, including one pick six, his performance had fans calling for him to be replaced. The Milroe experience has been a rollercoaster for Alabama this season, largely dependent on if he can be effective running the ball with his legs. In losses to Vanderbilt and Oklahoma, particularly, Milroe couldn't move the ball effectively in the passing game and looked increasingly helpless. This should be Milroe's last game inside Bryant-Denny Stadium and Alabama could use the version that looked electric against Georgia and LSU to make a reappearance.    Run the ball, Auburn The Tigers found success running Jarquez Hunter against Texas A&M, totaling 130 yards and three touchdowns in the upset win. Using Hunter -- plus some Thorne in designed runs -- should be effective against an Alabama defense that has struggled to defend the run and is now without senior linebacker and play-caller Deontae Lawson. Oklahoma's 1-2 punch of quarterback Jackson Arnold and running back Xavier Robinson combined for 238 yards and two touchdowns against the Tide last weekend.    Unusual smack talk The Iron Bowl is full of emotion but largely devoid of headline-making comments from players in the lead up to it. That's not the case this season where a spicy back-and-forth has added some extra juice to the game. It started with freshman Auburn linebacker Demarcus Riddick saying Tide star freshman Ryan Williams wasn't a ""big-time player to me"" and vowed to never lose to Alabama. Tide QB Milroe returned fire the next day saying he didn't know who Riddick was and to just let him talk. Other Alabama players backed up Williams' unique skills. Don't be surprised to see some more spicy comments coming out after the game depending on the result.    Date: Saturday, Nov. 30 | Time: 3:30 p.m. ET  Location: Bryant-Denny Stadium  – Tuscaloosa, Alabama  TV: ABC | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)   Sports betting odds via Fanatics.

Auburn hasn't won in Tuscaloosa since 2010, a wild 28-27 comeback win known as the ""Camback,"" and even with Alabama licking its wounds off an Oklahoma loss, this isn't the year that changes. Auburn's Hugh Freeze will come up with a great game plan to frustrate Alabama, but the Crimson Tide still have too much of a talent advantage to lose its home finale.

The Longhorns are cruising in their first year as an SEC member and sit in sole possession of first place in the conference, already achieving back-to-back 10-win seasons for the first time since 2009.  Texas A&M is in the midst of a resurgence under first-year coach Mike Elko. The Aggies are contending for a spot in the SEC Championship Game after beating LSU and Missouri. However, a 43-41 quadruple-overtime loss to Auburn last week narrowed their path, making this a must-win matchup.  The Longhorns and Aggies have played 118 times and Texas holds a dominant 76-37-5 advantage. The last time these teams played, the Longhorns mustered only 237 yards but outlasted Texas A&M 27-25 in 2011. This one carries much bigger stakes. The winner will play in the SEC Championship Game against Georgia and have a shot to win their first SEC titles.  History reignites: The last time these two teams met was in 2011, the final matchup between these two schools as Big 12 members. Justin Tucker's game-winning field goal went down in history as the rivalry sat dormant for 13 years. Surprisingly, these two teams have rarely been good at the same time. The last time both teams were ranked coming into the matchup was 2004. On paper, this is the highest-ranked matchup since No. 1 Texas traveled to No. 12 Texas A&M in 1977. The energy will be off the charts.  Strength on weakness: Texas is good nearly everywhere on defense, but the Longhrns have been a little more lenient on the ground -- ranking middle of the pack in the SEC in yards per carry. While Texas A&M isn't super efficient running the ball, they love to lean on it. The Aggies trail only Tennessee in rushing offense and yards per carry at 4.96, and are actually the best in SEC play alone. Expect offensive coordinator Collin Klein to stress test the interior of the Texas defensive line repeatedly.  A tale of two QBs: Quarterbacks Quinn Ewers and Marcel Reed couldn't be much more different. Ewers was a former No. 1 recruit who is in his third year as a starter. Reed was a mid-four star who was thrust into action as a former backup. Still, both bring some clear strengths and weaknesses. Ewers has been inconsistent with his long ball and is dealing with a nagging ankle injury. Reed is still developing as a passer, and his poor first half doomed Texas A&M against Auburn. Whichever signal-caller is more consistent will be in great shape to win the game.  Date: Saturday, Nov. 30 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ET Location: Kyle Field -- College Station, Texas TV: ABC | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)  Texas is the better team, they will contend for a national title and have more players picked in the NFL Draft. The Aggies are still searching for identity under first-year coach Mike Elko and need quarterback Marcel Reed to develop quickly. And yet, there's truly no telling what will happen in the renewal of this historic rivalry game. Texas got the last one at the buzzer, and it could easily go a similar direction this time.

They have jumped out to a quick  25-24 lead against Minnesota.  Wichita State entered the  match having won five straight and they're just one half away from another. Will they make it six, or will Minnesota step up and spoil it? We'll know soon.  Minnesota Golden Gophers @ Wichita State Shockers Current Records: Minnesota 5-1, Wichita State 5-0  Minnesota has played every game this season on their home court, but they'll have to hit the road  on Thursday. They will face off against the Wichita State Shockers at 12:00  p.m.  ET at State Farm Field House. The Golden Gophers' defense has only allowed 57.2  points per game  this season, so the Shockers' offense will have their work cut out for them.  If Wichita State heads into halftime all tied up, they better play a good second half: that's when Minnesota took over last week. Minnesota sure made it a nail-biter, but they managed to escape with  a  68-65  win over Central Michigan  on Monday.  Minnesota can attribute much of their success to  Dawson Garcia, who  dropped  a double-double on 22 points and 11  rebounds. Garcia's performance made up for a slower  match against Clev. State last Tuesday. Lu'Cye Patterson was another key player,  earning 19 points.  Minnesota was working as a unit and  finished the game with 17  assists. The team's really been improving in that area: they've now improved their  assist total in three consecutive  games.  Meanwhile, Wichita State entered their tilt with Saint Louis on Friday with four consecutive wins  but they'll enter their next game with five. They put the hurt on the Billikens with a sharp  88-63 victory. The oddsmakers were on the Shockers' side, but they didn't give the  squad enough credit as the margin was unexpectedly wide.  Wichita State's win  was the result of several impressive offensive performances. One of the most notable came from   AJ McGinnis, who  scored 12 points. McGinnis had some trouble finding  his footing against Monmouth last Monday, so this was a step in the right direction. The team also got some help courtesy of  Corey Washington, who  had 13 points in addition to eight  rebounds.  Minnesota pushed their record up to 5-1 with the  win, which was their third straight  at home. As for Wichita State, their victory bumped their record up to 5-0.  Rebounding is likely to be a big factor in this contest:  Minnesota hasn't given up the ball easily this season,  having  only  averaged 10.2  turnovers per game. However, it's not like Wichita State struggles in that department as   they've been averaging  only 9.2. Given these competing strengths, it'll be interesting to see how their clash plays out.  Minnesota is hoping to beat the odds  on Thursday, as the experts think they're headed for a loss. This will be their first time playing  as the underdogs this season.  Wichita State is a slight 2-point favorite against Minnesota, according to the latest college basketball odds. The oddsmakers had a good feel for the line for this one, as the game opened with the Shockers as a 1.5-point favorite. The over/under is 137.5  points.

This will also be the first showdown between the Tigers and the Sooners since 2019's College Football Playoff, when Ed Orgeron's historic Tigers downed Lincoln Riley's Oklahoma to advance to the CFP National Championship.  The Tigers hold a 2-1 advantage in the series, with Oklahoma's only win against the Tigers coming in 1950.  LSU is fresh off a bounce-back 24-17 win against Vanderbilt. Prior to that, the previously 6-1 Tigers dropped three SEC contests in a row. All three of those losses came by double digits, including one defeat against unranked Florida.  Not to be outdone, Oklahoma notched its biggest win of the season -- and took a sledgehammer to Alabama's College Football Playoff hopes -- in a 24-3 romp over the Crimson Tide. That was Oklahoma's sixth win of the year, which means that the Sooners will make it to a bowl game for a 26th straight season, the second-longest streak in the FBS.  Though both teams have already locked down a bowl game, a win Saturday is still important to improve either team's stock during the postseason bidding process.  Help could be on the way for Oklahoma: Oklahoma's offense has struggled a lot this season -- the Sooners notably fired offensive coordinator Seth Littrell on Oct. 20, one day after a 35-9 loss to South Carolina -- and a big reason why is the fact that the Sooners have been without their five top wide receivers for a majority of the year. Most of the injuries that set that room back occurred either in the preseason or within the first few games. The good news for Oklahoma is that help could be on the way at the receiver spot.  There is a possibility that Deion Burks and Jalil Farooq are both able to return against LSU. Farooq has only played in two games this season, including a brief appearance against Missouri, while Burks hasn't played since Nov. 9. Burks' return would be a special boon as, in spite of his missed time, he still leads the Sooners with three touchdowns catches.     All eyes on Garrett Nussmeier: Saturday could be LSU quarterback Garrett Nussmeier's last time in Tiger Stadium. The redshirt junior, who spent three years biding his time and learning LSU's system before emerging as a starter in 2024, is eligible to declare for the 2025 NFL Draft. At one point, he was seen as a potential first-round prospect due to his excellent frame and big arm. But his stock has dropped a bit down the stretch amid some late-season struggles. Nussmeier has thrown five touchdowns to five interceptions in LSU's last four games and seven of his 11 interceptions came in the past six contests. LSU coach Brian Kelly recently said he is ""hopeful"" that Nussmeier will return in 2025 in an attempt to recover some of his draft buzz.   Strength vs. Strength: Even with Nussmeier's struggles of late, LSU still has one of the most prolific passing attacks in the nation. And Nussmeier did have a good game against Vanderbilt, posting 332 yards and one touchdown through the air while completing just over 75% of his passes. The Tigers currently rank second in the SEC with 317.7 yards passing per game. They have plenty of talented receivers to spread the ball to, including wideout Kyren Lacy, who is currently tied for first place in the SEC with eight touchdowns.  Oklahoma's secondary will be a huge test. The Sooners have held each of their last three opponents -- and four of their last five -- under 200 yards passing. They've also been opportunistic when it comes to creating turnovers. Oklahoma had three interceptions against Alabama, one of which linebacker Kip Lewis returned for a crucial touchdown to give the Sooners their decisive advantage.  Date: Saturday, Nov. 30 | Time: 7 p.m. ET Location: Tiger Stadium -- Baton Rouge, Louisiana TV: ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)  All sports betting odds via Caesars Sportsbook. Check out the latest Caesars promo code to get in the game.  Oklahoma has quietly had an excellent defensive season. Or, at least it was quiet before the Sooners held Alabama's explosive offense to three total points. The Sooners currently rank fourth in the SEC in total defense (311.3 yards per game) and are holding opponents to just 20.2 points per contest. Jackson Arnold has also been solid for the Sooners after returning to the field -- especially with his legs. He has 221 yards and one touchdown rushing in Oklahoma's last three games. All this to say, Oklahoma is a bad matchup for an LSU team with a faltering offense and a defense that really struggles to defend against rushing quarterbacks. The Sooners may not win straight-up (the game's a tossup in my mind), but it will be incredibly close either way. The six-point betting line seems like too much. Pick: Oklahoma +6  SportsLine's proven computer model is calling for several outright upsets in Week 14 of college football. Visit SportsLine now to see them all, plus get spread picks for every game from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times."

This matchup will mark the 95th all-time meeting between the historic programs. The two rivals have played each other every season in football since 1926, except during World War ll (1943-45) and the COVID-19 shortened season in 2020. The Fighting Irish have turned around their season since suffering a loss at home to Northern Illinois in Week 2. Notre Dame enters this matchup on the cusp of securing an at-large berth to the 12-team College Football Playoff after winning its last nine games. With wins over Texas A&M, Louisville, Navy and Army on Notre Dame's résumé, a win over USC would almost guarantee an at-large berth. The Irish are currently a -650 bet to make the CFP, according to Caesars. USC has won three of its last four games after starting 3-4 and became bowl-eligible with a win over UCLA last weekend. Before the Trojans' showdown against Nebraska earlier this month, coach Lincoln Riley made a quarterback change, electing to bench Miller Moss in favor of UNLV transfer Jayden Maiava. USC has won both games Maiava started.  Here is everything you need to know about Notre Dame's matchup with USC this weekend. One final test for Notre Dame before the CFP: Notre Dame's path to the CFP is simple. If the Fighting Irish handle business this weekend and move to 11-1, the only drama left will be what seed they draw. With so many CFP contenders falling in recent weeks, Notre Dame should be in contention to host during the first round game. Maiava has been a spark for USC:  Riley made a switch at quarterback After USC lost to Washington, benching Moss in favor of Maiava. The change appeared to have paid off, with Maiava adding a new dynamic to USC's offense. With USC's quarterback situation remaining fluid heading into the 2025 season, Maiava can solidify himself as Riley's QB1 long-term with a strong performance down the stretch. Notre Dame's run game is the key: Notre Dame has a chance to win its 11th game of the season this weekend, which would mark the sixth time in program history that's happened. The Fighting Irish have turned their season around because of the run game. Notre Dame has 37 rushing touchdowns as a team entering Week 14 -- the most in a season since 1991. Running back Jeremiyah Love and quarterback Riley Leonard are the first duo in program history with at least 13 rushing touchdowns each.  Date: Saturday, Nov. 30 | Time: 3:30 p.m. ET Location: Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum -- Los Angeles TV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App (Free) Streaming on Paramount+ with Showtime (Try It Free)  Notre Dame's run game is the key to victory. The Fighting Irish have been on a tear since losing to NIU early in the season and the program is on the cusp of securing its third CFP appearance. Although USC has looked like a better team with Maiava at quarterback, the inability to win close games down the stretch has been an issue under Riley. The Trojans are one of six FBS teams to lead in the fourth quarter of every game this season.

So much so that it's simply referred to as The Game, and it's all any college football fan needs to hear to know which game you're talking about: Ohio State vs. Michigan. It's the rivalry that has defined the Big Ten throughout through all its changes. There's a reason the conference was long considered The Big Two and The Little Eight, as the Buckeyes and Wolverines have combined to win at least a share of 84 Big Ten titles. They've also claimed 20 national titles between them, including just last season with Michigan. It's not simply a football game, but a way of life among those who call themselves Buckeyes or Wolverines. Years are ruined, relationships end, and jobs are lost based on the outcome of this one game every fall.  This season sees a Michigan team down on its luck after having won the last three meetings. But you know what would make a 7-5 season feel like winning another national title? Beating Ohio State. For the Buckeyes, would getting to the College Football Playoff taste as sweet if it doesn't first include a victory over Michigan?  Everything these two programs do 364 days of the year is geared toward this. The day they finally meet on the field. And now it's finally at hand. Michigan has won the last three meetings: It's the first three-game win streak the Wolverines have put together in the series since 1995-97, and it's been a dominant performance. The Wolverines have led for 125 of the 180 minutes in those three games, with Ohio State leading only 30 minutes. A win this weekend would not only mark a major upset, but it'd give Michigan its first four-game winning streak against the Buckeyes since 1988-91. Ohio State coach Ryan Day is 1-3 against Michigan: To put that in perspective, Day is 45-1 against everybody else in the Big Ten since taking the Ohio State job. His only other loss came earlier this season when the Buckeyes fell on the road against No. 1 Oregon 32-31. Day has accomplished a lot with Ohio State, but Buckeyes coaches are mostly judged on their record against Michigan. Should Ohio State drop a fourth straight it would put a serious damper on what's been an excellent season.  Ohio State clinches a Big Ten Championship Game berth with a win: A win sends Ohio State to Indianapolis next week for a rematch against the Oregon team it lost to a couple of months ago. It would be Ohio State's first appearance in the Big Ten Championship since the 2020 season after the Buckeyes played in six of the first 10. They are 5-1 in their previous six appearances, with the lone loss coming to Michigan State in 2013. The Buckeyes are a -130 play on sports betting apps to win the Big Ten title.  Date: Saturday, November 30 | Time: Noon ET Location: Ohio Stadium -- Columbus, Ohio TV: Fox | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)  It's hard to think of the history of this rivalry and believe there will be a blowout, but I can't help but shake that feeling. Michigan just hasn't been good enough offensively this season to give me reason to believe it can keep this one close. Plus, considering the bad blood the Buckeyes have for the last three years, you have to think they'll show little mercy late in the game. Take the Buckeyes to cover the betting line. Pick: Ohio State -21 All sports betting odds via DraftKings Sportsbook. Check out the latest DraftKings promo code to get in the game.

This time, the NFL on CBS pregame show will broadcast live from Ford Field in anticipation of the Detroit Lions' Week 15 matchup against Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills.  Join Matt Ryan, Bill Cowher, Nate Burleson, James Brown, J.J. Watt and CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones in the Motor City, for an epic show that will be broadcasted live on CBS.  The Lions and Bills are arguably the top two teams in their respective conferences, and this could be a Super Bowl LIX preview. Allen and Jared Goff have been two of the best quarterbacks in the NFL this season, and both are poised to clinch their divisions. The Bills are looking to make their first Super Bowl since the 1993 season, while the Lions want to build on their remarkable 2023 campaign which ended in the NFC Championship game. There's a reason why they are currently the Super Bowl favorites.  These two squads don't face off that often, the last matchup taking place in Week 12 of the 2022 season. The Bills earned a 28-25 victory in Detroit, as Tyler Bass hit a 45-yard game-winning field goal with two seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. Allen threw for two touchdowns and one interception, but also led Buffalo with 78 rushing yards and another touchdown.  Get ready for what should be another entertaining interconference matchup. More details will be released later in the week.  Date: Sunday, Dec. 15 | Time: 12 p.m. ETLocation: Ford Field in Detroit, MITV: CBS | Live stream: Paramount+"

Every holiday season they release the most ridiculous safety memes, and sure it's a waste of our taxpayer money, but at least it's an entertaining waste. Here we are going into Thanksgiving week, and they've introduced a creepy turkey, named Trent, holding a pot while hovering over families.  Trent turkey is just like Smokey the Bear, if Smokey the Bear were a roasted turkey carcass that haunted American families' kitchens while giving out fire safety tips like Make sure you have a working fire extinguisher, working smoke alarms, and stand by your pan! Unattended cooking is the #1 cause of home fires! Sure it's not as catchy as ""Only you can prevent forest fires,"" but it's a dead turkey with a pan, and that has to count for something. Here are some other Thanksgiving favorites:    I'm not so sure about the messaging in this last Thanksgiving warning, especially the final line.  Standing by your turkey while you're frying it might not be such a good idea. Especially considering the Safety Commission's other warnings about the turkey volcano.  And of course, since the Friday after Thanksgiving officially begins the Christmas season, regardless what stores and my wife think, there's a couple of Christmas safety warnings worth mentioning.

Thanks, Axios! What would we ever do without you and your credentials?? Look at this ratio:  From the article: Debates over Thanksgiving's origins have been reduced to political-cultural battles amid a divided nation, yet a new generation of historians say we need to understand the holiday better to understand ourselves. The article is as predictable as the thousand that have been written before it. The Pilgrims were invaders who were disrespectful to the peace-loving tribes in the area and Axios writer Russell Contreras makes sure you understand who the savages were 👇 The Wampanoag showed up for the feast out of concern over gunshots rather than from invitation. (This was their land, after all).Zoom out: Around 50 years later, the colonists and the Wampanoag were at war after the colony expanded, and they enslaved other Indigenous people. Zoom out: Around 50 years later, the colonists and the Wampanoag were at war after the colony expanded, and they enslaved other Indigenous people. Because I want to go celebrate Thanksgiving instead of rebut the frustrations of bitter, Marx-adjacent journos, I'll give you this link to Thanksgiving history with actual citations. You can also read this book about the Mayflower from bestselling author Nathaniel Philbrick, and because Axios took aim in their article about the late-great Rush Limbaugh, here is a link to him detailing the history of the holiday. Even better, you can read the 19th-century reprinting of William Bradford's firsthand account from the 1600s on setting up the Plymouth colony. (But I'm sure Axios writer Russell Contreras knows more than him.)  God bless America, and Happy Thanksgiving.

Unless you click the link NBC News provides and read the very first paragraph concerning this ""historic"" victory for our economy. Here it is, from the Farm Bureau: Americans stocking up for this year's Thanksgiving dinner will see a dip in their grocery bills for the second year in a row. The 39th annual American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) Thanksgiving dinner survey finds that the classic feast for 10 will run you $58.08, down 5% from last year. However, this is still 19% higher than five years ago.  Yet, NBC News just rolls with it. And indeed, while Thanksgiving food prices are up 19% since 2019, according to the AFBF, federal data shows median household wages growing by about 25% during the same period.What's more, ‘the average American also has to work fewer hours to buy the same meal than in previous years,' the report added. ‘Wages continued to grow faster following the COVID-19 pandemic, even as inflation cooled. Because average wages rose 4% from 2023 to 2024, it took 9% less work time for us to pay for this year's Thanksgiving dinner.' What's more, ‘the average American also has to work fewer hours to buy the same meal than in previous years,' the report added. ‘Wages continued to grow faster following the COVID-19 pandemic, even as inflation cooled. Because average wages rose 4% from 2023 to 2024, it took 9% less work time for us to pay for this year's Thanksgiving dinner.' So yeah, if you don't count all the inflation we've experienced over the past four years we are seeing historic low prices this Thanksgiving.   I'm glad NBC left this next part in here, because it at least gives them a sliver of credibility. Of course, pay gains haven't boosted all workers evenly, and long-term expenses like housing costs and child care continue to squeeze families up and down the income spectrum. While consumer confidence has jumped in recent weeks, it remains below pre-pandemic levels.Still, the AFBF report said, 'even with the decreasing purchasing power of the dollar, some of the goods in our basket are at their long-term lowest prices, even in terms of the ""current dollar"" price.' Still, the AFBF report said, 'even with the decreasing purchasing power of the dollar, some of the goods in our basket are at their long-term lowest prices, even in terms of the ""current dollar"" price.'

California hates the idea of deportation so much that the state is apparently threatening to charge police officers in El Cajon with felonies (and take away their pensions) should they comply with Trump's order. Mayor Bill Wells tells the story:   I want to make it clear right now that El Cajon is not a sanctuary city. We're going to do everything we can to help the federal government to help ease this immigration problem, to help solve this problem.The problem we're facing in El Cajon is that state law, State of California law, says that if a police officer does his duty, that we're asking him to do by complying with the federal government, that police officer can be charged with a felony and lose his pension. The problem we're facing in El Cajon is that state law, State of California law, says that if a police officer does his duty, that we're asking him to do by complying with the federal government, that police officer can be charged with a felony and lose his pension. El Cajon is a 30-minute drive from the border, so Mayor Wells has reason to comply with Trump's order when the time comes. The law he's speaking about here is California's SB-54, which states in part, This bill would, among other things and subject to exceptions, prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies, including school police and security departments, from using money or personnel to investigate, interrogate, detain, detect, or arrest persons for immigration enforcement purposes, as specified, and would, subject to exceptions, proscribe other activities or conduct in connection with immigration enforcement by law enforcement agencies. Mayor Wells says California is now threatening to charge officers with a felony and even take away their pension if they should follow Trump's orders and help deport non-citizens. One commenter pointed out the obvious:  And we've already heard Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, speak on this:  It's a felony if you knowingly conceal or harbor an illegal alien from immigration authorities. It's also a felony to impede a federal law enforcement officer.

The core of the claims against these three asset managers is that they have such huge holdings in coal that they could allegedly connive together to raise the price of coal to force climate policies to be implemented. The lawsuit alleges that BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street used their shareholdings in coal companies, including Peabody Energy Corp. and Arch Resources Inc., to press management to cut their carbon emissions. This started in 2021 at the height of the ESG boom.The investment firms also joined groups such as Climate Action 100+ and Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative that press companies to cut their carbon emissions. In effect, the investors formed 'a syndicate and agreed to use their collective holdings of publicly traded coal companies to induce industrywide output reductions,' according to the suit.

Sadly, Wendy is now in a legal battle with A&E Television Networks, Lifetime Entertainment Services, EOne Productions, Creature Films and a filmmaker named Mark Ford over the film. According to a lawsuit filed by Wendy's guardian, the filmmakers ""cruelly took advantage of [Williams'] cognitive and physical decline by creating and publishing a documentary at a time when [Williams] was highly vulnerable and clearly incapable of consenting to be filmed."" So not only is Wendy incapacitated and permanently disabled, but she's got people working on her behalf to sue the makers of the documentary which they say took advantage of her and even ""intentionally manipulated and goaded"" her ""to trigger strong emotional reactions and acquire embarrassing footage.""

Trump's pro-crypto policies also helped motivate backers to support the project, Breitbart News has learned.Cottrill is working to capture Trump's courage and defiance immediately after being shot. In iconic fashion, Trump rose with a bloodied face and pumped his fist as he repeatedly shouted, ""Fight!"" to his supporters before U.S. Secret Service agents rushed him off stage. Cottrill is working to capture Trump's courage and defiance immediately after being shot. In iconic fashion, Trump rose with a bloodied face and pumped his fist as he repeatedly shouted, ""Fight!"" to his supporters before U.S. Secret Service agents rushed him off stage. When your woke relatives scoff about what redneck hillbilly is designing this beast, politely inform them that Cottrill designed a statue of Thomas Edison that is currently in the U.S. Capitol. Let's take a look at the pics:A lucky few will receive an 18-inch version of the statue:'The Patriot Statue of Donald J. Trump was our largest and most controversial undertaking, especially considering the scale and relevance of the event in Butler that took place,' Cottrill said.Dustin Stockton, who helped lead the project, detailed the process that Cottrill is undertaking to forge the statue.First, Cottrill sculpts a clay mold, and then individual bronze pieces are shaped based on the mold. The bronze pieces are then welded together and buffed out, creating the final product. Stockton estimated the statue would be completed by the New Year.The design team plans to take the statue on a cross-country tour. After that, the hope is that it will be temporarily displayed at the site in Butler, Pennsylvania, where Trump nearly lost his life, then be moved to Trump's presidential museum.During a phone call with Breitbart News on Tuesday morning, Butler County Board of Commissioner Vice Chair Kim Geyer, who has been in contact with Stockton, noted that the grounds are private property, meaning it is up to the Farm Show grounds' board of directors rather than the county to place it there.When asked if there is a better home, at least a temporary one, for the statue than in Butler County, Geyer noted that it would be 'an appropriate place.''Prior to it possibly going to the Trump Presidential Library in the future, I think it would be an appropriate place because we already have visitors who do come to frequent the location because they want to see where this event took place that occurred on July 13,' she said.Statues are amazing pieces of art to help us remember our history, and it's cool to see a new one be made instead of torn/melted down.But I can't wait for David French to write up a warning in The New York Times about Christians bowing down to the golden Trump statue! 😂

Lewis with the help of Dr. Yaz Romahi, the creative genius behind the project.  The treehouse features a beaver's den, Mr. Tumnus's house, sits on 12 acres, and features a wardrobe door that transports visitors into the woodlands of Headington, Oxfordshire, where C.S. Lewis wrote the Chronicles of Narnia.     Dr. Romahi said of the project, C.S Lewis's old house and garden is actually two doors down - so we share the same woodland. It is an homage to C.S Lewis and the Narnia series and we integrated the theme. I am a member of the Magic Circle and I am an engineer so I built all the magic props - the kids love the fantasy so it was a labour of love.  Some of the magic props include a magic mirror featuring the White Queen (with the face of Romahi's daughter), who with the help of generative AI replies to any question in verse, and lights that turn on when you place a special ring next to a copy of The Lord of the Rings. Romahi went on to say of the treehouse, The adults feel like they are re-living their childhood and their children are enjoying their space - and that obviously gives us the satisfaction While the treehouse is 6 years old, it has only been used for charity events in the past. Recently, however, to raise more funds for the Congenital Anaemia Network, they've expanded with two buildings available for short-term rentals, The Cedar Hollow Treehouse​ which sleeps up to 6, and The Faun's Hideaway which sleeps 2.

They're at risk of coming up $20 billion short unless congress bails them out. Yes, the tax collectors need your money.  Already bracing for funding cuts under a new Trump administration, U.S. Treasury officials are calling on Congress to unlock $20 billion in IRS enforcement money that is tied up in legislative language that has effectively rendered the money frozen ...Treasury officials warn of dire consequences if the funding is effectively rescinded through inaction. The loss of that money would lead to an increase of the national deficit by $140 billion, Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said on a call to reporters on Tuesday.

  Already bracing for funding cuts under a new Trump administration, U.S. Treasury officials are calling on Congress to unlock $20 billion in IRS enforcement money that is tied up in legislative language that has effectively rendered the money frozen ...Treasury officials warn of dire consequences if the funding is effectively rescinded through inaction. The loss of that money would lead to an increase of the national deficit by $140 billion, Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said on a call to reporters on Tuesday. There would be 6,000 fewer audits of wealthy individuals and 2,000 fewer audits of large corporations, and the agency would have to go on a hiring freeze, he said.

And we need to get people to behave as if this really is a major transitional challenge to the whole planet.  Somebody needs to tell the Heinz heir that people increasingly don't care about climate change anymore. In contrast to the ubiquitous climate hysteria of recent years, the public is more and more uninterested in ""climate emergencies."" Per Monmouth:  Less than half (46%) of the American public sees climate change as a very serious problem. This number is higher than it was nine years ago (41% in 2015), but is decidedly lower than in more recent polling (54% in 2018 and 56% in 2021). Compared to three years ago, climate change concern has declined by 8 percentage points among both Democrats (77% very serious, down from 85% in 2021) and Republicans (13%, from 21%) and by 13 points among independents (43%, from 56%).  You can doubtlessly expect these numbers to continue to fall, as the dire predictions of the climate mongers — world-ending famines, 1,000-year droughts, 750-foot rises in sea levels — consistently fail to materialize, year after year.  You can doubtlessly expect guys like John Kerry to try and stay relevant, though:

And there's no doubt about it — per AAA, gas prices are considerably down from over a year ago:   The low prices are driving a considerable boost in family spending power: In October 2024, the average purchasing power for middle-income families was 103.1%, up from 102.7% in September 2024. This marks the sixth consecutive month purchasing power rose for middle-income families. Spending power is at its highest level since January 2021 and is up 3.4% from a year ago. The recent recovery is driven primarily by gas prices continuing to fall in October. So what's driving the trend? Well, earlier this year we saw high levels of gas production, ahead of even the elevated levels of 2023. That doubtlessly has something to do with it.

President-elect Donald J. Trump said on Tuesday evening that he had selected Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford physician and economist whose authorship of an anti-lockdown treatise during the coronavirus pandemic made him a central figure in a bitter public health debate, to be the director of the National Institutes of Health.  Bhattacharya is a wonderful pick to lead the NIH. His central role in pushing back against the unhinged, anti-scientific mania of the Covid era is more than enough justification. You will likely remember the October 2020 Great Barrington Declaration, signed by Bhattacharya and several other prominent physicians, which held, correctly, that Covid lockdowns were ""producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health"" well out of proportion to the risks COVID posed to the general public. In contrast to the widespread, economically devastating and unscientific lockdown policies, the declaration proposed a policy of ""focused prevention,"" which would ... ... allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk.  It was a great idea! Alas, for their troubles, Bhattacharya and his colleagues were vilified, with prominent health and science officials claiming their commonsense proposal was a fringe idea rather than an eminently sensible, completely obvious plan. The good doctor himself was blacklisted on Twitter, unsurprisingly; Twitter was of course one of the main censors of Covid heterodoxy, even without the pressure to censor that was coming directly from the FBI and the White House at the behest of Joe Biden's ""misinformation"" team.  It's doubly incredible for this man to have gone from Twitter outcast to director of one of the most powerful health institutions in the world in just a few short years.  (Also, the good doctor understands trolling and memes. 👇)

	Shaboozey performed ""A Bar Song,"" ""Last of My Kind,"" and ""Highway"" from Ford Field.","The NFL kicked off its Thanksgiving slate on Thursday afternoon with an NFC North showdown between the Chicago Bears and the Detroit Lions. It’s a matchup between two teams that bookend the division standings — the Lions are on top, the Bears are in the basement — but part of what makes the Thanksgiving games interesting despite that is the pageantry of the whole thing. Of course, there was CBS sending its top crew, the celebration of John Madden, and all the fun little touches that come from games taking place on Thanksgiving. And of course, while it’s not the Super Bowl halftime show, fans at the stadium and watching on television got treated to a performance while both teams made their ways into their respective locker rooms. While Lainey Wilson is scheduled to perform during Giants-Cowboys and Lindsey Stirling is the halftime show during Dolphins-Packers, Shaboozey took the stage at Ford Field during the early game. Unsurprisingly, he performed his smash hit “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” along with “Last of My Kind” and “Highway.”  A post shared by NFL (@nfl)  If you’d like to watch the full performance, you can do that right here. While Shaboozey performed, the Lions were certainly the happier of the two teams in the halftime locker room, as they held a 16-0 lead and limited the Bears to only 53 yards of total offense in the first half."

	The Lions star right tackle hasn't given up a sack all year, but on Thanksgiving he took a sack on a trick play that the Bears covered up.","The Detroit Lions have been the best team in the NFC this season, thanks in part to one of the most balanced offensive attacks in the league. Detroit is built inside out, relying on arguably the best offensive line in football to pave the way for their two-headed rushing attack with David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs, with Jared Goff picking defenses apart in the play-action game off that running game.  On top of that, offensive coordinator Ben Johnson is about as creative as they come when it comes to dialing up some trickeration, and on Thanksgiving he tried to let his star right tackle, Penei Sewell, shine on the Lions first drive of the game. After picking up a first down to put them just outside the red zone, Sewell lined up at tight end and came around on a reverse, but instead of running it, the big fella was looking to throw it downfield. Unfortunately for Sewell, the Lions, and everyone watching hoping to see some Large Man Excellence, the Bears covered it extremely well and there was nowhere for Sewell to go, with the Bears defense eventually swarming him and pushing him out of bounds — because they could not bring him to the ground.  Penei Sewell tried it 😅 📺: #CHIvsDET on CBS/Paramount+📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/tPb5KRWNCr — NFL (@NFL) November 28, 2024  It’s actually a really good play by Sewell not to force a throw into coverage like most non-QBs would do in that situation, and the fans still went crazy for the play call and for Sewell shrugging off the entire Bears defense to stay on his feet. The craziest part of the whole thing is that Sewell, by losing two yards, took a sack on the play, which means he has taken more sacks this season than he’s given up at right tackle. Sewell came into the game having allowed 0 sacks in more than 700 snaps, per PFF, which is an astonishing stat and a great example of why he’s a perennial All-Pro. Hopefully, this won’t be the last time we see Sewell given the chance to throw the ball cause I want to see him get a chance to let the ball fly."

	Come get these winners.","Thanksgiving is here and that means a virtual smorgasbord of football action. The weekend begins with a tripleheader on the big day itself, and the fun doesn’t stop until Monday. In this space, it’s been a tough season but, on the bright side, four of the last five weeks have ended in the green as we scratch and claw our way toward respectability. There is still a long way to go but, before we get to the Week 13 picks, let’s take stock of the progress. Come get these winners. I’m tired of fading the Lions. It hasn’t gone well, and I hate it. But this is another spot where I think I have to. Detroit is banged-up and, while the Lions should win this game at home, Chicago is a step above the doormats that should be catching double-digits in this spot. Thoughts and prayers. In the interest of full disclosure, I’m a Falcons fan. I don’t want to bet on the Falcons. I actively try not to. But this is a spot I really like. Atlanta is coming off a bye, while Los Angeles played a high-impact game on Monday on the west coast. I would already have the Falcons as a tiny favorite before accounting for the situation, so give me the candy on the home underdog.  This is Cincinnati’s last stand. At 4-7, they have zero margin for error. That’s not why I’m taking them, but the Bengals should be able to move the ball and score, even against Pittsburgh’s defense. The market is still a touch higher on the Steelers than I am, and grabbing this below a field goal is advantageous.  Make no mistake, Carolina isn’t very good, but they are undervalued at this number. Bryce Young looks like an NFL quarterback and, while the Panthers are going to give up some points here, they can go shot-for-shot with the Bucs at home. NFC South overs have crushed all season. I’m not getting off the train just yet and, as noted earlier, I think this might even be a spot when the Over is correlated to the underdog to some degree. Tampa Bay’s defense should pave the way for some fireworks."

	A pair of Buffaloes go off the board to start our latest mock draft, while four quarterbacks end up going in the first round.","We are at the end of college football’s regular season, which coincides with the unofficial start of the stretch run for the NFL season: Thanksgiving Day games. Right now, we have a pretty good idea of who the best teams are in the league, and can start to predict with a little bit of certainty what needs teams will have as the 2025 NFL Draft rolls around and which college football players could do a good job filling them. As such, it’s time for us to roll out the second version of our mock draft for next April — you can check out how things played out the last time we did this right here. As for how this one is going to go, well, how about a team trading up for Shedeur Sanders to get us started? (Draft order as of Nov. 27, 2024) If it’s not evident by the fact that they benched then cut Daniel Jones midseason and are currently starting Tommy DeVito when he’s healthy, the Giants really want a high pick and really need a quarterback, and a trade up to 1 to take Sanders makes sense if they can’t tank their way to the top pick. While he doesn’t have the strongest arm on earth, Sanders is an excellent processor of the game and can throw the ball accurately all over the place. He’s gotten better about getting the ball out and not hunting big plays that lead to sacks — Colorado’s OL taking a step forward helps, of course — and while the Giants don’t have nearly the level of playmakers that Colorado has relative to their level of competition, he’d love getting to throw to Malik Nabers. Add in that he has the sort of big personality that can handle New York and the Giants could theoretically hire his father if they fire Brian Daboll and Sanders checks a ton of boxes here. The Jaguars move down a spot, pick up some extra picks for their trouble, and get the best football player in this Draft — and in fact, if you were to look up “football player” in a dictionary, there should be a photo of Travis Hunter there. Hunter is doing things we’ve never really seen playing both ways at an elite level in college, and while it’s possible he eventually has to choose a primary position in the NFL – I could see him picking receiver or corner and then playing mostly high leverage snaps at the other – his versatility and ability at either spot would be a welcome addition or a Jags team that just needs more talent. Also, if his goal is to play both sides in the NFL, the Jags are a team that needs help at both spots, so they’d likely be thrilled to let him give it a go.  Ward’s rise from a QB at Incarnate Word to a Heisman contender for the College Football Playoff-bound Miami Hurricanes really has been impressive. He’s a dynamic thrower of the ball with good mobility and has gotten better and better over the course of his career. He’ll take some sacks and put the ball in danger a little more than I’d like, but that’s an area where he’s grown during his time with the Canes. The Raiders need a lot of help in a lot of different places, but above all else, their top priority this April should be getting a franchise quarterback they can build around. Ward would provide that. The Patriots need to bolster their offensive line to better protect Drake Maye. The rookie QB has impressed in flashes since taking over as the starter, but he’s under pressure far more often than New England would like. This isn’t the best tackle class in history, but Kelvin Banks Jr. has been terrific for the Longhorns and would be welcomed with open arms by Maye and the Pats. He’s just a junior but has 37 starts already under his belt at Texas and has excellent movement skills and strength.  It’s still unclear if Bryce Young is the long-term answer for the Panthers, but it has been impressive how he’s managed to respond to getting benched earlier this year — he hasn’t been an MVP candidate or anything, but it looks like getting a hard reset has led to the game slowing down a bit for him. No matter who the QB is, Carolina could use a No. 1 receiver to add to an interesting group of pass catchers, and Burden is that guy. He’s got everything you want outside of the fact he’s 5’11, as he’s a major big play threat who can line up just about anywhere and would give Young another really fun target to go alongside promising youngsters Xavier Legette and Ja’Tavion Sanders. The Titans could be in play for a new QB, but if Sanders and Ward are off the board, I think their focus needs to be in the trenches. Will Campbell is the other top tackle in this Draft and whether Tennessee rolls with Will Levis for one more year or addresses the QB situation in free agency, they’ll want to do a better job keeping them upright. Campbell figures to be capable of providing that help, and it’s time to build inside-out in Tennessee.  The Jets are in the middle of one of the most disappointing years we’ve ever seen out of an NFL team relative to preseason expectations, and they’re going to need throw the baby out with the bathwater as they move on from the Aaron Rodgers era, which means a big roster shakeup that should include Haason Reddick leaving as a free agent. There isn’t really a QB worth taking here, so New York should just go with the best player available, which we think means Carter. The linebacker-turned-edge rusher has seemingly gotten better every week for the Penn State defense, he’s going to destroy the Combine, and would bolster a good Jets defensive line that features building blocks in Quinnen Williams and Will McDonald. It’s can come off as lazy to compare Carter to Micah Parsons as another LB-turned-EDGE from Penn State who wears 11, but also, that’s a pretty good comp. The Browns would be in a really interesting spot at this spot in the Draft. Perhaps by April a third QB will emerge as a consensus top-10 guy, but based on the play on the field this year, I’m not willing to put any other QB up here. Whoever is under center in Cleveland next year is going to need some guys to throw to, as Amari Cooper is gone and the current receiving corps is far from loaded. Tet McMillan would immediately give them a big-bodied No. 1 that can help any quarterback that ends up taking snaps in Cleveland next year. Arizona may have fallen off as a team, but the 6’5 McMillan is a one-man wrecking crew on the outside that no one has been able to figure out. As long as they don’t go down the Nick Wright path with this pick, they should really target McMillan if they can’t get one of the QBs. Good things tend to happen when teams select guys who played in Georgia’s defense. The Saints need to figure out a direction after firing Dennis Allen midseason (it does seem like interim coach Darren Rizzi has a real shot at getting the job), but a big part of that direction is figuring out a succession plan for guys like Cameron Jordan and Demario Davis. Chase Young is a free agent after this year, too, so they have a big hole at EDGE, and Williams is a long and talented option to build the pass rush around going forward. His numbers haven’t been quite as imposing as you might expect, but the measurables, good tape, and Georgia pedigree all make him worth a top-10 pick. The Bengals can’t stop anyone this year, and as a result, they are completely wasting what should be an MVP season from Joe Burrow. If they’re picking 10th and the best corner is sitting on the board still available, they should sprint to the podium to get this pick in. Johnson has been a bit out of sight, out of mind while sitting out with an injury, but he’s a bad dude on the outside and Cincy desperately needs an upgrade in their secondary. I know the temptation will be to replace Tee Higgins (who is almost assuredly not going to be back) with a top-10 receiver, but this is a thin receiver class at the very top once Burden and McMillan are off the board and their bigger issues are on defense, anyway.  Dallas has to figure out a ton of stuff this offseason, and in my eyes, none are bigger than “how do we keep opposing offenses from moving the ball on us at will?” Sorting out Micah Parsons’ future is important, but so is bolstering the heart of their defensive line, which is just not good enough. Graham could fix that immediately, as he’s the rare gigantic defensive tackle (6’3, 315 pounds) who is disruptive on all three downs and would make it easier for a guy like Parsons to eat off the edge. You can go in a lot of directions here, but Graham is the perfect mix of best player available and fills a need for the Cowboys. The Bears have to upgrade their line this offseason in front of Caleb Williams. The interior of the line is really the biggest need, but they could use an upgrade at tackle, as well. Simmons suffered a season-ending knee injury against Oregon, but was in the mix as one of the top tackles coming into this year after the way he played as a junior in 2023. They addressed the skill positions last year, but this Draft should be all about the trenches (on both sides of the ball) for the Bears.  Don’t discount a tight end here, as the Colts do seem like they’re still all-in on Anthony Richardson and that’s the biggest skill position hole on their offense — both Colston Loveland and Tyler Warren would be outstanding fits in Indianapolis. But their defense is not great, and Scourton would give them a powerful EDGE who can play the run or the pass, and is big enough (6’4, 285 pounds) that he can line up at defensive tackle in some situations. He’s been a key piece on the Aggie defense this year, and would be a good fit on a Colts defensive line that prioritizes big, physical dudes. Miami might see both of their safeties leave this offseason, and just generally could use a talent upgrade in the middle of the field. Malaki Starks would provide that, as the Georgia safety is a special player with positional versatility at either safety spot and can play some nickel. Starks flies around at the back end of the Georgia secondary and would bring some needed juice to the Dolphins defense.  It’s unfortunate that Morrison is out for the year with a hip injury, because he is a fantastic player and would make a Notre Dame defense that might be the best in America even better. He has just about every tool in the toolkit that you want out of a star cornerback, as he’s comfortable manning up opposing receivers or dropping into a zone, and he’s very willing to do what he needs to do against the run. A starting outside corner is going to be high on the list of priorities for the Bucs this offseason, and they manage to get one here. The Rams would be slightly upset they can’t get Morrison, but then, they’d remember they can get Revel and would be over the moon. If he didn’t tear his ACL before the season, Revel would have a real shot at going in the top-10 this year because of his elite size, athleticism, and competitive nature. Los Angeles desperately needs to come out of the Draft this year with one of the three standout cornerbacks, and while they miss on Johnson and Morrison, Revel fills the need they have, and it won’t shock us if you see a number of comparisons between him and Eagles rookie standout Quinyon Mitchell. The Niners are going to be in a fascinating spot this offseason if things don’t turn around quickly. But whether they are making major changes to personnel or just trying to retool for one more run with this group, adding some talent on the offensive line would be a good idea. Upgrading their right tackle spot would make a ton of sense, and if Williams doesn’t stay another year at Texas (which is in play if he thinks that’d get him a top 5-10 pick next year), he’s a mountain of a man that would likely intrigue John Lynch and company in the Bay.  James Conner is a free agent, and the Cardinals have seen the value in having a physical, bruising rushing threat alongside Kyler Murray this season. Well, there’s no one better at that style of running than Ashton Jeanty, and while it’s always a little tricky to find the spot for a running back in the first round, he’s a no-doubt talent. The Cardinals would be thrilled to land him at this spot, and the likely Heisman finalist would be very fun to see alongside Murray in the desert.  At some point, the Falcons will be good at rushing the passer again. It really is stunning just how long it has been since they’ve had a player record double-digit sacks in a season (it hasn’t happened since 2016!), and it’s not going to happen this year barring a miracle, either. They don’t even really pressure quarterbacks. Enter Pearce, who has been a load off the edge for Tennessee over the last two seasons — as of this writing, he has 17 sacks in two years. He could use some polish, but he’d be as good of a bet as Atlanta’s made on a young pass rusher in quite some time. Seattle is gonna be looking for some help up the middle on defense at just about every level this offseason. If the board shakes out this way, Seattle would have to at least consider adding the big fella from Kentucky to bolster the interior of their defensive front, with Jarran Reed a potential free agent departure. Mike MacDonald is going to want to beef up his defense and what better way to do that than adding a 6’6, 344 pound wrecking ball up front, as Walker pops off the screen every time you watch Kentucky.  This is a bit of a luxury pick, but Washington has its face of the franchise under center in Jayden Daniels, and one of his favorite targets is soon-to-be free agent tight end Zach Ertz, who turns 35 this offseason. As such, we’ll give him Warren, who has been the best tight end in college football this year and a remarkably versatile piece for the Nittany Lion offense. He’ll play as a tight end, outside receiver, slot receiver, running back, quarterback, and snap the ball, all in the same game. An offense built around Daniels, Warren, and Terry McLaurin would be one of the most fun in the NFL, and if the Commanders want to challenge the Eagles in the NFC East, they’re going to need guys who will help them win shootouts. The Texans have two great edge rushers in Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson, but their interior line play has left something to be desired. Williams helps anchor the excellent defensive front for Ohio State, as very few teams find room to run in the middle against the Buckeyes this season. Putting the 327-pounder between Hunter and Anderson would help address some of Houston’s problems, and the Texans have shown in the past they want to invest heavily in their defensive line.  One of the biggest surprises in the NFL this year has been the Broncos, which look like they struck gold by picking Bo Nix last year. Their tight end room hasn’t given them much of anything this year — Adam Trautman has nine catches on 15 targets — but as we saw with Jimmy Graham in New Orleans, Sean Payton can do some really fun things with a big time player in that position. Loveland fits that bill. He’s a good blocker for a college tight end who hasn’t been able to show off his effectiveness in the passing game as much this year because of how bad the QB play has been in Ann Arbor. And with no receivers really worth taking here, Denver brings in the best skill position player on the board for their young QB. Wow, crazy, Jim Harbaugh takes one of his former Michigan players, what a shock. Truth be told, if Loveland is on the board, we think Harbaugh himself might sprint to the podium to say his name within 10 seconds of the Chargers getting on the clock, as he would fill a critical need for another pass catcher. Instead, they go with another Michigan Man™ who fills a need in Grant, who moves really well for his size (6’3, 339 pounds) and would know exactly what he needs to do in Jesse Minter’s defense from day one. He can slide right in at nose tackle and make life easier for everyone in the Chargers’ front seven. The Ravens defense has not been playing at the level folks in Baltimore are accustomed to, and that figures to be the focal point of their offseason. Walker would give the Ravens a really talented and versatile linebacker that they can use as an edge rusher and play off ball some when needed next to fellow Bulldog Roquan Smith. Walker has shown flashes this season, particularly in the Texas game where he had three sacks in a blowout win for the Dawgs, and Baltimore could find plenty of ways to use his talents.  A real wild card team at the end of the first round right now, the Steelers could be all over the place. One thing they’ll at least have to think about is a quarterback, as they don’t have a long-term answer right now. I’d expect Russell Wilson to be back on a short-term deal, but at this pick, they might consider taking the hyper-talented Milroe and letting him sit and learn some of the finer points of the passing game at the NFL level before throwing him out on the field. Milroe is an S-tier athlete, and the Steelers could get him some touches and action in running packages, where he’d be even more dynamic than Justin Fields is in those spots now.  In a division that features three opposing teams with a wealth of pass catching options, Green Bay could really stand to upgrade its cornerback room and put someone on the other side of Jaire Alexander, who has also missed some time this year due to injuries. Bolstering their pass rush wouldn’t be a bad idea, either, but Barron is a veteran, battle-tested member of the Longhorn secondary who plays all over the place and would brings some versatility and tenacity to Lambeau. Aaron Jones has been great for Minnesota on a 1-year rental, but they will likely be looking for a long-term answer at running back next year as they presumably prepare for JJ McCarthy to take over as their starting quarterback. Hampton doesn’t get a lot of discussion because UNC stinks, but he’s a crazy talented back and I think he’s going to be really good in the NFL. The Vikings love using running backs in the pass game, too, and Hampton has 34 catches for 295 yards this season. Beck has had a rollercoaster season in Athens, which has led to some reconsidering his position in this Draft. That said, I think by the time we get to April, he’ll be firmly back in the first round conversation thanks to some Pro Day buzz, and this might be too late to get him. If he is still on the board, someone that missed out early on the top two guys would have to look at trading back in to get him, and I think the Browns should seriously consider doing that. Philly is a willing trade-back team and there’s no one particularly exciting here to add for them. Cleveland desperately needs an answer at QB long-term after the disaster that has been Deshaun Watson. Beck had a really bad stretch of turnover-prone games and the decision-making has been questionable at times, but he also makes the kinds of throws that make scouts and coaches go wild. Perhaps the Browns would rather bottom out next year to chase on of the top QBs then — a top guy in the 2026 class if he stays in school another year, Penn State QB Drew Allar, is from northeast Ohio and a childhood Browns fan — but I think someone will look to jump back into the first round to secure Beck if he slides this far.  Receiver wouldn’t be a bad course of action for the Bills, but there really isn’t anyone who would step right in and raise the group’s ceiling, plus they can just re-sign Amari Cooper. Instead, let’s have them get a running mate at defensive tackle for Ed Oliver in Harmon, who has been really good for the Ducks this year after transferring in from Michigan State. He’s big, disruptive, plays the run well, and is among Oregon’s leaders in sacks and tackles for loss.  The name of the game in Kansas City is keeping Patrick Mahomes upright, and despite being only 11 games into the season, he’s been sacked 27 times — he’s never been sacked more than 28 times in his career, and he’s getting sacked on 6.62 percent of his dropbacks, a career-high. They have to protect him better, and targeting Ersery to replace Wanya Morris at LT would make a ton of sense. A three-year starter for PJ Fleck, Ersery is 6’6, 325 pounds, a good athlete for his size, and brings some bite as a run blocker, too. He impressed in his biggest test of the season (Abdul Carter had zero sacks when Minnesota played Penn State), and we wouldn’t be surprised if he’s off the board sooner than this, especially if he tests well in Indianapolis. The Lions will have a vanity pick, which is pretty wild to consider, and what says “Dan Campbell vanity pick” more than taking an interior offensive lineman. The tackle position is set for years in Detroit, but they could use some help bolstering their guard spot between them — it’s worth remembering that Graham Glasgow turns 33 this offseason, while Kevin Zeitler turns 35. I think the Lions would love to have a swing guy that can move around as needed on the line, and Jackson started the year as a guard for the Buckeyes but kicked out to left tackle when Josh Simmons got hurt and will presumably finish the year there."

	A very good 'Inside the NBA' riff revolved around one moment on Kendrick Lamar's new album and some curious decisions Drake's made recently.","Kendrick Lamar stunned everyone last week when he teased and then dropped his newest album, GNX. Two things happened very quickly: One, it began receiving widespread acclaim, and two, people started screaming “MUSTARD” as loud as they could immediately after they heard “TV Off” for the first time. Lamar screams it on the track as a way to shout out collaborator DJ Mustard, and because the internet just does this sometimes, it got turned into a meme. Because it was a thing people were making jokes about, it seemed a foregone conclusion that it would pop up on Inside the NBA sooner rather than later. And during halftime of Tuesday night’s NBA Cup game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Phoenix Suns, “TV Off” came over the speakers, which led to a very good riff from the fellas and special guest panelist Jalen Rose. Shaq decided to scream “MUSTAAAAAARD” a few times and crack a joke or two, while Rose slid in a spectacular line that we assume Drake won’t love. “I don’t know if y’all should be playing that Kendrick,” Rose told the desk. “You don’t wanna get a lawsuit up in here.” “Lawsuits don’t scare us around here,” Ernie Johnson quickly responded. Rose, of course, is referencing the multiple legal actions that Drake has threatened against Universal Music Group around the biggest song from his feud with Kendrick over the summer, “Not Like Us.” No lawsuits have been filed yet, but if this does turn into a full-blown legal fight between Drake and UMG, we are willing to be large sums of money that Inside is going to make a ton of jokes about it."

	While it is unclear if Jokic has picked a side in the Drake and Kendrick feud, at least he knows one of the songs from it.","Here’s the thing with Nikola Jokic: Despite being the best basketball player on the planet, he’s done a very good job of keeping his personal life and interests away from the court out of the public eye. All we really know about him is that the dude absolutely loves horses, to the point that he was pretty bummed when he learned that the Denver Nuggets’ championship parade in 2023 was going to keep him from getting back to his horses in Serbia as soon as possible. Well as it turns out, we now know a thing that Nikola Jokic apparently likes: the song “Not Like Us.” While warming up for Monday’s game between the Nuggets and the New York Knicks, Jokic rapped along to the song while Russell Westbrook had the time of his life on the bench, which you can view here. I would love to know Jokic’s complete thoughts on the feud between Kendrick Lamar and Drake, along with whether or not he knows all the words to “Euphoria,” “6:16 in LA,” and of course, “Meet the Grahams.” A lot of this is because, when we did this back in 2019, Jokic refused to answer because he claimed it was someone I’d have never heard of, so I am fascinated in learning more about his taste in music."
Sports – UPROXX,Charles Barkley Thinks The Lakers Are Doing An ‘Awful’ Job Handling Bronny’s Development,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/charles-barkley-lakers-bronny-james-development-g-league/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 18:27:33 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	Barkley thinks the Lakers are doing Bronny a disservice keeping him from playing road games with the G League.","The Los Angeles Lakers have gotten off to a solid start to the 2024-25 season, going 10-6 in their first 16 games with JJ Redick at the helm. Even with the actual play on the court going pretty well, the Lakers still manage to create a bit of controversy with the way they are handling the rookie season of second round pick Bronny James.  Bronny made his debut in the opener alongside LeBron, becoming the first father-son duo in league history to play together, and since then has made 6 NBA appearances — including in the Lakers visit to Cleveland, where Bronny was born. He’s also spent some time in the G League with the South Bay Lakers, playing two games so far with the Lakers affiliate. The reason Bronny has only made two appearances in the G League is the decision was made not have Bronny traveling and playing road games with South Bay. That, of course, limits the opportunities for James to get in game action, which is the point of having him in the G League, but travel for G League teams isn’t by charter and the decision was made just to keep him in L.A.  That move has led to plenty of conversation, with much of it focusing on whether the Lakers are stunting Bronny’s development with their plan. Charles Barkley certainly thinks so, explaining on a recent radio hit on “The Bettor Angle” why he thinks it’s not fair to Bronny or the South Bay Lakers (10:00 mark of the below video).  “They’ve handled it awful,” Barkley said. “Awful. … I thought it was great, a little ceremonial first game, but the kid’s not ready to play in the NBA. He should be in the G League so he can play basketball. He’s not going to get better sitting on the bench. But also this thing where he’s only gonna play home games, it’s wild? You mean stupid. It’s not fair to him. It’s not fair to the team. Can you imagine a coach of that — like, you come off a road trip and there’s a player you ain’t seen in a week or two, and then you feel like you gotta play him. I don’t think they’re doing Bronny any favors and they just handled this thing really bad. It’s a bad look for the Lakers. I actually think it’s a bad look — I really like everything LeBron’s done, but this is a bad look for him in my opinion.”  There’s no doubt that Bronny needs game reps and keeping him off of the road certainly limits his chances to get those. As for the bit about a guy being on and off the roster throughout the season, if there’s anywhere guys are going to be accustomed to dealing with that, it’s the G League where you regularly have players going up and down to and from NBA rosters — particularly with two-way deals being so prominent now. The reasoning from the Lakers (and James family) perspective is likely that flying commercial and going to G League arenas brings some considerable security questions that are not guaranteed to be met for someone with Bronny’s popularity. That said, it’s hard to argue with the criticism that James isn’t getting the maximum opportunity to develop from a basketball perspective."

	Four injured All-Stars are all expected to return to the court this week.","Injuries: They’re not fun! For the first month or so of the season, fans have lamented that some of the biggest stars in the league have missed time due to knocks they suffered this season. Fortunately, we haven’t seen too many long-term injuries that are set to cost guys extended periods of time, and this week, a handful of former All-Star selections who have spent time on the sidelines are slated to return to action. Arguably the biggest beneficiaries of this are the Phoenix Suns, which have spent the last seven games without Kevin Durant due to a calf strain and have looked awful with him sidelined. Over the last five games, Phoenix has also dealt with the absence of Bradley Beal due to his own calf strain. Fortunately for the Suns, both are expected to be back for Tuesday’s NBA Cup game against the Los Angeles Lakers, according to Shams Charania of ESPN. The Memphis Grizzlies, meanwhile, have seemingly been in a state of injury crisis for the last year, with Ja Morant getting caught up in that. After only appearing in nine games last year due to a suspension and a shoulder injury that he suffered in practice, Morant has only played in eight games this year due to a hip injury, but that is going to change on Monday night, according to Chris Haynes. Morant, who has not played since Nov. 6, is in line to return for the Grizzlies’ game against the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday night. In a good bit of news for the New Orleans Pelicans, Haynes also reported that their high-profile offseason acquisition, Dejounte Murray, is slated to return to action after suffering a hand fracture in the team’s season opener — although he won’t play in Monday’s game against the Toronto Raptors, Murray is expected to return on Wednesday against the Indiana Pacers. The team traded for Murray in a deal with the Atlanta Hawks, but he’s only been able to give them 30 minutes this year due to his injury, which is part of the reason why New Orleans is off to a Western Conference-worst 4-13 start to the year."

	Porzingis has not played this season after suffering a foot injury during the 2024 NBA Finals.","The Boston Celtics have been on a role to start this season, as the team is 14-3 at this early juncture, sits in second place in the Eastern Conference behind the scorching hot Cleveland Cavaliers (who Boston has already beaten this year), and looks to be in as good of a position to defend a championship as any team in recent memory. All of this has happened without the services of Kristaps Porzingis, who has not played this season after suffering a foot injury during the NBA Finals that required surgery. Fortunately for the Celtics, their time without Porzingis on the floor is about to come to an end. According to Shams Charania of ESPN, Boston is going to get Porzingis back during Monday night’s game against the Los Angeles Clippers. “Porzingis has been making rapid improvements in his recovery from foot surgery in late June, completing scrimmages in recent weeks of practices with the Celtics and their NBA G League affiliate, Maine,” Charania wrote. Porzingis joined the Celtics via a trade with the Washington Wizards last offseason and immediately became a perfect fit for how Joe Mazzulla wants to use his centers. His three point shooting and ability to protect the rim were invaluable when he was able to play, but a calf injury limited him to only seven games in the team’s run to a championship last year. Not long after his return in the NBA Finals, the Celtics announced that Porzingis suffered a torn medial retinaculum allowing dislocation of the posterior tibialis tendon in his left leg during Game 2, which the team deemed a “rare injury.” He was able to play 16 minutes in their Game 5 win that sealed a championship, but needed offseason surgery."

	The Cowboys led 20-9 with just over three minutes to play and ended up with a 34-26 win thanks to the dumbest finish to a game this year.","The Commanders and Cowboys played in. one of the funniest games in the NFL this season, as the two divisional rivals went back and forth with each team being on the wrong end of some massive blunders in what ended up a 34-26 Cowboys win.  The final three minutes was particularly insane, as it saw the game go from 20-9 Dallas to 34-26 with a truly outrageous sequence of events. The first was a touchdown from Jayden Daniels to Zach Ertz, with Daniels running in the two-point try to make it 20-17. On the ensuing kickoff, Kavontae Turpin let the ball bounce in front of him and had it roll past him for a near-disaster, before turning it into a touchdown return with a quick spin move and outrageous speed, making it 27-17.   A post shared by NFL (@nfl)  The Commanders would then kick a field goal with just under two minutes to play to make it 27-20. A failed onside kick figured to be about the end of things, but it was truly just the beginning. Washington’s defense got the three-and-out needed to give their offense a chance at a miracle, and Daniels delivered for the second time this season as Dallas’ defense melted down, allowing Terry McLaurin to catch the ball and evade everyone on his way for an 87-yard touchdown. However, Austin Seibert had already missed an extra point earlier in the game, so it was anything but a guarantee they would tie the game, and sure enough a bad snap led to a rushed operation and Seibert hooked another left of the uprights to keep it a 1-point game (videos below).   A post shared by NFL (@nfl)  On the ensuing onside kick, the Cowboys scooped it up and ran it back for a touchdown, which was the one thing that could keep the Commanders hopes alive, as they would get the ball back with time on the clock and a chance at another Hail Mary. Alas, this time Daniels’ efforts at a miracle ended up being caught by Dallas and the game finally ended with a Cowboys win that became far more difficult than it ever needed to be."

	Fred VanVleet did not like getting ejected and definitely earned a fine with how he went out at the end of Blazers-Rockets.","The Houston Rockets have had a phenomenal start to the 2024-25 season, entering Saturday’s game against Portland at 12-5 on the young season, but things did not go as planned against the scrappy, young Blazers in a 104-98 loss.  The frustrations of that loss were evident late in the fourth quarter when Fred VanVleet got ejected after getting into it with the officials, telling them all that they suck, but then took things a step further after getting run by walking directly to the official that tossed him, pointing in his face, and telling him “you’re a b*tch.”  pic.twitter.com/wtHPtHgSMc — Diamond Scar (@diamondscar22) November 24, 2024  From the TV angle, it wasn’t clear if VanVleet made contact with the official’s face, which was of concern to the Rockets broadcast crew as that would’ve been an auto-suspension. However, a side angle showed that he did not make contact, but did still point his finger right in the ref’s face in a moment that wasn’t exactly his finest. This will definitely lead to VanVleet paying a hefty fine to the league office, and we’ll have to wait and see if, even without actually poking the ref, this crossed enough of a line to earn him a night off without pay. VanVleet is averaging 14.9 points and 6.2 assists per game this season for Houston."

	The Warriors tend to have very good seasons when Kendrick Lamar puts out an album.","Kendrick Lamar stunned everyone on Friday afternoon. There had been hopes for months that a new album was on the way following his high-profile feud with Drake, and it looked like we were going to get another sign that something big was on the horizon when he released the music video for “GNX.” And then, Kendrick took things a step further by just releasing his sixth studio album, which is also titled “GNX.” Because it is an album that Kendrick Lamar released out of nowhere, people went from being stunned to praising the project. And it’s possible that no one ends up being happier about this than the Golden State Warriors. Why, you may ask? Well, as it turns out, good things tend to happen to the Warriors — which entered Friday night’s game against the New Orleans Pelicans with an 11-3 record, good for first place in the Western Conference — when Kendrick puts out an album. Each of the last four times that has happened, the team has gone on to win an NBA championship, with To Pimp a Butterfly coming out in March 2015, Damn. getting released in April 2017, and Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers dropping in April 2022. There was also the soundtrack to Black Panther, which came out in February 2018 and featured songs that were either performed or curated by Kendrick. As for his other two studio albums, Section.80 and good kid, m.A.A.d city, the former came out a few weeks after they drafted Klay Thompson, and the latter was released in Oct. 2012, one week before the start of the 2012-13 NBA season, which marked the first time that Golden State made it to the postseason with Steph Curry on the team. Now, the overwhelming likelihood is that this is a bunch of insane coincidences, but if the Warriors do end up winning a championship, we’re going to think something weird is going on … and Kendrick will probably be a little bummed, as he’s a well-documented fan of the Los Angeles Lakers, which are currently the 4-seed in the West and find themselves 1.5 games back of Golden State."

	Jones, the No. 6 overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, was benched by the Giants earlier this week.","The New York Giants made the decision to bench starting quarterback Daniel Jones earlier this week amid a brutal year where the offense has struggled to find any sort of consistent rhythm. Now, in a shocking turn of events, the team announced on Friday afternoon that the sixth overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft asked for and was granted his immediate release. In a statement, which you can read in its entirely below, Giants president John Mara praised Jones for his handling of his benching, and made clear that parting ways was a mutual decision. Daniel came to see me this morning and asked if we would release him. We mutually agreed that would be the best for him and for the team.  Daniel has been a great representative of our organization, first class in every way. His handling of this situation yesterday exemplifies just that. We are all disappointed in how things have worked out.  We hold Daniel in high regard and have a great appreciation for him. We wish him nothing but the best in the future. Jones has had a tumultuous tenure in New York, as the decision to draft him that high was largely based on his perceived upside. While he’s certainly flashed the ability to be an accurate passer and a threat with his legs — so much so that the team gave him a $160 million extension in 2023 that was cited as a reason why they could not bring back Saquon Barkley in free agency this offseason — he’s never been able to become the face of the franchise the team envisioned. The Giants sit at 2-8 on the season, and are playing host to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday afternoon. The team has already announced that Tommy DeVito will start under center. To add some intrigue to this, the Giants face the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving this year. Dallas has had its own QB struggles this season as Dak Prescott is out for the year with the injury, and if they wanted, it would make sense to bring in Jones and try to get him up to speed ahead of Thursday."

	Miller made one of the best defensive plays you will ever see to stop an alley-oop by the Pistons.","The Charlotte Hornets and the Detroit Pistons squared off on Thursday night in a battle of two up-and-coming teams that hope to take a step forward in the Eastern Conference this season. While neither of them are expected to compete for a championship or anything, both are built around promising young players and hope that better days are on the horizon. One of the brightest young stars in Thursday’s game was Brandon Miller, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft who flashed as a rookie and has built on that in a big way during his second year in the league. Unfortunately for the Pistons, that meant finding out that Miller is a freak of nature, as evidenced by him making one of the best defensive plays you will ever see when he single-handedly blew up an attempted alley-oop by picking a Wendell Moore lob out of mid-air.  A post shared by NBA (@nba)  If Miller became horizontal during this, it’d look an awful lot like Odell Beckham Jr.’s famous one-handed catch from when he played for the Giants. Anyway, the Hornets won in overtime, 123-121, with Miller leading the way, as the former Alabama standout went for 38 points, seven rebounds, four assists, four steals, and a block in 42 minutes of work."

	Gobert got a 3-second call as he pouted over not getting the ball late in a tie game, and Anthony Edwards was not happy.","The Minnesota Timberwolves were one of the best teams and stories of the 2023-24 season, as Anthony Edwards made the leap into superstardom, Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert figured out how to play off of each other around him, and they made a run to the Western Conference Finals.  The vibes in Minnesota were, as they say, immaculate, but then a week before training camp they traded Towns to New York for Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo in a trade that has seen both the Knicks and Wolves struggling to build chemistry early in the season. Both teams are still hovering around .500, but the Knicks can get away with that in the East and still have a good look at a top-4 seed. In the West things are very different, as the Wolves came into Thursday’s game in Toronto with a tenuous hold on sixth at 8-6, needing a win to avoid dropping to a tie for 10th early this season.  In theory, the 3-12 Raptors should’ve been a good spot to get a win for the Wolves, but Minnesota found themselves in a dogfight with Toronto (on their incredible alternate court) late in the fourth quarter. With the game tied at 95-95 and five minutes to play, the Wolves chemistry issues became apparent when Randle waved off Gobert who had deep post position under the hoop, and the 4-time DPOY responded by walking to the other side of the lane to get a 3-second violation.   A post shared by LeagueAlerts Inc. (@leaguealerts)  While Gobert’s frustration is understandable, as he had two feet in the restricted area with a seal on a smaller defender and didn’t get the ball, you also can’t purposefully get a turnover in a tie game in the fourth quarter. That was what Anthony Edwards was thinking, as he got on Gobert as they came down the floor, letting him know that’s not an acceptable reaction to not getting the ball. That turnover proved to be important as the Wolves saw the Raptors pull away late for a 110-105 win, dropping Minnesota to 8-7 and a tie for 10th in the West with Dallas and Sacramento."

	To celebrate Hubie Brown calling it a career, we looked back on how old he was during major events that happened in his lifetime.","Basketball fans are going to see broadcasts get a little worse sooner rather than later. That’s because Hubie Brown, the legendary former coach who has turned into a stalwart on ESPN’s coverage of the league, will only call one more game before he retires at 91 years old. “We are going to give Hubie one last shot on a game,” ESPN president Burke Magnus told Jimmy Traina of Sports Illustrated. “He deserves that. We think the world of him. I think it is absolutely remarkable the level in which he still calls games at age 90-plus. I don’t mean to be purposely mysterious here but we are going to honor Hubie during the regular season at some point to be determined and send him off in style.” That he is still capable of working at 91 is remarkable, but Brown is still sharp as a tack and as good as it gets calling basketball games, and while no one has deserved retirement more, it’s always a tough day when someone as highly-regarded as him calls it a career. There is, still, no one better at seeing something, pointing it out, and explaining why it’s a big deal than Brown, and he has terrific chemistry with his broadcast partners. We’re all going to miss Hubie, and to celebrate the end of his time in the booth, we wanted to celebrate him by having some fun and looking at everything he’s seen over his extraordinary life. You see, Hubie was born on Sept. 25, 1933, which means he has been around for, quite literally, every single game that the NBA has played — the league was founded in June of 1946, when he was 12 years old. That got us wondering: How old was he during some of the biggest moments in world, American, and NBA history over the last century or so? Let’s dive in. Start of WWII: 5 years old (Sept. 1, 1939)

	ESPN content president Burke Magnus explained that the network's biggest star ending up on its newest property is a bit tricky.","ESPN has about a year to figure out how it’s going to handle Inside the NBA. As part of Warner Bros. Discovery’s deal to remain in the NBA’s media ecosystem, it was announced that Turner will continue to produce Inside, but license it out to ESPN, which solves the network’s longstanding issues trying to put together a pregame, halftime, and postgame NBA show that viewers enjoy. An unsurprising question that popped up after this was whether Stephen A. Smith — who is in the middle of some high-profile contract negotiations with ESPN — would find a way onto the show. Smith is the guy ESPN has built its NBA coverage around, and while that has come under plenty of criticism, he’s famously close with the Inside crew and has appeared on it in the past. But apparently, as of now, the network doesn’t have any intetion of putting Stephen A. on their newest property. “We have no plans to do that,” ESPN content president Burke Magnus told Jimmy Traina of Sports Illustrated. “And that’s because, frankly, the construct of the deal really doesn’t — that’s not how it was conceived. What is conceived is that Turner, as they have always done with this show, with this cast, with the people involved behind the scenes, are going to continue to do what they’ve always done. And we’re going to distribute it on the ESPN platform. Frankly, that’s exactly what we want. We don’t want to change it. We don’t want to interject new talent into it. We don’t want to really do anything to it.” It is worth mentioning that the scuttlebutt around Smith’s contract negotiations revolves around him wanting to do more NFL stuff for ESPN, but considering how big Inside is and his relationship with the guys, it is fair to wonder if he’d want to have any sort of presence on the show as part of a new deal (if, of course, he comes to terms with the network on one). For now, the complexities of the deal with Turner gives ESPN a way to say they have no plans of putting him on Inside in any capacity, but we’ll certainly be waiting to see if that changes as Smith and ESPN sit down at the negotiating table.

	Come get these winners.","In many circles, Week 11 has been described as the best slate of games so far when it comes to the 2024 NFL season, and it is hard to argue. There was entertaining action in every window other than Monday night and, on a week-to-week basis, that is not always the case. In this space, we also found success with a third winning week in the last four. Granted, it came with a hilarious investment in a team that lost by approximately 100, but a loss counts the same by a half-point or 30 points, right? Before we get to the Week 12 schedule and five picks against the spread, let’s take a look at the (unfortunately negative) season-long progress. Come get these winners. We struck with our principles last Thursday to success, and we’re doing it again here. It is unsightly to bet on Cleveland right now, and I won’t argue that. The Browns are 2-8 and having a season from hell. With that said, the market is too high on the Steelers in this spot. Pittsburgh continues to be unreal in an underdog role under Mike Tomlin, but the Steelers are 33-41-3 (44.6%) as a road favorite under his watch. Do I think the games from 2008 impact this week? I do not, but I can’t get this to more than a field goal on a short week in Cleveland. Let’s go Browns. This is a space that prides itself on taking the stands that few others will take. This is another example. The Lions are dominating everyone. We found that out the hard way last week. But this is really a 7.5-point number on the road? Detroit’s ATS record (8-2) is stellar but things have gone too far. Or maybe we’ll lose this bet and swear off fading the Lions for a while. Either way, I like the home dog here. Our Wong teaser of the week is here. Tennessee’s defense has been spunky this season, but the Titans still have Will Levis and a rudderless offense that gives us hope in the Texans at home with the move through key numbers. On the other side, I’ve actually been a touch low on the 49ers compared to the market this season and, while that has been the right stance on the whole, this is a principle play to take it up to 8.5. Remember when the 12th Man meant something? Well, the Seahawks are 2-4 at home this season, and the word is out on that. While I am not suggesting that home-field advantage is the reason for this play, I like Seattle to keep it going after a strong performance in an upset over San Francisco a week ago. Arizona is off a bye and on a four-game winning streak but, no matter what I do, I can’t get this to a pick’em, much less than +1 available at BetMGM right now. I don’t give out many road favorites, but I tend to make exceptions for when the Chargers are the home team. Granted, a lot has changed in Los Angeles, with Jim Harbaugh immediately turning the Chargers into a very competent and effective outfit. However, the Chargers still might have the least significant home-field advantage in the NFL, and Baltimore is at least slightly undervalued here coming off a loss to Pittsburgh."

	Charles Barkley wasn't gonna let the night go by without making a joke about their upcoming move to ESPN next fall.","Over the weekend, some exciting news broke regarding the future of Inside the NBA, as ESPN is adding the beloved studio show as part of a new licensing agreement with Warner Bros. Discovery. The show will continue to be produced independently by TNT Sports from their Atlanta studio, with Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, Shaquille O’Neal, and Charles Barkley remaining employees of WBD — well, so long as they get Shaq’s contract done — but they’ll be part of ESPN and ABC’s coverage of the Playoffs, Finals, and major regular season games. That was stunning news to many fans, largely because ESPN has been trying to figure out how to create a competitor to Inside for decades to no avail, and the fellas have never been afraid of making fun of ESPN — particularly Barkley. Chuck has taken ESPN and their analysts to tasks a number of times over the years, and while I doubt that stops in total, he knows times are changing soon for he and the rest of the fellas. On Tuesday night, after the Spurs beat the Thunder in the late game on TNT, Chuck couldn’t help but crack a joke to Kenny Smith that they’ve gotta “go back to kissing ass” ahead of their move to ESPN next fall.  No one has been more outspoken over the last six months about the contract negotiations with the NBA than Barkley, sometimes to the chagrin of his colleagues. He’s been extremely vocal about his frustrations with TNT not keeping NBA rights and has noted his biggest concern is trying to figure out how to keep everyone at TNT employed. That mission seems to have been accomplished with this latest news of the show being licensed to ESPN, and he showed still going to be Chuck and poke fun at the new arrangement."

	Another case of Vince Staples, being Vince Staples.","Vince Staples isn’t afraid to voice his opinion regarding anything and anyone. No one is exempt from the “Little Homies” rapper’s blunt takes—not fellow musicians, fans, or content creators. Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum is the latest person to feel his humorous wrath. Today (November 19), Vince Staples and Jayson Tatum came face-to-face in a new commercial for the Jordan brand (viewable here). Instead of using his beloved lyricism on full display, Vince channelled his words for another reason. As highlights of Tatum’s Championship season took over the screen, Vince gave Tatum a piece of his mind. “What type of dude is Jayson Tatum,” asked Vince. “The type of dude who’d crush a team and then say some cold sh*t like, ‘We just played our game and the rest took care of itself.'” As Vince pointed out, Tatum is a many of few words but when he does speak out against his opponents it cuts deeps. However, Tatum manages to keep a cool head or so Vince argued, saying: “The type that have a whole city and internet, booing him. And he’s just smiling.” Before the clip ends, Vince has one more grievance to air as a long-suffering Los Angeles Clippers fan. “That sh*t really message me up, man,” he said.  Unfazed by it all, Tatum laughs off Vince’s monologue. In Tatum’s eyes, it doesn’t matter who hates him because his partner, singer Ella Mai and their child provides more than enough love to make up for it."

	After a loss dropped the Sixers to 2-11 on the year, the team held a players-only meeting where Maxey voiced a gripe about Embiid.","The Philadelphia 76ers have been the biggest disappointment in the NBA to start the 2024-25 season. While there have been injuries to Joel Embiid, Paul George, and Tyrese Maxey that have prevented them from taking the court as a trio, Philadelphia has gotten off to a 2-11 start this year, which is tied with the openly tanking Washington Wizards for the worst record in the NBA. For a team that entered this season with championship aspirations, it’s pretty shocking to see just how bad Philly has been. And following a 106-89 loss to the Miami Heat on Monday night where the team blew a 19-point lead, Kyle Lowry called for a players-only meeting, according to Shams Charania of ESPN. And per Charania, the meeting included Maxey confronting Embiid with a message that the former NBA MVP “accepted.” Via ESPN: In the meeting, Maxey challenged Embiid to be on time to team activities, calling out the former league MVP about being late “for everything” and how it impacts the locker room, from other players to the coaching staff, sources briefed on the meeting told ESPN. Maxey and Embiid have a close friendship and have a history of holding each other accountable, according to those around the team. Embiid was listed as doubtful to play against the Heat with an illness, but eventually took the floor and struggled, going for 11 points, eight rebounds, and five assists in 31 minutes of work on 5-for-11 shooting from the field. Maxey, meanwhile, was unable to play, as he’s working his way back from a hamstring strain he suffered earlier this season. Charania also noted that Sixers players addressed head coach Nick Nurse, saying that “they want to be coached harder, and coaches in turn said they want players to practice with purpose and attention to detail.”"

	Powerhouse Hobbs has a list of aspirations after spending seven months out with a knee injury.","Powerhouse Hobbs wasn’t sure how fans were going to receive his return. Recency bias is a real thing in the wrestling industry, and any extended absence comes with the reality that you’re out of sight and out of mind.  When he walked out of the tunnel to the roar of the live audience as Ricochet’s surprise partner just two weeks ago, any anxiety over what the reaction would look like evaporated. For Hobbs, it was like he’d never left.  “It was one of those things where it let me know how special this business is, how special the fans are,” Hobbs tells Uproxx Sports. “When it comes down to it, we do it for them. We do it for their entertainment. We do it for their reactions. We do it because we love it. We all love to go out and perform in front of them. But then when they go ahead and give you that love back, man, it makes you want to go even harder.” As smooth as he looked in his return to the ring, the prior seven months were anything but easy.  He ruptured his patella tendon in a main event match, going from the high of being prominently featured on television on Wednesday night to having surgery the following Monday. The next day, he flew across the country, and just a week later was back in the gym determined to return stronger.  “I probably had a few days to be in my feelings and soak everything in,” Hobbs says. “But my main objective was to come back better than when I left. This recovery, I would get up at five, eat, in the gym by six on one leg for two hours, come home, eat, then off to PT for three hours a day, Monday through Saturday.” There were moments Hobbs says he felt helpless. He couldn’t bend his knee at all. He remembers the emotions of asking his three-year-old daughter to help take his sock off, asking his son to help him stand, or making sure he had something to hold onto so he didn’t fall in the shower.  The experience, Hobbs says, humbled him. Small accomplishments compounded. A strong support system that included conversations with wrestling legends like Sting, Mark Henry, and Billy Gunn helped him prepare for the ups, downs, and evolving mindset in how he’d navigate his return.  In his time away, Hobbs focused on the things he could control and put extra effort on how he could elevate other areas of his game.  “I got a lot of promos just sitting on the couch watching wrestling. I was very angry, not being able to do what I want to do,” Hobbs says.  Practicing patience is something Hobbs has had to learn over his four years in AEW, and especially now in what’s essentially a fresh start. You can’t manufacture many of the special moments in wrestling — they’re going to happen organically, like the infamous Meat chants last year. “You’re going to hear the people tell you what they want,” Hobbs says, “so it’s on you to capitalize on it.” Hearing the crowd react to his return, and feeding off their energy over the past few weeks, should give him confidence that he’ll be able to be successful in his career refresh. He created a list of aspirations during his time away, including another singles championship reign.  There’s no order to how he goes about checking off his accomplishments, but admits the primary focus is a “longer, stronger reign.” His path to wearing championship gold again comes with confidence, believing in himself, and turning the volume up on his character.  Before his injury, Hobbs says there were discussions about how he could start bringing who he is in real life to his character. Now that he’s had time to sit and stew on the future, he’s ready to show the world who he is.  “I’m going to start bringing my life into my character, the things that I hate, the things that I love. I’m just gonna show everyone how much more intense I can be, how destructive I can be, how I don’t give a shit at times who’s in my way,” Hobbs says. “In the end, this business, there only can be one. It’s going to come to a point where I’m going to show everybody that it’s all about me. They’re either going to be with me or be against me. It doesn’t matter. They boo me, I’m just going to start tearing everything up in front of them.  “And I think that’s what wrestling is missing a little bit. That one guy who makes people afraid, but they want to see him kick someone’s ass. I feel that it’s time to bring it out.”"

	Jake Paul's boxing fit in his match against Mike Tyson was one of the most expensive in boxing history. Here is what he wore.","Over the weekend, social media sensation turned legit boxer Jake Paul faced off against the mighty (if aged) Mike Tyson, attracting the eyes of 60 million viewers for what was undoubtedly the fight of the year. The two fighters, aged 27 and 58 respectively, lasted the entire eight rounds, with Paul ultimately besting Iron Mike, crushing the hearts of pretty much everybody over the age of 30. But we’re not here to talk about the fight, we’re here to talk about Jake Paul’s fit, which Paul revealed on the “Talk Tuah” podcast was worth over $1 million. “This outfit that I’ve made for the fight is the most expensive fight outfit in the history of boxing,” said Paul. The fit was a custom piece designed by Dominic Ciambrone’s Surgeon Studios and featured metallic silver shorts with diamond tennis chains, and a graphic of Mr. Monopoly holding a money bag. The full outfit was completed with a jewel-encrusted gray jacket prominently featuring the logo of Paul’s new body care line W. It’s flashy, brash, and eye-catching, a perfect reflection of Paul’s whole vibe. Love him or hate him, you can’t deny that this fight helped to solidify Paul’s status as a pop culture icon of the 2020s, and despite Tyson’s advanced age, being able to go toe to toe with the GOAT and come out on top is no easy feat. This is also a big win for Ciambrone, who we’ve been keeping a close eye on since the days he was simply referred to as the Shoe Surgeon. Check out the fit in action below."

	Tyrese Haliburton took over the NBA Cup last year. Which young, up-and-coming player is most likely to do that this year?","Tyrese Haliburton entered last season in an interesting spot. Yes, everyone knew he was a really good, really talented basketball player — he even made it onto the 2023 All-Star team. And yet, Haliburton was mostly a guy who did some cool things on a not great Indiana Pacers team, which came on the heels of him doing some cool things as a rookie and a second-year player on a not great Sacramento Kings team. And then, last season happened. More specifically, the inaugural NBA Cup (known at the time as the In-Season Tournament) happened, and Haliburton was the driving force behind an upstart Pacers team that took it to everyone and made the championship game, where they fell to the Los Angeles Lakers. It was the exact sort of springboard to stardom that a cup competition should provide, as a young, up-and-coming team led by a young, up-and-coming star went on a run and nearly won the whole thing. Haliburton averaged 26.7 points, 13.3 assists, and 4.9 rebounds in seven tournament games, and while he cooled off a bit as the year went on due to lingering injury issues, he was still able to use his NBA Cup performance as a springboard to an All-NBA Third Team nod and an appearance in the Eastern Conference Finals. Now, with this season’s NBA Cup underway, it’s worth wondering which young star is going to use this edition of the tournament as a way to assert themselves as a superstar, and today, we wanted to look at some of the frontrunners to do just that on teams that have already gotten off to good starts in Cup play. The Rockets have been one of the best up-and-coming teams in the league so far this season, and while you can toss a few guys in as their answer (Jalen Green would be a good fit here, too), we’ll go with Sengun, who was great last year but was sidelined with an injury during their big run later in the calendar. Anyone who watches Houston knows that Sengun is good, but ever since they traded James Harden, the Rockets haven’t gotten a ton of attention. The NBA Cup is a chance to change that — they steamrolled the Clippers in their Group A opener last week — and if they can win their game in Minnesota next week, they’re going to be the overwhelming favorites to move out of their group. Add in that Houston has a net rating of +12.98 when Sengun is on the floor this season and while depth is one of their biggest strengths, we’re willing to bet that he’s the guy who will carry them to Cup wins if they come. Atlanta beating the Celtics in their NBA Cup opener was a shock, and they followed it up with a win over Washington in their second game. The craziest thing about the game against Boston: Trae Young didn’t play, as Daniels was a two-way menace (28 points, seven assists, six steals) and Johnson stuffed the stat sheet (18 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists, three steals, a block). Young is, obviously, the face in Atlanta, but on the heels of the Dejounte Murray trade, there’s space for someone to blossom into his star running mate. Daniels’ ability to just ruin opposing backcourts and Johnson’s ability to do anything Atlanta needs on a given night both fit well alongside him, and they’ll both have to be great if the Hawks go on a run. Things have been completely dire in Detroit for a while now, and as a result, Cunningham hasn’t lived up to his billing as a No. 1 overall pick. But things are starting to change — Detroit is 2-0 in Cup play, with Cunningham going for 21 points, nine assists, seven rebounds, and two blocks against the Heat before putting up a 21-point, 10-rebounds, 10-assist triple-double with five steals and a block against the Wizards. He has to cut down on his turnovers, but he’s spearheading the Pistons as they try to take a big step forward under JB Bickerstaff. So far, so good, and if Detroit goes on an improbable NBA Cup run, it’ll be because Cunningham took a big leap towards becoming the face of the franchise the Pistons have craved for years. The most likely option to go on a Haliburton-esque run. Orlando is 2-0 with wins over Charlotte and Philly, even though Paolo Banchero is out with a torn oblique. The ball has been in Wagner’s hands a lot as a result, and the decision has paid off in a big way. He’s starting to find his shot after he couldn’t hit anything last season, while he looks really comfortable as a scorer and a facilitator. The Magic being good without Banchero is only possible because of Wagner, and a trip to the knockout rounds of the NBA Cup is within reach — their game in New York on Dec. 3 looms large, and we cannot wait to see what Wagner does under the bright lights of Madison Square Garden. You might have heard this by now: The Cavs are the best team in basketball this year at 15-0, and they won their only NBA Cup game so far against Charlotte. All eyes are on Tuesday night’s trip to Boston to take on the defending champs, which is the exact sort of high-profile stage Cleveland could use to emphatically say they’re championship and NBA Cup contenders. A big reason for the success? Mobley, as the decision to bring Kenny Atkinson on board as head coach has led to him looking more comfortable on offense and his usual brilliant self on defense. He has to continue to do that if the Cavs are going to be championship contenders, and the NBA Cup is a great place for him to show that he’s taken a step forward in his fourth season. If you want, you can also make a case for Darius Garland here, who has been nothing short of spectacular this season and is showing why he’s one of the best young guards in the league. However, Garland has been an All-Star and Donovan Mitchell is a known commodity, so we’ll go with the young big man as the Cav most likely to turn heads.  The Thunder are in a tricky spot due to the injuries suffered by Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein, so it’s possible they are just not big enough to go on an NBA Cup run. If they can, though, our hunch is it’s because of Williams stepping up and being the perfect running mate alongside Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. He keeps getting better and better the more experience he gets under his belt, and so far this season, Williams has done that again, as he’s putting up career-best marks in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks per game. He won’t unseat Shai as the man in Oklahoma City any time soon, but the Thunder are the exact sort of team that can use the NBA Cup as a chance to announce their arrival to the rest of the league. Williams can do the same."

We pick up the HBCU Homecoming series with only a day left before Director of Bands Chancellor Mills gets to prove himself in his first year in the position with the help of more than 100 band members and his staff. “It’s all in the planning, first and foremost,” Mills said in preparation for the event. “We don’t want to throw anything together and just put it out there; it’s huge this year.” As Mills said, the planning is critical, as the pressure of the occasion couldn’t be any higher, with current students and alumni all expecting a great show. “This performance is just going to signify where this program is,” said Mills. “It’s going to dictate how we’re going to move for the next 3-5 years. It’s significant in terms of what we want to give back to our community.” Fortunately, the hard work pays off as the band comes out at halftime to give the crowd their best with renditions of hip-hop classics produced by Just Blaze, including Joe Budden’s “Pump it Up” and “What We Do” by Freeway, who appeared to perform the song in-person. “I’ve had my songs played at a million sporting events,” Blaze said of the performance. “This is just kind of a great add-on to that part of the legacy. It sounded amazing.” As Blaze says in the episode, the party was far from over after the performance. Check out additional footage from the band’s night performance and more to see how the performance was received."

	Apparently, Shaq is a little upset with things, although he would like to remain on the show.","Basketball fans got some pretty monumental news over the weekend. As part of the agreement that will keep Warner Bros. Discovery as one of the league’s broadcast partners during its upcoming media right deal, Turner Sports will continue to produce “Inside the NBA” but license the show out to ESPN, which will air it going forward. The deal officially got announced on Monday, and there are some pretty big questions that continue to hang over the agreement that ESPN and Turner will have to get sorted out between now and the start of the 2025-26 season. As it turns out, there’s one especially big one that hangs over the deal, as Jimmy Traina of Sports Illustrated reported that Shaquille O’Neal is out of a contract on July 1, 2025. And apparently, there’s a bit of tension on the Hall of Fame inductee’s side of things right now. While sources say Shaq wants to remain on the show, he’s frustrated that there has been congratulations and press releases hyping that Inside the NBA is remaining the same while he is currently not under contract to be with the company next season. As Traina noted, Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, and Charles Barkley all do other things for Turner, so their deals are different from Shaq’s, who exclusively does NBA work for the network. It goes without saying, but Inside without Shaq would not feel the same, although we’re optimistic that Draymond Green joining the show whenever his playing career ends would be a good fill-in for him. Still, whether it’s agreeing to another deal with Turner or working something out with ESPN, here’s hoping that Shaq is at the desk with the rest of the guys when Inside airs on the Worldwide Leader for the first time."

Late on Sunday night, the NFL decided to announce that it has something special up its sleeve for the late afternoon game, as it was revealed that Beyonce will perform at halftime in her hometown.  A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce)  There’s no word on whether the league has a similarly huge name lined up for the early game, but lining up Beyonce — who headlined the Super Bowl halftime show back in 2013 — for a performance during a showcase game like this makes a ton of sense. Of course, there is a potential problem that will be monitored throughout the Christmas Day schedule, as the games will be aired on Netflix, which just struggled mightily with its broadcast of the boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul. Adding Beyonce to what will already be a highly-anticipated NFL game should only bring more eyeballs onto the platform, and there’s going to be a whole lot of interest in whether or not Netflix will be able to keep up with the demand."

	The Wings got the top pick in the 2025 WNBA Draft and will get the chance to draft UConn star Paige Bueckers.","The 2025 WNBA Draft figures to feature some serious talent, headlined by UConn star Paige Bueckers, and that meant Sunday was a big day for the Chicago Sky, Dallas Wings, Los Angeles Sparks, and Washington Mystics, as those four teams were set to learn their fate in the Draft Lottery.  The ping-pong balls fell in favor of the Wings, who will get the opportunity to select Bueckers first overall next spring and figure to create one of the WNBA’s most exciting backcourts immediately with Bueckers joining established Wings star Arike Ogunbowale in Dallas. For the second straight year, the Sparks will hold the No. 2 overall pick and the Sky will pick at No. 3, while the Mystics will have the fourth pick. The fifth pick will go to the expansion Golden State Valkyries, followed by the playoff teams from a year ago — aside from the Aces, who forfeited their draft pick as part of a league punishment.  The 2025 WNBA Draft first round order looks as follows:  1. Dallas Wings
2. Los Angeles Sparks
3. Chicago Sky
4. Washington Mystics
5. Golden State Valkyries
6. Washington Mystics (via the Atlanta Dream)
7. New York Liberty (via the Phoenix Mercury)
8. Indiana Fever
9. Seattle Storm
10. Chicago Sky (via the Connecticut Sun)
11. Minnesota Lynx
12. Phoenix Mercury (via the New York Liberty)  Behind Bueckers, Kiki Iriafen is the presumptive No. 2 prospect in this class, which means she could be making a very short trip from playing college ball at USC this season to pro ball with the Sparks. From there, Azzi Fudd, Olivia Miles, Lauren Betts, and others will be in the mix for picks in the top half of the first round."

	Jon Jones successfully defended his UFC Heavyweight championship at UFC 309 in New York.","Jon Jones (28-1) knocked out Stipe Miocic (20-5) in the third round to retain the heavyweight championship at UFC 309 from Madison Square Garden in New York.  Jones opened with a couple shots up top, a leg kick, and eventually a takedown. On top, Jones worked the ground and pound, refusing to give Miocic any room on the ground in a dominant first round — but while it looked like Jones could have ended it early, Miocic was able to hang on. Miocic opened the second round with a more measured approach, waiting for his own opportunities to attack without being taken down. The former heavyweight champion was relatively flat-footed before opening a more active approach in the third, but as Miocic moved, it was Jones who picked apart Miocic.  Jones hurt Miocic with a big right hand midway through the round, but kept the champ at bay with a combination of his own. Jones hurt Miocic with a spinning back kick to the body, then finished him off with lefts and rights on the ground before the referee stoppage.  Jones’ return to the UFC on Saturday was just his second bout in the heavyweight division. He hadn’t fought since last year, claiming the UFC Heavyweight belt in his debut in the heavyweight division against Ciryl Gane. Jones is arguably the greatest fighter in UFC history, but his background is riddled in controversy amid two victories over another greatest of all-time contender, Daniel Cormier. Miocic hadn’t fought since 2021, when he suffered a second-round knockout at the hands of Francis Ngannou.  Jones as the winner has an interesting path forward. On one hand, the interim champ, Tom Aspinall, is waiting in the wings and ready to prove himself against an all-time great. On the other hand, Alex Pereira seems prepped to climb to the heavyweight division, making possibly two weight jumps in three year as the former middleweight and current light heavyweight champion. Jones hasn’t seemed as interested in Aspinall recently, but opened the door to that fight after the win.  After his loss, Miocic retired from the UFC."

	Chuck, Shaq, Kenny, and Ernie will continue covering NBA games in 2025, as ESPN will license the show from TNT starting next year.","When TNT Sports lost the rights to the NBA this summer, with the league opting for a three-network deal with ESPN, NBC, and Amazon, the biggest question from fans was what would the future look like for ‘Inside the NBA’. After initially sounding as though it would end after this season, TNT was able to get Charles Barkley to agree to stick around for the remainder of his contract, with plans to continue the show in some capacity.  Now, we know what that will be, and instead of TNT airing the fellas talking about various sports (as was rumored at one point), they will continue to cover the NBA as part of ESPN’s NBA coverage in a unique licensing deal between Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery. According to the Wall Street Journal and Andrew Marchand of The Athletic, the deal will see TNT Sports continue producing the show, but it will air on ESPN.  Separately, Warner Bros. Discovery struck a deal with Disney to license the TNT show “Inside the NBA” to ESPN and ABC starting next season, according to the people familiar with the matter. The show, which features the former players Charles Barkley and Shaquille O’Neal, has an enthusiastic and large following. The show will air throughout the course of the season. This all happens alongside a larger settlement between the NBA and WBD, with Bleacher Report and House of Highlights maintaining rights to NBA videos. That is all excellent news for those at TNT Sports and those outlets, and sources inside TNT Sports tell Dime that they are “considering it a best case scenario” after losing NBA game broadcasts. [UPDATE: This post previously stated WBD would continue operating NBA TV and the league’s digital platforms, as was reported by the WSJ, but that was incorrect. NBA Digital and WBD will continue their current relationship but will not be operated by WBD (as is the current structure), while NBA TV will not be operated by WBD in the future.] For NBA fans the biggest news is that Charles Barkley, Shaquille O’Neal, Kenny Smith, and Ernie Johnson will still be on our televisions — one would assume from Studio J in Atlanta still if TNT is producing it — each week during the NBA season. One would expect they’ll move from their Thursday slot to Wednesday for ESPN’s biggest night of games — as the other options are Friday and Sunday and I have a hard time imagining them moving to either of those. The move allows the best show to continue without any changes to talent in front of or behind the camera, which is particularly important, and one would think if ESPN is adding the show they will understand what makes it so good and give it the kind of space and time it deserves, rather than what they currently do with their studio offering. It remains to be seen what happens with NBA Countdown, as they’ll still need to have something for those Friday and Sunday games, but may shake up their main crew with the Inside fellas becoming their A-crew and Finals team."

	The NBA has big plans for how it wants to build on 2024's shooting competition between Steph Curry and Sabrina Ionescu.","The NBA struck gold at All-Star weekend in 2024. While the game itself was bad enough that the league is considering a major shake-up in its format and the Dunk Contest was a dud, a shooting contest between Steph Curry and Sabrina Ionescu injected a whole lot of excitement into the festivities on Saturday night — Curry was able to win, but it was awfully close. With the 2025 edition of the All-Star Game taking place in the Chase Center, it would make a ton of sense for the league to run back a Steph vs. Sabrina shootout. According to Shams Charania of ESPN, that is, indeed in the works, but there’s a catch: They may not be the only NBA and WNBA players involved. Curry and WNBA star Sabrina Ionescu of the New York Liberty participated in the first NBA versus WNBA 3-point challenge at All-Star Saturday night this February in Indianapolis. Curry and Ionescu are in strong conversations to return in a variation of the shootout, which could include other NBA and WNBA players such as Klay Thompson of the Dallas Mavericks and Caitlin Clark of the Indiana Fever, sources said. Expanding on the competition and including Thompson and Clark always made far too much sense, so it’s good to see that the NBA might do something that would obviously be a huge draw."

	The NBA is considering a shakeup to make the All-Star Game a 4-team tournament like Rising Stars -- and include the Rising Stars winners.","The last really good NBA All-Star Game was in 2020, which was both the first year of the Elam Ending format and just a few weeks after Kobe Bryant’s tragic death. Players took the game more seriously than we’ve seen in quite some time, as it was a league-wide celebration of the Lakers legend, but since then the game has fallen back into old habits of being a glorified pickup run with barely a hint of defense being played.  That has led to fans tuning out and TV networks being upset, and Adam Silver seemed like a broken man after last year’s game was the highest scoring in history, handing Giannis and the East the All-Star Game trophy with the glowing praise of “you scored the most points. Well, congratulations.” The truth is, the All-Star Game just isn’t important enough for players to go all-out, especially with how much money is at stake for them nowadays. It’s no longer the biggest national stage some of them will get to show out and build their profile, and the result is a bunch of guys trying not to get hurt while producing a few highlights.  For that reason, the league needs to get creative. We offered our thoughts on what that should look like last year, as they’ve bounced back-and-forth between formats and how they pick teams to varying degrees of success. This year we might see a significant change to the format, as ESPN’s Shams Charania brought word that the league is in deep discussions on a new format that would be similar what they did with the Rising Stars Game, breaking the All-Star rosters into 4 teams and having them play a semifinal game and then the winners of those playing in the final. The teams would be 3 teams of 8 All-Stars and the winning team of the Rising Stars Challenge from Friday. Charania highlights how discussions around this format started at Summer League and have included league personnel, team executives, players (including Stephen Curry), and coaches, with significant momentum towards being adopted for the 2025 game in San Francisco. At the very least, you could bet that whatever team of All-Stars got matched up with the Rising Stars winners would likely have a little more juice to not lose, which would yield the intended results of raising the level of competition.  I think anything would be an improvement over a regular four-quarter game, and the Rising Stars games have been improved as a result of this format change. Even if they aren’t suddenly the greatest basketball games in history, they move quicker and when it’s close late the competitive juices get flowing in a way we don’t see often in the current All-Star format."
Sports – UPROXX,It Is Silly That Nikola Jokic Has Somehow Gotten Better To Start The 2024-25 Season,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/nikola-jokic-start-2024-25-nba-season-denver-nuggets/,"Fri, 15 Nov 2024 21:41:00 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	Nikola Jokic entered this season as an all-time great already. Somehow, someway, he keeps getting better.","There’s this fun thing I like to do sometimes that I affectionately call the Barry Bonds game. How it works: You go onto baseball-reference, pull up the page for the legendary San Francisco Giants slugger, and just look at how ridiculous it was that Bonds was able to put up the numbers he did during his prime. Yes, steroids, I know, but even with that caveat, individual players are not supposed to break their sport the way that Barry Bonds was able to break the game of baseball. We’re not fully there yet, but going onto Nikola Jokic‘s basketball-reference page is getting to a similarly very silly point. Ever since becoming the no-doubt cornerstone of the Denver Nuggets back in 2018-19, Jokic has consistently put up some of the wildest numbers in the league. His last four years feature three MVPs and a second-place finish while averaging 26.1 points, 12.2 rebounds, 8.7 assists, and 1.4 steals in 34.1 minutes per game while shooting 58.8 percent from the field and 36.4 percent from three. The advanced stats especially love him — scroll on down to the “Advanced” section, a lot of stuff is bold (led the league) and a few things are gold (all-time career marks). There is no one quite like Jokic, and there has never been anyone quite like Jokic. His career True Shooting percentage is third in league history, behind only Rudy Gobert and DeAndre Jordan, while attempting 1,942 more three-pointers than those two combined. His career total rebound percentage is 15th, right in between ABA legend Mel Daniels and Marcus Camby. He’s 25th all time in assist percentage — the three names directly behind him are Ja Morant, Ricky Rubio, and LeBron James. The dude just has his fingerprints all over games in a way that no one has ever consistently matched. I say all of that to say this: Somehow, someway, on a team that needs him more than ever (which says a lot as the entire franchise is built around having him), Jokic has raised his game through the first stretch of the 2024-25 season. This should not be possible. It’s not even like he’s suddenly adding something new to his bag of tricks, he’s just better than ever at being Nikola Jokic. Small sample size caveats are prominent here, but here’s some stuff to consider: Points per game: 29.7 (fifth in the NBA, his current career-high is 27.1 PPG)
Rebounds per game: 13.7 (leads the NBA, current career-high is 13.8 RPG)
Assists per game: 11.7 (leads the NBA, current career-high is 9.8 APG)
Steals per game: 1.7 (t-9th in the NBA, current career-high is 1.7 SPG) The only players to ever average a triple-double over a full season, of course, are Oscar Robertson (once) and Russell Westbrook (four times). Neither of them, in any of their triple-double seasons, were in the same galaxy as Jokic’s current True Shooting percentage of 66.7 percent — both guys, funny enough, posted a TS% of 55.4 percent in their most efficient season with a triple-double. And all of the advanced stats that tend to show that Jokic is a marvel (PER, win shares per 48 minutes, box plus/minus) are outrageous — if the season ended today, he’d post the highest single-season PER (33.31) of all-time, the highest BPM (15.02) of all-time, and the fourth-highest WS/48 of all-time behind some guys named Kareem and Wilt. So, yeah, Jokic is a joke, the single best basketball player in the world today and the guy spearheading a Nuggets team with some flaws that came as the result of a talent drain over the last few years to an early 7-3 record and, as of this writing, the longest-active winning streak (five games) in the Western Conference. And here’s the funny thing: If Denver did not have Jokic playing like this, they would be in some serious trouble. Have a look at how dire things get when he is not on the floor, via PBP Stats: There is a reason why, when asked what the ideal number of minutes is for Jokic to be on the floor for the Nuggets, Michael Malone said “48.” We’ve seen plenty of teams over the years be totally helpless when the sun around which everything revolves goes to the bench — LeBron’s teams in his prime were famously horrendous when he would sit, the Sixers have an organizational commitment to being awful without Joel Embiid, etc. — but seeing as how Jokic is either scoring or assisting on nearly half of all the points that Denver scores, well, it’s pretty important that he never comes off the floor. That’ll have to change at some point (well, probably), but Jokic playing like this means it’s easier for the Nuggets to slowly bring along their young guys who have to take on bigger roles this season — although it must be said that Christian Braun has impressed as the de facto Kentavious Caldwell-Pope replacement. They can also afford to be patient with Jamal Murray, who still hasn’t quite looked like himself on the heels of a pretty nasty run of injuries that made his postseason and Olympic efforts hard to watch at times, but just got paid in a big way and absolutely has to get on track. Of course, at some point, Denver is going to need to totally round into form, even if there are some really encouraging signs beyond Jokic. Aaron Gordon has been awesome so far this year when healthy, while Michael Porter Jr. continues to just do his thing as a huge dude who can shoot the hell out of the basketball. When 75 percent of the core your team is built around is playing at a high level from the start of the year — and that final member of your core has a reputation for saving his best for when the lights get brighter — you’re usually in a pretty good spot. There are still big picture questions that can only be answered when the playoffs roll around, which is the curse of being a team with title-or-bust aspirations. In the meantime, all anyone can really do is sit back, watch, and marvel at the spectacle that is Nikola Jokic, the best player in the world at the very height of his powers, someone who keeps finding ways to break the game of basketball, and an all-time great who stands shoulder-to-shoulder alongside the greatest players to ever set foot on the hardwood. And the scary part? As the early portion of this season has shown, if anything, he’s only getting better."

	'We’re nothing. We’re just dead. We’re dust.'","Tonight, November 15, is the much-publicized boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul. Ahead of the fight, which will stream on Netflix, Iron Mike was asked by internet-famous teen reporter Jazlyn Guerra, a.k.a. Jazzy’s World TV, for his thoughts on legacy. He took it very seriously.   “Well, I don’t know. I don’t believe in the word ‘legacy,'” Tyson replied. “I just think that’s another word for ego. Legacy doesn’t mean nothing. That’s just some word everybody grabbed onto. Someone said that word, and everyone grabbed on the words, and now it’s used every five seconds. It means absolutely nothing to me. I’m just passing through. I’mma die, and it’s gonna be over. Who cares about legacy after that?”  Tyson somehow wasn’t done. “What a big ego,” he continued. “So I’mma die. I want people to think that I’m this, I’m great. I’m, no. We’re nothing. We’re just dead. We’re dust. We’re absolutely nothing. Our legacy is nothing.” Guerra responded to Tyson’s stream-of-consciousness existentialism with a polite “thank you so much for sharing that,” but 50 Cent had another takeaway. “G*ddam it! Mike ya scaring the kids, WTF chill,” the rapper wrote on X. “Note to self, keep the kids away from Mike.”  You can watch the video here.

	This year's NBA City Edition unis were officially unveiled on Thursday, so we're ranking them from 30 to 1.","The NBA and Nike officially unveiled the 2024-25 City Edition uniforms for all 30 teams on Thursday, and while the designs have been leaked since this summer, I like to wait until we get the official images to rank them. That is because the actual jerseys themselves almost always look better than their 2D mock-ups, which is certainly the case with this year’s crop. The leaks got roasted to no end on social media and while I’m not crazy about this year’s group of uniforms, they aren’t as bad in actuality as the leaks looked.  That said, there are some heaters and some really bad ones, along with a big crop this year of very “meh” looks as it’s fair to wonder if Nike and the teams are running a bit short on ideas — good news guys, at least another 12 years of these! Here we are ranking the uniforms from worst to best, where there’s one that should become part of one team’s permanent look.  NBA
Creating good alternates is hard when you have an iconic jersey set, and that’s the problem the Celtics (and Lakers) run into every year. These are just bad and don’t even seem to be trying to do anything interesting. Wear your normal (and great) uniforms, please.  NBA
Same goes for the Lakers. These are just unbecoming of a once proud franchise.  NBA
I’m honestly kind of stunned they went back to the Heat Culture well again after the reaction to when they did this last year, but it does look a little better on the all red uniform. Still, c’mon guys, stop trying to make this a thing. NBA
On the opposite end of the spectrum from Boston and L.A. is OKC, which has had one uniform in its history that I thought was legitimately good (the 2018 City Edition honoring Oklahoma’s Native American heritage). Everything else has been either “meh” or outright bad. I’ll say this, these aren’t the worst unis they’ve ever had, but I just am not a fan.  NBA
The Pacers have done this look before in black, and it’s just not for me.  NBA
A retro look that just doesn’t really land for me. I will say, I bet the court they have for this color scheme will look great, but I’m just not a big fan of the lettering.  NBA
I wouldn’t call these bad, they just don’t land for me, but that’s also been the case for a number of the Brooklyn City Editions over the years.  NBA
I’m just out on the 5280 thing. I like the mountains on the side and the topographical map thing, and while I think there are better executions, leaning into the rainbow coloring is generally good for Denver. However, I just can’t get on board with the 5280 in place of lettering. NBA
All of the uniforms in this tier have the same issue of not being bad, but also not being particularly inspiring. Dallas’ are particularly plain, which, again, not necessarily bad, but not memorable either.  NBA
I get they’re going for the Chicago musical font here, but it feels like they weren’t willing to go all-in on it and the end result is pretty bland.  NBA
I get what Minnesota’s going for, but I just see an old Windows 98 screensaver in that design.  NBA
They aren’t as bad as the Lakers and Celtics, but they also have a similar problem where their normal uniforms are iconic classics and trying something new often just makes you want them to do what they always do.  NBA
The Magic are at the top of this group by virtue of having the best lettering/logo — the Magic with a star for the A is always great — but Orlando has great uniform looks and this one just falls flat comparatively.  NBA
Like Orlando, Charlotte has some great throwback looks and this just makes me wish they were wearing one of those instead.  NBA
My colleague Mark said the logo looks like it should be for store brand paper towels and I can’t unsee it. I do like that shade of blue though.  NBA
Perfectly fine, even though it’s still a little confusing when the Bucks are wearing all-blue.  NBA
Never seen a more Oklahoma State jersey in my life. Go Pokes.  NBA
I actually kinda like these, but they are giving off strong vibes of made up Houston jerseys for a movie that couldn’t afford NBA licensing.  NBA
If I were to guess, these will be among the most polarizing unis. I dig New Orleans leaning into being a little different and weird, and the herringbone pattern with actual bones certainly does that. They will likely be at the bottom of some folks rankings but I don’t think their standard unis are so good that they can’t get weird and have it work.  NBA
These have grown on me a bit, in part because they at least look like Warriors uniforms — unlike their Michigan/Marquette alternates from a year or two ago. They aren’t the best uniforms in the world, but a solid attempt at playing off something unique to the Bay (the Golden Gate Bridge).  NBA
I really like the District font and this year they put it on a nice color instead of whatever the hell the black and green and orange thing was a year ago. The Wizards won’t be good this year, but I do think they’ll look good in these.  NBA
I like this Spurs font, they’ve done it before but it works for me. I also like this shade of blue. These aren’t as good as their fiesta look in the past, but a solid choice and I just like when the Spurs have a little pop of color.  NBA
I like these, even though I will not immediately spot this color and go “Cavs” in my brain. Part of why these will work is their court that goes with them is phenomenal.  NBA
Another one that gets a big boost from an unbelievably good court design. These play off the old 1995 All-Star logo, and while I’m not crazy about the font, I still dig them. If they incorporated the saguaro cactus into them, they’d be higher.  NBA
The Blazers almost always do a good job with the City edition uni, and this year is another good addition to their rotation. A big part of that is their “Rip City” font just looks good on anything. NBA
The Jazz are finally making the move back to the purple mountains with their full-time uniform set, and this year’s City Edition is a very good version of that.  NBA
The throwback to the Memphis Sounds just looks fantastic. I love that Memphis font and these are going to look fantastic on the floor — even if it’ll take a little adjustment to seeing a team in red and thinking “Grizzlies”.  NBA
The Kings also have another really good throwback look, taking it to the days of the Cincinnati Royals. The royal blue and red just pops, and they didn’t try to do too much with a uniform that doesn’t need much more.  NBA
I’m a sucker for this spectrum Sixers look. I just think it’s so clean and the white edition is even better than the navy look from a couple years back.  NBA
The Vince Carter Raptor doing his legendary between-the-legs dunk is so good and the Raptors need to just make it their permanent logo. These with the purple retro look they brought back this year is a damn-near perfect uniform set and it’s a shame they will move on to something new next season."

	Come get these winners.","Sometimes, you simply want to unplug the season and plug it back in. That is where we are when it comes to NFL handicapping in 2024. After a pair of encouraging weeks, the ugliness returned in Week 10, including a Falcons-Saints game that impossibly stayed under with three missed field goals and other malodies. We won’t be deterred from the goal of righting the ship but, hey, you could also fade these picks if you’re feeling spicy. Before delivering this week’s five-pack, let’s take a look at the carnage in 2024.  Come get these winners. A Thursday night Under? Let’s get back to basics. Washington has been an “over” team to the tune of 7-3 this season, but Philadelphia has been quietly stout on defense in recent weeks. This is, of course, a short week for both teams, and Washington has some injury issues along its offensive line. I tend to think the Commanders defense is a touch undervalued in this spot as well, and this is a favorable price. The Saints got the bounce last week after firing their coach and, with the help of one of the worst kicking performances of the season for Atlanta, New Orleans won a game it shouldn’t have won. That could benefit us this week, as the Browns are underdogs in a spot where they probably shouldn’t be. Let’s ride the Jameis roller coaster and hope it goes well. Detroit is a wagon. They seemingly cover every week and, when they don’t like in Week 10, they somehow win the game despite a million turnovers. With that said, getting a full 14 here on Jacksonville is something I can’t pass on. Trust me, I know how ugly it is. Seattle is healthier and coming off a bye, including the projected return of DK Metcalf. I’ve also been a touch low on San Francisco all season, and I simply can’t get this to 6.5 points, even with McCaffrey back for the 49ers. This teaser happens to involve a pair of prime time games, but I would like it even if it didn’t. Candidly, I love each leg here, with the Bengals more than able to get in the backdoor if things go south at the outset. Houston is on the road, which does scare me a bit, but the situation in Dallas is rather dire, and the Texans may be discounted a bit after a maddening loss to Detroit."

	Giannis got called for a foul despite getting all ball. But fortunately for the Bucks, as Rasheed Wallace once said, ball don't lie.","The Milwaukee Bucks played host to the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night, and while there is still a ton of basketball left to be played this season, you won’t find a more insane final 90 or so seconds of regulation than what we got out of these two Central Division opponents. The two teams traded the lead back and forth, and after a Marcus Sasser three tied things up with just under 30 seconds left, Milwaukee got the ball and had a chance to win. A wide open look by Taurean Prince did not fall, and with a hair over a second left on the clock, Detroit called a timeout, advanced the ball, and tried to replicate the magic it found on a sideline out of bounds play on Tuesday night against Miami. It looked like that was going to happen, as Cade Cunningham lobbed one up to Ron Holland near the rim, but Giannis Antetokounmpo was able to break things up … well, at least it looked like he did, but the referees called a foul that stood after a review even though it really did not look like Giannis fouled Holland at all. However, in the words of the great philosopher Rasheed Wallace, ball don’t lie. Holland stepped up to the charity stripe and missed short twice, which ended up sending the game to overtime. It would’ve been an awfully harsh way for the game to end for Milwaukee, but, again, Sheed’s got us covered here."
Sports – UPROXX,Draymond Green Claims Steph Had Extra Juice For Warriors-Mavs Because Klay ‘Ghosted Him’,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/draymond-green-klay-thompson-ghosted-steph-curry-warriors-mavs/,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 23:16:08 +0000","<div class=""upx-component upx-embed-url""><div class=""embed-holder""></div></div>Steph Curry apparently had a little extra motivation for Klay Thompson's return to the Chase Center.","Klay Thompson made his return to the Chase Center on Tuesday night as a member of the Dallas Mavericks. It went the way that things tend to go when teams travel to take on the Golden State Warriors: Steph Curry did some absolutely ludicrous Steph stuff, and the Warriors went on to pick up a 120-117 win to start their NBA Cup campaign. Curry scored all 12 of the Warriors’ points during a 12-3 run to close out the game, and plenty of people noted that he looked especially fired up after hitting a three with 27 seconds left that essentially iced things. It turns out there’s a reason why: According to Draymond Green, Curry was ghosted by Thompson in the lead-up to the game. “I’m stirring the pot, I pissed Steph off,” Green said on his podcast, which you can watch at the 4:30 mark of the video at the top of this post. “He’s like, ‘Yeah, I talked to Klay last night about’ — cause he was supposed to speak before the game. He was like, ‘Yeah I called Raymond and told him I’m not speaking. I just need to lock in on the game, so I ain’t speaking and I talked to Klay about it.’ He tried to check in with Klay about something else, and Klay ghosted him, so he got pissed. And here we go. Locked in.” Steve Kerr said that Curry was supposed to address the crowd before the game, but he and Thompson decided against it, while Green did drop a hint after the game that Thompson isn’t an easy guy to get a hold of when he told the press “You ever try to keep in touch with Klay? It’s very one-sided. The love is there. The relationship is there.”"

	The legendary Spurs coach has been away from the team since Nov. 2.","The San Antonio Spurs have been without the services of legendary head coach Gregg Popovich since the start of November. While the team previously said that Popovich’s absence was due to an illness, on Wednesday afternoon, the Spurs revealed that Popovich suffered what was described as a “mild stroke” ahead of their game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Nov. 2, 2024. “The San Antonio Spurs today announced that Head Coach Gregg Popovich has suffered a mild stroke,” the team said in a statement. “The episode occurred on Nov. 2 at the Frost Bank Center. Popovich, who has already started a rehabilitation program, is expected to make a full recovery. At this point, a timeline for his return to the sidelines has not been determined. During this time, the organization is grateful to the extended community for providing privacy and space to the Popovich family.” Assistant coach Mitch Johnson, who has been part of the Spurs’ famed coaching system since 2016, has filled in for Popovich as he’s been away from the team for the last six games. When asked last week for an update on Popovich, Johnson said that the Hall of Fame coach was “in good spirits,” even though there was no word on when fans could expect to see Popovich back on the sideline. One of the greatest basketball coaches of all time, the 75-year-old Popovich has been at the helm of the Spurs since 1996. He is a 5-time NBA champion, a 3-time Coach of the Year, and is the NBA’s all-time wins leader among coaches."

	Let's be honest, Charles Barkley and Shaq were always going to do this at some point.","It’s been a rough start to the year for the Toronto Raptors. While they were never expected to compete for a championship this year, injuries to a number of key contributors like Scottie Barnes and Immanuel Quickly have played a big role in the team going 2-10, which is the worst record in the league at this early juncture. A bright spot has been the play of Gradey Dick, the No. 13 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft who is shooting 37.3 percent from three and his upped his scoring to 20.1 points per game. He’s a good player whose last name has led to stuff like this happening, and shockingly, it was not until Tuesday night that the Inside the NBA guys had their inevitable meltdown over him.   A post shared by Dime (@dimemagazine)  “This boy’s ballin right here, y’all,” Charles Barkley told the crew. “I think you pointed that out, Gradey Dick,” Ernie Johnson responded. “I can’t say his name,” Barkley shot back. “I just can’t say his name. I’m not gonna say his name, I don’t give a damn what y’all say around here.” It was right around this point that we got one of the consistently funniest things on Inside: Shaq laughing so hard at something insane that Chuck said that he sounds like he’s furiously trying to clear his throat. Anyway, the fellas kept going down this road for a bit longer, because there was never going to be any stopping this riff once it finally happened. As for how the rest of Dick’s night went, he scored a career-best 32 points with five rebounds and three assists in a 99-85 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks."

	There was some extra juice in the building for Klay Thompson's return to the Bay, and Steph reminded the fans whose house it was late.","The biggest game of the night in a packed slate of NBA Cup games was the Mavs taking on the Warriors in Klay Thompson’s first game back in San Francisco since leaving as a free agent this summer for Dallas.  It was an emotional scene as they played a terrific tribute video and had the crowd in captains hats to honor their former star, but once the game got going there was plenty of juice on both sides in a reunion that wasn’t all happy. The two teams went back and forth, as the stars on both sides all played their roles, with Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving combining for 52 for the Mavs, while Thompson hit 6 threes on his way to 22 points in his return, including a big one late that gave Dallas a five-point lead midway through the fourth quarter.  That lead would get up to seven before Stephen Curry took over for the Warriors, scoring 12 points in the final 3:10 of game time, including a personal 10-0 run (aided by some spectacular defense from Draymond Green) that turned a Golden State deficit into a 4-point Warriors lead. His final bucket of that run was a vintage stepback three-pointer over Dereck Lively II, as he hit the Mavs big man with his signature “night night” celebration, before making a demonstrative declaration to the crowd that “this is my sh*t.”  STEPH CURRY HAS THE LAST 10 WARRIORS POINTS. 10-2 run to put GSW up 4 with under 30 seconds. 🏆 DAL-GSW | West Group C action🏀 #EmiratesNBACup on TNT pic.twitter.com/xNxak7xWr5 — NBA (@NBA) November 13, 2024  The Mavs would hit a three to cut the lead to one, but a pair of Curry free throws and a missed Luka three saw the Warriors win in regulation, 120-117. Curry finished with 37 points in the win, and while it’s clear there’s not actual bad blood between either side in the Splash Bros. breakup, there did seem to be a little extra fire from Curry for a mid-November game to make a statement at home with Klay now on the other side. While the “night night” is nothing new, the jersey popping and yelling “this is my sh*t” was more than we ever see from Curry in a non-playoff environment, and while I am a fan of the NBA Cup and think it brings out more competition in these games, I think this had more to do with who was on the other side than the Cup ramifications of this game."

	Shaq, who is never shy about being brutally honest when modern big men come up, did not mince words about Joel Embiid.","Joel Embiid took the floor for the Philadelphia 76ers for the first time this season on Tuesday night. Embiid, who has spent the start of the year ramping up to play after some knee problems, looked like someone who needs to work off a ton of rust, as he went for 13 points on 2-for-11 shooting with five assists and three rebounds in a 111-99 loss to the New York Knicks. It’s probably safe to assume that Embiid will be fine as long as he can manage whatever is up with his knee, while the Sixers — which find themselves 2-8 at this early juncture — have to get him, Paul George, and Tyrese Maxey all healthy and clicking as soon as possible. But even if that happens, Shaquille O’Neal is not optimistic about Philly’s ability to win a ring with Embiid at the center of things, which he expressed at halftime on TNT. “In New York, it’s a tough team to play,” O’Neal said. “But this was the fear I had for Joel Embiid. You announce arrogantly, I’m not playing back-to-backs, Ernie. I’m not injured but I’m sore. I’ll come back when I want to come back. Now, when you say things like that, you’re supposed to come back with extra energy. 0-for-3? I would have been 0-15. But you know what y’all would have said. ‘Hey, Shaq’s not playing well, but he’s playing aggressive.’ The plan that they are having, it’s not working. And not only that, I say this respectfully, Joel Embiid will never win a championship until he gets his mind and his attitude right.” Shaq has essentially staked out a place in the basketball punditry world as the guy who will call out big men when he feels they aren’t living up to what they’re capable of, and clearly, he thinks Embiid is the kind of guy who can lead Philadelphia to a championship. In fairness to Embiid, while he did say he may not play in back-to-backs going forward in an effort to be healthy when the playoffs roll around, he said after the loss to the Knicks that he wants to play in Wednesday’s game against the Cleveland Cavaliers, even if the decision is out of his hands."

	With the game tied in overtime, Miami tried calling a timeout. There was just one problem: They didn't have one available.","The second annual Emirates NBA Cup tipped off on Tuesday night, with a number of teams taking the (very vibrant) floor for the league’s relatively new in-season tournament. In the East Group B, the Detroit Pistons played host to the Miami Heat and looked like they were going to cruise to a win before Miami got hot down the stretch of regulation. With things tied up, the two teams went into overtime, where Miami was able to take a lead with just under two seconds left before things got very, very weird. First, the Pistons drew up a beautiful sideline out of bounds play to get a dunk for Jalen Duren that tied things up. And then, a furious Erik Spoelstra walked onto the court and called a timeout. There was just one problem: Miami didn’t have one, which meant we had a classic Chris Webber situation on our hands — perhaps it was fate that one of Webber’s Fab 5 teammates, Jalen Rose, was in attendance and lost his mind. Malik Bealey stepped up to the free throw line, buried it to put Detroit ahead, then on the ensuing Pistons possession, got fouled one more time with 0.1 seconds left to seal the game. It was, quite frankly, stunning to watch Spoelstra make such a big mistake, but at the very least, we got a really entertaining end to a game that suddenly has some stakes to it because of the NBA Cup."

	Caitlin Clark found a very unique pitfall of fame at The Eras Tour: Getting so many friendship bracelets you start to lose circulation.","Taylor Swift’s “The Eras Tour” has been the biggest show in the world for the past few years, as the tour has had millions of fans pass through the gates at stadiums around the globe. After finishing her international leg of the tour, Swift added another run of U.S. tour dates, which included recently playing three nights in Indianapolis at the start of November.  In attendance for those shows was the biggest sports star in the city at present, as Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark wasn’t about to miss a chance to see her favorite artist play shows in her new home city. The only problem for Caitlin at the Eras Tour was that she’s too popular in Indianapolis, which meant she was being constantly given friendship bracelets from other Swifties. That’s a very nice problem to have, but in her effort to wear every one she was given, it started to create an issue, as she explained at the Women’s Leadership Summit.  “Taylor Swift, I just went two nights in a row in Indianapolis. I’ve been three times,” Clark said. “I had a ton [of bracelets], all the way up the arms. I had to take them off, my circulation was getting cut off! Everyone was just chucking their bracelets at me. I’ve seen her three times, and every time the show has just gotten better.”  She showed off her collection on Instagram during one of the shows and it was a lot of bracelets.  Clark has spent the last year or two learning the ups and downs of life as a superstar, but this is certainly a very unique pitfall of fame, being so popular you get too many friendship bracelets and start to lose feeling in your arm."

	The NBA Cup is back for a second season, and here's how it will all work and what groups each team ended up in.","The NBA’s efforts to add a little excitement to the doldrums of its regular season will return on Tuesday evening. For the second straight year, the league will hold its new cup competition, now known as the Emirates NBA Cup. The first year was fun, with the Los Angeles Lakers winning the whole thing by knocking off the Indiana Pacers in Las Vegas, and now, the NBA will continue its efforts to turn this nascent event into a crucial part of its calendar. What does this all mean? Well, we tried to answer that today by explaining what’s new this year, how the whole thing will work, and why we’re excited to watch this as it tries to become a tentpole event on the NBA calendar. So is this just the In-Season Tournament but with a new name? It is! While the NBA has never explicitly said this, my assumption is that they spent the first year calling it the In-Season Tournament so fans would get a sense of what it is before calling it what they always wanted to call it: The NBA Cup, or more specifically, the Emirates NBA Cup. Or maybe they just couldn’t find a sponsor in the first year. What’s that Emirates thing? I’ve seen its logo on courts but never actually looked into what it is. It’s an airline based out of the United Arab Emirates that sponsors a lot of stuff. They’re sponsoring this event, which is the second-best thing that the NBA does, and fortunately, Emirates has plenty of experience sponsoring the second-best thing, as they are the shirt sponsor for Arsenal. What? Just let me cook. Ok, so, any major differences from last year other than the name? A big one are the courts. Last year, they came under criticism from players (who kept slipping on them) and fans (who thought some were huge eyesores, particularly because of the weird, cumbersome stripe they had going down the middle of the courts). They’re not nearly as bad this year, as they replaced the stripe with rings in the center of the floor and got rid of some of the more abrasive designs that just do not work on television. I’m sure not everyone will love them, but I think they are a huge improvement on last year — we just have to see if players struggle with their footing on them, or else the aesthetic changes do not matter at all. What about point differential? I know some players disliked that. Well, that’s still sticking around as a potential tiebreaker for which teams do and do not advance. Frankly, I think it’s fine and we saw last year that some of the European players were trying to egg their teammates on — Domantas Sabonis was the main one I remember — but it’ll still take a bit of a shift for everyone to get on board with it. Remind me how determining how teams advance will work again? Sure! Right from the league: So the easiest way to move on is to just win your group and not worry about any tiebreakers. That is correct. Well then, what do the groups look like? Once again, the NBA broke things up into three groups of five teams in each conference — this will, hopefully, look a lot cleaner when expansion happens, we get up to 32 teams, and they can do groups of four in each conference where each team plays group games home and away. The group games will happen on Tuesdays and Fridays starting tonight and running through Dec. 3. Here’s how it all looks: West Group A: Minnesota, LA Clippers, Sacramento, Houston, Portland West Group B: Oklahoma City, Phoenix, LA Lakers, Utah, San Antonio West Group C: Denver, Dallas, New Orleans, Golden State, Memphis East Group A: New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Brooklyn, Charlotte East Group B: Milwaukee, Indiana, Miami, Toronto, Detroit East Group C: Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington How do these teams qualify for the knockouts? Same as last year — win your group and you get a spot. Both conferences then get one remaining spot for a wild card team, which goes to the best remaining team that did not automatically qualify by winning its group. This is probably where those aforementioned tiebreakers would come in, but you never know. And will the knockouts work like last year, too? Yup! Single-elimination basketball games, with the quarterfinals happening on-site at home arenas and the semifinals and final happening in Las Vegas. The quarters are on Dec. 10 and 11, the semis are on Dec. 14, and the final is on Dec. 17. And are these games all considered regular season games, too? For the most part they are — group games, the quarters, and the semis will all count towards regular season records again, while the championship game will not. So it looks a lot like last year, then. That’s right, the league has, essentially, decided to keep a lot of things the same other than the name and the courts. Oh, also, as a programming note: home teams will wear their Statement Edition uniforms, while road teams wear their Association edition uniforms, according to the league. Huh, well then, ok. You don’t seem enthused about all of this, dear reader. Yeah, I mean, I am still unsure why I should care about this. Well that’s easy: You don’t have to! You’re an adult with agency and the ability to care about whatever you want, times are tough, maybe you don’t want to get super personally invested in a new thing the NBA is doing, that’s fine. But you seem to like this. I do! Why? I think a big split I have noticed here is “fans who like soccer” and “fans who do not,” with the former being more open to the idea of a midseason cup competition — Adam Silver has compared the NBA Cup to the FA Cup in English football, but basically every domestic league has a secondary cup competition. The thing is that these competitions are universally considered not as important as winning the league, but they are still important because it’s an opportunity to win something historic and provide some validation for a team’s season. The NBA Cup is only in its second year, so clearly, it has a way to go before it gets taken that seriously — the whole saga with the Lakers debating putting up a little banner is an example of this. But the FA Cup, for example, is not considered cool because everyone farts around and then Manchester City wins it at the end. It’s considered cool because teams from several levels of English football have a chance to win it, and sometimes, you get magical runs to the very end. We got a glimpse of what that could look like last year when the Indiana Pacers nearly won the whole thing. Hell, if not for the fact that they’re the Lakers, it’d probably be viewed as proof of concept that the final was between a Play-In team and an upstart young squad trying to win something for the first time. That is, to steal a phrase from the English, the magic of the cup. So acknowledging that this isn’t as important as winning the NBA Finals is fine? One-hundred percent. The longer the NBA sticks with this — and, let’s face it, Silver is essentially staking his legacy as a commissioner on this becoming a big deal — the more likely it is that it’ll settle into a spot where fans/franchises like that it is a thing that they can win, all while understanding that the big prize is still waiting for them in June. It helps, of course, that there’s a financial incentive to do well. Remind me what that is. Sure! Players whose teams make the quarterfinals make $50,000, players whose teams make the semifinals make $100,000, players on the runners-up make $200,000, and players on the team that wins the whole thing makes $500,000. Nice. I agree. Anyway, this sounds like, bare minimum, a thing I can have on my television on Tuesdays and Fridays. It is, and really, if that’s all that comes from this for the next year or two, that’s totally fine. Something like this will only become a big deal the more it happens and the more it becomes ingrained as part of the sport’s culture, and as long as this year is a step towards doing that, I’m sure it’ll all work out in the long-run. Nice. Well, I suppose I can tune in. That you can, and if you want to know what games are on, when they’re on, and which networks they’ll be on, you can click right here."

While the league will have a presence in a few different places, its two main events — All-Star Saturday Night and the All-Star Game — will set up shop at the Chase Center in San Francisco, which is the home of the Golden State Warriors. It stands to reason that we’ll see some of the big names associated with the franchise involved in the festivities — Steph Curry, if I had to guess, is going to be an extremely busy man for a few days. And in the lead-up to the league making its way to California, a number of the biggest names in music from the Bay Area teamed up with the Warriors to release a new song in celebration of the All-Star Game going to San Francisco. The track is titled “Players Holiday ‘25,” and features Saweetie, G-Eazy, P-Lo, LaRussell, Larry June, Kamaiyah, Thuy, and YMTK. It’s not the only release the team has in store for All-Star, as a full album, titled For The Soil, will come out in January. You can listen to the song — which is being released via the Warriors’ record label Golden State Entertainment — at the top of this post. “The Warriors have been a big part of my journey, and it’s an honor to collaborate with Golden State Entertainment and some of the most iconic voices from the community to create something that represents the culture we live and breathe,” P-Lo said in a statement.

	The NBA Cup starts Tuesday night and we are looking at eight teams that should invest a little extra energy in the early season competition.","The second edition of the NBA Cup (now with a fancy sponsor, Emirates) will begin on Tuesday night as group stage action gets started. Feelings on the NBA Cup vary, but for the most part, it seems to have been at least a mild positive in terms of adding a little juice to November regular season hoops.  Last year, the eight teams that emerged from group play were the Celtics, Bucks, Pacers, and Knicks in the East, and the Lakers, Kings, Suns, and Pelicans in the West. Ultimately, the Lakers beat the Pacers in the final, marking the high point of the season for Los Angeles, while that was just the beginning of a run to the conference finals from Indiana. There are differing views from teams on how they approach the Cup, but because most of the games until you get to Vegas count all the same as regular season games, you should see contenders still trying at least until the quarterfinals where they may punt to avoid adding a trip to Vegas to their schedule.  Not every team has the Cup schedule circled on their calendars, and for some, it gets in the way of the long-term goals (either to get lottery balls or winning a title). But as the Pacers showed a year ago, for a young team without much playoff experience, the Cup can get guys feet wet to that kind of environment and build some confidence for the tournament everyone cares about come April, May, and June.  Here, we’ll look at eight teams that we think should be willing to invest early season energy into trying to get to Vegas and hoist the NBA Cup.   Houston’s gotten off to a strong start this season at 7-4, and I think they’re in a similar position to the Pacers last year, as they can use this as a way to test their young roster without much playoff experience. A successful run to the knockout rounds (and maybe beyond) would be a genuinely big deal for the Rockets, who can assert themselves as a genuine threat in the West playoff race with a strong tournament showing.  We saw that the Lakers were willing to raise their level a year ago in the Cup competition, and it’d be kind of incredible if they went back-to-back. Their group is a bit less daunting now that the Thunder are without Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein (although that’s still an excellent team), and if they make the knockout rounds, a team with LeBron and AD is always going to be a threat in a single-elimination basketball game. We’ll see if they approach it with the same aggression, but this is a team that has to try and chase wins regardless, so I’d expect the effort to be there, even if they can’t replicate the same kind of run.  The Grizzlies want to prove they are fully back as West contenders, and they can make a strong statement if they come out of the aforementioned Group of Death. They are playing at a high level right now, led by Jaren Jackson Jr.’s continued brilliance, and if they can get to Vegas, they’d have a very good chance at lifting the Cup. And if Ja Morant can get healthy and come back in time, absolutely no one will want to see that guy in a one-off. By the time the season is over, the Spurs will likely have filtered out of the Play-In race, but this is the exact kind of team I think should place an overemphasis on the NBA Cup. The Spurs are still building around Victor Wembanyama and figuring out what that should look like, but this team has been fairly competitive early (5-6) and could take advantage of some injury woes for the top teams in their group to try and make a little noise in the Cup. We saw in the Olympics that Wemby loves some heightened competition, and this might be a good chance to turn him loose and make an all-out push for something in November, understanding that they probably don’t have the roster just yet to really threaten the playoffs.  Will the Cavs ever lose? At some point, yes, but why not keep the good vibes rolling as long as possible and try to win the Cup? Yes, they’re a title contender, but unlike, say, Boston, this isn’t a team that’s had any real playoff success. Building some good habits in the knockout rounds could pay dividends down the road, and seeing as how they’re in the same group as the Celtics, I’m sure they’d love to use this as a statement of intent in the event they cross paths in the postseason. The Bucks desperately need something to turn around their season, and maybe the Cup gives them a carrot to chase that can wake things up. I’m skeptical they have the juice to make this happen, as the vibes are just horrendous in Milwaukee right now, but theoretically, Giannis and Dame (who will miss their opener with a concussion) are good enough as a tandem to beat anyone. That will require them to get on the same page, which hasn’t really happened to this point, but perhaps playing on different courts can change the mojo in Milwaukee.  Like every team other than the Cavs and Celtics in the East, the Knicks are off to a sputtering start at 4-5. Their star-studded roster isn’t clicking just yet, the defense has taken a major step back, and the offense hasn’t been quite good enough to make up for it. Their group, at one point, looked like the toughest in the East, but the Magic are without Paolo Banchero and the Sixers … well, we’ll get to them in a second. That cracks the door for the Knicks to try and lay a foundation of winning they can build on as the season progresses and create that chemistry that’s been lacking in games with a slightly bigger game feel. Joel Embiid is back for the Cup games, but Tyrese Maxey is out and Paul George has been on a minutes restriction. This team is desperate to go on a run, and with the big fella back, there’s no time like the present to try and climb out of the East’s basement. Like the Bucks, Philly just needs to stack some wins and get some positivity, and if they can somehow make it to Vegas, they can erase a decent amount of the early season concern about them."
Sports – UPROXX,How Darius Garland And The Cavs Got Their Confidence Back,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/darius-garland-interview-cleveland-cavaliers-confidence/,"Mon, 11 Nov 2024 21:37:23 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	The Cavs are off to an 11-0 start, and we talked to Garland about the work this summer that led to the return of his confidence and smile.","The Cleveland Cavaliers came into the 2024-25 season with plenty of pressure, as this felt like a make-it-or-break-it season for their Core Four. They re-signed Donovan Mitchell and gave contract extensions to Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen, while Darius Garland is entering the second year of his own 5-year deal. A ton of money has been committed to this group, with the expectation that they would take another step forward as a real threat in the Eastern Conference under new head coach Kenny Atkinson.  While they can’t fully answer whether they’ve done that until May and June, the Cavs have made an emphatic statement to open the season, as they are the NBA’s last remaining unbeaten at 11-0. That hot start is the byproduct of confidence and trust in their group, something they’ve built over the years but had to fortify by figuring out how everyone can play to their strengths. One of the difficult tasks of building confidence as a unit is that each player has to first have that confidence in themselves. The story of the young season for Cleveland has been strides in that area by the two youngest members of their core, as Garland and Mobley are playing some of the best basketball of their careers.  For Garland, he’s bounced back after a difficult 2023-24 campaign that saw him suffer a broken jaw early in the year and never get fully back to his peak level. As he explained to DIME over the weekend, after missing a third of the season, he wasn’t too interested in vacations this summer, instead opting to get in the gym and build back the strength, confidence, and wiggle that had been missing at the end of last season.  “It’s a total difference. It’s a big difference,” Garland said of how he feels starting this season compared to the second half of last year. “I’m in a good head space right now. I’m fully healthy — some little nicks, but nothing too major right now. And yeah, just came in with a lot of confidence over the summer, put in a lot of work. Especially after last year, I didn’t play a lot of games, so wasn’t a lot of vacations for me this summer, or a lot of hangout time. It was really just strictly in the gym trying to get better, trying to put some more weight and some more muscle on that I lost from last year, from having to jaw surgery. And yeah, trying to get my confidence back, trying to get my wiggle back, and my ball handling and just trying to stay consistent with it.”  Garland’s summer in the gym helped him remember how much he loves the game. One of the lasting images from the end of last season for Garland and the Cavs was Donovan Mitchell on the bench putting his arm around Garland and saying “I believe in you,” as Garland was mired in the midst of a shooting slump. It was a touching moment between teammates, but also telling of how difficult things were for Garland, who had lost his perpetual smile and was finding it difficult to have that same sense of belief.  This season, his confidence is back, as is his infectious smile, and Garland is looking to spread that positivity beyond the court as well. For Veteran’s Day weekend, that means welcoming a pair of Gold Star families from the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) to the Cavs’ games against the Nets and Bulls, as Garland is helping honor a pair of families of fallen veterans from his hometown of Gary, IN.  “It’s super cool just to have some veteran families around me,” Garland said. “My grandfathers were veterans, so just trying to show some love and support for some of the families, and show that they’re loved and that they mean a lot to us, and we know how it is battling some things that they’ve gone through and that they’ve been through. So yeah, just to have their backs and just show that they’re loved and that we really appreciate it.” Both families have ties to Garland, as his mother went to high school with both of the fallen service members. He wants to take the opportunity his platform provides to show them love and do his favorite thing: put a smile on someone’s face. “I try to do it a little bit more often now, especially to kids and those with special needs,” Garland said. “I was one of the kids growing up looking up to Kobe, LeBron, Dame Lillard, Steph, so when I was growing up and they were giving back to younger kids and other people, I just always wanted to do the same. I know that it’ll just make their whole day and change the way that they look at things. So, trying to do it often and just try to put a smile on somebody’s face. That always means a lot to me, because I always wear a smile on my face.”   A post shared by Cavs Care (@cavscare_)  The way the Cavs have played so far this season has put an awful lot of smiles on faces in Cleveland, and Garland credits their hot start to the connectivity of the group and the confidence that’s instilled up and down the roster. This is the third year together for the Core Four, and many of their reserves have also been part of the team for at least a year or two. That familiarity has created a culture of accountability, with Garland noting that from players to coaches to the training staff, there’s a camaraderie that allows for honest conversations that make everyone better.  The newest face in the room is head coach Kenny Atkinson, as he took over for JB Bickerstaff (now in Detroit) with aspirations of taking this group to the next level. Garland, like everyone else in Cleveland, has been impressed with how Atkinson hit the ground running with the Cavs, and highlighted the way he instills confidence in everyone as the biggest thing he’s brought to the team. “He was a player, so he knows what it’s like playing a lot of games, and just having that confidence out on the floor — I mean, when you have that confidence, I think you just get boosted a little bit more,” Garland said. “You think that you can do anything and make any kind of shot, and that’s what our team has right now. We’re shooting the ball with confidence, making plays with confidence, and we’re doing it on both ends of the floor, and I think that’s where he’s just instilling us. Even at film, when we don’t shoot a shot we’re wide open, he’s going to get on us about shooting the ball, because that might be the only good shot that we have in that possession. So he wants us to shoot every ball with confidence, shoot every open one and just keep continuing to play hard and trust each other.” Garland has always been a good shooter, but last season, that confidence in his shot waned a bit, particularly in the postseason. That gave Garland plenty of motivation this summer, where he stripped his game back down to the basics and built it back up with a focus on the little details that go a long way in the games.  “Just trying to pay attention to details,” Garland said. “Just try to do all the little things to make me a better scorer, make me a better shooter. Literally the smallest things, like getting my feet ready, staying down low before I even get the ball. I mean, just literally everything, all the little things. I really went back from square one, from when I started basketball and just worked my way up until I could really start moving and going full speed for the entire summer. So I really went back to the basics this summer, and just tried to clean everything up and just try to polish everything, and getting some of the results back right now.”  The results are the best shooting percentages of his career from every level, with splits of 53.8/47.5/95.0 through the first 11 games. He’s finishing better than he ever has at the rim, a byproduct of the strength he added over the summer, and he’s shooting threes at a higher rate and making more of them than he ever has as a pro. That’s a lethal combination, and he certainly seems to have found that wiggle off the bounce once again, helped by his decisiveness and confidence with the ball as both a shooter and driving to attack the defense.  Garland is far from alone in having a strong start, as the Cavs are finding a way to feed off each other and recognizing how each of them can make the others better. Along with Garland’s return to All-Star form, Mobley has become a bigger part of the offense and is a big beneficiary of that boost of confidence Atkinson has provided. Mobley playing with more force and freedom on both ends of the floor raises their ceiling, and Garland is quick to note how his play opens up so much of the floor for everyone else, calling him “our catalyst.” “He gets us going on both ends of the floor, and he can do so many things, especially on offensive side of the ball,” Garland said. “We can set a 1-5 pick and roll with him, and I go set a pick-and-roll, or Don go set a pick-and-roll for him, and let him just work off that screen. And when he gets downhill he’s a great decision maker, so he’s going to make the right read. We really have a lot of trust in him. We just want him to continue to be confident in his game, want him to shoot some more threes, which is getting better over the years. And yeah, just to be the leader on both ends of the floor, especially defensively. Hopefully he’s All-NBA or Defensive Player of the Year this year, which he’s super capable of, and especially him and JA back there, it’s really tough to get anything at the rim.” The grind of the NBA regular season is impossible to avoid, but the Cavs have found an early comfort in leaning on their depth. At the top, they can play to the hot hand among their stars, but they’re finding an ability to be more adaptable as a roster to change their approach and lineups as needed based on matchups and game flow. With Mobley and Allen, they’ve always been able to go big, but against Brooklyn on Saturday, they closed with a four-guard lineup and showed how they can succeed going small, with Caris LeVert and Ty Jerome stepping in and playing well to close out their 11th win to start the season. As Garland explains, their experiences together, the highs and the lows, have taught them a lot about how they need to play, particularly in late game situations where slowing down and getting stagnant to let one player operate can be tempting, but ultimately plays into the hands of the defense.  “We have so much talent on this team and a lot of depth, so we just have a lot of confidence in everybody, and we’ve been in these situations before. Like I said, we’ve been around each other for a couple years now, so we know what to do. We’ve seen all different scenarios, from being in regular season or the playoffs, so when it’s late game situations, I think that we’re starting to get pretty good at it. And even with our depth last night, Ty Jerome and Caris, they ended the game with us. And, I mean, they made a difference when we went four guards and Evan at the five. It’s just so many different things that we can do because of because of our depth. And we got so much talent. I mean, you really have to just pick and poison, either you’re gonna give up a wide open three or a layup or a floater or something.” Garland and the Cavs know there are no banners to be hung for a fast start to the season, but for a team that just never seemed to hit their stride a year ago, this stretch is a reminder to both themselves and the rest of the league that they do have the kind of ceiling where they can beat anyone. There are still 71 games left in the season, but building the confidence and trust internally early on figures to pay dividends down the road.  For now, the Cavs will look to prolong their winning streak as long as they can, but as Garland notes, they have “bigger plans in May and June” and hope to keep putting smiles on faces in Cleveland deep into the spring."

	Barrett did a literal double-take and couldn't stop from blurting out ""Game of Thrones!""","There is no team that has more celebrities attend their games than the Lakers (the Knicks being a close second), as the courtside seats at L.A. games often go a few rows deep with stars from the world of entertainment. There are the regulars like Jack Nicholson and Denzel Washington, but on any given night you might find an actor from your favorite TV show or movie watching the Lakers play.  That happened to Toronto wing RJ Barrett on Sunday night as the Raptors made their annual trek to Los Angeles. After finishing through contact for an and-1, Barrett turned to the crowd in the corner to celebrate only to find himself face-to-face with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, best known for playing Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones. Barrett realized this mid-celebration and did a literal double take, turned back to Coster-Waldau, pointed, and blurted out “Game of Thrones!” at him before turning around and walking to the free throw line.   A post shared by Dime (@dimemagazine)  It’s a very funny thing to happen in the middle of an NBA game, but also, that’s exactly how I would react if I turned around and was suddenly face-to-face with the guy that played Jaime Lannister. I feel like this is far from the first time someone has pointed at Coster-Waldau and just yelled “Game of Thrones!” at him, as that is by far the role he’s best known for."

	In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, Most Valuable Promotions clarified that the record-breaking boxing match was not rigged in Paul’s favor. 
	“It is further illogical and inane that MVP, in the debut of a hopeful long-term partnership with the world’s biggest streamer—an organization that made its first-ever foray into live professional sports with Paul vs. Tyson—would even so much as consider such a perverse violation of the rules of competition,” detailed the statement. 
	Earlier this month, the former YouTube vlogger faced off against the former undisputed world heavyweight champion in a boxing match broadcast on Netflix. The bout, which had viewers fighting streaming issues, resulted in a unanimous decision victory for Paul in the officially sanctioned match.  
	After the fight, Michael Irvin, sports commentator and former NFL player, joined Cam’Ron and Mase’s It Is What It Is talk show and shared his belief that the results of the match were predetermined. 

	








 
	“That fight was a lie,” he exclaimed. “Everybody’s lying […] they had no intentions to really strap it on. If you look through that, I didn’t see one patented uppercut by Mike Tyson. What did Mike Tyson win on? Uppercut.”

	“This is not the first time Jake Paul has faced unfounded skepticism or outright disbelief as a professional athlete, and frankly, the claim that his bout must have been rigged is just the latest backhanded compliment to come his way,” Nakisa Bidarian, co-founder of Most Valuable Promotions reiterated to THR.

He eventually landed on his dad’s Los Angeles Lakers squad in the second round of this year’s NBA draft. After just a few games, however, he was sent to play in the NBA’s G League to build up his skills.  
	Upon his arrival, it was reported that Bronny would “shuttle” between both teams during an undisclosed period of time and will only be playing in G League home games, as to not fly commercial with his South Bay Lakers teammates. It is also reported that Bronny would be skipping road games due to the team staying at affordable hotels like the Courtyard-Marriott, rubbing many, including former NFL star and podcaster Ryan Clark, the wrong way.

	








 
	On his The Pivot podcast, Clark shared his confusion over Bronny’s ability to skip games due to travel and lodging accommodations when he hasn’t earned his stripes as an athlete just yet.

	“What has Bronny James done that he shouldn’t be able to stay at the Courtyard-Marriott?,” Clark questioned. “You say, ‘well, they fly commercial.’ What has Bronny James done where he should be too good to fly commercial? The pros isn’t about where you came from, how you were raised, what your parents had. Professional sports is about how well you can contribute, and you don’t get treated differently because of your parents.” A post shared by The Neighborhood Talk (@theneighborhoodtalk) 
	Many agree with Clark, including ESPN reporter Brian Windhorst, who believes coddling Bronny now will be “detrimental” to his career, adding that he believes the special treatment the former USC student receives from the Lakers has gone “too far,” The Post reports.   
	Another ESPN insider, however, is arguing that the Lakers are treating Bronny differently because, well, he’s different.  
	“Bronny James isn’t just your normal, everyday G League player,” ESPN’s Shams Charania said on The Pat McAfee Show on Tuesday. 
	“I don’t know if it’s a security thing, but there’s a different level of fanfare when he’s on the road for these G League games, a different level of everything when he’s with that G League team. How do you manage that on the road? I don’t think the door is necessarily completely shut on him playing in those road games as the G League season goes on, but as of right now that is the plan that the Lakers have laid out, and they want him to continue to shuttle back and forth, spend as much time on the active roster as possible.”

The fight ended up being highly underwhelming for many, and Michael Irvin recently shared his belief that most likely was not an accident. 
	“That fight was a lie,” he said during an appearance on Cam’ron and Ma$e’s popular sports talk show It Is What It Is. He continued, citing how both boxers didn’t seem to be putting in 100% effort and Iron Mike did not utilize a special move in his arsenal. “Everybody’s lying […] they had no intentions to really strap it on. If you look through that, I didn’t see one patented uppercut by Mike Tyson. What did Mike Tyson win on? Uppercut.”

	








 
	The NFL Hall Of Famer revealed rumors he heard that could explain why the fight wasn’t as exciting as it was promoted to be. “I heard some people talking about they couldn’t put [Mike Tyson’s uppercut] in the contract,” he stated. “He couldn’t body and then uppercut. Like, how can you put that in a fight contract?”

	Michael Irvin continued his assessment of the fight and rumored contrast terms by drawing a parallel to his NFL career. “That’s like making me play a game without running a slant route in the deep end or the deep out,” he said. “You do what you do best. If they take that away, you ain’t that dude anymore, and they took that away.” 
DJ Whoo Kid supported Irvin’s claims when he recounted a conversation he had with Jake Paul at a fight after-party, saying, “Legally they each cannot go at each other hard.” Despite being disappointed by how the boxing match went, the former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver was happy to see Mike Tyson secure a large payday. “I’m happy he got every dime, or whatever it is,” he said. “I want him to get his money. I just wanted him to free the beast.” 
	Per the final tally of the fight, Tyson threw 97 punches and only landed 18. Paul threw 278 punches and landed 78. Iron Mike was paid $20 million and Paul got $40 million. One valid explanation for the underwhelming bout is the health issues Tyson dealt with in the lead-up, which made them postpone the match as it was originally booked for July. He suffered from an ulcer flare-up and revealed that he almost died in June. 

	








 
	“This is one of those situations when you lost but still won,” Mike Tyson wrote on X. “I’m grateful for last night. No regrets to get in ring one last time. I almost died in June. Had 8 blood transfusions. Lost half my blood and 25lbs in hospital and had to fight to get healthy to fight so I won. To have my children see me stand toe to toe and finish 8 rounds with a talented fighter half my age in front of a packed Dallas Cowboy stadium is an experience that no man has the right to ask for. Thank you.” 
	“I wanted to give the fans a show, but I didn’t want hurt someone who didn’t need to be hurt,” Jake Paul said of the match. “I didn’t wanna hurt someone that didn’t need to be hurt.”  Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox"

According to a press release issued by Netflix, the event raked viewers from 60 million households, making it one of the most-watched sporting events of the year. However, the viewing experience notably wasn’t smooth for a lot of people who tuned in, and the streaming service has been hit with a new lawsuit over the “streaming issues.” 
TMZ Sports reports that Ronald “Blue” Denton filed the class-action lawsuit suit in Florida on Monday (Nov. 19). The outlet reports Denton made the legal move “just three days after he says he and thousands of others struggled to watch Netflix‘s broadcast.”

	








 
	According to court documents obtained by the site, the suit states viewers “were faced with legendary problems, including: no access, streaming glitches, and buffering issues.”

	People’s complaints about the quality of Netflix’s stream were well-documented in realtime on social media during the night of the showdown. One user wrote, “How are y’all gonna have the biggest fight of the year on your platform & y’all stream can’t go longer than 5 minutes without buffering… WTF Netflix.” 
	Another person raised concerns about another major event next month and expressed doubt about whether or not Netflix could handle the traffic. “Netflix couldn’t even stream a Tyson fight right but now they doing a Christmas NFL game. Featuring Beyonce. Ok bro,” they sarcastically typed. 
	The match up resulted in a victory for the famous YouTuber, as Mike Tyson was defeated in 8 rounds by a unanimous decision. A hot topic of the night was the age disparity between the two contenders; Paul is 27 and Mike Tyson is 58, which drew a fair amount of both intrigue and criticism from fans.

Sports,Bobby Portis Offers $40K Reward For “Prized Possessions” Stolen In Burglary,https://www.vibe.com/news/sports/bobby-portis-reward-prized-possesions-stolen-burglary-1234950302/,"Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:15:11 +0000",Portis is the latest professional athlete to fall victim to a home invasion.,"NBA star Bobby Portis is offering a hefty reward for information leading to the recovery of “prized possessions” that were stolen during a burglary at his Wisconson home.  
	On Nov. 6, Portis, the Milwaukee Bucks forward released a public message via Instagram pleading for the public’s assistance in locating the stolen items, which he’s willing to pay $40,000 cash for. In the video, Portis spoke of his love for the city of Milwaukee, where he became a resident after signing a deal with the Bucks organization in 2020. 
	“Over the last four-and-a-half seasons, I’ve considered Milwaukee as a home,” Portis, 29, said. “I’ve grown here, I come here a boy and elevated into a man. The love you guys have given me here isn’t something I’ve ever felt before in my NBA career.”

	








 
	He continued, explaining the circumstances behind the burglary, which occurred while Portis was out of town for the Bucks’ matchup against the Cleveland Cavaliers earlier this month.

	“While I was at the game yesterday, we had a home invasion and they took most of my prized possessions,” Portis added, expressing the importance that the items, which he did not specify, hold to him and his family. 
	The burglary of Portis’ home marks the latest in a string of home invasions seemingly targeting professional athletes that have occurred in recent months. 
	In September, Minnesota Timberwolves guard Mike Conley’s Minnesota home was broken into and ransacked, with jewelry being listed among the items stolen. Authorities believe the burglary of Portis and Conley’s homes could possibly be connected due to similarities in the two break-ins, despite occurring in neighboring states. 
	NFL stars and reigning Super Bowl champions Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce’s homes were also burglarized in October, within a 48-hour period of one another. While no items were reported as stolen from Mahomes’ residence, the culprits in the burglary of Kelce’s home made off with $20,000 after breaking into the property through a rear door.

	








 
	Drafted in the first round of the 2015 NBA Draft by the Chicago Bulls, Portis has spent time with Bulls, Washington Wizards, and New York Knicks before joining the Bucks, winning a championship with the team in 2021.

	Netflix had its first live boxing event on Friday night (Nov. 15) with a card headlined by the Jake Paul, 27, and Mike Tyson, 58—the widest age disparity in sanctioned boxing history. And the generation divide wasn’t the only stark distinction between the two men. 
	Jake Paul came out to to the ring to Phil Collins’ “In The Air Tonight,” riding in a customized low-rider with his brother Logan Paul. The entrance was jam-packed with thinly veiled jabs at Tyson, with the song referencing the boxer’s appearance in The Hangover, and even a bird, referencing the “Now Kith” meme. Tyson, however, walked out to the ring with pure intention of throwing down and nothing more. And all the built-up tension was released as the two combatants entered the ring for the highly-anticipated showdown. 
	While both Tyson and Paul promised to knock the other boxer out before the 5th round, the match surprisingly went for the entire eight rounds. Tyson came out swinging for the first two rounds but Father Time quickly got Iron Mike together, as the icon began to slow down with each subsequent round. Paul kept to a moderate pace throughout the whole match.

	Jake Paul’s even-keeled strategy allowed him to drastically out-punch Tyson throughout the match. By round four, Tyson’s legs looked tired and shaky, which were tell-tale signs of exhaustion for a boxer. 
	As the fight ended in round 8, Jake Paul began bowing to Mike Tyson out of respect for “being an all-time great in this sport” and for “all that he’s done to allow us to be here.” Tyson kept his guard up but gave Paul some dap as he realized the fight was over.

Kiyan had been stewing over his final schools, consisting of USC and Auburn, but felt like ‘Cuse was where he needed to be. 
	Kiyan explained to everyone that what he loved the most about playing for ‘Cuse outside of the connection to his dad were marquee match-ups against universities like Duke and North Carolina. Anthony expressed that the national spotlight would benefit both him and the rest of his teammates who are looking to restore Syracuse to greatness and possible futures in the NBA. “All that played a part into why I chose Syracuse,” Kiyan said on the podcast. 
	“I’m overwhelmed,” La La said following her son’s announcement during the podcast. “I’m happy because he’s happy…It’s big shoes to fill, but at the same time, this is his moment, his lane and his time to create his own reality.”

	Kiyan Anthony also talked to ESPN about his decision, saying, “Ultimately, it came down to my relationship with the staff. From day one, when they started recruiting me, they made me feel like it was family. My dad’s name on the facility is special, but I want to go in there and create my own name, and I’ve already done that through my dedication in the offseason, with early-morning practices, playing at camps, playing on the circuit.” 
	Kiy then spoke about the culture that Coach Adrian Autry is trying to establish with the Orangemen basketball unit. Anthony expressed to the outlet that Autry, who was named the head coach after the 2022-23 season, had already begun getting to work on the 2025 season. 
	“I’m going to do everything Coach Autry needs me to do,” Anthony added. “We talk a lot, especially late at night, about how we can make Syracuse basketball great. Off the court, Coach is super cool. You could go out with him on a Friday night. He’s still young and connects with all his players; he is very relatable.” 
	While Carmelo Anthony only played one season for the Orangemen, his impact on the university is undeniable. 
	During his lone 2003 season, Melo, a freshman, led the Orangemen to a storybook national championship.

Thursday (Nov. 14) found the two men doing their final weigh-in and stare down ahead of their Netflix exhibition. Tyson weighed in at 233 pounds and promptly took his spot on stage. Paul was clocked at 220 pounds, a career-high for him, and then began his usual antics. Hitting the stage in a crawling stance, Jake Paul then immediately began running toward Iron Mike, getting directly in his face. 
ESPN reports that around this time, the YouTuber “purposefully” stepped on Tyson’s foot, to which he responded by slapping him in the face. A source close to the event claimed that Mike Tyson had grown “tired” of the content creator’s trash talk in the days leading up to Thursday. So, Paul stepping on the OG’s foot finally set him over the top, resulting in him slapping his opponent. “[Mike Tyson] hits like a bi**h! It’s personal now. He must die!” Paul dramatically screamed to the crowd while Tyson walked away from the stage.

However, as the day of the fight quickly approached, Tyson transformed into something far more intense. On Tuesday (Nov. 12), the boxing legend talked to reporters about the fight, promising to unleash “the devil himself” on Friday night. 
	“I’m bringing the devil himself [to the ring],” Tyson told ESPN. “There are no feelings attached. My own mother should be very careful if she has to get in the ring with me.

Former NBA stars Carmelo Anthony and Rudy Gay recently chimed in on the recent back and forth between Drake and DeMar DeRozan, which was a byproduct of the 6 God’s feud with Kendrick Lamar earlier this year. 
	“I think Drake was hurt a little bit because of the relationship he built with DeMar in Toronto,” Melo said on an episode of his show 7PM In Brooklyn. “Representing the 6, Raptors — you know that was a lot of connection with those two. He’s a Raptor for life from a basketball standpoint. Yes, that jersey should be going up.” 

	








 
	Gay, who just recently retired from the NBA, previously played for the Raptors, and is a new recurring co-host on 7PM, disapproved of Drizzy’s behavior. “That’s wack, man. Drake is wack for that,” he asserted. “You gotta pull up on DeMar if you feel that way before you go on camera.” Melo agreed, especially regarding the Toronto rapper’s comments on taking down DeRozan’s banner if the Raptors ever hung one up for him.

	“Drake did a lot when he said I’ma go up there and take it down. That part is a lot,” Carmelo Anthony said. However, he acknowledged that DeRozan turned himself into Drake’s opposition when he joined Kendrick Lamar on stage at The Pop Out concert and appeared in the “Not Like Us” music video. “Those are shots. You my man, we in the crib, we hanging, we building the 6 up. From that standpoint, that would f**k me up, too. I’m gonna feel a way no matter what, but yes, you do have a conversation. As a man, you have a conversation.” 
	Though Rudy Gay did not like the “First Person Shooter” rapper’s actions, he leveled with Anthony on that part. “If you got a problem, come at me,” he said. “To see your man’s out there dancing with the enemy, that’s kinda crazy.” 
	Drake and DeMar DeRozan went viral earlier this month when the For All The Dogs rapper sat courtside for the Toronto Raptors matchup against the Sacramento Kings. At one point, he was interviewed on air and said, “Unfortunately, we’re playing this goof [DeRozan] tonight, but it is what it is” as well as “If you ever put up a DeRozan banner, I’ll go up there and pull it down myself.”

	








 
	After the Raptors defeated the Kings, Drake could be seen mouthing “F**k outta here pu**y” as DeRozan walked off the court. During a post-game press conference, the six-time All-Star was asked about the comments regarding the banner and said, “Well he gon’ have a long way to climb to take it down, so tell him good luck.” 
	This is a significant change in their relationship, just three years after DeRozan said that Drake would “forever have a friend” in him. When he was traded from the Raptors to the Spurs, despite being told he would not be traded, the five-time Grammy winner invited him to his house and gave him support in his time of disappointment. Even after appearing at The Pop Out and in the “Not Like Us” music video, he claimed that he still had love for the OVO head honcho. Those days are seemingly over.

The Detroit Lions were enjoying some turkey after taking down their NFC North-rival Chicago Bears, 23-20, on Thanksgiving Day.  Detroit made some history in the process, going 11-1 for the first time in the franchise’s history. The Bears fell to 4-8 on the season.  Another milestone was reached for this great Lions team, as their defensive efforts kept the Bears scoreless in the first half. It was the first time this season the Lions had shut out a team in the first half.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Detroit Lions running back Jahmyr Gibbs runs with the ball during the game against the Chicago Bears at Ford Field in Detroit on Thursday. (Lon Horwedel-Imagn Images) Meanwhile, quarterback Jared Goff and the Lions’ electric offense put up 16 points, though they were limited in the red zone by their standards as kicker Jake Bates notched three field goals in the first half to account for nine of the 16 points.  Tight end Sam LaPorta, who scored two touchdowns for the Lions, collected his first in the second quarter as Goff threw a laser to him from three yards out to make it 10-0 at the time.  In the second half, though, Bears quarterback Caleb Williams and his offense turned things around, as their opening drive resulted in a Keenan Allen touchdown from 31 yards out, as the rookie signal caller put it right on the wide receiver's numbers and Allen ran it into the end zone.  OSCAR MAYER SPARKS NOSTALGIA AIRING 50-YEAR-OLD AD WITH ICONIC JINGLE DURING BEARS-LIONS GAME But the Lions quickly responded, using over seven minutes of clock for LaPorta to find the end zone once more after Goff ran a perfect play-action pass that left the tight end wide open for the score.  Williams and the Bears didn’t back down, however, as they marched 70 yards for Allen to get into the end zone again to keep the Lions’ lead at 10 after a failed two-point conversion.  Then, after Bates missed his first field goal of the game, the Bears took advantage of the great field position as Williams threw a dime to wide receiver D.J. Moore for a touchdown down the left sideline from 31 yards out to make it a three-point game.  Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams looks to throw a pass during the game against the Detroit Lions at Ford Field in Detroit on Thursday. (Lon Horwedel-Imagn Images) The Bears were able to get the ball back again with three minutes left, but a perfect punt left Chicago at the one-yard line to make it as hard as possible to get a chance to at least tie the game.  But one of the weirdest endings to a game in recent memory came when Williams was sacked to make it third-and-26, leaving 30-plus seconds on the clock. Williams lost track of time, however, and took way too long to get the play off, ultimately launching a prayer to wide receiver Rome Odunze that fell incomplete to end the game. Even more weird was head coach Matt Eberflus still having a timeout in his pocket. Knowing his quarterback was taking too long, he could have used it to preserve time — but the Bears found yet another improbable way to lose.  In the box score, the ""Sonic & Knuckles"" backfield of David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs put in work against the Bears’ defense to once again lead the way for the Lions' offense.  Gibbs needed only nine carries to tally 87 yards on the ground, while Montgomery had 21 carries for 88 yards.  Detroit Lions tight end Sam LaPorta catches a touchdown pass during the game against the Chicago Bears at Ford Field in Detroit on Thursday.

Boise State, Wyoming, Utah State and Nevada were among the conference teams to cancel games against the Spartans as a result of Fleming’s presence on the team. They were aware the forfeiture would result in a loss on their records, which ultimately helped SJSU secure its high seed.  Earlier this week, federal Judge Kato Crews in Colorado, appointed by President Biden in January, denied a motion for injunctive relief in a lawsuit by college volleyball players against the conference in efforts to have Fleming not play in the tournament and their forfeit losses rescinded.

The move is congruent to its regular-season forfeitures to the Spartans, and though no specific reason was given for this move, it more than likely has to do with the Spartans having Blaire Fleming, a trans athlete, on its roster.  The Broncos forfeited twice to the Spartans during the regular season, but after defeating Utah State in the quarterfinals on Wednesday, they had them on the schedule yet again.

""The decision to not continue to play in the 2024 Mountain West Volleyball Championship tournament was not an easy one,"" Boise State Athletics wrote in a statement, per OutKick.

A dozen women jointly filed the suit against the Mountain West and its commissioner, alleging violations of Title IX and their First Amendment rights.

""The movants have failed to meet their burden to show irreparable harm, a likelihood of success on the merits, or that the balance of harms or equities is in their favor,"" Crews wrote in his decision.  The players were looking to have their forfeits for refusing to play against Fleming and the Spartans rescinded, which would, in turn, shift the standings heading into the tournament. They also wanted Fleming banned from the tournament.  Boise State, Wyoming, Utah State and Nevada were among the conference teams to cancel games against the Spartans due to Fleming’s presence on the team.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Before Tom Brady took on his first Thanksgiving Day game in the broadcast booth, he decided to spend his Thanksgiving Eve taking in another sport.  Brady was spotted mingling at American Airlines Center for the Dallas Mavericks and New York Knicks primetime matchup on Wednesday night. Brady was spotted shaking hands with Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd and others.  It was all Dallas on the court, too, as Brady watched the Mavs beat the Knicks, 129-114, to move to 11-8 on the season. New York fell to 10-8.

The Giants are already looking toward the future with six games left on the schedule.  DeVito is a longshot to play on the short week, as he’s suffering from a forearm injury. Drew Lock, whom the Giants paid $5 million this offseason to be Jones’ backup, would be the next man up if DeVito can’t play.  And while he may not be playing anymore, Brady knows that his choice of profession means being away from family on holidays.  Fox Sports broadcaster Tom Brady smiles on the field prior to an NFL football game between the Chicago Bears and the Green Bay Packers at Soldier Field on November 17, 2024, in Chicago, Illinois.

That, however, led to additional speculation of a staged fight. Most Valuable Promotions (MVP) made sure to nix any speculation that the Jake Paul-Mike Tyson fight was compromised in any capacity, but in case you needed more evidence, one of the ring girls from that night is giving it. MVP co-founder Nakisa Bidarian said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital that the fight was ""100% real from beginning to end."" The speculation was already present well before the fight, but one moment that prompted fireworks led to even more talk of possible staging.

Several people needed to separate Tyson from Paul, causing a melee on the stage. Fans pointed to the ring girls behind them, who continued to pose and smile, as evidence that it was all planned. But Sydney Thomas, who has since nearly doubled her social media following, says they had no choice but to not react. ""I was so shocked that it happened. I was not expecting that at all. … But our job as event models is to stand there and smile, we’re not really supposed to react. You’re not supposed to change what you’re doing. You’re supposed to be in the background of all the pictures and not have these big reactions,"" Thomas told Fox News Digital in a recent interview.  So, Thomas had to keep her cool.

In my head, I’m like, ‘No way. But keep smiling! They’re taking so many pictures, this moment’s going to go so viral. I got to be looking good back here!' That was my thought process. ""A lot of people, too, had drawn a line [and] said, ‘This has to be staged. There’s no way that’s real. The models in the back didn’t even react.’ They were saying it was on us for the reason why it was looking so fake, because we didn’t react. That’s our entire job. We’re paid to stand there and smile. We’re professional at it. We’re not going to have these reactions. It was shocking, but that’s our job."" MVP ripped any notion that the fight was rigged in any form. ""If you were to rig such competition, it is a federal crime. And myself, Jake Paul, Mike Tyson, executives from Netflix would all be going to jail. They would be risking their entire company, and we would be risking our entire lives to do that,"" Bidarian told Fox News Digital last week.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Thanksgiving Day wouldn’t be Thanksgiving without a full slate of NFL games. The football tradition returns with the main course: the Detroit Lions, who host the Chicago Bears on Thursday afternoon. The Lions have played every year dating back to 1934 and hope to pick up their first Turkey Day win in nearly a decade.  Meanwhile, the Dallas Cowboys, who have been playing on Thanksgiving Day since 1966, return to take on their NFC East rival, the New York Giants. The Green Bay Packers close out the day against the Miami Dolphins, who put a stamp on the holiday last season when they defeated the New York Jets to win the league’s first-ever Black Friday game. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM For an extra serving of football, the NFL has scheduled another Black Friday matchup, this time between the Kansas City Chiefs and Las Vegas Raiders at Arrowhead Stadium at 3 p.m. ET on Prime Video.

(AP Photo/Michael Conroy) The Lions open Thursday’s slate with a game against the Bears at home in what will be the organization’s 85th game on Thanksgiving Day since 1934. The Lions are 0-3 against the Bears in their last three meet-ups on the big day, and they haven’t won a Thanksgiving Day game since 2016. But this year could be different.  Detroit is 10-1, having won every single game since their Week 2 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, while the Bears are hoping to tap into their previous luck and end their five-game slide.  With injuries plaguing the Lions this week, the player to watch will be star running back David Montgomery as he faces his former team. The Bears, who have lost three of their last five games on the final play, won’t have room for error if they want to stop the Lions’ stellar run game.  When: Thanksgiving Day, 12:30 p.m. ET Where: Ford Field Where to watch: CBS BROWNS' JAMEIS WINSTON REJECTS MASHED POTATOES AS A THANKSGIVING DISH, DOESN'T EVEN WANT IT AROUND New York Giants quarterback Tommy DeVito throws a pass against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers during the first half of an NFL football game, Nov. 24, 2024, in East Rutherford, N.J. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) The Cowboys host the struggling Giants at home on Thursday, but it’s not the home-field advantage fans are expecting to see. Despite winning 14 of their last 15 matchups, the Cowboys are 0-5 this season at AT&T Stadium, and a win in what will be the organization’s 57th Thanksgiving Day game could be exactly what they need to keep building momentum after snapping a five-game losing streak with a win over the Washington Commanders on Sunday. The Giants enter Thursday’s matchup with more questions surrounding the quarterback position even after releasing Daniel Jones last week. Fan-favorite Tommy DeVito walked away from his first start this season with a sore throwing arm.

The retired coach especially dislikes teams that have lost to &quot;average&quot; opponents.","Joel Klat explained how the chaos in the SEC will affect the Alabama Crimson Tide and the Ole Miss Rebels in the playoff. He analyzed whether a fourth SEC team could make the playoff.  During his storied coaching career, Nick Saban rarely shied away from an opportunity to express his thoughts about a topic related to college football. During his latest appearance on the ""Pat McAfee Show,"" the seven-time national championship winning coach discussed some of the potential drawbacks of the new 12-team College Football Playoff format.  Under the expanded playoff, the five highest-ranked conference champions will receive an automatic postseason bid. The four highest-ranked conference champions will be granted a bye for the first round. Saban suggested that the concept could result in some unintended consequences.

""Especially the kind of losses Ole Miss had and like Alabama’s had to pretty .500 teams I want to call them. Pretty average teams. You’ve got some other teams that maybe they didn’t play the same competition, but they didn’t lose games to average teams either."" Alabama head coach Nick Saban speaks during NCAA college football Southeastern Conference Media Days on Tuesday, July 19, 2022, in Atlanta.  (AP Photo/John Bazemore) From Saban's point of view, the Georgia Bulldogs are the only potential three-loss team that should be in line for serious playoff consideration. Georgia will enter their annual in-state rivalry showdown with Georgia Tech on Nov. 29 with two losses. The Bulldogs are then scheduled to play the winner of this weekend's Texas-Texas A&M game in the SEC Championship game in Atlanta. If Georgia drops that game, Saban does not believe they should be eliminated from playoff contention.

Cowboys owner Jerry Jones didn’t shut the door on a potential extension, but if Dallas doesn’t finish strong, it’s hard to see McCarthy returning despite three straight 12-5 seasons in years before 2024.  Then, Duval County has Doug Pederson already out the door despite a similar situation as McCarthy with the franchise sticking with him through a 2-9 season thus far.  Other coaches that find themselves on the hot seat are Brian Daboll (New York Giants), Matt Eberflus (Chicago Bears), Antonio Pierce (Las Vegas Raiders), and Zac Taylor (Cincinnati Bengals) among others.  As for Daboll, Giants owner John Mara did give him a vote of confidence, saying that he didn’t anticipate making any changes this offseason, which also includes GM Joe Schoen, despite the Giants heading into Thanksgiving to face the Cowboys with a 2-9 record.  Jacksonville Jaguars head coach Doug Pederson answers question after an NFL football game against the Buffalo Bills, Monday, Sept. 23, 2024, in Orchard Park, NY.  (AP Photo/Steven Senne) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP NFL players, coaches and front offices all know that, despite playoffs not being in the picture, playing strong through the remainder of the year could be the difference between remaining in place or searching for the next opportunity.   Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Hall of Fame voter says Eli Manning's candidacy faces 'significant' obstacles in first year of eligibility,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/hall-fame-voter-says-eli-mannings-candidacy-faces-significant-obstacles-first-year-eligibility,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 19:12:49 -0500","Eli Manning is no stranger to contending with doubters. But, if he wants to make it to the Hall of Fame in 2025, the retired QB will have to overcome at least one voter&apos;s doubts.","Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Earlier this month, Eli Manning learned he was one of the semifinalists for the 2025 Pro Football Hall of Fame modern era class. The two-time Super Bowl champion, who retired after the 2019 season, made the list in his first year of eligibility. But this week, a Hall of Fame voter put a damper on the idea that Manning could receive enough votes to become an official member of the Class of 2025. ""The general consensus seems to be Manning will eventually get into the Hall, even if it's not this year,"" the voter told ESPN. Candidates must reach the selection committee's 80% threshold in order to get voted in. But, Manning's candidacy has become polarizing. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Apr 14, 2024; Harrison, New Jersey, USA; Retired Giants quarterback Eli Manning during the pregame at Red Bull Arena. (Jonathan Jones-USA TODAY Sports) There are several arguments that could be made when making a case for or against the retired quarterback. He showed his ability to play at an elite level during the run to the aforementioned Super Bowl titles, throwing a combined 15 touchdowns against just one interception during those postseasons. DANIEL JONES TO SIGN WITH VIKINGS AFTER TUMULTUOUS END WITH GIANTS: REPORT Arguments against Manning's candidacy include the fact that he was never named to an All-Pro team during his playing career. While Manning did compete in an era that also featured Tom Brady, his older brother Peyton Manning, Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers, the absence of at least one All-Pro nod could weigh heavily in the minds of some voters. New York Giants former quarterback Eli Manning prepares to throw out the first pitch before the game between the New York Yankees and the Toronto Blue Jays at Yankee Stadium.  (Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports) Furthermore, Manning finished his career with a regular-season record of 117-117. Many star quarterbacks and Hall of Famers finished at least one season in the NFL's top spot in touchdowns or passing yards —Manning never accomplished either of those feats.  He did, however, throw the most interceptions in the league in three separate seasons. Manning retired from the NFL with 244 career interceptions.

(Brad Penner-USA TODAY Sports) But, there have only been a dozen quarterbacks who have won multiple Super Bowl titles, and Manning is among that exclusive group. In all likelihood, Manning will ultimately become a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame — it just remains unclear how long he will have to wait to receive the coveted gold jacket.

After another round of polling takes place, a list of 10 finalists will be revealed. Lastly, a group of seven finalists will be announced.

"NY Post Sports – Latest News, Scores, Stats & Videos",Rangers once-vaunted power play has gone missing in growing concern,https://nypost.com/2024/11/28/sports/rangers-once-vaunted-power-play-has-gone-missing/,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 19:49:56 -0500",The Rangers have simply looked disjointed.,"The Rangers have lost a significant part of their offensive motor on the power play, as well as a step on their confidence-boosting penalty kill.  It’s been seven games since the Blueshirts last scored a power-play goal, dating back to the second period of the 6-3 loss to the Jets on Nov. 12.  That’s a concerning 0-for-14 stretch for a part of the game they so heavily rely on.  “It’s not scoring, they’re not bopping right now,” head coach Peter Laviolette said at the end of the four-game road trip. “There’s some movement, there’s some looks. They’re walking in, but it’s not falling for us. It can be better. There’s no question, it can be better.”  Dropping to 15th in the NHL in power-play percentage at 20.4, the Rangers have simply looked disjointed with the man advantage.  Similarly to the Rangers’ issues five-on-five, entering the zone has become a one-and-done opportunity.  Opponents are so often able to break the Rangers up in transition, force them to the perimeter or prevent a unit that has largely been skating together for years from connecting around the offensive zone.  Peter Laviolette did make some personnel changes, which is something the Rangers head coach hasn’t had to do since taking over the team last year.  Since Chris Kreider has missed the past two games with back spasms, Alexis Lafreniere has filled in for the longest-tenured Ranger on PP1 with Mika Zibanejad, Vincent Trocheck, Artemi Panarin and Adam Fox.

The second group has been pumped with youth, after Brett Berard joined the mix alongside Will Cuylle, Zac Jones, Kaapo Kakko and Reilly Smith.  Wednesday night’s 4-3 loss to the Hurricanes saw the Rangers lose the special teams battle, giving up two power-play goals in the four man-advantage stretches they faced.  In the 6-2 loss to the Oilers, the Rangers gave up their first shorthanded goal of the season — something that only happened seven total times in 2023-24.  Will Cuylle has shown up on the scoresheet in five of the Rangers’ past six games, garnering four goals and three assists while playing on both the second power-play unit and penalty kill.  The 22-year-old logged a career-high 19:39 of ice time Wednesday night, posting an assist, two shots on goal, two blocks and five hits in the loss."

Three of the four semifinalists — the Bucks, Pelicans and Lakers — were bounced in the opening round of the postseason.  The other semifinalist, the Pacers, were swept in the Eastern Conference finals.  The traveling members of the Knicks organization had a big Thanksgiving dinner together in Charlotte.  The Hornets game will decide whether the five-game road trip — which ties the longest of the season — will be winning or losing.

The Knicks are currently 2-2 with uneven play in victories over the Suns and Nuggets, and losses to the Jazz and Mavericks.  “We’ve been on the road a long time,” coach Tom Thibodeau said. “Be ready to play. You’ve got to play 48 minutes. Whatever happened yesterday is not going to matter tomorrow. Whether it’s a loss or a win, you’ve just got to make sure mentally you’re ready to play. And then you have to be mentally tough. You have to be able to deal with adversity. That’s part of this.

Let it fly.,"Jordi Fernandez’s directive to his team has certainly been heard. Let it fly. The Nets’ 3-point prowess is at the heart of their 9-10 start to the season after most predicted them to be NBA bottom-feeders.  It has been stressed throughout the season by their first-year head coach, who wants to make it their offensive identity. They shot a stellar 18-for-42 (42.9 percent) from behind the arc during their 127-117 win over the Suns on Wednesday night in Phoenix. For the season, the Nets are shooting 38.8 percent from 3-point range — fourth-best in the NBA entering Thursday. And that’s while shooting 40.9 treys a game — fifth-most in the league. Last year, the Nets shot 36.2 percent from deep — 19th in the NBA. They took 36.7 3s a game — ninth-most. This year’s team is relishing Fernandez’s green light. “It’s big-time,” Trendon Watford said after scoring 18 points — including nailing two 3-pointers — in Wednesday’s win. “I’ve had four coaches since I’ve been in the league and I don’t think there’s a coach that tells us to shoot as much as him. “He came to me before the game and said he wanted me to shoot 10 threes. I let him down, I only shot six. That’s who Jordi is. He wants to get up 50 3s a game and that’s how we want to play. … We enjoy it.” The Nets also outscored the Nets 24-13 in transition. It’s an area Fernandez has emphasized in recent games, trying to get his team to play quicker.  They entered Thursday with the slowest pace in the NBA, averaging 96.42 possessions per game. “If we wanted to have a chance against a team like this, especially when they get to a switching lineup one through five, you have to be able to run, and obviously you have to get stops,” Fernandez said after Wednesday’s win. “But even after makes, we were able to get the ball in quick and throw it ahead and get that earlier shot.

Schroder poured in 29 points — shooting 4-for-9 from 3-point range — and added three assists in Wednesday’s win. Though he is a looming free agent, he has emerged as a veteran leader this year. “That’s who he is,” Fernandez said. “He’s extremely tough. He’s gonna let everybody know that we’re here, that he’s here and we’re not gonna back down. That’s pretty much it. That’s how you play the game of basketball. Obviously respectfully. “But that’s who he is, that’s who we are. The way the group fights, it’s all we want to see.”"

Brady was critical of Jones on the Fox broadcast during the Giants-Cowboys Thanksgiving clash. “I don’t know how that whole situation went down but to think that you’d ask for a release from a team that committed a lot to you is maybe different from how I would’ve handled that,” Brady said. “I always felt I wanted to get the trust and respect of my teammates regardless of the situation, knowing that I was trying to be the best I could for the team because that was the most important thing.”  The Giants benched Jones last week ahead of the team’s 30-7 loss to the Buccaneers.  They subsequently opted to start third-stringer Tommy DeVito, bypassing backup Drew Lock.  And they signed Tim Boyle to their practice squad as well, in turn relegating Jones from starter all the way down to fourth-string.  Jones notably possessed an injury clause in his contract with the Giants, which would have guaranteed him $23 million for next year if he got injured and couldn’t pass a physical during the offseason.  So once the Giants decided to bench Jones, it was expected he’d be demoted to third- or fourth-string to prevent any possible injury.  During practice last Friday, the Giants at times had Jones stand in at safety on the scout team.

One day later, Jones asked for and was granted his release to end his tumultuous five-plus-year tenure.  “There’s just some different things that happen in the NFL,” Brady said. “Everyone makes individual choices. I think we’re all, at points in our career, faced with different challenges. I faced them in college — some things didn’t go the way I wanted, but the people that mattered the most to me were the guys in the locker room.  “I showed up every day — I didn’t care if they asked me to be the scout team safety, scout team quarterback, I was gonna do whatever I could to help the team win.”  Jones signed with the Vikings on Wednesday."

Thanksgiving is not typically a notable benchmark.  The Blueshirts would be remiss, however, not to address their deficiencies with urgency.  So where is the confidence in the team to turn it around sooner rather than later?  “High,” captain Jacob Trouba said following Wednesday night’s 4-3 loss to the Hurricanes. “Teams go through adversity. I think you’re a better team when you come out of the other side — and we’re going to come out of the other side. We all know it’s hard to go through. I think throughout the year, there are ups and downs and that’s how you build a team.”  This matchup against the Flyers on Friday in Philly suddenly has implications in the standings.  The gap between the upper and lower echelon of the Metropolitan Division has grown — and the Rangers are on the wrong side of it.  A loss would allow the Flyers to tie the Rangers with 25 points.  As of Thanksgiving morning, the Rangers were six points behind the Capitals, who are the surprise third-ranked team in the division.  With their win over the Rangers on Wednesday night, the Hurricanes jumped over the Devils for first place in the Metro.  The Rangers felt notably better about their performance against the Canes and see it as one they can potentially build off of.  “We did enough to put ourselves in a good position to win [Wednesday night], sometimes it just doesn’t work out,” Reilly Smith said. “There’s a lot of positives from [Wednesday night], I think we’ve got to keep working on those. You work your way out of these holes as a group and that’s what we’re going to do.”  Without Filip Chytil the last six games, and without Chris Kreider the last two, the Rangers have not only not been at full strength, but the two top-nine forwards’ absences have forced head coach Peter Laviolette to shuffle his lines.  There’s no indication of how close or how far Chytil is to returning, despite the fact that he’s skated with the team since getting cleared of a concussion by specialists, but Kreider said the Rangers likely want him to get a couple practices/morning skates in before he plays after he returned to the ice Wednesday morning.

Kreider could also slot into the left-wing spot on the third line next to Kaapo Kakko and Smith, which would bump Adam Edstrom back down to the fourth line and likely edge Jonny Brodzinski out of the lineup.  When Chytil returns, the Rangers could go back to Kreider-Chytil-Kakko, a line that only started two games together this season before the Czech center went down.  They only logged 13:04 of ice time, which is not nearly enough to draw any conclusions from.  There are some inevitable positives on the horizon that the Rangers should look forward to.  “I mean, yeah, it was a better effort, but all we care about is getting wins right now and we didn’t do that [Wednesday night],” Lindgren said. “We’re going to need more in Philly.”"

He was 82. Alabama released a statement Thursday saying that Battle had died. No details were provided. “It’s difficult to put into words just how much Coach Battle means to The University of Alabama and college athletics, as a whole,” athletic director Greg Byrne said. “He excelled in so many areas and was a true visionary.” Born in Birmingham, Battle was a three-year starter for the Crimson Tide between 1960 and 1962 and helped Bryant win his first national title in 1961. Battle started his coaching career at Oklahoma, where he earned a master’s degree in education in 1964 while working under Bud Wilkinson. He was an assistant at Army during a two-year military tour in 1964-65. He moved to Tennessee in 1966 and was an assistant coach for four years. When Doug Dickey left for the same job at Florida in 1970, the 28-year-old Battle became the youngest head coach at the time. Battle went 59-22-2 with the Volunteers, winning four of five bowl games. In 1972, Battle named Condredge Holloway the Vols’ starting quarterback, making him the first Black player to start at that position for a Southeastern Conference team. Tennessee played its first night game at Neyland Stadium that same season against Penn State. In 1981, Battle founded the Collegiate Licensing Company and was president and CEO until 2002. The company was bought by IMG in 2007. Battle took over as athletic director at Alabama in 2013, spending four years on the job. The Crimson Tide won three national championships during his tenure, and he later served as special assistant to the university president. Former Alabama coach Nick Saban called Battle “first class” and said he represented the university with “tremendous character and integrity.” Saban praised Battle for revolutionizing the business of college athletics. “I got to know him best when he returned to direct the Alabama athletics department where his vision and leadership were driving factors in the Crimson Tide’s success that resulted in our 2015 national championship,” Saban said. Battle is a member of several halls of fame. He also was honored by the National Football Foundation, received a lifetime achievement award from the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame and was a recipient of the 2005 Paul W. Bryant Alumni Athlete Award. “Bill was an innovative leader who had a distinguished career as a coach, businessman, and athletics director, who loved his family and was committed to the special opportunities presented through intercollegiate athletics,” SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey said."

There were 129 hitters who received enough plate appearances to qualify for individual awards in 2024, and the worst OPS belonged to the Royals’ Maikel Garcia at .613.  For quite a long stretch, the worst qualified hitter in baseball has outperformed Yankees first basemen.  Since the collision, DJ LeMahieu, Ben Rice, Oswaldo Cabrera, Jake Bauers and J.D. Davis had chances (as did Jon Berti in the ’24 postseason).  None ran with the job, and after the Yankees declined Rizzo’s option, they will be on the hunt to fix what has been a surprising problem.  The Juan Soto sweepstakes will have to be settled before the Yankees can act, and where Soto ends up will dictate just about every significant decision the Yankees make this winter.  If they have an extra $600 million-$700 million in the budget, they could more freely splurge at first base.  When they search for first base help, free agents will include:  The longtime Mets slugger has blasted 226 home runs since debuting in 2019 — second only to Aaron Judge.  He will turn 30 next month, is proven both in New York and big moments, and just about never leaves the field.  Alonso, though, is coming off the worst statistical season of his career (.788 OPS) and will be looking for the largest and longest pact of the free agents who play first.  He is a righty slugger, and the Yankees likely would prefer a lefty behind Aaron Judge.  He is a playable but not strong defensive first baseman.  The longtime Diamondback has won three straight Gold Gloves and is among the more underrated players in MLB. He owns an .813 OPS over his past three seasons and averaged nearly 32 homers per year in the span.  Walker is a righty swinger, will be expensive and turning 34 in March, with concerns about how much longer he can keep playing at this level.

He likely will be affordable on a short-term pact after hitting 23 home runs with a .749 OPS with Minnesota, his switch-hitting bat still a weapon.  But for how long? Santana will be 39 in April, his numbers have slid and the Yankees have fielded too many aging sluggers.  Speaking of aging sluggers, the seven-time All-Star is on the downslope of his career but still a threat, hitting 22 home runs with a .716 OPS last season.  As recently as 2022, he was the National League MVP.  Yet, Goldschmidt is 37 and coming off the worst season of his career (though he was much stronger in the second half than first).  His bat looked better in October. He could be an affordable option if the Yankees land Soto and seek bargains.  Or they could seek trade help:  The Giants reportedly want to cut salary, and the first baseman/right fielder is due around $5 million in arbitration.  The 30-year-old Wade, a lefty swinger, is not much of a power threat but owns a .376 on-base percentage over the past two seasons and could be the Yankees leadoff hitter.  The corner infielder is due $10 million for next season, which is a price point that the Rays often offload.  Diaz, a 33-year-old righty swinger, received MVP votes in ’22 and ’23, but is coming off a down season (.755 OPS).  The Rangers also reportedly may trim payroll, and they are set to pay Lowe around $10 million-$11 million in arbitration.  The 29-year-old has been solid in four seasons with Texas, with whom he has posted a .791 OPS while averaging just under 20 homers per season.  The Guardians would need to pay the lefty first baseman/outfielder around $12 million, which is a lot for Cleveland — a club that also has top prospect Kyle Manzardo at first base.  The 27-year-old Naylor was an All-Star last season, when he hit a career-best 31 homers while posting a .776 OPS.  Naylor became a Yankees enemy in 2022, when he did a “rock-the-baby” celebration following a home run in the ALDS and could be seen on camera calling Gerrit Cole “my little f–king son.”  Or they could look internally:  He has played just 50 major league games and brings a disciplined approach the Yankees like.  He is due $30M over the next two seasons  His bat showed promise at the end of last season."

It was the third time the Lady Broncos forfeited against the Spartans this season, also having forfeited their two regular-season matches. The forfeits have come amid SJSU rostering transgender player Blaire Fleming, who has become one of the conference’s top players. Those against transgender athletes in biological girls sports have cited unfair advantages for said athletes and those teams. However, a columnist for USA Today called those who refuse to play trans athletes the “real threat.” “For all the shrieking there is about transgender women athletes, it’s the cisgender women pushing the forfeits who cost their fellow athletes opportunities to play and saddled their teams with losses,” Nancy Armour posted in a column headlined “Opinion: Ruling in San Jose State volleyball case reveals farce of transgender hysteria.”  “It’s those women, not the San Jose State player, who are the real threat.” While her X account is private, Armour still received lots of flak for her take online. “Is your brain really this broken,” Clay Travis posted. “Women standing up for WOMEN isn’t hysteria @USATODAY it’s courageous and about time,” wrote another user. Added another, “Nancy Armour is a misogynist and hates women. I’m proud of my alma meter (sic) for not backing down even though it ends their season. All of the women of Boise State’s program should hold their heads high. I hope my daughter grows up to have your courage.” Boise State, Wyoming, Utah State and Nevada were among the conference teams to cancel games against the Spartans as a result of Fleming’s presence on the team. They were aware the forfeiture would result in a loss on their records, which ultimately helped SJSU secure its high seed.  Earlier this week, federal Judge Kato Crews in Colorado, appointed by President Biden in January, denied a motion for injunctive relief in a lawsuit by college volleyball players against the conference in efforts to have Fleming not play in the tournament and their forfeit losses rescinded. A dozen women jointly filed the suit against the Mountain West and its commissioner, alleging violations of Title IX and their First Amendment rights. Among the women are SJSU co-volleyball captain Brooke Slusser and two former Spartans as well as athletes from other Mountain West schools.  Fox News’ Scott Thompson contributed to this report."

After the Bears’ latest loss that concluded in a final series of disastrous seconds to lose to the Lions 23-20 for their sixth straight loss and eighth of the season, fans and the sports world are calling for the head coach’s axing.  The CBS broadcasters couldn’t get past Eberflus’ horrendous clock management by finishing the game with a time out in his pocket.  “This is unacceptable from the head-coach position,” Matt Ryan said on the postgame broadcast. “This is your responsibility is to not panic in critical situations and give your team the best opportunity to win games. That’s a massive, massive fail by Matt Eberflus.” “The players are not without fault. They made mistakes with those penalties,” Nate Burleson added. “But on the coaching side, this was a time management collapse. I don’t want to call for anyone’s job, but these are the type of late-game decisions — or lack thereof — that got people fired.” Bill Cowher was also quick to note that this is not Eberflus’ first late-game flop, and with 36 seconds left on the clock after quarterback Caleb Williams was sacked, he failed to call a timeout to regroup his offense.  “You have a 3rd-and-26, run another play, get in field goal range, you have plenty of time to run your field goal unit out,” Cowher said.  Many sports heads took to X to share their opinions as well after the detrimental loss.  “Eberflus is my favorite bad coach – they need to extend him for 2 years he’s so entertaining,” the Ringer founder Bill Simmons wrote on X.  “Matt Eberflus just made a Thanksgiving mistake he may never recover from,” RGIII wrote on X. “YOU CAN’T END THAT GAME WITH A TIMEOUT IN HAND. He’s coaching like he is on the hot seat, feeling the pressure and has been lost in the biggest moments all year. The Bears are repeating the cycle.” Mike Greenberg added: “There is absolutely no excuse for an #NFL coach to allow that to happen. Hell, there is no excuse for a high school coach. With a timeout in his pocket. Inexcusable. In a season filled with coaching blunders, this was a new low.” Eberflus is in his third season in Chicago and has yet to lead the team to a winning season. In his first year under the helm, the Bears went 3-14 with Justin Fields under center and not much improved in the following year’s 7-10 season.  They went on to pick Williams with the No.1 overall pick of the 2024 Draft, but the Bears have yet to find a groove in their 4-8 season. Prior to Chicago, Eberflus was the defensive coordinator for the Colts for four seasons, which included two playoff appearances. “Eberflus not realizing they didn’t have a timeout needs to be the final moment of his coaching career with the Bears,” Nick Wright of “First Things First” posted."

The Bears let nearly half a minute tick off after Caleb Williams was sacked with 33 seconds left in the game and a time out in their pocket in what would be a 23-20 loss to the Lions. By the time Williams hiked the ball with around five seconds left at the Lions’ 41-yard-line, a long incomplete pass would be the final play of the game. In the CBS booth, Jim Nantz and Tony Romo chided Chicago for their lack of urgency in what was an impressive comeback from a 16-0 halftime deficit to the now 11-1 Lions.  “They better hurry, oh no, this is a disaster in the making here,” Nantz said in agony on the CBS broadcast. “You’re going to have to do something with it, it comes down to this play. Incomplete. And the game is over. Completely botched at the end by the Bears.” “I can’t believe they didn’t take a timeout,” Romo added. Williams rallied the Bears with three second-half touchdowns and had driven them into field goal range to possibly tie the game on a drive that started at their own 1. Meanwhile, Lions quarterback Jared Goff struggled in the game’s final two quarters, putting up just seven points after the Detroit offense was in total control in the first half. Goff finished the game with 221 yards and two touchdown passes; both to tight end Matt LaPorta. The Bears fired offensive coordinator Shane Waldron three weeks ago, which has led to improvements behind interim OC Thomas Brown but not any wins. Their offense still needs to work while Williams, the No. 1 pick in the draft, is under siege behind a bad struggling line.  Williams has been sacked an NFL-worst 54 times. Eberflus has been under fire for Chicago as the team has lost six straight games with one coming on a Hail Mary and another on a blocked field goal."

Captioning the post, “Vegas for 24 hrs!” Nicolette Dellanno — who announced her engagement to Wilson over the summer — can be seen hanging out with Izzy Nix, the wife of rookie starting quarterback Bo Nix, and Kennedy Stidham, who is married to backup QB Jarrett Stidham, among others. The ladies dined at Catch restaurant the night before Sunday’s contest at Allegiant Stadium. Nix, the Broncos’ 12th overall pick in this year’s NFL draft, went 25-for-42 against the Raiders, throwing for 273 yards and two touchdowns as Denver improved to 7-5 on the season. Just like Nix and Izzy, this is Wilson and Dellanno’s first season in Denver. Wilson, the second overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, spent the first three years of his career with the Jets. He had two rocky seasons as the starter before Gang Green brought in Aaron Rodgers ahead of the 2023 season. Last year was meant to be a reset for the former BYU product, but when Rodgers tore his Achilles just four plays into the season, Wilson was thrust back into the starting role. Wilson finished his final year in New York by throwing for eight touchdowns and seven interceptions through 12 games. He was traded to the Broncos in April. “I was grateful for my experiences there and the guys. I miss the guys out there and everything too. But at the same time, a fresh start is good. I’m excited to attack a new challenge,” Wilson said of the trade in May. He is third on the quarterback depth chart. The Broncos are currently the seventh seed in the AFC playoff race and host the Browns (3-8) on Sunday. Wilson and Dellanno were first linked in 2022 when they were spotted at a Yankees game together."

In a battle between two of the NFL’s better offenses, the Dolphins come into Thanksgiving at 5-6 after looking like a shell of their explosive selves without quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. Still, Miami is on the outside looking in at a playoff spot and every game is a near must-win.  The Dolphins travel to the frozen tundra as three-point underdogs for this prime-time matchup. Have we said it is going to be cold? Tagovailoa is 1-3 straight-up and 0-4 against the spread when temperatures dip below 40 degrees, according to BetMGM.  The Dolphins understandably have taken some money here given their strong play in recent weeks, having torched the Patriots, 34-15, last time out. It would be fine to take the Dolphins if the Packers’ run defense had holes, but they’re a solid run unit ranking ninth-best in yards per carry allowed (4.2 YPC).  Green Bay’s passing defense is also among the better units, ranking 11th in pass defense, according to defense adjusted value over average (DVOA).  Meanwhile Miami can’t stop the run, ranking 26th in DVOA.  Packers coach Matt LaFleur is an artist when it comes to designing run plays, and Josh Jacobs is such a bruiser that it is hard to see Mike McDaniel having this team ready to steal one on the road in hostile territory.

Some of the Bears and Lions WAGs shared their journey to kickoff before before the Bears-Lions Thanksgiving game at Ford Field in Detroit.  Christen Harper, who tied the knot with Lions quarterback Jared Goff in June, rocked an oversized varsity jacket with vintage Lions patches, as seen in a mirror selfie she posted to her Instagram Story on Thursday.    “Happy Thanksgiving!!!!! & go Lions!” Harper, a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model, wrote.  Simone Biles, who’s married to Bears safety Jonathan Owens, took a private plane by Fly Exclusive to the holiday showdown. The Team USA gymnast — who secured four medals, including three gold at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris — and Torries Brown, the girlfriend of Chicago tight end Marcedes Lewis, toasted mimosas while aboard a private jet, as seen in a snapshot Biles shared on her Instagram Story.  “Otw to Detroit for some Thanksgiving football,” Biles, 27, wrote, including a bunch of football emojis. The superstar gymnast, who recently debuted a stunning bob haircut, at the Country Music Association Awards last week, looked beautiful on the sidelines — this time sporting longer hair.  Biles rocked a white beanie and a vintage Bears windbreaker jacket — and she carried a clear stadium bag with Owens’ name and number on it. Biles and Harper are staples on the sidelines during the NFL season.  Goff and Owens are also supportive of their better halves, respectively.  In an interview with The Post in July, Owens explained how important showing up for each other is during their busy schedules. “When it comes from traveling to different events or coming to my football games, it makes [us] want to go out there and harder or you want to improve just because you know that your family is there supporting you,” Owens said. “That’s just one thing that we always make sure to do with each other, because you do understand what each other goes through, and you know how hard it is when you’re a professional athlete.  “It’s been amazing… I wouldn’t want to do it any other way than with my wife, because we both understand each other and support each other fully.” The Bears granted Owens excused absences during training camp in order to support Biles in Paris during her third trip to the Olympics. In a separate interview with The Post, Goff gushed over seeing Harper in her element as a model and philanthropist. “It’s been fun to see her thrive in that now,” Goff said. “It was outside of her comfort zone when she initially applied for it and did the swim search, and then was chosen. She was a rookie of the year. “It’s been fun and really cool to see her become comfortable on that platform and grow her voice in that way. I know she’s got a lot of things that she wants to do and help people — and she’s very passionate about animals, so helping animals, and all that. All of this has been helpful for that larger mission.”"

Perez, who was a guest commentator for Paul vs. Tyson on Netflix, admitted that Paul has done a lot for boxing as a whole, but everything else that comes with him is a bit unsettling.  “It’s complicated, my feelings in regard to Jake Paul,” Perez said on the “Dan LeBatard Show.”  “Because I am so grateful for him for getting Amanda Serrano paid. I mean, really, that woman has been getting punched in the face for what, 16 years? And didn’t get a big payday until he came around? That’s really sad.  “In regards to him as a boxer, he has gotten better; he’s taken it seriously. But, yeah. You know…Yeah,” Perez said while laughing ensued by her and the show hosts.  Serrano, largely considered one of the best female boxers of all time, had said she fought world title fights for as little as $4,000-$5,000. After signing with Paul’s promotion company, Most Valuable Promotions, she has had multiple seven figure paydays. She claimed to have made more than her opponent, Katie Taylor, to fight on the Paul-Tyson undercard. Taylor, who won the thrilling fight via a controversial decision, disclosed that she made $6.1 million to fight Serrano as the co-main event of the massive fight card. The two had previously fought to a decision which Taylor won at Madison Square Garden in April, 2022. Paul’s win over Tyson drew an incredible audience to the streaming platform, but those who did tune in saw little action — particularly in the closing rounds.  Paul is undoubtedly the biggest face in boxing right now, but there’s something Perez didn’t love that the she couldn’t quite put her finger on.  Paul has mostly made a career off boxing MMA fighters who are past their prime, including 37-year-old wrestling savant Ben Askren, 39-year-old ex-champion Tyron Woodley, 47-year-old former striking connoisseur Anderson Silva and 38-year-old fan favorite Nate Diaz.  The Problem Child, 11-1, followed with a spectacle of a match against a 58-year-old Tyson, who could barely stand by the end of the fight.  The fight’s lack of action led some to believe the fight was rigged, which got the attention of Paul’s team.  MVP released a scathing statement about the “baseless claims” that the competition wasn’t fought in good faith.  Netflix claims 108 million people watched Paul fight Tyson. There are many concerns since the conclusion of Paul-Tyson, including when the Youtuber-turned-boxer told reporters that he was not trying to knock out the legend in the fight; with at least one lawyer speculating that a class action lawsuit could soon come surrounding the betting on the fight."

Appearing on “The Herd with Colin Cowherd” Wednesday, Johnson  — who coached the storied franchise from 1989 through 1993 and won two Super Bowls — was asked about what he would do with the Cowboys as they enter a critical offseason. Johnson torched the team’s decision to sign quarterback Dak Prescott to a four-year, $240 million extension.  “Well, first of all, they’re so financially strapped with some of these contracts. First of all, I would have never given Prescott a new contract,” Johnson said, as transcribed by Larry Brown Sports. “I’d let him play it out. He’s the highest-paid player in the league. He’s not the best player in the league. He wasn’t gonna go anywhere, if they had gone to the Super Bowl with him, hey, he wasn’t gonna go anywhere, pay him whatever. If he struggled in the playoffs, then you negotiate. Or if he got hurt, you save money. But they’re so financially strapped right now, I don’t know what they do.” Prescott, who has been under center in Dallas since 2016, agreed to a monster extension just hours before Dallas kicked off the season against Cleveland. He was entering the final year of a four-year, $160 million deal signed in 2021. Although that game was a highlight – a 33-17 road win with Prescott throwing one touchdown and zero interceptions — the Cowboys season quickly spiraled. Dallas went on a five-game skid that started in mid-October and ended last Sunday with a 34-26 victory over the Commanders. That win was guided by backup quarterback Cooper Rush, now starting for the Cowboys after Prescott suffered a hamstring injury in a Week 9 loss to the Falcons. He opted to undergo season-ending surgery. Before the injury, Prescott had thrown 11 touchdowns and eight interceptions through eight contests. In addition to Prescott, Dallas awarded star wide receiver CeeDee Lamb a four-year, $136 million extension in August following an offseason holdout. However, the Cowboys did not extend fifth-year coach Mike McCarthy, who is coaching on an expiring deal, with questions looming about his future in Dallas after the season. Although owner Jerry Jones hasn’t dumped water on the suggestion of a McCarthy extension, it’s something Johnson called attention to Wednesday. “They talk about changing coaching, I don’t know if changing coaches is going to help them cause Mike McCarthy is a good football coach. I don’t know if that new coach coming in can solve the problem,” he said. Johnson is far from the only person who has criticized Jones and the Cowboys this season, with Dallas’ legendary quarterback, Troy Aikman, shredding the team’s “lazy” receivers after an embarrassing loss in October. That same month, when making his weekly appearance on 105.3 The Fan in Dallas, Jones seemingly threatened to have the radio hosts fired upon fielding questions over the team’s offseason approach. Dallas enters Thursday’s NFC East clash against the 2-9 Giants at 4-7. Kickoff is at 4:30 p.m. in Arlington."

With about 7:15 left in the second quarter, Jalen Brunson’s defender, Quentin Grimes, was screened by Karl-Anthony Towns. The screen was weak, almost nonexistent, but Grimes still switched to defend Towns as Maxi Kleber took care of Brunson on the ball. The Knicks (10-8), naturally and predictably, hunted the size mismatch. Towns received a pass at the top of the key and squared up against the much smaller Grimes, who is an apt defender and deceptively strong. Towns laboriously backed him down, using three dribbles to get to the paint before he was quickly met by a double-team. The hook shot didn’t even touch the rim. About 30 seconds later, the same mismatch developed after a switch. Hart threw the ball into the post to Towns, who backed down too forcefully on Grimes and was whistled for a charge. Turnover. The Knicks, in that moment, failed to score on six straight possessions. They followed up their lowest-scoring quarter in the first with their lowest scoring half. They were losing by 24. “We’re giving teams the game plan,” Hart explained after the 129-114 defeat Wednesday. It wasn’t the first time Hart voiced this concern. For all the scoring juice the Knicks have squeezed out this season, they’ve demonstrated a fairly consistent weakness to “teams that switch, teams that junk the game up,” said Hart, noting that the Rockets and Celtics also punished the Knicks with this strategy. He predicted the Hornets, who the Knicks face on Black Friday afternoon, will do the same under rookie head coach Charles Lee, a former Celtics assistant. Hart, in turn, offered two solutions: Either use himself more often in the pick-and-rolls, which would alter the rotations and defenders who switch on the screener; or, more simply, attack the switches with more pace. “We have to adjust accordingly, whether that’s putting me in the actions and still getting the [center involved] and doing that. Or playing faster, playing with more thrust,” Hart said. “And causing teams to mess up on switches. We have a talented team. Guys who can shoot the ball. So when we’re playing slow, we’re easy to guard. Because we’re going against set defenses.” To be clear, the switching wasn’t the only reason the Knicks were locked down in the first half against the Mavericks. They shot poorly across the board, including Hart, who flubbed a couple shots near the rim and tossed a one-armed turnover like he was Daniel Jones in the red zone. But the Mavericks were also very comfortable throwing their defenders all over the court. There was little regard for assignments. “There’s a new challenge every day,” Towns said. “I can guarantee you, [Mavericks coach] Jason Kidd’s a hell of a coach. He looked at the game and found ways he could play against us. He did a great job. They were ready.” Hart recognized the problem. The Knicks devolved into an inefficient half-court set, rather than the motion offense that carried the Knicks to 145 points on 45 assists in a Denver win just two nights prior.

When teams switch, we got to play faster,” Hart said. “We got to put them in a position to make mistakes off ball, off screening, miscommunication, those kind of things. “When we’re playing slow, know they’re switching and we just try to find a mismatch. And then it doesn’t matter if we have a mismatch when you’re going into a set defense behind. So we got to play faster, make them make mistakes, and capitalize that way.” Brunson agreed. “Obviously they were switching,” said the point guard. “When it comes to switching you probably need to attack it a little quicker. But it’s a mixture of the ball not going in and getting good looks and then them playing good defense as well at times. It honestly shouldn’t happen the way it happened.” Left unsaid, but equally important, was the Mavericks own a top-10 rated defense (ranked 7th) with versatility throughout the lineup, especially when Luka Doncic is out injured. The same is true for the Celtics (8th) and Rockets (2nd). The Hornets, on the other hand, are ranked 19th. So even if Charlotte (6-12) attempts to exploit a Knicks weakness, it hasn’t demonstrated the commitment or ability to make it work. There are only so many of Houston’s Dillon Brooks in the NBA, the type of defender who can handle both Brunson and Towns. But the Knicks will have to face those teams during a long season or, more importantly, in the playoffs. It’s another thing to figure out."

The sticks include those used by Alex Ovechkin, Peter Forsberg, Patrick Kane, John Tavares, Vladimir Tarasenko and Tukka Rask.  There’s also a puck signed by the late Johnny Gaudreau and it’s that item that was part of what compelled the brothers to sell the sticks.  Gaudreau, a member of the Columbus Blue Jackets, and his brother Matthew were killed while riding their bicycles in Salem County, NJ on August 29.  That same week, Dallas police officer Darron Burks was shot and killed while sitting in his patrol car.  A rookie officer in his first year on the force, Burks had just left his job as a high school math teacher and coach to join the force.  The Rice brothers will donate all proceeds from their items to the Assist the Officer Foundation, which is helping the Burks family.   “The boys went through the hockey stick collection they built, looking for the Johnny Gaudreau stick they knew they had,” recalled their father, Barrie Grice. “Sure enough, they found it, and decided they wanted to sell it to raise money for the police officer, using Johnny and Matthew’s spirits to help another, uniting tragedies in kindness. Brothers honoring brothers.” According to Heritage, “While the acquisition of each of the different items has a unique story behind it, one stick has meant more to the Grice Brothers than any other. When Blake was born, he spent his first month in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) due to his extremely premature birth. During that time, Austin attended a L.A. Kings/Colorado Avalanche game where he was given an autographed, game-used stick from Kings center Anze Kopitar.” Barrie Grice says that stick, too, went into the auction after Blake and Austin decided it was more important to support the charity.  “When Blake was talking to Austin about it on the phone, he asked his brother if he was sure he wanted to give that stick up. Austin responded, ‘There are more important things than a hockey stick, Blake. Like with your birth, the main thing is you are OK and you are here to be my brother. Those families lost people forever. It’s fine. Let’s donate that one, too.” The online auction runs through Dec. 7. Rich is the editor and founder of Sports Collectors Daily.

Victor Wembanyama led the way, while secondary names like Amen and Ausar Thompson, Brandon Miller and Scoot Henderson headlined the second tier of rookies. The 2024-25 class is still emerging but one player has Lakers fans–and their superstar–excited.  Dalton Knecht rookie cards will definitely be worth watching in the years to come. Knecht, the 17th overall pick in the 2024 NBA Draft, is separating himself from the crowd. The 6’6″ guard/forward is averaging just over 11 points per game as of Nov. 23, but his recent string of performances suggests Knecht could be climbing into stardom soon enough.  Knecht followed up a 27-point game on Nov. 16 at New Orleans with a 37-point output at home against the Jazz. In that game he drained 9 threes while helping lead the Lakers to a 6-point victory. In a postgame interview, LeBron James said he has no idea how Knecht fell to the Lakers at 17. He added that he was grateful Knecht was on the team and that he knew exactly what the Lakers were getting. Collectors are grateful as well. 76ers rookie Jared McCain is near the top of the well-performing rookies list so far, but Knecht is neck-and-neck with him.  2024-25 NBA trading card products will make their way to market soon enough but here are 5 of Knecht’s earliest cards. 2023-24 Bowman U NOW  
Knecht had a pair of Bowman U NOW cards while he was a Tennessee Volunteer. Bowman U Now is the collegiate version of Topps NOW. Cards are only available for 24 hours on the Topps website and lucky collectors who ordered a card had a random chance at receiving a numbered parallel. The total print run of the shooting picture (#30 in the series) is 919 while the print run of the dunking card (#60) is 999. The base versions aren’t actually serial numbered, but these cards will also be some of his most rare, considering less than 1,000 were made of each. Ninety numbered parallels, including a Gold 1/1, are part of those print runs. 2023-24 Bowman U Chrome #48  The Bowman U Chrome brand has been a popular addition to the Topps lineup in the last few years. For collectors who love prospecting outside of baseball, collegiate basketball and football athletes now have true Bowman autographs before they make the pros. There are numerous parallel versions on the base card along with the autographed versions. Base non-auto versions of this card are selling for $5-$10 but a PSA 10 Yellow Refractor Auto numbered to 75 sold for $1,275 on November 21. 2023-24 Bowman U Chrome Sapphire  Chrome, but make it Sapphire. Collectors love the gleaming blue Sapphire version of nearly every chrome product, so it should come as no shock that 2023-24 Bowman U Chrome also has a Sapphire release. Knecht does not have any autographs in this set, but there is still a full parallel rainbow that can be put together. A PSA 10 sold for $100 on November 23 while a raw Gold Sapphire Refractor parallel sold for $158.50 on November 23. Standard base versions have been bringing $30 and more. 2023-24 Bowman U Best 
Initially, 2023-24 Bowman U Best did not release to the same fanfare as its Chrome counterpart, but the design of the product is so striking and different that it will standout it any collection. Knecht has base cards and autographs here with parallel autographs numbered to /125 and lower. The pictured raw Refractor Auto /125 sold for a whopping $450 on November 22. 2024 Panini Instant Draft Night 
For now, Panini still has the NBA licensing rights, making this 2024 Panini Instant Draft Night card Knecht’s first true NBA rookie card. While he isn’t wearing a Lakers jersey, he is sporting a Lakers hat and the card itself has the Lakers logo on it.  The print-on-demand cards are only available for a short time and the total print run for Knecht’s card is just 512. There were also several different numbered parallels that collectors could buy for a higher price via Panini and those who did are feeling pretty good right now. Collectors on eBay are scooping these up as they realize that Knecht’s first true rookie card is in fairly short supply.   Raw versions of the base card have been selling in the $150 range while a Jungle parallel /25 sold for $511 on November 21.  Since Knecht has exploded on the scene, Panini has also produced some official Knecht rookie cards via Instant including one from his NBA debut.  Brendan Cross is a freelance journalist with a degree from San Jose State.

While this is undoubtedly not an  all-encompassing list, here are some sales we know are happening across the landscape.  Happy hunting. eBay   Some eBay sellers have discounted items this week. They can be found on the Deals page. Just type something into the search box (like Topps, Panini, Upper Deck or whatever you’re looking for) and you’ll get the results of what’s been marked down. SportsMemorabilia.com and Fanatics Fanatics’ main website, SportsMemorabilia.com and Steiner Sports all fall under the Fanatics umbrella now and all will be offering discounts on autographed items and other collectibles.   A quick check at SportsMemorabilia.com showed autographs from Shaq, Jayson Tatum, Nolan Ryan, Don Mattingly, Chipper Jones, Henrik Lundqvist, Auston Matthews and numerous other stars discounted quite a bit as well. This signed, time lapse photo of Carlton Fisk’s famous 1975 World Series game-winning homer is less than $65.  If you’re an Eagles fan–or a football fan in general–this unsigned photo of Saquon Barkley is about as cool as it gets for a very low cost.  Cards are typically excluded from the sale but it’s possible certain card products will be discounted. It’s best just to start browsing. Fanatics, of course, will have mountains of team gear, too, where the discount will apply. The company’s offers will change by the day for those types of items, including a one-time $50 discount for new customers. If you’re all about baseball, MLBShop is another option. Card Companies Topps’ Holiday sale is open now.  The company offers discounts on certain items, including current and recent unopened boxes like Holiday Baseball, supplies and other items. There isn’t a ton of variety but they do sometimes sell out quickly so it’s best to at least check out the deals ASAP. Upper Deck is touting its Black Friday deals on cards and items from the UDA store. We suspect Panini America will also have some special deals on their website. Online retailers Black Friday/Cyber Monday is a big one for the big online retailers of trading card boxes.  Steel City Collectibles, Blowout Cards, Dave & Adam’s and other big sellers usually offer ongoing specials.  Steel City has a page devoted to their specials.  Another big seller, Baseball Card Exchange, will roll out its Black Friday specials (5-10% off depending on the size of an order) at one minute past midnight on Thursday night/Friday. Amazon/Walmart  Shopping for card deals on Amazon can be a little frustrating as the site isn’t really well organized but there are quite a few Black Friday deal offers for supplies–everything from penny sleeves to top loaders, graded card carrying cases, display stands for single cards and storage boxes. You can start here and search around for what you’re looking for. They do have a few unopened boxes of recent product in their Black Friday section. While prices may not always be better than eBay, shipping is often free, which can sometimes more than make up for it. Among them:  2024 Donruss Elite Football  2024 Panini Prestige Football 2024 Topps Series 2 (hanger) 2024 Topps Update (hanger) 2023 Topps Series 2 (blaster) 2023-24 Topps UEFA Club Competitions (blaster) Walmart has a page devoted to Black Friday week deals on trading cards.  We can’t vouch for how great they are but there are many. COMC  The consignment seller accounts at COMC have had the option to create sales for Black Friday and Cyber Monday and many have taken advantage. You can find countless vintage and modern single cards, some discounted for the seven-day period.  The site sees a tremendous amount of traffic during this period.

Sports Collectors Daily,How the 1994-95 NHL Lockout Spelled More Trouble for The Hobby,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/how-the-1994-95-nhl-lockout-spelled-more-trouble-for-the-hobby/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 01:40:06 +0000","Thirty years ago, a hobby already trying to stay alive due to the baseball strike had to face an NHL lockout to start the 1994-95 season.","November 25, 2024 By Jeff Morris  While 1994 in the sports card industry will always be linked to the Major League Baseball players’ strike that shut down the season and hastened the unraveling of what had been a booming market, there was another labor stoppage that gave the hobby a double whammy. The NHL locked out its players for the start of the 1994 season. The players had gone to training camp and there were even some pre-season games played. But on October 1, the players were locked out. They had played the entire previous season without a deal in place. The lockout lasted until the sides finally settled on Jan. 11, saving what would be a 48-game season and playoffs that would run deeper into the summer than ever before. The key issues involved salary cap and luxury tax proposals. The league wanted a mechanism in place that would benefit the small market teams and add parity. The players’ union was not on board with the plan. Meanwhile, the collectibles business took a second hard hit on the heels of the already devastating baseball strike. Series 1 trading card products rolled out on time, but the demand was nowhere near at the level it had been in the previous two years. While there is a monopoly with Upper Deck and the NHL today, the 1994 hockey card market was the wild west. The number of brands at that time was staggering compared to what is being released today. Joining Upper Deck in the market were Pinnacle, Fleer, Topps, O-Pee-Chee and Donruss/Leaf. Pro Set was gone but the Parkhurst name was being shopped around and eventually picked up by Upper Deck. Action Packed had produced some fringe items and was knocking at the door for an NHL license. There were food issues and other sets, too.  Kraft was producing a food promotion set for Kraft and Jell-O products in Canada. Upper Deck was producing a McDonald’s set in Canada, which is the license that Tim Hortons has now. They also produced an NHLPA-licensed set called Be A Player, which included an autograph in every pack. Another big seller for a brief time that year was a set of NHL POGs from the World POG Federation. Panini was producing an NHL sticker book and stickers which sold well in Canada and Europe but did not do as well in the United States, a market that had not warmed up to stickers yet. There was also a Kitchener, Ontario-based company called Slapshot that produced junior hockey cards, as well as prospect sets from Signature Rookies and Classic. One promoter told the Calgary Herald in November of 1994 that the work stoppages “have devastated an already depressed business.”  In Alberta, hockey accounted for about 80% of store sales. At the time of the hockey lockout, I was the editor of Canadian Sportscard Collector and was also contracted to write some card backs. I went into a lot of shops and attended a lot of shows. I remember one shop owner closing his doors in the Ottawa area that year. He said he had to invest so much money into hockey and baseball to carry at least a few boxes of every product that he couldn’t afford the inventory needed to compete. He also said that he didn’t have the counter space to carry every item he wanted to. Another shop in Michigan that I visited had the same problem. Hockey was a huge seller in his shop, and he struggled to stock hockey and baseball products. Plus, he carried every NFL product and NBA product, as the Lions and Pistons were both popular at the time and driving sales. Because I was based in the Niagara area at that time, I also frequented shops and shows in the Buffalo area. They were also hit hard, but they had the popularity of the Bills to help them weather the storm. Before the lockout, there were a number of monthly shows at small hotels and community centers on both sides of the border that were put on hold and never came back. The decline in interest in the hockey card market was noticeable was at a pair of big shows. The October Montreal show saw attendance take a hit. The hardcore vintage and diehard collectors were there, and the autograph list of retired Montreal Canadiens and local stars who had played for other teams was good.  However, the vibe of the show and the feeling on the floor was downright depressing. First of all, the baseball strike hit Montreal harder than any other city and market. It ripped out the potential for a World Series from what was the best and hottest team in baseball. Olympic Stadium, at the same Olympic Park complex, stood somewhat-less-than-majestically behind the Maurice Richard Arena, where the show took place. Just seeing the stadium was a stark reminder that what had once been one of the best sports cities in North America had, at that time, no professional sports. The Canadiens were locked out. The Expos were on strike. The Alouettes had folded and would not return for a couple years, leaving only memories of Johnny Rodgers, Jimmy Jones, Tom Cousineau, Junior Ah You, and other Montreal football legends.  The city and its collectors had a blanket of depression thrown over them. It was a far cry from the same show from the previous year, when the Canadiens were the defending Stanley Cup champions, Patrick Roy was the most celebrated hero of the generation, and the excitement around the Expos was gaining momentum and was bringing the city back to the Gary Carter-Andre Dawson-Tim Raines era. The dealers in 1994 were there on the show floor with little to no crowds at their tables. Stacks of hockey and baseball wax boxes gathered dust. The autograph lineups drew enthusiastic collectors and fans, but the turnout was smaller than usual. That show was almost like a turning point in the city and in the entire province of Quebec. The sports card market would not be the same for about the next quarter century. Like in every other city, it wasn’t until COVID that things really blossomed into what it had been before 1994. The next big show that year was the Sport Card and Memorabilia Expo in Toronto. It was more of the same, yet even more pronounced. There was still excitement around the Maple Leafs, who in 1993 made their best Stanley Cup playoff run since winning their last Stanley Cup in 1967. But that excitement was temporarily deflated. The Blue Jays had been drawing four million fans per year and had won back-to-back World Series. They would not have made the post-season that year, as the New York Yankees were running away with the division and the wild card was a long shot. But there was still a buzz about the National League Expos, as all baseball fans in Canada wanted the World Series to stay in Canada. There were even conspiracy theories floating around in Canada that Bud Selig and Donald Fehr wanted the season cancelled because it would be better for baseball to lose a World Series than have a third straight in Canada. It wasn’t the first ridiculous sports conspiracy theory, and it was certainly not the last. The attendance at the 1994 Toronto show was a little better than half of what it had been in years past. Like in Montreal, the hardcore collectors were there with their want lists. Sales of new wax boxes were flat, but stronger than they were in Montreal. The number of collectors who travelled to Toronto from the United States, most notably from Buffalo, Boston and Detroit, was way down. The corporate booths were still there, but on a much smaller scale. About 30 miles away along the QEW, Hamilton was hosting the “4-on-4 Challenge”. It was a four-team tournament of four-on-four hockey featuring the locked out stars. Team Ontario, Team Quebec, Team Western Canada and Team USA played a three-day tournament on the same weekend as the Expo. Patrick Roy, Luc Robitaille, Brett Hull, Doug Gilmour, Joe Sakic and a number of top NHL stars took part in the tournament. The teams wore NHLPA logo uniforms. The tournament raised more than a half million dollars for Ronald McDonald Children’s Charities of Canada and minor hockey associations throughout the country. Wayne Gretzky, meanwhile, was organizing a barnstorming tour of Europe. He joined forces with IMG to create the Ninety-Nine All-Stars Team which spent the first two weeks of December touring Norway, Finland, Sweden and Germany. The 4-on-4 Challenge and the Ninety-Nine All-Stars also found their way onto hockey cards. The Be A Player brand, which started as an NHLPA project with Upper Deck, featured many photos from the tournament. Also included in the 1994-95 Be A Player set was a 19-card insert set called Wayne Gretzky’s 99 All-Stars. The set features photography from the December, 1994 games. Meanwhile at Canadian Sportscard Collector magazine, it seemed like there was a continual daily discussion with my co-worker and close friend Baron Bedeksy about the situation. Who are we going to put on the cover? Our 50th issue fell in November, 1994. We needed to come up with something a little bit different for the issue that would be for sale at the Expo, which was the biggest opportunity of the year to showcase our magazine. At that time, the 1993 seven game semi-final series between the Leafs and the Los Angeles Kings was still talked about. It was one of the greatest NHL playoff series ever. One of the hockey card licensing rules was that fighting was not allowed on cards. In that series, Wendel Clark and Marty McSorley dropped the mitts and had one of the most epic fights in NHL playoff history. Bruce Bennett Studios sent us a great image from the fight. Maybe the card companies couldn’t put fighting on their cards, but we could put it on the cover. The headline was “Why you won’t see this on an NHL hockey card”. During the lockout, we also focused on some future stars. Brett Lindros, the younger brother of Eric Lindros, was a highly touted junior star with the Kingston Frontenacs of the Ontario Hockey League. He had been drafted ninth overall by the New York Islanders. Lindros was destroying junior hockey. In 26 games with Kingston, he had 24 goals and 23 assists for 47 points. Putting him on one of our covers was a slam dunk. Many said he would be just as good as his older brother. He joined the Islanders when the lockout ended. Concussions put an early end to his career. He played only 51 NHL games and scored just two goals. He was a player that many collectors had invested in. Injuries turned him into one of the biggest busts in hockey card history. Pinnacle already had Eric Lindros under contract as a spokesman. Brett spent more than half the 1993-94 season with the Canadian National Team before returning to Kingston. His time with the national team in Canada opened the door for a special insert card in 1993-94 Pinnacle of the Lindros brothers. The other junior cover we did was Jeff O’Neill. He was pictured in his Hartford Whalers jersey from the NHL Draft. The headline was “The Real Deal”. O’Neill had been drafted fifth overall and was in the midst of his second straight monster year with the Guelph Storm of the OHL. O’Neill had a very good NHL career with Hartford, Carolina and Toronto. He is a very popular media personality in Canada and especially in Toronto. He is a Toronto sports radio co-host and is a commentator on Leafs TV broadcasts. He is also on The Sports Network in Canada as a hockey analyst. He is usually on the TSN show as part of their panel of experts from his home office. Behind him on the wall on every episode, several times a week on national TV in Canada, is a framed cover of Canadian Sportscard Collector. I have never met Jeff O’Neill, though several years ago a friend of mine got him to sign a copy of the magazine for me. But seeing that issue on his wall, when I was the one who decided to put him on the cover, picked the photo, and came up with the headline, is pretty cool. I hope I get to meet him some day so I can tell him about what went into that piece of memorabilia on his wall. In January, 1995, the puck dropped and play resumed. The lockout was over. The hockey card market was easing into the new normal. Unfortunately, the lockout was the knockout punch to many sports card stores already staggering from the baseball strike.

Sports Collectors Daily,"With Canton Calling, a Look at Adam Vinatieri’s 1997 Pacific Philadelphia Rookie Card",https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/adam-vinatieris-1997-pacific-philadelphia-rookie-card/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 01:30:18 +0000","Only one company put New England's young kicker in its trading card set. Now, Adam Vinatieri's lone rookie card is one of the most sought after of the era.","November 25, 2024 By Horacio Ruiz  He’s the NFL’s all-time leading scorer and a four-time Super Bowl champion. If you’re looking to digest the Adam Vinatieri rookie card checklist, though, it won’t take long. A guy who could soon have a bust in Canton has just one, from a company that no longer exists.  That might tell you how long ago it was. If you think you can pick one up for a buck or two, though, you’re in for a surprise. In his first year of Hall of Fame eligibility, Vinatieri now has an opportunity to become the first ever first-ballot kicker to be inducted. Last week, Vinatieri was one of 25 Modern-Day semifinalists announced by the Pro Football Hall of Fame. While Vinatieri needs to go through two more rounds of cuts, he appears to be a favorite for this year’s class. He is the NFL’s all-time leading scorer, having passed the last kicker inducted into the Hall of Fame, Morten Andersen. Vinatieri was an integral part of the New England Patriots dynasty during the first half of the Tom Brady era, appearing in four Super Bowls and winning three. But Vinatieri made a name for himself by being clutch in high-pressure situations. He was a weapon his teammates could rely on in close games.  Embed from Getty Images During the 2001-02 AFC Divisional Playoffs, Vinatieri kicked the game-tying and game-winning field goals for the Patriots in blizzard-like conditions. Later in those playoffs, as New England marched towards its first title, Vinatieri kicked the game-winning field goal as time expired in Super Bowl XXXVI. Vinatieri would do it again two years later, kicking a game-winning 41-yard field goal in Super Bowl XXXVIII with four seconds remaining as the Patriots claimed their second title in three years. After ten years in New England, Vinatieri signed with the Indianapolis Colts, where he helped win Super Bowl XLI in his first season with the franchise. Embed from Getty Images Vinatieri retired after the 2019 season, and he remains the all-time leader in career field goals made, field goals attempted, consecutive field goals made, and most combined regular-season and postseason games played. There is a valid argument for calling him the greatest placekicker ever. For football card collectors, especially those who focus on Hall of Fame rookie cards, now might be a good time to look at Vinatieri. While Vinatieri started his NFL career as an undrafted free agent in 1996, his lone rookie card (no parallels) is found in the 1997 Pacific Philadelphia football set. Vinatieri is the key card in the set because it was released in May 1997 – too soon to feature the recent draft class and too late to issue any “true” rookie cards. It’s a humble start for a guy who turned out to be an all-time great but something the long defunct Pacific made a habit of doing (see Kurt Warner). Rodney Harrison, a teammate of Vinatieri’s in New England, also has a rookie card in the ’97 Pacific Philadelphia set. He was named a Hall of Fame semifinalist this year after being one of 15 finalists last year. Card #199 shows Vinatieri just after a kickoff, with the Patriots logo in the bottom right corner and his name in gold foil. The back of the card highlights his rookie campaign and highlights from his college career at South Dakota State.  The back discusses his college and pro career to that point.
 PSA has graded the Vinatieri rookie 370 times, with 95 Gem Mint 10s and 151 Mint 9s. Beckett has graded the card 145 times, with one Pristine 10 and 41 Gem Mint 9.5s. Raw cards on eBay are selling for between $50 and $70. The most recent PSA 10 sold for $417 and the most recent PSA 9 sold for $135. It would be two more years before additional cards of Vinatieri would arrive in packs, inside the Triumph set from Collectors Edge. There are no guarantees this will be the year Vinatieri gets inducted. Hall of Fame voting can be unpredictable and, at times, political. But Vinatieri is poised to become the fifth-ever placekicker inducted into the Hall of Fame. Being a semifinalist in his first season of eligibility bodes well for his future chances.

Sports Collectors Daily,Collectors’ Night in NYC Brings Out the Best,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/collectors-night-event-nyc/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 01:29:29 +0000","The sixth edition of Collectors Night brought an opportunity for collectors to expand their knowledge, hear stories and see some outstanding memorabilia.","November 25, 2024 By David Seideman  Two blocks from Rockefeller Center’s Christmas tree, the euphoria at a bar upstairs matched the season’s Yuletide spirit. On a November evening in New York, BC Vintage was hosting its sixth Collectors Exchange event. Company founders Chris Brigandi and Chris Caserta invited hobby heavyweights in various memorabilia categories to share insights and stories. About 50 collectors, some traveling long distances, were on hand. Leading off was Andrew Eckert, the director of business operations at Fanatics Live & Fanatics Collect.  Since relaunching PWCC through Fanatics Collect four months ago, the company has been selling 10,000 to 12,000 cards per week. Eckert also touted Fanatics Live, the company’s livestreaming arm where box breaks are conducted by sellers who offer spots in everything from $75 boxes to those that sell for thousands. 2024 Topps Chrome Update breaks with collectors looking for MLB Debut Patch cards–like the well publicized Paul Skenes— has been popular.   “You have his MLB Debut Patch worn on the field in his first game, a pinnacle moment,” Eckart said. “Then you take that patch and he autographs it. Skeenes has become the de facto best chase card in the hobby.” Brigandi asked him what the primary goal is for the company that will eventually own licenses for the NFL and NBA as well as the Topps Company that it now owns.  “Fanatics wants to connect the ecosystem of different kinds of collectors, from the live collector to the pure Topps collectors, through our synergy. It’s the power of all these things.” Since serving as Notre Dame’s Fighting Irish equipment manager in college, Eckhart has become a fervid collector of his alma mater.  He owns every style of the school’s jersey ever worn— 250 in all. Eckhart brought a a green jersey with a blue stripe on the sleeve worn just one game by a punter in 1983, which he bought from a local collector in South Bend.  Each of his four vintage paper ballots for the Heisman Trophy was mailed out to 100 journalists before the digital age, including one from 1956 bearing Hall of Famer Paul Hornung’s name.  On top of that, he asked each living Notre Dame coach for a handwritten play. Lou Holtz complied with a reverse play, detailed by x’s and o’s, that enabled Rocket Ismail to score a touchdown. Khyber Oser, the director of vintage memorabilia and photography at Goldin, co-wrote with Henry Yee, PSA/DNA’s photo authenticator and uber collector Marshall Fogel, the 2002 book that established the “Type” system.  Type 1 original photos of popular sports card images have skyrocketed in value. Original Sports Illustrated photos are some of the hardest to find. Oser showed a 1969 Type 1 photo of Celtics Hall of Famer John Havlicek that graced an SI cover.  As graded magazines gain traction in the hobby, he believes that such photos will attract broader interest (that photo, colorized by SI, is on the auction market now).  “There’s so much more to photos than cards,” Oser said. “They were used for magazines, posters. premiums. postcards. and programs. Babe Ruth photos were on pinbacks (buttons). His underwear box is a Charles Conlon photo. He and other master photographers had secondary usage. Photos are fine art and tell stories. This crossover is what makes photography even more interesting.” Osser held up a Type 1 photo of Mantle’s 1950s M114 Baseball Magazine premium. “If you own the premium, you might want the photo,” he said.  Brigandi shared with Oser and the guests a perfect example of his philosophy.  He acquired a striking 1926 barnstorming poster of Babe Ruth at Oscawana Lake in upstate New York. He was examining with a magnifying glass a Type 1 photo of Babe Ruth giving a trophy to a boy in a baseball uniform.  The trophy had Oscawana Lake stamped on it, making the photo and poster an ideal pair.  In April CCG bought James Spence Authentication to gain a foothold in the autograph business.  The company already authenticated coins, comic books, currency, audio visual games, currency, and sports and non-sports cards. JSA’s founder is still on the job, though.  “I am still authenticating,” Spence said. “I am not playing golf.”  Spence said about 35% of the company’s authentication work is baseball related but the company does everything, including political, entertainment, music and world leaders.  Since Spence launched JSA 19 years ago, he says he has authenticated over one million autographs, including tens of thousands of baseballs. Spence still hand signs the company’s letters of authenticity for virtually everything that has significant value. When it came time to play stump the authenticator, Spence was up the task.  A Cy Young signed ball was quickly rejected. “The ink is way too fresh,” he said. “The ink hasn’t cured or sunk into the leather. The formation is bad. It doesn’t have the sharpness spontaneity. One dead giveaway had nothing to do with the signature itself, though. The printing on the official National League baseball dated to the decade after Young had died in 1955. “This is an outright forgery,” Spence exclaimed. He noted that the three companies whose certification stickers had been applied to the ball had all been banned from eBay.  To someone not familiar with the memorabilia market or autographs in general, it could have been a disastrous purchase.  “This is absolutely authentic,” Spence said after eying a 1968 Jackie Robinson signed check. “I had the pleasure of authenticating every single check when Rachel (Jackie’s widow) sold them to Lelands in the 1990s. She had folders for all of them.” Even a check that has cleared doesn’t necessarily mean the signature is real.  For example, checks from former MLB Players Association chief Marvin Miller many other corporate type checks are stamped.  Many wives and family members of players have also been endorse them.  Thurman Munson, Billy Martin, and Reggie Jackson fit this category; Spence explained. A Babe Ruth signed ball with quote marks around “Babe” was a big whiff.  To save time, Ruth stopped using quote marks around his first name when signing around in 1928 and this ball was from a later period.  The autograph was also off center, another warning sign.  “He hit a sweet spot on 97 percent of all balls.,” Spence said. And there had been other autographs on the ball.  “There’s an abrasion on the north panel,” Spence observed. “Someone tried to turn this into a single-signed ball.” The night’s cleanup hitter for show-and-tell was super collector, Kevin Cohen, who dropped every jaw in the room. His two best pieces, naturally, involved Ruth.  An autographed Ruth on a creamy Harridge ball was authenticated by JSA and also graded a PSA 8. “You can see the autograph clear across the room,” he declared.  Brigandi said it was easily a six-figure baseball. Equally amazing was letterhead from a building where Ruth once lived. He signed it twice, and PSA encapsulated the autographs with a gem mint grade 10. “This shows you’re a true collector,” Brigandi joked.  “An investor would have cut this in half and sold one to pay for the other.” Cohen’s collecting philosophy is simple: “Eye appeal is the first thing. I have yet to lose on quality.  I have batted .1000.  And I never regret paying extra. I buy less.  One, two or three items per year.” The two least valuable show-and-tell items were the most poignant. Spence had brought along the 1968 Topps Mickey Mantle he pulled from a pack at a candy store back that year. After having Mantle sign it in 1990, Spence kept it in his wallet until it became thoroughly wrinkled. It was the first autographed card CCG authenticated when it bought Spence’s company. Spence then shared his Little League baseball from Englewood, NJ in 1970. when his dad was the coach.  Looking at the names, he ruefully recalled a teammate who was stabbed to death in town at age 15. Another name was Warren Moore, a rap music pioneer. The autograph guru’s parting gift was a pearl of wisdom. “If he is still alive, have your father sign a baseball,” he said. My father, who passed away suddenly in 2005, and I were best friends. We attended countless baseball games together in several cities and I dragged him to card shows. One of my prized possessions is a foul ball he caught at Ebbets Field and dated “7/44.”  It never occurred to me to have him sign it. What a great idea that would have been.

No, these aren’t the earliest cards depicting the sport. There are several 19th century boxing sets that hold more prestige and value. Other sets, too, were released around the same time as this one. In particular, the T219 Champions, T220 Prizefighters, and T225 Prize Fight series’ were all distributed just afterwards and are popular targets. But there are several reasons why this foreign set is a landmark release that is attainable to collectors. While the majority of UK cigarette cards didn’t hit the market until the 1920s and 1930s, there are still a large number of sets available before that time. The 1908-09 Ogden Pugilists and Wrestlers set is one of those. Ogden’s, a famous cigarette brand in the UK, actually distributed several boxing series’, starting in 1901 and lasting into the 1920s. However, their 1908-09 Pugilists and Wrestlers set might be the most popular of those releases. The set is broken up into two series’. The first series was issued in 1908 and features cards No. 1-50. A shorter (and rarer) second series was distributed in 1909 for cards No. 51-75. It is worth pointing out that part of the reason the first series cards are seen more often is that some were actually reprinted in 1909 as well. While cards No. 1-25 are only believed to have been printed in 1908, cards No. 26-50 were also printed into 1909 (these have a strong white back as opposed to ones more off-white in color). The cards’ appearance is almost Allen & Ginter Champions-like in nature. Fronts feature color lithographs of subjects against all white backgrounds, similar to those popular American-issued N28 and N29 multi-sport cards that preceded them by about 30 years. There are three things in particular that make these cards highly collectible, even in addition to the outstanding artwork. First, the cards are somewhat easy to find. While American collectors were probably not too familiar with them in the pre-internet days, they are now found online quite easily. eBay is a great starting point for these cards, yes. But vintage dealers online from the UK, or even America, are good places to look, too. You are not too likely to stumble upon them at your local card shop. These are, after all, boxing cards more than a century year old. Still, online shopping makes finding them much easier. eBay often has a few hundred listings available. The cards, too, are pretty affordable. I’ll cover cost a bit later, but the majority of this set can be built quite reasonably. Finally, the checklist includes fighters from many years up until that point. Ogden didn’t just include current boxers. The roster goes all the way back to the days of bare knuckle fighters in the 19th century. The set is headlined by plenty of Hall of Famers and stars, including John Sullivan, James Jeffries, Joe Gans, Sam Langford, and more. And in addition to those, true to the name of the set, cards of early wrestlers are included, too. The highlights there are early cards of Hall of Famers and early champions Frank Gotch and Georges Hackenschmidt. If you’re building the set, don’t underestimate the wrestling subset. Several of those cards are desirable and Gotch’s card is one of the most valuable in either series. As if all of that isn’t enough, the set also includes a pair of key rookie cards.  Baseball card collectors have been drawn to the set in recent years by the presence of Abe Attell. Attell was famously a conspirator in the 1919 World Series scandal involving the Chicago White Sox. While Attell has plenty of other boxing cards, this one is important as it is viewed as his rookie. The real headliner, however, is the card of Hall of Famer Jack Johnson. Similar to Attell’s, while other Johnson cards command interest, this one has the added benefit of being a rookie card. Johnson, for the record, does have at least one other rookie. That one is found in James Jeffries’ 1909 playing card set, as I wrote a while back. But this one not only pictures Johnson on his own, it also comes in a more traditional card set. Of the two, his Ogden card is by more desirable to most collectors. A final note here is that the cards bear a strong resemblance to another boxing set that Ogden released a few years later in 1915. While the checklist is different, the cards can easily appear to be in the same set. The 1915 Ogden Boxers cards have similar fronts and even feature the same sorts of images — boxer headshots. The have the same Ogden’s Cigarettes title at the top and the same capital letter font for the names at the bottom. They could easily be mistaken for a third series of sorts. However, they are easily separated by the backs. Even though the backs also have a similar style, the 1915 cards are titled ‘Boxers’ instead of ‘Pugilists and Wrestlers.’ That set is also not nearly as heavily traded as it contains fewer stars than the earlier Pugilists and Wrestlers issue. As mentioned earlier, the cards aren’t too difficult to find if you know where to look online. However, finding them out ‘in the wild’ in person is a much more difficult task. While they are not scarce, they can be tricky to find at shops or even card shows. Prices, however, are often collector friendly. If interested in acquiring a set, a collector’s best bet is to buy the cards in lots. While individual commons from the first series often are sold in the $5-$10 range, in lots, it is possible to find them at times for closer to $2-$3 a card in lesser condition. The stars, of course, are a bit more. Cards, too, in the higher-numbered second series usually often are closer to $10-$15. But even the most expensive cards can fit into many collector budgets. Attell’s aforementioned card is still a relative bargain, usually starting around $25. The card of Gotch the wrestler is typically the second most valuable card, starting around $50-$100. Johnson’s rookie, of course, is the most valuable. And while nicer examples are not cheap, low-grade raw examples can be found for as little as $150-$250. Complete sets, particularly with both series’, are rare. However, on occasion you can find them available. Complete first series’ are more readily seen than the second series with Johnson’s rookie and the high-numbered Gotch card often pulled out and sold separately. There are usually a few hundred listings for the 1908-09 Ogden Pugilists and Wrestlers on eBay.

Sports Collectors Daily,"5 Early Roki Sasaki Cards to Consider, Hottest Auctions",https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/5-early-roki-sasaki-cards-to-consider/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 05:12:09 +0000","As MLB and collectors await his arrival, here's a look at some of the more popular early Roki Sasaki baseball cards.","November 24, 2024 By Brendan Cross  The talent pipeline between Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan and Major League Baseball continues to bear fruit. Roki Sasaki, a 23-year-old pitching phenom from the Chiba Lotte Marines, will be posted by his team and will sign a contract with an MLB team prior to the 2025 season.  Who he will be playing for is yet to be determined, but interest in Sasaki’s earliest baseball cards has been heating up with teams lining up to try and sign him.  Sasaki did not complete six seasons in the NPB, which means he is entering the MLB as an amateur and is not eligible to sign a contract to the tune of Yoshinobu Yamamoto’s 12-year $365 million pact with the Los Angeles Dodgers last December. According to a Baseball America article by J.J. Cooper, Sasaki will essentially be signing a minor league contract and will not reach arbitration until his third season in the major leagues. Shohei Ohtani also took this route when he signed with the Angels prior to the 2018 season. To call Sasaki the Paul Skenes of Japan is not the best comparison. Yes, the Japanese fireballer has a triple-digit fastball and is only six months older than Skenes. But the lanky 6’2” righthander has a great command, a filthy splitter and a wipeout slider that is more Jacob deGrom than it is Paul Skenes. Regardless of those or any other comparisons, Sasaki is on his way to the majors and is already the most talked about free agent pitcher available. Is Sasaki as good of a pitcher as Ohtani or Yamamoto, or maybe Kodai Senga or Shota Imanaga? Consider that he made his debut at the age of 19 in 2021 and was immediately a dominant pitcher. In 2022, he pitched a perfect game with 19 strikeouts, which tied the NPB record. In that game, he set a new NPB record by fanning 13 in a row. In his next start, he went eight perfect innings but was pulled before the ninth due to pitch count concerns. In 2023, the world had a chance to see Sasaki on a big stage. In the World Baseball Classic, he pitched 7.2 innings and struck out 11. In the semi-final against a strong Mexican team, Sasaki averaged 100.5 mph with his fastball. The obvious impact that Sasaki will have on the hobby is that he will be one of the most sought after rookies in 2025. He is not the only high-profile rookie who will have his Major League baseball card debut next year, but he will be in high demand. Sales of Sasaki’s Japanese cards and those produced in conjunction with the World Baseball Classic have skyrocketed since late October. Over 500 listings sold on eBay November 9 when news of his pending arrival heated up. Ten cards have sold for $1,000 or more this month on the platform. Sasaki’s earliest trading cards date back to 2020, as he was featured in several top Japanese sports card sets from brands like BBM and Calbee. Here’s a handful of Sasaki’s best NPB and pre-MLB cards. 2020 BBM 1st Version #104

Collectors seem to consider this to be Sasaki’s best NPB card to own. It’s the flagship equivalent to what will eventually be his 2025 Topps Series 1 or Series 2 rookie card and is his first professional card.  BBM began producing cards for the NPB in 1991. PSA 10 versions of the card have been selling for $400 and up while raw copies are pushing north of $100. There are facsimile autographed versions as well. 2020 Calbee #94  Another leading card brand in Japan, this 2020 Calbee base card features the high leg kick of Sasaki while the card design itself has rounded corners. It may not be as sought after by collectors when compared to the BBM counterpart, but visually it’s a must add to any budding Sasaki collection. PSA 10 copies have moved close to $200 with nice raw copies less than half of that. 2021 Topps Chrome NPB #194 
Topps got into the NPB card game with a 2021 Topps Chrome set that featured a few future MLB players such as Seiya Suzuki, Shota Imanaga and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, along with Sasaki. The 2021 Topps MLB chrome set featured the same classic chrome design. It’s Sasaki’s first true Topps card and will surely continue to be a grail card in many collections. Along with the base version, a full range of parallels from Refractor to the 1/1 SuperFractor make these some of the best Sasaki cards to consider. There are no recent sales of numbered versions of this card, but a base PSA 10 sold for $168 on November 14. 2022 Bowman NPB Chrome #133 
In 2022, Topps released a Bowman NPB product featuring paper and chrome cards. This product has an equally large parallel rainbow to build and chase as the 2021 Topps Chrome NPB product. I love the large stride that is captured by Sasaki in this card, large enough to go off the card on both sides. There is also something special about Sasaki having a Bowman card. While he is an NPB professional in this card, as far as the MLB is concerned, he is essentially a prospect. A PSA 10 version of this card sold for $73 on November 14, making it nearly $100 cheaper than its Topps Chrome NPB counterpart. 2023 Topps Series 2 World Baseball Classic #WBC-34

The World Baseball Classic subset in 2023 Topps Series 2 is a highly collectible insert set that features stars who participated in the most recent world tournament. Sasaki was overshadowed by Shohei Ohtani’s performance both on the mound and at the dish, but it was the first time the international stage got to see Sasaki pitch, and he did not disappoint. Base versions of this card are selling for between $8-$10 dollars while numbered parallels will fetch significantly more. Topps also produced a standalone set for the last WBC and you can find Sasaki there, too. Card #21 has a base card and an image variation with each having multiple parallel versions.

Sports Collectors Daily,Find of T206 Era Packs Headlines REA Sale,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/t206-tobacco-packs-find/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 02:11:47 +0000","A recent estate sale discovery of Piedmont cigarette packs from the era of T206 baseball card production is now on the market, along with a rare Ty Cobb card, a dual-signed Ruth-Gehrig baseball and other pieces of sports history.","November 24, 2024 By Rich Mueller  An estate sale discovery of a dozen packs of original 1910 Piedmont Cigarettes, possibly containing T206 baseball cards, and the original case they were stored in for more than 100 years, is on the market for the first time. According to Robert Edward Auctions, the case was discovered recently at an estate sale in Richmond, VA, located just ten miles from where the American Tobacco Company factory that made them was located. Is there a multi-million- dollar pristine copy of the famed Honus Wagner card in one of them?  Not likely, but the tantalizing possibility of a Walter Johnson, Cy Young, Christy Mathewson, Ty Cobb or Nap Lajoie is enough to make collectors swoon.  The packs date to the 1910 era when ATC was cranking out millions to serve a nation of smokers.  The estate sale find uncovered by REA’s consignor consisted of 13 packs, even of which were still sealed and while the tax stamp has been broken on the remaining six.  REA says the consignor has decided to keep one pack for his personal collection.  Piedmont packs offered to collectors are often described as dating to the three-year era of baseball card production are often inaccurately researched and the auction house description details some of those issues. The packs offered by REA appear to have a reasonable chance of containing a baseball card, but ATC also produced non-sports cards in the era and the possibility of a bird card instead of a baseball card can’t be ruled out.  Either way, most potential buyers are likely to keep the pack unopened because of the scarcity. The case they came in originally housed 50 packs and the one offered by REA is the only one known to exist.  The Piedmont packs aren’t the only new discoveries offered for sale in what is one of REA’s largest auctions each year. As was reported last week, a 1916 Morehouse Baking Babe Ruth rookie card graded PSA 3.5, and over 100 other cards from the same set, are making their hobby debut.  Brought to market by a collector who made contact with the owner while at a yard sale, the cards were distributed through a bakery in Massachusetts.  It’s the first Morehouse Ruth ever documented and presented for sale. More than a dozen other Hall of Famers and stars of the day were also part of the find.  Bidding on the Ruth card quickly topped $500,000 in the first 48 hours after the auction opened. Also on the block is a newly discovered T206 Ty Cobb with the Cobb tobacco back graded PSA 2.5 that had a high bid of $185,000 as of Sunday afternoon.   According to REA, “This card comes to us from a family outside of Greensboro, North Carolina, where the card was the centerpiece of a large vintage baseball card collection built between the 1970s and 1990s. Originally purchased at a flea market in the 1980s by our consignor’s father, the card was highlighted in an August 1990 feature story in their hometown newspaper, a copy of which accompanies the card. The collection, and this incredible rarity, was eventually passed from father to son, where the T206 Ty Cobb with “Ty Cobb” back stayed in its original ungraded state until just earlier this year.” The card’s arrival on the auction market comes just days after SC Daily reported on another new T206 Cobb back that will enter the market through dealer MINT State, which plans to sell it on consignment on behalf of the family that owns it—and hundreds of other T206 cards. Following the announcement of his third MVP Award, the auction features a 2018 Topps Transcendent Japan Autographs #TA-SO17 Shohei Ohtani Rookie Red #1/1 graded PSA 10.  Other modern card highlights include a 1996-1997 Topps Chrome Kobe Bryant rookie Refractor PSA 10 and a 1997-1998 Skybox Metal Universe Championship Precious Metal Gems Basketball #23 Michael Jordan #15/50 PSA 4.  Other notable items in REA’s Fall Catalog Auction include: *1951 Bowman Willie Mays rookie card PSA 8
*1910 D322 Tip Tod Bread Honus Wagner PSA 5
*1911 T206 Gold Border Richard Hoblitzell PSA 6 (rare “no stats” variation –1 of 2)
*1933 Goudey #149 Babe Ruth PSA 7
*1952 Topps Mickey Mantle PSA 5.5
*1957-58 Topps Bill Russell rookie card PSA 8
*Ticket stub from Jackie Robinson’s 1947 debut
*Babe Ruth-Lou Gehrig dual-signed baseball graded 8 by PSA/DNA
*Pete Rose 1963 NL Rookie of the Year award
*2004-05 LeBron James game-used shoes
*1974 Nolan Ryan game-used Angels home jersey  “We have a ton of new-to-the-hobby cards and memorabilia items, and the most exciting thing about it is that the event covers the interests of so many different collectors,” REA President Brian Dwyer remarked on the auction. “We’re extremely excited to finally unveil this auction that has been months in the making, and we look forward to some historic results.” The auction runs through Sunday, December 8.

The ECHL affiliates of the Minnesota Wild based in Coralville, Iowa, are celebrating their home state’s proud tradition of pork production on Saturday, November 30, when they host the Bloomington Bison on “Crispy Bacon Night.” And the themed uniforms that the Heartlanders will wear for the game are something else. The Heartlanders unveiled the uniforms on their social media channels on Wednesday, November 27, calling them “horrendously perfect.” The jerseys, pants and socks combine to give the overall effect of a pig farmer wearing denim overalls. The jersey itself has a pink and grey plaid pattern on the sleeves and the upper chest for the farmer’s collared shirt. The denim overalls cover most of the chest and back. On the front of the jersey, the Heartlanders’ primary logo sits on the pocket of the overalls in the middle of the chest. Several strips of bacon poke out of that same pocket. The shoulders of the jersey depict the straps and buckles of the overalls. Sponsor logos are overlaid on the shoulders and the right chest. The pants and socks both have a blue denim pattern, completing the overalls look, with darker pockets on the back of the pants. The numbers on the back and sleeves are pink with black outlines and set in the Heartlanders’ usual font. Nameplates are black with white lettering. Under the number on the back, a pink curly pig’s tail pokes out from the overalls. According to the Heartlanders, there are more pigs (23 million) in Iowa than people (4 million), so a pork-and-bacon-themed night is a perfect fit. Along with the jerseys, the Heartlanders will be handing out thundersticks designed to look like bacon strips, and they’ll host a bacon-themed pregame party at the nearby Hyatt Hotel Exhibit Hall. Your Crispy Bacon experience doesn’t end when you walk in the door… in fact, it’s just beginning and will carry over into the game, with specialty concessions, in-game bacon activities, and pork eating contests.  This is sure to be be one of the most unique nights in Heartlanders history.  Game-worn jerseys are being auctioned off through Dash, with bids closing at 7:45 p.m. CT on Saturday. Puck drop between the Heartlanders and Bison is set for 6 p.m. CT Saturday at the Xtream Arena in Coralville. If you want to see these jerseys in person, tickets are still available through the Heartlanders’ website."

It then returned for a Thanksgiving victory over the Giants in 2022, as well as last year’s win over the Washington Commanders.

He led the franchise to eight playoff appearances, including a 32-14 win over the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bow XI. After he retired from coaching, Madden ventured into broadcasting and served as the color analyst for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC.

The team posted a message to fans on their website and social media channels on Tuesday, November 26. In it, they say they are launching “a deliberate process through which we will seek out, listen to, and reflect on input about our team name from fans, supporters, and a group of advisors assembled to reflect a diverse range of voices and perspectives.” We appreciate you pushing us to be the best we can be.  To learn more about our process and share your thoughts, please visit: https://t.co/2Ae5eamAnI pic.twitter.com/pfuBI1XMUp We want to assure you that we have heard your feedback and are actively listening. We share your high expectations, and together, we will build a storied club that reflects the essence of the beautiful game and the character of our dynamic city. The “BOS Nation” moniker was originally chosen in part because the letters could be rearranged to spell “Bostonian.” “It starts with ‘Bostonian’ — those nine letters that make up that word are so meaningful to those of us that come from there,” controlling owner Jennifer Epstein told CBS in October. “When you rearrange those letters you get BOS Nation, and that was very intentional. This team is fan-centric, fans first, and our new identity is made up of the diverse communities that live in our strong city and have a love — or will soon have a love — of the beautiful game.” The team also launched two wordmark logos at the time, both of which used a color scheme of green and black with pink accents. It was unclear at the time if these were intended to appear on kits or if another crest would be forthcoming. This commitment remains clear: to create a Club that represents the strength, diversity, and passion of this community, and that starts with the team’s name. Here’s how we’re leading the charge: • Hosting Dedicated Forums and Opportunities to Listen: Engaging with fans, women’s sports advocates, former players, and Boston leaders. We’ve already begun hosting sessions and welcome suggestions for groups and individuals we should include here. • Assembling Brand Advisors:  We’ve identified a diverse group of voices to guide and shape our future and welcome additional nominations here. • Listening to Your Feedback: We have read, archived, and are now studying, all feedback provided to date. We welcome you to continue to share your thoughts through this quick form. No matter what the name ends up being, Boston’s NWSL franchise is slated to begin play in the 2026 season. They’ll play their home games at White Stadium, a 10,519-seat facility in historic Franklin Park that recently underwent a $30-million renovation. The team’s ownership group includes Hollywood actor/producer/director Elizabeth Banks and Team USA Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman. No related stories."

The Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) and Puma announced the new deal on Wednesday, November 27. The contract is effective January 1, 2025, and formally brings to an end the FPF’s partnership with Nike, who had been producing kits for Portugal since 1997. The deal with Puma covers all of Portugal’s men’s, women’s and youth national teams, along with the FPF’s futsal, beach football and E-Sports teams. “Signing a top-tier national team was one of our priorities in football and I am very excited to welcome a team as popular as Portugal to the Puma Family,” said Puma CEO Arne Freundt in the company’s press release. “Given the large number of fans all over the world and the great potential of the next generation of this squad, we are looking forward to the upcoming big tournaments such as the 2026 World Cup.” Portugal is also one of three host nations for the 2030 FIFA World Cup, along with Spain and Morocco. While Puma has never made kits for Portugal before, the company did partner with legendary Portuguese player Eusébio in the 1960s. Known as “O Rei” (“The King”), Eusébio and Puma collaborated on the iconic Puma King football boot. Eusébio was the top scorer in the 1966 FIFA World Cup, in which Portugal finished third. “We were attracted to PUMA because of the way in which they engage with the fans and tell the unique story of every team they work with,” said FPF president Fernando Gomes in the press release. “We look forward to creating an exciting range of products with them which will resonate with our large fan base all over the world.” During their time with Nike, Portugal won the 2016 European Championship and the 2018-19 UEFA Nations League. Their best showing at a FIFA World Cup during that stretch was a fourth-place finish in 2006. Puma will unveil the first of its new FPF products in early 2025."

On Thursday, November 21, the Guinea Football Federation (Feguifoot) lodged a formal complaint with the Confederation of African Football (CAF) over their men’s national team’s 1-0 loss to Tanzania two days before. That win vaulted Tanzania to second place in Group H of the 2025 African Cup of Nations qualification round — one point ahead of Guinea — and secured their spot in the tournament finals, to be held from December 21, 2025, to January 18, 2026, in Morocco. Feguifoot contends that Tanzanian substitute Ibrahim Ame was listed as number 24 on the official teamsheet for the match, but when he entered the game in the 73rd minute, Ame was wearing number 26 on his shirt. “Therefore … the player in question was not eligible to take part in the match,” Feguifoot’s press release reads (translated to English by Google). “By bringing this player into the game in the 73rd minute with this number 26, Tanzania therefore used an unqualified player.” “The situation was all the more serious because the absence of a listed number was combined with the absence of a name on the jersey, making it de facto impossible to verify the player’s identity,” they add. Feguifoot has asked the CAF to award the win and the three points to Guinea, which would mean they would qualify for the AFCON finals instead of Tanzania. Tanzania scored their goal in the 61st minute of the match, before Ame came on as a substitute. The Tanzanian Football Federation (TFF) responded on their Facebook page, saying their players “were checked by the opposing team and the Commissioner where they were allowed to play” (translated to English by Google). “(The) TFF does not have any information from the Confederation of African Football (CAF) that Ame’s participation in the match was illegal.” Feguifoot’s release also alleges that the kickoff time for the game — which was held in Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania — was unfairly moved ahead three hours, forcing players to play in extreme heat with only 48 hours’ notice of the change. It also noted that the match commissioner and security officer were both from Kenya, a country that borders Tanzania. Both nations are also part of the Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations (CECAFA) Zonal Union. The CAF has yet to make a ruling on the formal complaint."

Coming soon to Milan Puskar Stadium 👀 pic.twitter.com/lfWGg27Pd8 A gold Flying “WV” will still be prominently featured at the 50-yard line, just like it has been since the 1997 season, when West Virginia moved away from the state outline and a smaller Flying “WV” at midfield. However, the Mountaineers have replaced the wordmarks in the navy blue end zones and the yard-line numbers with their current typeface, which was introduced in 2019, while two parallel stripes also flank the wordmarks. The stripes are reminiscent of the pants stripes on West Virginia’s uniforms, which were revealed prior to this season. The stripes were a staple under Hall of Fame head coach Don Nehlen from 1980-93 and were used on their “Country Roads” alternate uniforms in 2022 and 2023. Lastly, the out-of-bounds area behind the end zones and down the sidelines to the designated team areas at the 25-yard line is now navy blue. The sidelines and out-of-bounds area behind the end zones have been white since 1988. This marks the first update to the turf at Milan Puskar Stadium since 2016, when – according to our friend Ethan Dimitroff of the Mountaineer Uniform Database — West Virginia increased the size of the Flying “WV” and changed the placement of the Big XII logos to the 25-yard lines.

In doing so, however, the Chargers may have accidentally revealed their plans to unveil a navy blue alternate helmet – which would be worn with their navy blue Color Rush uniforms – ahead of next season. The Chargers have paired their navy blue Color Rush uniforms, which feature a single-color lightning bolt on the shoulders and pants, with their standard white helmets since their current uniform design was unveiled in 2020. They simply swap the powder blue and gold lightning bolt decals, powder blue numbers and gold facemasks for navy blue and gold lightning bolt decals, navy blue numbers and navy blue facemasks to complete the look. dark mode activated pic.twitter.com/K4a1qez9Dl The reason for this is the NFL’s one-helmet rule, though the league has since relaxed that rule, allowing teams to introduce a second or third shell to their closet. The Chargers are among a handful of teams that have not yet taken advantage it. But if the promotional photos that were shared on social media by the Chargers and the skate club are any indication, they could soon have a navy blue helmet with single-color lightning bolt, gold numbers and navy blue facemask at their disposal. That said, a closer inspection of the photoshoot suggests the navy blue helmet is nothing more than a display piece from the Chargers’ facility, as it is a Riddell Speed with interior padding that is consistent with full-size collectible helmets. There’s also the presence of a large white warning sticker on the back, which typically states, “This replica helmet is for display only. It is not designed or intended for use as a protective helmet. Do not wear this helmet.” You can also see the sticker on the inside. Compare those features to the white helmet, which is an authentic Vicis Zero2 and includes other details such as the Chargers’ front and back bumpers, as well as the American flag, NFL shield and a warning label that lists the potential dangers of playing football. Now, that’s not to say the Chargers won’t eventually unveil a navy blue alternate helmet. After all, they scrapped their royal blue Color Rush uniforms this season – and, if you’re going to add another helmet, you might as well maximize the amount of times it can be worn each season. But given the information we shared above, it would be a stretch to constitute this as a leak at this time. Of course, we’ll keep you posted anything changes, seeing as we’ve been on top of the alternate and throwback helmet news for the last two seasons.

In July 2024, Leicester City announced it had signed a sponsorship deal — one of the most valuable in its history, the club said at the time — with BC.Game, an online cryptocurrency gaming platform. The site’s logo has appeared on the front of the Leicester City men’s first team jerseys since the 2024-25 Premier League season began in August. But BC.Game’s financial health has been seriously questioned lately. According to iGamingBusiness, bankruptcy petitions were filed in October against the site’s former owner, Blockdance, and its current parent company, Small House, in Curaçao, the Caribbean island nation where BC.Game is licensed. These petitions were filed by The Foundation for the Representation of Victims of Online Gaming and allege Small House has failed to pay out more than $2 million in player winnings since acquiring the site in February 2024. In a statement dated November 21, 2024, BC.Game says the allegations “lack substantive evidence and fail to demonstrate any violations by our platform.” The allegations lack sufficient supporting evidence, with many claims based solely on unverified statements. Our internal investigations have revealed discrepancies in the cases cited by the plaintiffs, with most accusations lacking a clear legal or technical basis. We affirm that BC.GAME has adhered to industry compliance standards in all relevant operations. The statement also raises concerns about lawyers’ conduct in the case and inconsistencies in the case evidence. For their part, Leicester City also released a statement of support for BC.Game: “We have been and continue to be in regular discussions with BC.Game with regard to an active legal case in Curacao. BC.Game have provided the Club with the strongest assurances that they are actively appealing this case, and that the process which has been initiated in Curacao is administrative in nature and has not arisen due to any concerns with their financial standing. “BC.Game have further assured us that they have no issues with liquidity and that they remain fully committed to meeting their ongoing contractual and financial obligations, including to the Club, and that this case will not impact on BC.Game’s continuing international operations.” Should BC.Game not be able to fulfill their deal with Leicester City, it wouldn’t be the first time in recent memory that a cryptocurrency firm has had to terminate a sponsorship contract early. Late in the 2022-23 season, Italian clubs AS Roma and Inter Milan both dropped their front-of-shirt sponsor, blockchain company DigitalBits, over missed contract payments. AC Milan played in blank shirts for a few games before securing streaming service Paramount+ as a new sponsor for the final match of the Serie A season and the UEFA Champions League final. AS Roma, meanwhile, played the rest of the season with the initials “SPQR” on their shirts. The acronym stands for “Senatus PopulusQue Romanus” (“The Senate and the People of Rome”) and it also “appears on Roman currency, at the end of documents made public by an inscription in stone or metal, and in dedications of monuments and public and civil works,” according to Wikipedia. The full phrase “appears in Roman political, legal, and historical literature.”"

The new brand has been a long time coming. “The Nook Nation alternate brand has been years in the making,” Chinooks GM Eric Snodgrass said in a statement. “We wanted an alternate and fresh look that we could use on occasions through the off-season and during the summer while still keeping our classic branding as our primary look.

We are convinced that the triumphs will come and will be memories that will be close to the hearts of soccer fans forever, not just for the next ten years,” added Adidas Mexico general manager Jorge Dionne. The new contract will cover the 2026, 2030 and 2034 FIFA World Cups. The FMF first partnered with Adidas in 1984, and that contract lasted until 1990. Mexico kits were then produced by various companies like Umbro, ABA Sport, Garcis and Atletica until 2003, when the FMF signed a contract with Nike. In 2007, Mexico partnered up with Adidas once again, and that relationship that lasted ever since.

The new look maintains the popular bee character, a staple in the minor league baseball landscape since 2006, while updating the typography and adding some alternate identities. The new type, which is included in the primary logo and the interlocking cap logo, is meant to allude to the sting of a bee. The interlocking SL cap logo pre-dates the Bees in Salt Lake City, with previous teams in the city like the Gulls and the Trappers using a version of the baseball custom in the 1970s and ’80s. New alternate identities pay tribute to the state of Utah, including one that features the state outline with the word Bees set in a descending staircase that evokes a classic logo from the team’s parent club, the Los Angeles Angels. Another alternate pays homage to the Beehive State with a beehive icon. If you’ve driven through Utah, you’ll know this symbol from the state’s highway signs. Yet another alternate sets pair of crossed bats within a honeycomb, with icons of a baseball and the state of Utah set opposite the letters S and L.

About two weeks after the conclusion of the 2024 Korean Series in late October, the KBO League team based in Daejeon, South Korea, unveiled a new suite of logos and uniforms for 2025. While the orange remains in their colour palette from previous seasons, it is now complemented by a dark shade of navy blue instead of black.

Both identities were created by designer Matthew Wolff. The wordmarks include one in cursive script and one in all caps. Both were “developed with the motif of an eagle’s beak and talons,” the team said on social media. The cursive script—used in the primary logo and on both the white home and orange alternate uniforms—is “a modern reinterpretation of the logo from the championship days,” when the Eagles won their only Korean Series in 1999. Also included in the new suite is an eagle head logo with lightning bolts in the neck. This logo doesn’t appear on the Eagles’ new uniforms, but it is used on their website, on team merchandise, and on a flag that was used in the photo shoots for the new uniforms. The Eagles’ white home uniforms feature the scripted wordmark in one-colour orange, while the front number is navy blue. The corporate wordmark of the Hanwha Group — a worldwide conglomerate based in Korea that deals in everything from energy to finance — appears in orange on the left shoulder. A single orange stripe runs down each side of the pants. The grey away uniforms have slightly darker grey pinstripes and a navy blue all-caps wordmark on the front, along with an orange front number. A navy blue stripe runs down each side of the pants. The Eagles also unveiled two alternate jerseys, one orange and one navy blue. The orange one has a navy blue script wordmark and a white front number, while the navy blue one has a white all-caps wordmark and a white front number. The navy alternate is also the only one where the unveiling photos showed a clear view of the back; in this case, the player name is one-colour white, while the number is one-colour orange. The Eagles’ social media announcement pictured all four jerseys with the same cap or batting helmet, which has a navy blue base and an orange script “E” on the front. Along with the Eagles and Twins, Wolff has done design work for Major League Soccer’s Chicago Fire and Los Angeles Football Club; New York/New Jersey Gotham FC, Racing Louisville, San Diego Wave FC and Angel City FC of the National Women’s Soccer League; and USL clubs like Louisville City, Union Omaha and FC Tulsa. He also worked on the typography as part of the rebranding of the National Basketball Association’s Los Angeles Clippers, which was unveiled in February 2024. The Hanwha Eagles joined the KBO League in 1986 as the Binggrae Eagles, as Binggrae was the name of Hanwha’s confectionary branch. They changed their name in 1993 when Binggrae separated from the Hanwha conglomerate. They won their only Korean Series championship in 1999 but have been runners-up five times (1988, 1989, 1991, 1992, 2006)."

The nickname Sky Carp won the day, edging out Cheese Balls, Polka Pike, Moo, and Supper Clubbers. Three years later, the franchise announced that it will play Friday nights as one of the runners-up in that fan vote, the Supper Clubbers. Supper clubs, cozy dining establishments that traditionally serve prime rib, fried fish, and relish trays, as well as mixed drinks, are a staple of Wisconsin culture. The logos unveiled with the new Friday night brand celebrate this particular aspect of Americana. A wordmark script captures the feeling of a neon sign one might find outside a supper club. Another mark features the official cocktail of Wisconsin, the Brandy Old Fashioned, complete with a cherry and orange slice and a character that evokes the hoity-toity image of a supper club. And a sleeve patch pits a pair of cherries against the outline of the state of Wisconsin. The Beloit Sky Carp are the High-A affiliate of the Miami Marlins in the Midwest League."

The Armada — based in Boisbriand, Quebec, just north of Montréal — have primarily used black and white as their team colors since joining the QMJHL in 2011. But they added blue to their palette over the weekend with the unveiling of the third jersey, which they wore at home both on Friday against the Acadie-Bathurst Titan and Saturday against the Val d’Or Foreurs. While the new third jersey maintains a black base — echoing the Armada’s “Bleed Black” motto — the squared-off shoulders are blue, as are stripes around the waist and sleeves. The front of the jersey features a new logo, with “ARMADA” in black running across a black “A”, both of which have white outlines. Blue was chosen because it “embodies the spirit of an armada that strongly cuts through the waves, weathering storms and staying on course toward a future full of promise” (translated to English by Google). Atop the “A” is a blue crown that the team says is made up of two horizontal Bs. The bottom line of the crown symbolizes Autoroute 15, which runs through Boisbriand and is part of the Trans-Canada Highway. The collar of the jersey is half blue and half black, with a blue insert at the front with a black double-B logo inside. The numbers on the sleeves and back are black with white outlines, as are the As and Cs on the front of alternate captains’ and captains’ jerseys. Names on the backs are one-color white. The new jerseys worked like a charm for the Armada, as they won both games in which they wore them over the weekend."

(&#8216;Member member berries?)","As far as old hockey logos go, the Vancouver Canucks’ “flying skate” logo might be one of the most divisive of them all. Was this actually a logo good enough to warrant a rebirth, or are we simply hitting the member berries a little too hard again? (‘Member member berries?) With its sharp lines, vibrant red-and-yellow colour palette, and a sense of speed woven into its look, it was a vast departure from the club’s previous blue-and-green hockey stick design when it was introduced in 1978. It was also the most visible element for one of the most memorable runs in franchise history when they went all the way to Game 7 of the 1994 Stanley Cup Final. Though they fell just short of ultimate glory, the love for the logo lives on, guaranteed to instantly bring back memories of that team that was just a win away. As the ’94 team celebrates its 30th anniversary—and as the flying skate continues to make its mark now as an incredibly popular alternate jersey—let’s take a closer look at the origins of the flying skate logo and that colour scheme: how they came to be, their controversial reception, and how they have cemented their place in Vancouver’s visual identity. When the Canucks decided to overhaul their look in 1978, they turned to Beyl and Boyd, a San Francisco-based design agency, to create a bold and aggressive new identity. The result was a massive shift from the team’s look up until that point—gone were the blue and green of the original uniforms, replaced by a vibrant red, orange, yellow, and black colour scheme meant to evoke energy and aggression. “The Canucks colours were all wrong,” designer Bill Boyd told the Vancouver Sun in 1978. “Blue-green is the coolest colour of all; [it] slows the pulse, reduces aggression, and promotes calmness. With the [new] Canucks uniforms, we are going from the coolest of colours—blue-green—to the hottest—red-orange. The cool colour is passive, the hot one aggressive, plus the black. It’s the contrast of colours that creates emotion.” This aggressive new palette was paired with a dynamic new logo by illustrator Mike Bull. The flying skate design replaced the stick-in-rink logo, which Boyd and his team considered too static for the fast-paced game of hockey. The skate, speeding diagonally across the word “Canucks,” embodied motion, style, and progress. According to Boyd, the new logo was specifically chosen for its positive attributes of “movement and style,” reflecting the Canucks’ desire to inject energy and aggression into their brand. The change was as symbolic as it was visual, trading one piece of hockey equipment (the stick) for another (the skate) in a way that underscored the true speed of the game. It bore the hallmarks of the pop art movement, with sharp angles and a bold, contrasting colour palette. It was part of a broader trend in the late 1970s, as sports teams experimented with their aesthetics to stand out in increasingly competitive markets. Initially, the Flying Skate’s impact on the uniforms was minimal, appearing only on the sleeves of the jersey and serving as a secondary element to the far more overpowering “V” design on the chest—a representation of the City of Vancouver. “Diagonal stripes get your attention. They’re like the crooked picture on the wall. You have to fix it, or it drives you crazy,” Boyd explained. The Canucks continued to break from tradition by wearing yellow jerseys at home instead of white, with Boyd emphasizing, “White produces no response at all, so we went for yellow… Yellow is warm, pleasant, happy, upbeat.” As with most bold design choices, the look proved polarizing. Critics mocked the new uniforms, with The Financial Post joking, “So the Canucks will go from ‘cool’ to ‘hot’ just by changing their uniforms? The rest of the teams could wear sunglasses, that is, if they aren’t already colourblind.” By 1982, the Canucks had made a surprise run to the Stanley Cup Final, providing the flying skate logo with its first big moment on the national stage. Unfortunately, the New York Islanders quickly swept aside the team and eventually the “V” jerseys. Just three years later, the Canucks updated their look, moving the flying skate logo from the sleeves to the front of the jersey while shifting the “V” to the shoulders. These changes introduced a cleaner, more traditional uniform layout, though the colour scheme of red, yellow, and black remained intact. By the late 1980s, dissatisfaction with the team’s look persisted. Brian Burke, the Canucks’ director of hockey operations at the time, criticized the jerseys on a local radio show, calling the home uniforms a shade of “puke-yellow.” His remarks inspired a 20-year-old fan named Jeremie White to propose a new uniform concept, pitching designs that replaced the colour scheme with black and blue and introducing a new design featuring a hockey stick flying through a “V.” While Burke dismissed the colour and logo change, he saw potential in White’s skills and ideas. Partnering with general manager Pat Quinn, White refined the design, resulting in a significant uniform update in 1989. The new look eliminated the shoulder “V”s, reintroduced traditional striping on the jerseys, and replaced the “puke yellow” home uniforms with a white set. The flying skate logo remained front and centre on the chest of both the home white and road black sweaters. White’s vision, combined with Quinn’s leadership, ultimately helped refine the look that became synonymous with the Canucks’ most competitive teams of the ’90s. The flying skate logo undoubtedly reached its peak during the 1994 Stanley Cup Final, where it adorned the jerseys of a gritty Canucks team led by Trevor Linden, Pavel Bure, and Kirk McLean. Though it ended in heartbreak, the flying skate became synonymous with that era of Canucks hockey and a moment when many younger fans forged their lifelong love for the team. The popularity of that team wasn’t enough to stop the radical design shift the sports world experienced in the mid-to-late 1990s. Just three years later, it was gone, replaced with a new orca-focused logo and then, eventually, a return to that cool-and-calming blue and green colour scheme. ‘Member blue and green? Despite its forced retirement, the flying skate’s popularity endured. While the orca logo ushered in a new chapter for the Canucks, many fans saw it as a corporate pivot—a sharp departure from the community-driven passion the flying skate represented. In 2019-20, as part of the team’s 50th-anniversary celebrations, the Canucks wore the flying skate jerseys for select games before bringing it back as a full-fledged third jersey during the 2022-23 season. They say sometimes you have to lose something to love something, and that appears to be the case here with the Flying Skate logo. Widely panned in its day, the Flying Skate is now more popular than ever, with fans often pleading for it to return full-time, hoping to join a handful of other NHL teams that have corrected their ’90s redesigns. As a hockey fan who grew up watching those black, red, and gold Canucks teams, I never got the appeal of that look at the time, but I can’t deny the warm-and-fuzzies I feel whenever I see them hit the ice today. It’s not just about the bold colours or sharp lines—it’s about the grit of Trevor Linden, the jaw-dropping magic of Pavel Bure, and the electric atmosphere of the old Pacific Coliseum every time the team stepped on the ice in that unforgettable outfit. ‘Member Gino Odjick?

His second-half performance is even more peculiar. After landing awkwardly on a diving catch attempt, he didn't see the field much.

Here are the latest injury updates for the Dallas wide receiver.  NFL HQ: Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule Officially, we don't know. The assumption is yes, he is, but the Cowboys have not given him an injury designation. Lamb did not go to the medical tent, though. He is likely dealing with a sore injury, but Dallas had a two-possession lead when Lamb exited the game. The Cowboys could be exercising caution to make sure he doesn't aggravate the injury more. Officially, Lamb is just spending time on the sideline. Unofficially, he keeps favoring his shoulder and moving it around, so it seems like he is dealing with an injury, even a minor one.  This post will be updated with any relevant post-game comments about Lamb.  Teddy Ricketson is a Digital Content Producer at The Sporting News.

With New York down to Drew Lock and Dallas trotting out Cooper Rush in place of an injured Dak Prescott, quarterback play was never expected to be at its best — but Brady put the focus on the quarterback who wasn't there. Brady ripped the way Daniel Jones handled his exit from the Giants, calling out the new Vikings QB for requesting his release after he was benched and demoted to the very bottom of the depth chart in New York. Here's what Brady had to say about Jones' situation and what he would have done differently. MORE: Ranking the Giants' 8 best QB options for 2025 Brady sharply criticized Jones for requesting his release last week, arguing that he would have handled the situation much differently. ""I don't know how the whole situation went down,"" Brady said during Thursday's broadcast, ""but to think that you would ask for a release from a team that committed a lot to you is maybe different than how I would've handled that."" The Giants benched Jones after a rocky first 10 games, but there was a bit more to the situation than just poor performance. Jones' contract included an injury guarantee, meaning the team was incentivized to sit him and avoid risking a major injury that might leave them on the hook for an additional $23 million. Not only did the Giants bench Jones, but they demoted him to No. 4 on the depth chart and had him function as a scout team safety during practice. Jones read an emotional statement after practice last Thursday, thanking the organization and its fans, and he requested his release the following day.  Brady wouldn't have done the same, he claims. He explained that he didn't back down when ""challenges"" inevitably came his way during his 23-year NFL career and said he still ""showed up every day"" regardless of what wasn't going his way.  Team owner Tom Brady throws some shade at Daniel Jones for requesting his release from the Giants after getting benched pic.twitter.com/tve9TXOMf4 ""Some things didn't go the way I wanted, but the people that mattered the most to me were the guys in the locker room. I showed up every day,"" Brady said. ""I don't care if they asked me to be scout team safety, scout team quarterback. I was going to do whatever I could to help the team win."" NFL HQ: Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule Brady, of course, didn't quite face the same circumstances as Jones at any point in his career. The seven-time Super Bowl champion did start his career as a backup, but that's standard for a sixth-round pick. Once he took over as the Patriots' starter, Brady won his first Super Bowl and never looked back. He wasn't benched, nor did he come close to being benched, let alone demoted, from No. 1 to No. 4 on the depth chart. The ultimate competitor, Brady seems to know exactly how he would approach such a situation — and it wouldn't be the same way Jones approached it. Brady is notably a minority owner of the Raiders, who were speculated as a potential landing spot for Jones after Gardner Minshew's season-ending collarbone injury. Jones and the Vikings have at least three more games on Fox, which opens the door for Brady to call one of their games, but the former Giants QB likely won't be seeing the field in Minnesota unless Sam Darnold goes down with an injury.

MORE: Inside the Dodgers' nearly $1 billion worth of deferred contracts Ohtani claims that Mizuhara purchased $325,000 worth of trading cards from online resale platforms eBay and WhatNot between January and March 2024. The money Mizuhara used to buy the cards was reportedly siphoned out of Ohtani's bank account. Mizuhara is facing charges of bank fraud and subscribing to a false tax return, crimes that could carry a sentence of more than 30 years in federal prison. His sentencing was initially scheduled for Dec. 20. On Wednesday, the trial was moved back until Jan. 24. Ohtani was granted a hearing to recoup the cards. He'll return to court on Dec. 20. In court filings, the tradings cards are described as ""collectible sports cards found in silver and black Panopply case; collectible sports cards found in gray Panopply case; box containing collectible sports cards; card wrap device; and plastic card protectors holders.” Mizuhara could be tasked with shelling out nearly $17 million in restitution to Ohtani, as well as more than $1 million to the IRS, if he is convicted of the crimes he's accused of. A legal permanent resident with a green card, Mizuhara could also face deportation back to Japan. David Suggs is a content producer at The Sporting News.

The competition, which has been contested annually since 2000, will move to a four-year cycle to be played the year before the FIFA World Cup. As such, the Club World Cup has also been expanded to a larger field to accommodate the continental champions from the entirety of the previous four years, plus a few additional participants. In its place on an annual basis will be the newly minted FIFA Intercontinental Cup, which will keep the semblance of the Club World Cup's old format along with a few tweaks. The name is taken from the defunct annual match played between the champions of Europe and South America, which was played for the last time in 2004. The Sporting News has all the details of the coming changes to the FIFA tournaments as the world governing body hopes to craft a club competition with the gravity and weight of its international sister tournament. MORE: All the matchups, dates, and venues for the 2024 Copa America in the United States The 2025 Club World Cup will feature a 32-team field with teams from all around the globe, to be contested from June 15, 2025 to July 13, 2025. A draw and exact fixture schedule has yet to be determined, as not all of the participants have yet been determined. The dates were worked around the international match calendar, which allows time between the end of the competition and the beginning of European domestic club seasons. However, with North and South American leagues playing a calendar-year schedule, clubs from CONCACAF and CONMEBOL will have to sort out how to fit the competition into their regular season calendar. All but two confederations were awarded four slots. UEFA was given 12 spots, with CONMEBOL granted six and OFC given one. Additionally, the host nation will also get one additional participant via a nomination system that will often carry some (potentially peripheral) competitive basis but also largely will be chosen to maximize the tournament's profile. Clubs will qualify for the tournament by winning a continental title within each four-year cycle. Should a club win multiple continental crowns, the runners-up from that year will also qualify. To begin the new format in the 2025 tournament, FIFA is back-dating its qualifying method, which will see some clubs qualify despite having already secured past Club World Cup berths. The final 'host' nation spot was awarded to 2024 MLS Supporters' Shield winners Inter Miami to allow Lionel Messi the chance to compete in the event. * Because the AFC moved its continental tournament from a calendar-year schedule to a European-league schedule, there are only three title winners from this four-year cycle. Thus, an additional qualifier was awarded via the confederation's club ranking.** Because Al Ahly won the CAF Champions League three times in this four-year cycle (2021/22, 2022/23, 2023/24), two additional qualifiers were awarded via the confederation's club ranking.*** If River Plate win the 2024 Copa Libertadores, Olimpia will qualify as the next highest-ranked CONMEBOL club. If another side wins the 2024 Copa Libertadores and qualifies in that manner, River Plate will qualify based on CONMEBOL ranking.**** Because Real Madrid won the UEFA Champions League two times in this four-year cycle, an additional qualifier was awarded via the confederation's club ranking. FIFA approved its newest club ranking system in late 2023, which will be heavily utilised for qualification to the Club World Cup. Starting from the group stage of the confederation's relevant premier club competition, teams will earn three points for a group-stage win and one point for a draw, plus three points for progression to each successive knockout stage. However, there is one exception. For this competition only, UEFA will use its current coefficient ranking system. As per that system, European clubs will earn two points for a group-stage win and one point for a draw, plus four points for qualification for the group stage, five points for qualification for the Round of 16, and one point for progress to each stage of the competition thereafter. The host cities for the 2025 Club World Cup were announced in late September. Notably, the host cities are nearly all east of the Mississippi River, which was done purposely. Because the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup will be contested in the United States at the same time, to keep travel minimized, the two competitions were collaboratively split. With just two exceptions, the Club World Cup was largely kept to east coast venues, while Gold Cup matches were arranged throughout the western half of the country. 2025 Club World Cup venues are as follows: Every four years, the 32-team FIFA Club World Cup will be contested over the course of a month, and be formatted with a group stage and a knockout stage that will be familiar to many football fans, as it has been utilised for both the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA Champions League in the past (although both systems are set to be replaced in the coming edition of those competitions). The 32 teams will be drawn into a group stage featuring eight groups of four, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage. From there, 16 teams will contest the single-elimination knockout stage, progressing from the Round of 16 through to the final. Notably, there will be no third-place playoff in this tournament. With the Club World Cup moving to a four-year cycle, just like the international World Cup, FIFA has crafted a brand new tournament — based on an old one — to be played on an annual basis. The FIFA Intercontinental Cup will debut in 2024, which will be similar (but not an exact replica) of the current, soon-to-be replaced Club World Cup. The name is taken from the defunct showpiece match played between the champions of Europe and South America, which ran from 1960 until 2004. In the Intercontinental Cup, the global continental champions will play through a single-elimination knockout tournament. Unlike the current Club World Cup, where the CONMEBOL and UEFA champions are given byes to the semifinals, the UEFA champion will be immediately awarded a place in the Intercontinental Cup final, against the qualifier who emerges from the earlier rounds of the competition. The competition will be formatted as follows: Round 1: Round 2:  Playoff (December 14, 2024): Final (December 18, 2024): *The AFC Champions League winner and CAF Champions League winner will rotate Round 1 and Round 2 qualification on an annual basis, with an initial draw determining that 2024 would see AFC into Round 1 and CAF into Round 2.

 WATCH THE 2025 CLUB WORLD CUP DRAW ON FIFA+ While FIFA has not yet published a full dossier on the draw procedures, it can be assumed that the 2025 Club World Cup draw will likely mirror the old FIFA World Cup draw format, either closely or exactly. With 32 teams set to enter the competition — the same amount the World Cup boasted for decades before 2026 expansion — it's likely that the draw procedure will look identical to the former World Cup format. This will see teams placed into four ""pots"" based on global stature. While nations in the World Cup were easily divided up into four pots based on FIFA ranking, it's unclear how FIFA will divvy up the clubs into various pots. From there, they will be drawn into eight groups of four, with one team from each pot in every group. Likely, there will be a few rules restricting the construction of the groups. First and foremost, just like at the World Cup draw, it's likely that teams from the same continent cannot be pulled into the same group, with the exception of European clubs who can have two per group due to numerical superiority.

Hailing from the North Caucasus, not Dagestan, Umalatov beat everyone the promotion put in front of him but never reached the championships – or even the playoffs – through three seasons with the PFL. In 2021 he was not in the season proper, ‘22 it was visa issues, and ‘23 an injury kept him out. UMALATOV FLATLINES DILANO TAYLOR TO START THE FIGHTS #PFL3 pic.twitter.com/WRMLMohfE1 As a result, many anointed him as the next to take the crown if only he could avoid external barriers. And here he is, standing at the threshold. However, his upcoming opponent has gone from strength to strength while Umalatov underperformed against Neiman Gracie in the semi-finals, being unable to finish the grandson of BJJ royalty despite promising to do so in the first round. Gracie has rounded out his MMA game somewhat but the fight seemed a layup of a stylistic matchup for the 'Prince' Umalatov, who has a strong wrestling background, of course, but is also somewhat of a knockout artist; he has a 65% KO rate over his seventeen loss-less fights, as much with strikes as with ground and pound. Magomed Umalatov remains undefeated at 16-0.Brennan Ward retired after this loss. pic.twitter.com/cIauuAfhho Cardio has also proven to be somewhat of an issue for Umalatov, as is strength of schedule. His best win is either Andrey Koreshkov or Dilano Taylor, who are good fighters, just not really in the same realm as Shamil Musaev resides in right now. Another undefeated Russian, Musaev remained largely unknown to Western fans until he made a statement in his PFL debut by stopping former Bellator interim welterweight champion Logan Storley in the early second round after pounding the wrestler from pillar to post in the first.

His natural born Russian wrestling ability shone through as he fought his way through Russia’s regional scene once while being a striking specialist and is now coming off of two straight wins against the (formerly) undefeated Murad Ramazanov, the last Dagestani wrestling sensation that people were convinced would be world champion.

During the same event that Umalatov dropped the third round to Neiman Gracie according to two judges, Musaev dominated Ramazanov for three rounds. MMA math does not work, it’s true, but they are similar archetypes and Ramazanov is the better version,  being in his prime while Gracie is 35.  SHAMIL MUSAEV SNATCHES RAMAZANOV'S UNDEFEATED RECORD!#PFLRegularSeason LIVE NOW🇺🇸 ESPN+🌎 https://t.co/jPNvomCxHI pic.twitter.com/iz7UtPwZp9 I do think this is a close fight on paper, but Shamil Musaev should have the tools to edge past Magomed Umalatov, especially if Umalatov fades down the stretch again.

In recent years, the Braves have dished out lucrative extensions to star players like Ronald Acuña Jr., Austin Riley, and Spencer Strider. But there was one All-Star that Atlanta was never able to lock down before he hit free agency: Max Fried. Fried, a 30-year-old lefty with a 73-36 career record, expects to command a nine-figure contract this winter. The Braves don't seem particularly interested in entering a bidding war to bring him back, which could spell doom if the list of potential suitors keep growing. The Toronto Blue Jays are one of the many teams in the Juan Soto sweepstakes, but they also finished in last place in 2024. They're one of the biggest wild cards in this winter's free agency showdown, because no one really knows which direction they could swing.  For now, though, the Blue Jays are a serious threat to steal Fried. Ben Nicholson-Smith of Sportsnet reported Thursday that Toronto is interested in signing the two-time All-Star to join their starting rotation. ""They’re in on Soto, have interest in players such as Max Fried... yet president and CEO Mark Shapiro said in early October he expected payroll to be similar to what it was in 2024, most of that is already spoken for and there’s little certainty on the roster beyond next year,"" Nicholson-Smith said.   Nicholson-Smith's portrait of the Blue Jays portrays them as a team caught in limbo, and desperate to climb back into contention. If they do miss on Soto, it's highly possible the Blue Jays could immediately pivot their attention to Fried, perhaps even overpaying to make sure they land him. Toronto wouldn't be the worst place for Fried to sign from the Braves' point of view, but any new uniform will look strange on the long-time Atlanta star. And if the Braves aren't willing to put up much of a fight to keep him, then they certainly can't be picky.

On Thanksgiving, Chicago found a brand new way to lose. What looked like a game-tying drive at the very least went off the rails when the Bears refused to use a timeout after Caleb Williams was sacked in the fourth quarter. Rather than using a timeout and running a play to position themselves for a field goal, Chicago let the clock run all the way down to the final seconds. By the time Williams' third-and-26 pass fell incomplete, the clock had hit zero. The Bears lost 23-20 to the Lions, falling to 4-8 on the season. A wild end to this one. #CHIvsDET pic.twitter.com/zwR7g1Efv9 While some questioned Williams' awareness, most of the blame from fans was directed toward coach Matt Eberflus and the coaching staff for not stepping in and calling timeout when they could. After the game, Bears players and Eberflus seemed to blame everyone but themselves. Here's a look at what players and coaches had to say about the Bears' disastrous final sequence in Detroit. MORE BEARS-LIONS: Bears players had mixed messages after Thursday's loss, but the consensus was clear: they weren't sure why the game ended the way it did. ""I think we as players did enough to win,"" WR Keenan Allen told reporters, seemingly placing blame on the coaching staff for the defeat. WR DJ Moore similarly put some blame on the coaching staff without saying it directly, telling reporters, ""I don't know why we didn't take a timeout."" ""Like I said, I don't know why we didn't take a timeout.""DJ Moore on the final play of the game. pic.twitter.com/vxScEmEAjL Even Williams didn't rush to take accountability despite letting all of that time come off the clock at the end of the game. The rookie said he was ""living with the call and letting coaches make that decision"" regarding a timeout. Eberflus, meanwhile, said he wanted to run a quick play and then use his final timeout, hinting at miscommunication between himself and his rookie quarterback. As for a breakdown in communication, Williams said there wasn't much communication with Eberflus in that moment. ""I don't have a microphone to speak to coach or anything like that,"" he said. MORE NFL: Other Bears were baffled by the sequence, as well, with TE Cole Kmet nearly speechless about what led to the clock running out. ""Honestly ... I don't even know,"" he told reporters, adding that the Bears ultimately need to avoid taking a sack in that situation. Asked why he thinks the Bears keep losing games, CB Kyler Gordon shook his head and told reporters, ""Next question. No comment."" ""Next question. No comment.""Kyler Gordon on if there's an underlying reason for these close losses. pic.twitter.com/NEvG7R2yI4 Losing is one way for a coach to get fired, but losing the trust of the players is a much quicker way. Comments by players after Thursday's loss certainly raise questions about how much respect Eberflus commands in the locker room, even if he wasn't directly called out by anyone. Eberflus struck both chords in his postgame press conference, telling reporters that accountability ""starts with me"" but expressing little regret about the messy final sequence of the game. ""I like what we did there ... I think we handled it the right way,"" Eberflus said, explaining that he wanted to run a play and then call a timeout before attempting a field goal. #Bears HC Matt Eberflus defended his decision not to use the timeout: “I like what we did there. ... I think we handled it the right way. ... Didn't work out the way we wanted it to.” pic.twitter.com/dod3i2rMTh https://t.co/BWdfdK1EVP On one hand, the logic works. Moving quickly and running a play with a timeout in hand would allow the Bears to use the entire field knowing they could definitely stop the clock. Once Eberflus recognized that Williams and the offense weren't prepared to run a quick play, however, there was little choice but to use the timeout and preserve some time even if the situation wasn't ideal. Eberflus decided against the timeout, and the Bears never got the chance to try even a long-range field goal. As Eberflus fights for his job, comments that many might perceive as tone-deaf about that final sequence will only add to the pressure the third-year coach is facing.

Milano, the Bills’ veteran linebacker, practiced with the team on Wednesday. Milano has missed all 11 games of the 2024 season thus far after suffering a torn bicep during practice in August. Bills coach Sean McDermott didn’t rule Milano out for Sunday’s game against the San Francisco 49ers but was cautious to update his linebacker’s status. “Probably what you would expect just in terms of getting back into the flow, endurance, because he hasn’t played football in quite some time,” McDermott said at his Wednesday press conference. “Really just trying to take it one day at a time, one play at a time, not to sound like it’s coach speak, but that’s really what we’re looking at.” Buffalo has one of the NFL’s best defenses. The Bills are seventh in the league in points allowed per game (19.5) and have held opponents under 30 points in 10 of 11 contests this year. Milano’s insertion back to the lineup would only make the unit better.  The linebacker has played in Buffalo since entering the NFL in 2017. He earned First-Team All-Pro honors in 2022 and has logged 488 total tackles and 10 interceptions in seven seasons. Sunday’s game against the 49ers begins at 8:20 p.m. ET.

A surprise National League Championship Series run was a breath of fresh air for the Mets and their fans, but the 2025 season was always going to be the one with heightened expectations. Now, it's World Series or bust at Citi Field. The Mets are currently chasing hard after Juan Soto on the free-agent market, but regardless of whether or not they land the superstar outfielder, they can still make big waves on the open market. Including, perhaps, at the back end of their bullpen. The Mets have their closer locked down for the next three seasons, for better or worse, in the form of Edwin Díaz. But their bullpen was still fairly shaky in 2024, Díaz included, finishing 17th in MLB with a 4.03 reliever ERA.  Cale Ahearn of FOX 43 believes the Mets will land another closer type to pair with Díaz at the end of games. He predicted that Tanner Scott of the San Diego Padres would sign in Queens on a four-year, $54 million contract. ""In the same vein of the Mets re-signing Sean Manaea, I think the team continues their offseason splurge to bring in the top reliever in the lefthander Scott,"" Ahearn said. ""New York faces quite a few strong lefty bats throughout the National League East division, so having one of the best lefthanded arms to combat that along with closer Edwin Diaz would create a formidable Mets bullpen."" If the Mets are looking for a lockdown reliever, the 30-year-old Scott is the best they'll be able to find this winter. The 2024 National League All-Star has pitched to a minuscule 2.04 ERA in 150 innings since the start of 2023, racking up 188 strikeouts. Signing Scott would be something of a surprise, if only because the Mets already have one high-priced closer, Díaz, locked up for $19 million per season. But this is a team owned by Steve Cohen (net worth: over $21 billion), so literally anything is possible.  More MLB: Mets predicted to bring $60 million breakout star back to Queens in free agency Jackson Roberts is a former Division III All-Region DH who now writes and talks about sports for a living.

The Browns and Steelers battled it out in a classic AFC North matchup, with white snow powdering the field in Cleveland.  Could a second snow game be on deck for Thanksgiving? It's certainly possible.  While weather won't play a factor for either Lions vs. Bears or Cowboys vs. Giants (both Detroit and New York play indoors), it's possible that the finale of the NFL Thanksgiving slate is impacted by the weather. The Thursday night contest between the Packers and Dolphins is set to take place at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, where weather is always a variable to consider this time of the year.  For Dolphins fans making the trek up north, it will be far from the sunny weather in South Florida. Tua Tagovailoa and Co. are going to have their hands full with a cold night game against Jordan Love and the Packers.  Will there be snow at Lambeau on the holiday? Here's what to know about the forecast for Dolphins-Packers.  NFL HQ: Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule This section will be updated throughout Thanksgiving with weather updates. 6:15 p.m. ET -- Just under two hours until kickoff. It is currently 26 degrees at Lambeau, with a real feel of 12 degrees. The wind is blowing steady at 14 mph, and gusting at 23 mph. While it is dry now, flurries are expected to start in about an hour.  1:45 p.m. ET -- There are still about eight hours left until kickoff. It is currently 33 degrees at Lambeau, with a real feel of 20 degrees. It's not currently snowing, although flurries are in the forecast for later in the evening.  The forecast for the Dolphins-Packers game is calling for a cold night in typical Green Bay fashion. The temperatures are expected to be as low as 19 degrees, with winds also coming into play that could make the atmosphere even frostier, according to Weather.com. It's anticipated to be a cloudy night in Wisconsin for the action.  In terms of snow, there is a chance — but a small one. Entering Thanksgiving, there is a 9% chance that Lambeau Field gets snow on Thursday night, per Weather.com.

This trend continues with their latest acquisition, 4-star Dennis Uzochukwu. Uzochukwu is a formidable figure, standing at a terrifying six-foot-six, 285 pounds. The Lawrenceville native had been committed to Georgia State for some time but surprised the world when he announced his flip to Georgia on Thanksgiving.  This new acquisition is certainly something for Bulldog fans to be thankful for -- he’s ranked the No. 42 OT in the country. Maintaining a status quo of dominance in the trenches in the NIL era is not easy, but Georgia continues to bring in talent from its resource-rich region. The beast can also play defensive end, admittedly, he likely will not need to during his time with UGA. However, if necessary, who knows if he’ll see playing time. The Bulldogs are certain to be players in the transfer portal to fortify their ranks. And money talks in Athens. We’ve seen players in college football play multiple positions on both sides of the ball this year, most notably from Colorado’s Travis Hunter, though, Ole Miss’ JJ Pegues is much more like the style of two-way player Uzochukwu embodies. Regardless of whether he’ll play both sides of the ball, Uzochukwu is a massive pickup for the top-recruited team in the country, and will likely contribute to the Bulldogs’ continued success.

They'd hardly changed a thing about their roster from the season before, and after back-to-back deep postseason runs, they believed they were primed to win it all. Instead, they washed out of the playoffs almost as soon as they started. A four-game series loss to the hated New York Mets let the Phillies know that they were a lot farther from a title than they believed, and there's work to do this winter to get them back on track. One of the biggest goals for the Phillies will be to find a fifth starting pitcher to join their strong rotation, because Taijuan Walker and the rotating cast of characters in that role essentially amounted to an automatic loss in 2024. How about a postseason legend to fill that slot? Nathan Eovaldi recently became a free agent after declining a club option to return to the Texas Rangers in 2025. Jacob Hitz of FOX 43 recently predicted that Eovaldi would sign with the Phillies on a two-year, $45 million contract. I've been begging for the Phillies to add another starter to the rotation since the '24 season began. With prospect Andrew Painter still recovering from Tommy John surgery, he won't be ready for the big leagues for a while,"" Hitz said. Taijuan Walker proved he's not the guy. Spencer Turnbull, signed as a reliever, briefly took over as a starter until injuries sidelined him for the rest of the year. I think Eovaldi is a solid option, and perhaps the best affordable option for the Phillies, without sacrificing too much quality. Eovaldi, who will be 35 next season, has put together a steady run in the regular season, with a 41-25 record and 3.76 ERA since the start of 2021. But he's truly filthy in the playoffs, where he owns a career 3.05 ERA, two World Series rings, and went 5-0 in 2023 in six starts.

We all have things to be thankful for in our personal lives: friends, family, health. So, in the spirit of Thanksgiving, here are seven NHL teams with the most to be thankful for. Martin Necas signed a bridge deal with the Hurricanes this offseason. But even with just two years on the contract, $6.5 million a year is still an investment in a league with a hard salary cap. Well, that deal isn’t looking too great right now– he’s been playing so well, it’s becoming apparent that Carolina should have tried harder to lock him up long-term. Necas is currently the league leader in points with 37 in 22 games played. He started the season well, but found a new gear this month. In 13 games played this November, Necas has seven goals and 15 assists.  Kirill Kaprizov might be the current frontrunner for the Hart Trophy. He has 35 points through 21 games played this season, which ties him for second in the league. His 14 goals are tied for the fifth most in the league. So when a knee-on-knee hit caused him to miss Minnesota’s game against Calgary on November 23rd, fans were rightfully concerned. But after an MRI showed that his injury wasn’t serious, he reentered the lineup last night against the Buffalo Sabres, and scored the only goal of the game, which extended his road-game point streak to 12 games.  Fans of the San Jose Sharks haven’t had much to be excited about in recent years. They haven’t made the playoffs since 2019. They traded away most of their franchise players– Brent Burns, Timo Meier, Erik Karlsson, and most recently, Tomáš Hertl. But things are finally looking up in San Jose. Macklin Celebrini, the first overall pick in the 2024 NHL draft, has been an immediate impact player for them. He has 11 points through his first 13 NHL games, and two of his seven goals are game-winners. The Boston Bruins firing Head Coach Jim Montgomery was a bit of a head scratcher, as he won the Jack Adams Award in 2022-23. Montgomery had a record of 120-41-23 with Boston, and 180-84-33 all time. But the St. Louis Blues certainly weren’t complaining, because they fired their current Head Coach Drew Bannister, and signed Montgomery to a five-year contract just five days after Boston fired him. The Blues are 2-0 in the Montgomery era. Tampa Bay made headlines this summer for all the wrong reasons when they chose not to re-sign Steven Stamkos. Stamkos had been with the organization for 16 years, and had been the captain for nine. They let Stamkos walk in Free Agency, and instead traded for Jake Guentzel’s rights and signed him to a seven-year contract. This decision stunned the hockey world, but this is a business, and so far, this decision is proving to be the right one. Guentzel has nine goals through 21 games with Tampa, and is a point-per-game player. Alex Ovechkin suffered a fractured left fibula during a 6-2 victory over the Utah Hockey Club on  November 18th. Since then, the team is 2-2, but both victories were vastly different. The first, a 4-1 win, was a defensive clinic against the reigning Stanley Cup Champion Florida Panthers. The second came last night in Tampa Bay. The final score was 5-4, and it featured a shorthanded goal, a bottom six goal, and a power play goal. It’s a good sign that the team has been able to get it done offensively without their leading goalscorer.  What can be said about the Winnipeg Jets at this point that hasn’t been said already? They’re 18-5 on the year. They’ve emerged victorious in all three games that have gone to overtime. They have the best power play in the league, which is firing at a 33.8% success rate. But night in and night out, their best player has been their starting goaltender, Connor Hellebuyck. Hellebuyck has a .928 SV%. He has a 2.11 GAA in 18 games played, and he leads the league with three shutouts. He won the Vezina last season, and at this rate, he might very well just run it back.

For a while, it looked like the story of the game would be Caleb Williams' remarkable second-half play, but coach Matt Eberflus one-upped him with baffling clock management that overshadowed the rookie's performance. Here's what happened at the end of the Bears-Lions game.  NFL HQ: Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule With 36 seconds left, the Bears were set up on Detroit's 36-yard line — well within range to at least tie the game at 23 and send things into overtime. However, on the 2nd-and-20 play, Williams got sacked at the Detroit 41. Z-Man got 'em and that'll do it!#DefendTheDen#CHIvsDET | 📺 CBS pic.twitter.com/a8j91rhpCJ  When he went down there were 36 seconds left in the game, and Chicago still had one timeout. Bears coach Matt Eberflus chose not to use it, instead allowing the clock to tick down, likely in case he needed to use the timeout to set up a field goal or try to win the game. It took 10 seconds for Williams to get up and get his bearings. He then started signaling a play to his teammates. Williams was in the shotgun with the center ready to snap the ball with 12 seconds left.  The rookie continued surveying the defense, and he eventually called for the snap with six seconds left in the game. He threw it deep for Rome Odunze, but the ball sailed over his head at the five-yard line. When it his the ground, the clock read zero and the game is over. A wild end to this one. #CHIvsDET pic.twitter.com/zwR7g1Efv9  Chicago loses with one timeout on the clock. It was an absolutely embarrassing final play in what had been an impressive second half for the team where they nearly erased a 16-0 halftime deficit.  MORE BEARS-LIONS: Eberflus talked to the media after the game. It's tough to tell how he truly feels because you can argue that he is being honest, and you can argue that it is all coach speak. Regardless, the head coach said, ""I think we handled it the right way. It didn't work out the way we wanted to. Matt Eberflus explains why he didn't use the final timeout at the end of the game. pic.twitter.com/HlWuFt9uQe Williams also talked about the final game in his postgame availability.  Caleb Williams when asked whether calling a timeout late in the 4th Q is above his pay grade: “In that situation, I’m living with the call and letting coaches make that decision…maybe in the later years of my career (he may call a timeout himself), right now I get the call and… Had Williams and the Bears been able to complete the comeback, the final drive would have unquestionably been the high point of Williams' rookie season. Chicago got the ball back down 23-20 with 3:41 left in the game. The Bears' drive started on the one-yard line after a 61-yard punt by Lions punter Jake Fox. Williams started things by hitting wide receiver Keenan Allen for a six-yard gain. Ben Niemann ripped Allen's helmet off on the tackle, and the veteran wide receiver couldn't believe that no flag was thrown. He argued his case and threw the ball angrily toward the feet of the ref. When the flag finally was thrown, Allen was assessed an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty.  This set the tone for the rest of the team's final drive. Williams was sacked three times, but he also escaped trouble and kept things alive with big plays on 3rd- and 4th-down. The Bears' offense dinked-and-dunked its way down the field, benefitting from a 29-yard defensive pass interference call on 4th-and-14 with 56 seconds left. With 46 seconds left in the game, Chicago had 1st-and-10 on the Detroit 25. Williams had an incomplete pass on first down, and the Bears had to burn their second timeout to avoid a delay-of-game. After the timeout, Allen had a 13-yard reception called back due to illegal use of hands to the face on the offense.  That pushed Chicago back to the 35 and set up the sack on 2nd-and-20 and subsequent confusion on ahead of the game's final play.

Dropping a tightly contested match to an 11-1 team isn't disastrous; losing to Detroit in the nature that Chicago did might have been. The Bears effectively handed the Lions a victory in the game's waning moments, allowing the clock to dwindle down instead of calling a timeout on third-and-long inside Detroit territory. Caleb Williams offered a glimpse of his impressive potential, tossing three scores to power Chicago's second-half comeback efforts. Yet, it was his lack of urgency and indecision on the game's final sequence that might linger most in spectators' minds. A wild end to this one. #CHIvsDET pic.twitter.com/zwR7g1Efv9 Still, Williams' indiscretion was nothing to that of veteran coach Matt Eberflus, who — seeing his quarterback struggle to get a play off — let time slip away. Eberflus has cut a frustrating figure in the Bears locker room as of late. On Thursday, his foibles reached a fever pitch. Now, some are wondering whether he'll be in a Chicago headset for much longer. Here's what you need to know. MORE BEARS-LIONS: Eberflus' struggles surfaced in the most devastating of ways on Thursday afternoon. Chicago's play-caller opted against calling a timeout in the waning moments of a 23-20 game, leading to a haphazard Hail Mary toss and loss to division leaders Detroit. The nature of Thursday's defeat laid bare Eberflus' late-game toils. He's been a historically ineffective tactician when the lights are at their brightest, as detailed by the Associated Press' Josh Dubow. 221 coaches have had 20+ career games decided by 7 points or fewer. Matt Eberflus' .227 win percentage in those games (5-17) ranks 221st When queried on the nature of Chicago's end-of-game antics — namely, the team's final two play calls — Eberflus explained that he had hoped that the Bears would run a quick-hitter from Detroit's 41-yard line with 18 seconds left before using their timeout to bring the kick team on the field. ""Our hope was, because it was third going into fourth, that we would re-rack that play at 18 seconds, throw it in bounds, get into field goal range, and then call timeout,"" Eberflus said. ""We liked the play that we had, and we were hoping that [Williams] was going to call it. ""I liked what we did there. ... I think we handled it the right way. ... Didn't work out the way we wanted it to."" Matt Eberflus on why they didn’t use the final timeout at the end of the game:“I think I handled it correctly.” 😂pic.twitter.com/B3FVFR3YT6 Eberflus didn't reveal specifics on the play itself, but he did assert that the play was directed towards ""the inside."" NFL HQ: Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule ""We've just got to do a better job together to re-rack that play, get it off, and then call a timeout once it's in bounds,"" Eberflus added. Eberflus acknowledged his role in the mayhem that took hold of the Bears at the end of the fourth. ""I'm the head football coach, so I'm taking the blame, of course,"" Eberflus said. ""That's what you do. We didn't get it done. It starts at the top and it starts right here."" It's unclear whether he'll get a chance to answer for his errors in Chicago's coming few games, however. His seat was already percolating — there's a reason why he had to cut ties with hand-picked offensive coordinator Shane Waldron. And with players already appearing to have issued votes of no confidence toward the 54-year-old coach, the clock might be ticking on Eberflus' reign in the Windy City.

Spurs are aiming to bounce back from a shock defeat against Galatasaray last time out, while Roma will be desperate to end their poor run of form and secure a much-needed victory. Tottenham have been in impressive form in the Europa League this season, winning three of their four matches so far. However, their 3-2 loss against Galatasaray last time out ended their 100% record in the competition. In the Premier League, Spurs have been somewhat inconsistent, with impressive wins against the likes of Manchester City offset by disappointing defeats to Ipswich Town. Roma, on the other hand, have struggled both domestically and in Europe. The Italian side currently sit 12th in Serie A and have won just one of their four Europa League fixtures. Their recent 1-0 loss against league leaders Napoli extended their run of defeats to three matches in all competitions. This will be the fourth meeting between Tottenham and Roma although they have never met in a competitive match. Both teams have won twice, and the last match ended in a 1-0 victory for Roma. Tottenham will be without the injured duo of Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven, with Radu Dragusin and Ben Davies expected to start in central defense. Rodrigo Bentancur is set to feature to maintain his match fitness, while Will Lankshear and Mikey Moore are both ruled out. For Roma, Paulo Dybala is only fit enough for a place on the bench, while Uzbek international Eldor Shomurodov is sidelined with a muscle injury. Mario Hermoso and Alexis Saelemaekers are closing in on returns to the first team. Forster;  Spence, Dragusin, Davies, Gray;  Sarr, Bentancur, Bergvall;  Johnson, Solanke, Werner  Svilar;  Celik, Mancini, Hummels, Angelino;  Soule, Baldanzi, Cristante, Zalewski;  Dybala, Dovbyk Spurs will be confident of securing all three points against a struggling Roma side. The hosts have been impressive in Europe this season, winning seven consecutive home matches in the Europa League without conceding. Roma, on the other hand, have a woeful record in England and their current form offers little to suggest they can end that dismal run. – Tottenham to win
– Under 2.5 goals
– Solanke to score anytime
– Both teams not to score"

With both sides struggling to find consistency in the competition, this match promises to be a tightly contested affair at the Epet Arena. Match Preview [&#8230;]","Sparta Prague and Atletico Madrid will lock horns for the first time in their respective histories on Tuesday night, as they battle it out in a crucial Champions League encounter. With both sides struggling to find consistency in the competition, this match promises to be a tightly contested affair at the Epet Arena. Sparta Prague have had a mixed start to their Champions League campaign, winning two and losing two of their opening four matches. The Czech outfit sit in 26th place in the overall Champions League table, just one point behind 24th-placed PSV Eindhoven. Striker Victor Olatunji has been a bright spark for Sparta, finding the net on eight occasions this season. Atletico Madrid, on the other hand, have endured a challenging start to their European campaign, losing to both Benfica and Lille. The Spanish giants are currently in 23rd position in the Champions League table, having collected just six points from their opening four matches. However, Atletico’s form in La Liga has been more impressive, with Diego Simeone’s side sitting third in the domestic league, five points behind leaders Barcelona. Sparta Prague’s recent form has been a cause for concern, with the team winning just one of their last six matches in all competitions. Their Champions League campaign has seen them secure a 3-0 victory over Red Bull Salzburg and a 1-1 draw with Stuttgart, but they have since suffered heavy defeats against Manchester City (5-0) and Brest (2-1). Atletico Madrid, on the other hand, have been on a roll, winning their last five matches in all competitions, including a crucial 2-1 victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. The Red and Whites’ recent La Liga form has also been impressive, with a 2-1 win over Alaves keeping them in the hunt for the league title. This will be the first-ever meeting between Sparta Prague and Atletico Madrid, as the two sides have never faced each other in a competitive fixture before. Sparta Prague will be without the services of Veljko Birmancevic (thigh) and Angelo Preciado (knee) due to injury. Atletico Madrid, meanwhile, will once again be without the injured Thomas Lemar, while Robin Le Normand is also unlikely to feature. Vindahl; Vitik, Panak, Cobbaut; Wiesner, Laci, Kairinen, Rynes; Pesek, Olatunji, Rrahmani Oblak; Azpilicueta, Gimenez, Lenglet, Galan; Llorente, De Paul, Barrios, Gallagher; Griezmann, Alvarez This match is expected to be a closely contested affair, with both teams desperate to pick up a positive result. Sparta Prague have shown they can be a tough opponent at home, but Atletico Madrid’s recent form and pedigree in the Champions League suggest they have the edge. The Spanish giants’ ability to grind out results, coupled with their attacking firepower, could prove to be the difference in this encounter. – Atletico Madrid to win
– Under 2.5 goals
– Antoine Griezmann to score anytime"

With Milan seeking a third straight win in the competition and Slovan still searching for their first points, it promises to be an intriguing encounter. Slovan Bratislava are making their Champions League debut this season, but it has been a chastening experience so far. They are one of five teams yet to pick up a single point, sitting bottom of the group with a goal difference of -13. Despite their domestic dominance, Vladimir Weiss’s side have struggled to adapt to the rigors of Europe’s premier club competition. In contrast, AC Milan have bounced back from a slow start to their Champions League campaign. After losing to Liverpool and Bayer Leverkusen, the Rossoneri have recorded impressive victories over Club Brugge and reigning champions Real Madrid. Paulo Fonseca’s men will be aiming to maintain their resurgent form and take a significant step towards securing a place in the knockout stages. Slovan Bratislava’s domestic form has been relatively strong, with just one defeat in 17 matches this season. However, their Champions League performances have been a different story, as they have lost all four of their group stage fixtures so far. The Sky Blues will be desperate to avoid a fifth consecutive defeat in Europe’s premier club competition. Milan’s form has been somewhat erratic, with the Italians winning only eight of their last 25 matches in all competitions. Their mixed domestic results, which include a 0-0 draw against Juventus and a 3-3 draw with Cagliari, have been in stark contrast to their impressive Champions League showings. The Rossoneri will be keen to build on their recent triumphs and cement their position in the top eight. This will be the second meeting between Slovan Bratislava and AC Milan in European competition. The two sides previously faced off in a qualifying tie for the inaugural Champions League in 1992, with the Italian giants emerging victorious on aggregate. Slovan Bratislava will welcome back Kevin Wimmer and Juraj Kucka following the international break. However, they will still be without several first-team regulars as they aim to secure their first points in the Champions League. Milan, on the other hand, will have almost their entire squad available, with the exception of long-term absentees Ismael Bennacer and Alessandro Florenzi. Alvaro Morata is expected to lead the line, supported by the in-form Rafael Leao and Tijjani Reijnders. Slovan Bratislava: Takac, Medvedev, Bajric, Wimmer, Vojtko, Ihnatenko, Barseghyan, Szoke, Gajdos, Mak, Strelec
AC Milan: Maignan, Hernandez, Thiaw, Gabbia, Royal, Fofana Musah, Reijnders, Leao, Pulisic, Morata Despite Slovan Bratislava’s impressive domestic form, their Champions League struggles are unlikely to end against a resurgent AC Milan side. The Rossoneri’s quality and experience should prove too much for the Slovakian champions, and they are tipped to secure a comfortable victory. – AC Milan to win
– Over 2.5 goals
– Alvaro Morata to score anytime"

The Bundesliga heavyweights are looking to bounce back from their recent 4-0 defeat against Liverpool, while the Austrian side seek to build on their 3-1 win over Feyenoord. Leverkusen have enjoyed a mixed start to their European campaign, collecting seven points from their opening three games. Xabi Alonso’s side currently occupy 13th place in the 36-team Champions League table. The German outfit have been boosted by Patrik Schick’s hat-trick in their 5-2 Bundesliga victory over Heidenheim on Saturday, but they will be without several key attackers due to injury. Salzburg, on the other hand, have struggled in Europe this season, losing their first three matches before securing a much-needed 3-1 win over Feyenoord. Pep Lijnders’ young team remain outside the playoff spots in 30th place in the Champions League standings and have lost their last two domestic fixtures against Blau-Weiss Linz and LASK Linz. Leverkusen’s recent form has been inconsistent, with two wins, two draws, and two defeats in their last six matches across all competitions. The Bundesliga side’s 4-0 loss to Liverpool at Anfield marked their first Champions League defeat of the season, but they bounced back with an impressive 5-2 victory over Heidenheim at the weekend. Salzburg, on the other hand, have struggled to find consistency, winning just two of their last six matches in all competitions. Their 3-1 triumph over Feyenoord in the Champions League was a rare bright spot, but the Austrian side have since lost back-to-back domestic fixtures. This will be the first-ever competitive meeting between Bayer Leverkusen and Red Bull Salzburg. The German champions have an impressive record against Austrian opponents in Europe, winning three of their five previous encounters and drawing the other two. Leverkusen will be without several key players, including striker Victor Boniface, midfielders Jonas Hofmann and Amine Adli, and winger Martin Terrier. Jeremie Frimpong is also a doubt after picking up a knock in the win over Heidenheim. For Salzburg, goalkeeper Alexander Schlager returns from suspension, but the visitors will be missing several injured players, including Bryan Okoh, Leandro Morgalla, and Takumu Kawamura. Hradecky; Tella, Tapsoba, Tah, Hincapie; Garcia, Xhaka, Andrich, Grimaldo; Wirtz, Schick Schlager; Dedic, Baidoo, Piatkowski, Terzic; Diambou, Gourna-Douath, Clark; Nene, Konate, Gloukh Despite Salzburg’s recent win over Feyenoord, Leverkusen should have too much quality for the Austrian side, especially with their attacking options depleted by injuries. Alonso’s men will be determined to bounce back from their heavy defeat against Liverpool, and they should have enough firepower to secure a comfortable victory at home. – Leverkusen to win
– Over 2.5 goals
– Patrik Schick to score anytime"

The two sides last met in the 2021-22 group stage, with Atalanta prevailing 1-0 at home and drawing 3-3 in the reverse fixture. Young Boys, the reigning Swiss Super League champions, have endured a dismal start to their Champions League campaign, losing all four of their opening matches. Under the caretaker management of Joel Magnin, the Swiss outfit have scored just once while conceding 11 goals, leaving them rooted to the bottom three. In contrast, Atalanta have been one of the surprise packages in Europe’s elite club competition this season. Piero Gasperini’s men are unbeaten in their first four matches, keeping four clean sheets in the process. Atalanta’s recent form has been impressive, with six consecutive wins across all competitions, including a 3-1 victory over Parma in Serie A on Saturday. Young Boys’ domestic form has been slightly more encouraging, with four points from their last two Swiss Super League fixtures. However, their European woes continue to overshadow any positive results on the home front. Magnin will be hoping his side can end their Champions League drought and secure a much-needed win against the in-form Italians. Atalanta, on the other hand, are flying high both domestically and in Europe. Their 2-0 triumph over Stuttgart on matchday four of the Champions League showcased their defensive solidity and attacking prowess. The Bergamo-based club currently sit second of the Serie A table, level on points with reigning champions Inter Milan. The previous two meetings between Young Boys and Atalanta have been closely contested affairs. In the 2021-22 Champions League group stage, the Italian side won 1-0 at home before being held to a thrilling 3-3 draw in Switzerland, where Luis Muriel’s late strike salvaged a point for Atalanta. Young Boys will be without several key defensive players, including Saidy Janko, Abdu Conte, and Loris Benito, while midfielder Miguel Chaiwa is also sidelined. Atalanta, meanwhile, will be missing the suspended Ederson in midfield, but Lazar Samardzic is expected to deputize effectively. Keller; Athekame, Lauper, Camara, Blum; Males, Lakomy, Ugrinic, Colley; Imeri; Ganzvoula Carnesecchi; Toloi, Hien, Kossounou; Bellanova, Samardzic, De Roon, Ruggeri; De Ketelaere; Lookman, Retegui Atalanta’s superior quality and recent form should prove too much for the struggling Young Boys. Gasperini’s side have been clinical in front of goal and solid at the back, and they will be eager to maintain their unbeaten start to the Champions League campaign. Expect the Italian visitors to secure a comfortable victory in Bern. – Atalanta BC to win
– Atalanta BC to keep a clean sheet
– Ademola Lookman to score anytime"

<h1>Canucks Triumph Over Bruins, Thanks to DeBrusk's Stellar Return and Lankinen's Impenetrable Guard</h1>
<p>In a riveting display of skill and strategy, the <a href=""https://21sports.com/petterssons-power-play-prowess-propels-canucks-over-flames/"">Vancouver Canucks</a> clinched a 2-0 victory against the <a href=""https://21sports.com/pastrnaks-late-strike-seals-bruins-thrilling-comeback-victory-over-blues/"">Boston Bruins</a> on a chilly Tuesday night. The Canucks were powered by Jake DeBrusk's impressive power-play goal and Kevin Lankinen's formidable guard with 32 saves.</p>
<h2>DeBrusk's Exciting Homecoming</h2>
<p>Returning to Boston after seven seasons, DeBrusk, now a Canucks' star, reminded the Bruins what they're missing. He skillfully poked a rebound 5:53 into the second period, marking his third goal in two games and his 16th point in November alone. DeBrusk had recently shown his prowess by scoring twice and assisting once in a narrow 4-3 victory against Ottawa on Saturday.</p>
<h2>Lankinen's Unyielding Defense</h2>
<p>Lankinen's exceptional performance was a critical part of the Canucks' victory. He impressively blocked 13 shots in the second period, followed by another 11 in the third. With about 25 seconds left on the clock, he masterfully thwarted Brad Marchand's attempt to sneak the puck through, securing his second shutout of the season.</p>
<h2>Canucks' Noteworthy Achievements</h2>
<p>The Canucks were also buoyed by the return of forward Brock Boeser, who had been sidelined for seven games due to an upper-body injury sustained on November 7. The team celebrated their eighth consecutive road victory and improved their record to 5-2-2 when they score first. DeBrusk's hot streak continued with him racking up five points in his last five games.</p>
<h3>Bruins Struggle Under Interim Leadership</h3>
<p>The Bruins, now led by interim coach Joe Sacco after Jim Montgomery's recent firing, fell to 2-1. They struggled to make a mark during the game, being held shotless during their fourth power play, which was met with audible frustration from the home crowd.</p>
<h3>Key Game Moments and Stats</h3>
<p>The game's pivotal moment came when Boeser was penalized for interference midway through the third period. However, the Canucks turned the tables and dominated the next two minutes, leaving the Bruins scoreless. In terms of stats, Vancouver outperformed Boston in hits (30-29) and blocked shots (26-11).</p>
<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
<p>The Canucks are set to face off against Pittsburgh on Wednesday night, while the Bruins will be visiting the New York Islanders. The thrilling season continues, and hockey fans are eagerly awaiting the results.</p>

<h1>Zary Seals Flames' Triumph, Rangers Suffer Second Road Loss</h1>
<p>On a thrilling Thursday night, the <a href=""https://21sports.com/dustin-wolf-shines-bright-flames-edge-predators-in-a-goalkeepers-duel/"">Calgary Flames</a> clinched a 3-2 victory over the New York Rangers, thanks to Connor Zary's crucial goal in the third period. <a href=""https://21sports.com/calgarys-flames-ignite-in-overtime-coronato-leads-to-3-2-victory-over-canadiens/"">Matt Coronato</a> and Yegor Sharangovich contributed significantly with each adding a goal and an assist to the Flames' tally. MacKenzie Weegar demonstrated some impressive playmaking skills with three assists.</p>
<h2>Jonathan Huberdeau Achieves Milestone, Dustin Wolf Shines Between the Pipes</h2>
<p>Jonathan Huberdeau, another star for the Flames, hit a significant milestone by bagging his 500th career assist. In the net, Dustin Wolf stood tall, blocking 27 shots, marking his third consecutive victory.</p>
<p>For the Rangers, Alexis Lafreniere and Will Cuylle found the back of the net in a quick succession of just 16 seconds in the second period. Despite the loss, it's worth noting that this is only the second road game the Rangers have lost this season. Goalie Igor Shesterkin remained resilient, saving 46 shots.</p>
<h3>Key Play: Zary's Game-Changing Goal</h3>
<p>The game-changing moment came at 10:34 of the third period when Zary, who had been active on the ice throughout the game, shrugged off a challenge from Kaapo Kakko. He managed to lift the puck over Shesterkin, scoring what would be the game-winning goal.</p>
<h2>Takeaways from the Game</h2>
<p>The Flames showcased their best first period of the season, outshooting the Rangers 20-5. Despite this, they held only a slim one-goal lead heading into the second period. Their power play, which had been lackluster in November, came alive and produced an essential goal for the second game in a row.</p>
<p>The Rangers, on the other hand, relied heavily on their goalkeeper Shesterkin to keep them in the game. Their progress was hindered by four penalties within the first 29 minutes, stalling their momentum.</p>
<h3>Breaking Down the Numbers</h3>
<p>The Flames achieved a feat of 20-plus shots in the first period for the first time since October 25, 2022, when they registered a similar number against Pittsburgh.</p>
<h2>What's Next for Flames and Rangers?</h2>
<p>The Flames will be looking to continue their winning streak at home against the Minnesota Wild on Saturday. The Rangers will conclude their four-game road trip on the same day, facing off against the Edmonton Oilers.</p>

The Flames achieved a feat of 20-plus shots in the first period for the first time since October 25, 2022, when they registered a similar number against Pittsburgh. The Flames will be looking to continue their winning streak at home against the Minnesota Wild on Saturday. The Rangers will conclude their four-game road trip on the same day, facing off against the Edmonton Oilers.

<h1>Chicago Blackhawks Overcome Florida Panthers in Thrilling 3-1 Encounter</h1>

Craig Smith and Nick Foligno also inked their names on the scoreboard, enabling Chicago to halt a hat-trick of consecutive losses. This victory also bolstered their home record to 3-5-0 for the season.</p>
<h2>Mrazek's Impressive Return to Lineup</h2>
<p>Mrazek made a triumphant return to the Blackhawks' lineup after sitting out Tuesday's 3-2 defeat to the Panthers due to personal reasons. He was a pivotal force in Chicago's victory, stopping numerous shots with impeccable skill and precision.</p>
<h2>Teravainen's Power-Play Goal Sets the Tone</h2>
<p>Teravainen set the Blackhawks on the path to victory with an early power-play goal, just 2:46 into the opening period. This marked only his second goal in his recent 17 appearances. Smith later doubled the lead, skillfully converting a breakaway into a goal, thanks to Pat Maroon's assist, 10:07 into the second period. This marked Smith's fifth goal for the campaign.</p>
<h3>Reinhart's Lone Goal for Florida</h3>

<h1>St. Louis Blues Snatch Victory from Sharks, Putting an End to Home Losing Streak</h1>
<p>Jake Neighbours emerged as the shootout star, while Jordan Binnington defied all three attempts by the <a href=""https://21sports.com/robertson-shines-bright-as-dallas-stars-overpower-san-jose-sharks/"">San Jose Sharks</a>, leading the <a href=""https://21sports.com/st-louis-blues-triumph-over-tampa-bay-lightning-in-thrilling-ice-showdown/"">St. Louis Blues</a> to a 3-2 triumph on Thursday night. This win ended a four-game home losing streak for the Blues. Binnington displayed resilience by bouncing back from Alexander Wennberg's equalizing goal with only 8.8 seconds remaining, securing his 151st career victory. This tied him with Mike Liut's franchise record.</p>
<h2>Standout Performances</h2>
<p>Wennberg was the lone double-goalscorer for the Sharks, with Mikael Granlund and <a href=""https://21sports.com/macklin-celebrinis-overtime-goal-fuels-san-jose-sharks-victory-over-detroit-red-wings/"">Macklin Celebrini</a>, the 2024 NHL draft's top pick, providing assists for both goals. For the Blues, Jordan Kyrou and Nathan Walker found the back of the net during regulation time. This marked only the second victory in their last nine matches.</p>
<p>Walker's goal came just 11 seconds into the game, thanks to Radek Faksa's interception of a pass from Sharks' goalie Yaroslav Askarov. Later, Kyrou, positioned between Granlund and Timothy Liljegren, nudged home a pass from Pierre-Olivier Joseph for his sixth goal of the season, with 8:13 remaining in the second.</p>
<h2>Goalkeeper Highlights</h2>
<p>Binnington held the fort with 22 saves, contributing significantly to the Blues' victory, while Askarov managed 29 saves.</p>
<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<p>The Sharks, who have been outscored 28-10 in the season's first period, struggled from the onset, despite netting a first-period goal for the third consecutive game. On the other hand, Binnington, with 295 games under his belt, stands second among goalies in Blues' franchise history. He reached the 151-win milestone in 56 fewer games than Liut, whose record from 1979-1985 stood at 151-133, with 52 ties.</p>
<h3>Game-Changing Moment</h3>
<p>Neighbours played the hero, delivering the shootout victory with a wrist shot that outsmarted Askarov on his glove side.</p>
<h3>Key Statistics</h3>
<p>The Blues have been outscored 14-2 in the third period across their last seven games.</p>
<h3>What's Next?</h3>
<p>The Blues are set to play seven out of their next eight games on the road, commencing Saturday against the New York Islanders. The Sharks, on the other hand, will start a four-game homestand against Buffalo the same day.</p>

<h1>Werenski's Overtime Goal Brings Columbus Blue Jackets a Remarkable Comeback Victory</h1>
<p>Zach Werenski's masterstroke at 1:25 of the overtime session marked the climax of a thrilling game as the <a href=""https://21sports.com/los-angeles-kings-emerge-victorious-in-dominant-performance-against-columbus-blue-jackets/"">Columbus Blue Jackets</a> overcame a three-goal deficit to triumph over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/vasilevskiy-shines-with-stellar-saves-as-lightning-strike-devils-4-0/"">Tampa Bay Lightning</a>, in an electrifying 7-6 victory on Thursday night. Werenski, shining in the spotlight, equalized the game at 4 in the second period and contributed with three assists, helping the Blue Jackets secure their second consecutive win.</p>
<h2>Key Players in the Clash</h2>
<p>Sean Monahan and Dmitri Voronkov greatly supported their team with a goal and three assists and a goal plus an assist, respectively.

<h1>Colorado Avalanche Triumphs Over Washington Capitals in Nail-Biting Encounter</h1>
<h2>Miles Wood Fires Avalanche to Victory</h2>
<p>In an electrifying Thursday night showdown, Colorado Avalanche clinched a tight 2-1 win over <a href=""https://21sports.com/capitals-dominate-avalanche-in-thrilling-5-2-victory-a-night-of-twists-and-triumphs/"">Washington Capitals</a>, with Miles Wood playing the hero as his third-period goal became the decider. Mikko Rantanen, another Avalanche star, also found the net, marking the team's fifth victory in their last six outings.</p>
<h2>Alexandar Georgiev Continues Winning Streak</h2>
<p>Alexandar Georgiev, the formidable Avalanche goaltender, demonstrated his mettle with an awe-inspiring performance that saw him repel 29 shots. This marked his fourth consecutive win after returning from an upper-body injury that sidelined him for two games.</p>
<h2>Capitals Feel the Absence of Ovechkin</h2>
<p>For the Capitals, it was Pierre-Luc Dubois who scored, but the team's winning spree came to an abrupt end, halting at three victories. Logan Thompson, the Capitals goalkeeper, experienced his maiden regulation loss of the season with 25 saves. Earlier, the team was dealt a significant blow as Alex Ovechkin, their superstar, was ruled out for four to six weeks due to a broken left fibula, sustained during their Monday clash against Utah.</p>
<h3>Avalanche's Takeaways</h3>
<p>Despite Nathan MacKinnon failing to score for the second time in three games — both against the Capitals — Rantanen maintained his impressive form, securing points in five of his last six games.</p>
<h3>Capitals' Takeaways</h3>
<p>Without Ovechkin's presence, the Capitals found it difficult to generate momentum offensively. Their usually effective power play, often energized by their captain, went 0 for 2.</p>
<h2>Key Moment of the Match</h2>
<p>The defining moment came just 3:29 into the third period when Wood, positioned at the front of the net, deflected Cale Makar's point shot, sending it past Thompson for the lead.</p>
<h2>Crucial Statistic</h2>
<p>A telling statistic dating back to the 2021-22 season reveals that the Capitals have a dismal 4-14 record without <a href=""https://21sports.com/ovechkins-decisive-strike-propels-capitals-to-victory-over-predators/"">Ovechkin</a> in the team. At the time of his injury, the captain was leading the league with 15 goals, only 27 short of Wayne Gretzky's record.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>The Avalanche is set to square off against the reigning Stanley Cup champions, Florida, on Saturday, while the Capitals will host New Jersey.</p>

<h1>Golden Knights Prevail Over Senators in Hard-Fought Match</h1>
<p>In a hockey game that kept fans on the edge of their seats, the Vegas Golden Knights claimed victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/tkachuks-overtime-magic-propels-senators-to-victory-over-bruins/"">Ottawa Senators</a> with a nail-biting 3-2 score on Thursday night. Ilya Samsonov, who had let in 10 goals over his last two games, bounced back with a remarkable performance, pulling off 38 saves.</p>
<h2>Samsonov's Key Saves Halt Senators' Attack</h2>
<p>Despite the Senators' aggressive play, Samsonov held strong, making crucial saves against formidable players like Josh Norris, David Perron, Tim Stutzle, and Brady Tkachuk. The Senators (8-10-1) find themselves trapped in a four-game losing streak, having scored just two goals throughout their last three games.</p>
<h2>Golden Knights Gain the Upper Hand</h2>
<p>In the initial phase of the game, the Golden Knights (12-6-2) seized control when Linus Ullmark made a spectacular diving save but failed to reposition quickly enough. This left Jack Eichel with an unhindered shot to the net, marking his sixth goal this season. Brett Howden extended their lead to 2-0 in the mid-second period, slipping a goal past Ullmark, who had 29 saves in the game.</p>
<h3>Sensational Third-Period Action</h3>
<p>Adam Gaudette managed to get one past Samsonov 7:17 into the third period, narrowing the lead. However, the Senators' joy was short-lived as Pavel Dorofeyev restored the two-goal lead just two minutes later. Drake Batherson kept the Senators' hopes alive, scoring a goal off a Jake Sanderson rebound with a little over seven minutes left. Despite the Senators outshooting the Golden Knights 18-5 in the third period, they fell short of a comeback.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways and Statistics</h2>
<p>A recurring issue for the Senators has been their habit of conceding the first goal, which has led to eight consecutive losses and a dismal 1-9-1 record when they let in the first goal. On the other hand, the Golden Knights capitalized on an ill-timed Ottawa line change, delivering a swift counter-strike leading to Howden's goal. The Golden Knights have an impressive 12-1-1 track record against the Senators since their entry into the league in 2017.</p>
<h3>What's Next for Both Teams?</h3>
<p>Looking ahead, the Senators are gearing up to host the Vancouver Canucks on Saturday night, while the Golden Knights prepare to face off against the Montreal Canadiens on Saturday afternoon.</p>

Drake Batherson kept the Senators’ hopes alive, scoring a goal off a Jake Sanderson rebound with a little over seven minutes left. Despite the Senators outshooting the Golden Knights 18-5 in the third period, they fell short of a comeback. A recurring issue for the Senators has been their habit of conceding the first goal, which has led to eight consecutive losses and a dismal 1-9-1 record when they let in the first goal. On the other hand, the Golden Knights capitalized on an ill-timed Ottawa line change, delivering a swift counter-strike leading to Howden’s goal. The Golden Knights have an impressive 12-1-1 track record against the Senators since their entry into the league in 2017. Looking ahead, the Senators are gearing up to host the Vancouver Canucks on Saturday night, while the Golden Knights prepare to face off against the Montreal Canadiens on Saturday afternoon.

<h2>Jesper Bratt's Stellar Performance</h2>
<p>Jesper Bratt emerged as the star of the night, scoring twice and assisting another, aiding the <a href=""https://21sports.com/devils-break-panthers-winning-streak-in-nhl-showdown/"">New Jersey Devils</a> in their 4-2 victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/necas-last-minute-heroics-propel-hurricanes-to-seventh-consecutive-victory-over-persistent-flyers/"">Carolina Hurricanes</a> on Thursday. The match saw an impressive display from Devils' defenseman Dougie Hamilton, who seized the lead for the team, 3-2, with just 9:25 left on the clock. This happened after Carolina's Andrei Svechnikov evened the score 12 seconds into the final period.</p>
<p>Bratt managed his tenth goal of the season and his second in the game during a power play, which happened with 5:55 left on the clock. This goal marked the fourth for the Devils. The opening score for Carolina came from Jack Roslovic at 8:43 into the first, but Bratt quickly evened it out with 5:15 remaining in the same period.</p>
<h2>Highlights and Key Players</h2>
<p>Stefan Noesen pushed New Jersey ahead at the beginning of the second period, scoring a power-play goal just 46 seconds into the period. Roslovic, who only managed nine goals in 59 games last season, has significantly improved his performance with 11 goals in 19 games for the Hurricanes.</p>
<p>The Devils' victory was also supported by Jacob Markstrom's 20 saves, while Spencer Martin of the Hurricanes managed 17.</p>
<h2>New Jersey's Takeaways and Carolina's Setback</h2>
<p>Jack Hughes, with three assists under his belt, maintained his robust performance for New Jersey. He is currently second on the team with 25 points, including eight goals.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Hurricanes announced on the same day that veteran goaltender Frederik Andersen is scheduled for knee surgery and will be absent for the next eight to 12 weeks. Andersen, with a record of 3-1-0 this season, will be sorely missed, as Martin fell to a 1-2-0 record.</p>
<h3>Crucial Moments and Stats</h3>
<p>A key moment in the game was when Markstrom denied all seven shots aimed by Carolina in the second period, maintaining it as a one-goal contest. The Devils showed their home prowess with a record of 5-3-2, and an impressive 8-4-0 on the road.</p>
<h3>What's Next?</h3>
<p>The Devils are scheduled to face the Washington Capitals on Saturday, while the Hurricanes will be visiting the Columbus Blue Jackets on the same day.</p>

<h1>A Nail-biting Victory for Detroit Red Wings against New York Islanders</h1>
<p>In a thrilling showdown, <a href=""https://21sports.com/lucas-raymond-inks-lucrative-eight-year-contract-with-detroit-red-wings/"">Lucas Raymond</a>'s incredible goal in the final seconds helped the Detroit Red Wings to a 2-1 victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/islanders-thrilling-rally-overcoming-penguins-in-post-regulation-showdown/"">New York Islanders</a> on Thursday evening. Jonatan Berggren's crucial equalizer also played a pivotal role in breaking Detroit's run of three consecutive losses. The Red Wings' goaltender, Alex Lyon, displayed a remarkable performance with 22 saves.</p>
<p>For the Islanders, the only ray of hope came from Simon Holmstrom, who managed to score the sole goal for his team, unable to reverse their pattern of losses with five out of their last six games ending in defeat. Despite a valiant effort with 29 saves, Islanders' goalie Ilya Sorokin couldn't prevent the defeat.</p>
<h2>The Turning Points of the Game</h2>
<p>Holmstrom sparked the Islanders' spirits by scoring the first goal of the match at 5:51 of the first period, marking his third goal of the season. However, Berggren, with just 4:46 left in the game, managed to level the score with his third goal of the season. The decisive moment came when Raymond, with a skillful assist from Dylan Larkin, netted the puck from the left circle, beating Sorokin's glove with just 51 seconds to spare.</p>
<h3>Key Takeaways from the Game</h3>
<p>The Islanders, despite having the league's worst penalty-kill entering the game, successfully thwarted three power plays from the Red Wings, who boast the second-best power play in the league. Sorokin was instrumental in this, making six crucial saves.</p>
<p>In contrast, Raymond, who had an impressive tally of 31 goals last season, ended his scoring drought with a game-winning goal in the final minute, providing a much-needed boost to the Red Wings.</p>
<h2>Flashback and Key Statistics</h2>
<p>Recalling the teams' first encounter last month, which saw the Red Wings triumph with a 1-0 victory thanks to Patrick Kane's first-period goal, it seemed history might repeat itself with Holmstrom's early goal. However, the Red Wings turned the tide with two goals in the final five minutes of the game.</p>
<p>A noteworthy stat from the game revolves around the Red Wings' knack for comebacks last season, boasting an 11-24-3 record when trailing after two periods. This season, however, they had a 0-8-0 record when down after two periods, a statistic they managed to overturn with their late rally in this game.</p>
<h3>What's Next for the Teams?</h3>
<p>Looking forward, the Islanders will be hosting St. Louis on Saturday, while the Red Wings will welcome Boston to their home ground.</p>

After the Intimidator passed away in 2001, Dale Jr. and his sister Kelley wanted equal ownership rights of the DEI. But, despite the public feud, Teresa didn’t budge and rather claimed that DEI would “make another Dale Jr.” This is what forced Jr.’s hand to leave his father’s racing legacy and move to Hendrick Motorsports. And just like that, Teresa Earnhardt became public enemy No. 1 in the eyes of the fans. Not only DEI but the entire estate of Dale Earnhardt was under the control of Teresa. All that remains of DEI is now nothing short of a museum, which is indeed a bleak representation of Dale Earnhardt’s racing legacy. Anything and everything that was related to the intimidator was under the lawful control of Teresa, and she certainly made most of this power. Interestingly, she also might be the reason behind Kannapolis Intimidators changing their name to Kannapolis Cannon Ballers. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Now, apart from NASCAR, the Intimidator was looking to spread his wings in different sports. Therefore, he purchased an ownership stake in his hometown baseball team that was associated with the Chicago White Sox. He made this purchase in 2000, and the team from Kannapolis, North Carolina, became the Kannapolis Intimidators. Unfortunately, Earnhardt never got to see his team in action as he lost his life in a tragic crash during the 2001 Daytona 500 race. Although the team continued to stick by the name Kannapolis Intimidators until 2019 but decided to change it in 2019. With a new stadium coming up, the new owners decided to rebrand the team completely and opted to go with the new name, Kannapolis Cannon Ballers. While they did have permission to use the nickname Intimidator, it was associated with the late NASCAR driver’s estate, which was under the control of Teresa. There were limitations on the team to trademark the elements of the brand, and therefore they had to make the tough choice. “We really wanted to be thoughtful and careful before we dove in. It was intimidating to think about getting rid of Intimidator’s moniker. But ultimately it was the only practical business decision we could make.” Alicia Amlin, Chief of Staff for Temerity Baseball said. November 28, 2000: The intro press conference for the Kannapolis Intimidators. Dale Earnhardt, Bruton Smith, and Larry Hedrick were introduced as new owners of the baseball team and Sam Bass designed the logo “Maybe we’ll be making Kannapolis a little more exciting for fans.” pic.twitter.com/bofDysxZnT — nascarman (@nascarman_rr) November 28, 2024 Expand Tweet  Did Teresa Earnhardt preserve Dale's legacy, or did she tarnish it with her decisions? Debate But the owners wanted to embrace and honor the culture that embraced Dale Earnhardt so dearly. Although they couldn’t risk being linked to Intimidator, they found a subtle way to ingrain his identity with the team mascot and logo. The human figure with a baseball head had ties to the region’s racing culture. But it was the moustache that paid homage to the former team owner and his ties to the team. Well, if you look closely, the mascot’s face does have similarities to Earnhardt’s, and this isn’t something that Teresa can control. However, now that Dale Jr. has ownership of the #8 number, it seems like the tensions between him and Teresa have simmered down. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Junior has fond memories of running NASCAR races in the iconic #8 car from his DEI days. However, the public feud between him and his stepmother saw him part ways with the team. But something interesting happened this year. The trademark on the #8 number was set to expire this June, and for some reason, Teresa chose not to renew it. She could’ve kept the number if she exercised her ownership right, but rather she allowed Dale Jr. to get hold of his iconic number. Despite being at odds with each other, Jr. knew that Teresa would not dilute Intimidator’s racing legacy outside of the family. And surprisingly, he even thanked her for keeping the #8 number safe all these years. “One of the things that I really appreciate about Teresa as long as she had this “8.” I was very happy that it was in a safe place. I knew that it was always gonna be fine. But if she doesn’t want to pay for the trademark anymore, I’m like, we better get that because I want it safe.” Junior said this on the Dale Jr. Download.

The 2025 drafts of the Pro Volleyball Federation concluded only recently, and Nebraska senior Merritt Beason was the first to find herself a new camp. The outside hitter was drafted by the Atlanta Vibe. And yet, despite her new career milestone, Beason’s father isn’t surprised.

Naturally, with the pro volleyball scene booming in the country, Beason was on the radar for everyone, especially with this year being her last stint with the Huskers. But this was already pre-ordained, her dad posits. In a post by Hail Varsity on X from November 28, Merritt’s father, Scott Beason, recalled how following a dedicated path has helped the two-year Nebraska team captain to become one of the most coveted volleyball stars. “Even when she was little, she’s always been a worker.

20, 2024 Red Bull’s Sergio Perez ahead of practice REUTERS/Marton Monus The IndyCar Series has long been a haven for ex-Formula 1 drivers. Names like Marcus Ericsson and Romain Grosjean have found success and revived their careers there, with Ericsson winning in the Indy 500 in 2022. Thanks to Mexico native Pato O’Ward’s efforts, IndyCar is becoming a hotbed of talent and international appeal. Despite these trends, Sergio Pérez has stated he has no interest in transitioning to IndyCar after his Formula 1 career is over.Red Bull Racing’s 34-year-old driver recently extended his contract through 2026 with four-time world champion Max Verstappen. Due to a lackluster season and inconsistent results, fans and the media criticized Sergio Pérez’s new contract. His performance at the Dutch Grand Prix, where he finished sixth, did not prove to be encouraging as he followed it up with three finishes outside the top 10 in his next six races, with one DNF and one being as low as 17th place. For the season, Perez sits with five finishes outside the points, including three DNFs. When asked during a Honda event last week if he would consider a move to IndyCar after F1, Pérez responded unequivocally, “Not really, if I’m honest.”After retiring from F1, Perez plans to prioritize family time after the demanding schedule of F1. “I think one of the reasons I’ll stop the day when I stop is because I’ve done it enough,” he explained. A dad of three, the Mexican driver looks forward to spending more time with his kids but is skeptical about finding the same level of satisfaction outside F1. Despite acknowledging IndyCar’s competitiveness, criticism followed.“I really respect what they do in Indy, but the way I see it is like after [F1], I hope to finish my career without any injury,” Pérez said, highlighting the risks associated with oval racing. He then added a more controversial remark, “There are drivers that are not very experienced in the series, and doing those sorts of speeds and having that sort of impact is not something I’m willing to do.” Many fans and insiders interpreted his candid assessment of IndyCar’s safety risks and talent pool as dismissive of the series. Although Pérez seems uninterested in a full-time IndyCar career, he hasn’t ruled out competing in other categories. Six-time F1 race winner, who won the Monaco Grand Prix in 2022, expressed interest in 24 Hours of Le Mans and Rolex 24 at Daytona. He hinted at a potential future in one-off endurance races, saying, “Doing one or two races a year—I think it’s something as a driver you’re going to be looking at very soon because it’s really hard to stop completely.” It’s unclear if he’s missing out on a unique opportunity or if the series would be better off without him. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Throughout the IndyCar community, Sergio Pérez‘s struggles at Red Bull have become a lightning rod. Pérez himself admitted, “The problem I had earlier in the year is that I had a car that I couldn’t drive. I was just very uncomfortable with the car, and it was very hard driving into the corners not knowing what it was going to do.” The team has been criticized for its slow response to these concerns. The Red Bull engineers apologized after the Italian Grand Prix for not addressing car limitations earlier in the season, Pérez revealed in September.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Interestingly, he also claimed it wasn’t until Max Verstappen faced similar challenges that his complaints were validated-but the damage to his reputation had already been done. In September this year, Perez stated to the official F1 channel, “I really feel like I’m in the same boat as I’ve been in the last 10 races, but now, all of a sudden, Max has come to similar issues.“ Fans have been blunt in their criticism of Pérez’s performance, with one calling him a “slightly better Grosjean.” This comparison, though harsh, highlights frustrations over his inconsistency despite superior machinery. While Romain Grosjean had sporadic brilliance and frequent errors, Pérez’s longevity and key moments, like the clutch Sakhir Grand Prix win in 2020, put him in a different league. One fan reflected the sentiment that Perez was missing out by not joining Indy Car, “His loss, then. It would be a better move than continuing to destroy his reputation in that Red Bull…” The Mexican’s reputation in F1 is certainly at an all-time low as he edges towards seeing his lowest points tally in his Red Bull tenure with 152 points after 22 races this season, and just 34 points in his last 11 races! ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad From a business perspective, his popularity, particularly in Mexico, is seen as a boon for Red Bull. “From a popularity standpoint, he’d be a great addition,” noted one person. Another added, “He’s making Red Bull money. Not sure any team here would be able to afford him.” With a $14 million salary and rumors of a potential performance clause-based reduction, many believe Pérez’s price tag still places him out of reach for most IndyCar teams. Is Sergio Pérez right to dismiss IndyCar, or is he missing out on a golden opportunity? Debate The IndyCar community didn’t hold back on sarcasm with one person saying, “Oh no… Anyway.” This reflects skepticism about F1 drivers making the switch, especially lucrative ones. Some couldn’t resist poking fun at the challenges Pérez might’ve faced in IndyCar. “Bro doesn’t want to be the second-best Mexican on the grid,” one fan said, referring to Pato O’Ward’s dominance.

The streamer believed that the Olympic gold medalist and the NFL player will have quite a close race if it is a 40-meter dash. “40 yards close. Because Noah is not fast when he likes… He gotta get out of the block. When it first starts, he’s slow as s***,” he said. While IShowSpeed knows that Noah is the fastest man in 100m, the runner is a slow starter according to him, which gives Tyreek an advantage in a 40m dash. “It’ll be close. I’d say I probably got Tyreek. Do we know your distance yet? Is it 40, 50, or 60 meters? 40, I got Tyreek. 50 and up, Noah,” said the streamer. After that, podcast host Shannon Sharpe asked him whether he would like to race the winner. He replied in the affirmative, saying, “Hell yeah. I’m the final boss. I’m the final boss.” Speed then also went on to say that while he has faced Noah Lyles, Tyreek Hill looks to be quite afraid to battle him. Thus, he gave the NFL player a proposition. He said, “Tyreek, all you have to decide. Put your career on the line. Put your contract on… Put your contract… Put everything on your line. Put your life on the line. Race me 40 yards. 40 yards.” While the streamer told him to take as much time as he needs to train, he knew Tyreek wouldn’t race him. This is because it is quite risky for him to be seen losing against IShowSpeed before he faces Noah Lyles. Thus, the player wouldn’t face the streamer. However, it seems like Speed is ready to race whoever wins, showing his dedication to the craft. This story is developing… Let the world know your perspective.

Guard-USA TODAY Sports “Kuminga is the best athlete I’ve ever seen in my life. I’ve been around soccer players, track stars, elite basketball players.” This is how Juan Toscano-Anderson describes Jonathan Kuminga. We know him as a young superstar, continuously trying to make his mark among the NBA’s elite. But we tend to always have something more to offer to his on-court life, rather than his off-court life. So, as he propels himself into Steve Kerr’s unique 12-man rotation, let’s finally explore one of the most asked questions about his personal life. The moment Jonathan Kuminga entered the NBA with the Golden State Warriors, he’s been someone who has been keeping his matters private. With that, one thing has been clear—he’s a master at keeping his personal life under wraps! While the hoopster’s been a rising star in the Bay Area, his romantic life has stayed out of the public eye, something that’s close to impossible these days. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Unlike many NBA players whose relationships often make headlines, he has managed to avoid the spotlight. Essentially in the era where social media is flooded with celebrity relationships and rumors, it’s refreshing to see someone choose privacy. On the other hand, it also looks like the Warrior doesn’t even want to give a hint, for example, his Instagram, which is packed with game highlights, workout clips, and moments with teammates, but not even a single hint about a significant other. via Imago Nov 2, 2024; Houston, Texas, USA; Golden State Warriors forward Jonathan Kuminga (00) handles the ball against the Houston Rockets during the second quarter at Toyota Center. Mandatory Credit: Erik Williams-Imagn Images In the age where athletes’ personal lives are constantly on display, Kuminga’s low profile is a rarity—and it’s hard not to admire his restraint. This decision speaks to his maturity and focus on basketball, rather than chasing fame through a public relationship. He is only 22, and being with the Warriors, he’s surrounded by some of the best in the game. As we know, Steph Curry, Draymond Green, and all offer invaluable guidance, and he seems intent on soaking it all in to elevate his game! Could Kuminga's focus on basketball over fame make him the next big NBA legend? Debate Kuminga’s priorities lie with basketball. He’s already shown his potential, making an impact as a dynamic forward for Golden State. However, for now, he seems content focusing on his development as a player. With that, it’s time to look into his journey to the NBA. Jonathan Kuminga’s had a different path to the NBA. The hoopster had to leave his homeland of Kinshasa, DR Congo, and move to the US as a teenager. His early American days were spent at Huntington Prep and Our Savior New American School, where he quickly became one of the most talked-about prospects in the country! Did you know in 2019, he was named the MVP of the Slam Dunk to the Beach? He showcased a thrilling event scoring 40 points, a single-game record. However, unlike others, the hoopster didn’t follow the usual path to college basketball. Instead, he took a bold step: something that only a few opt for. He joined the NBA G League Ignite program. USA Today via Reuters Mar 11, 2024; San Antonio, Texas, USA; Golden State Warriors forward Jonathan Kuminga (00) reacts to a call by an official during the first half against the San Antonio Spurs at Frost Bank Center. Mandatory Credit: Scott Wachter-USA TODAY Sports Imagine having offers from top college programs like Duke and Kentucky, but you chose the G League. Not a usual thing, right? Although it was a challenge playing against older, more experienced players, it has paid off. In his first season, he started showing his worth. He averaged 15.8 points and 7.2 rebounds, putting his skills on full display. Scouts took notice, and his stock soared. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad And the big moment came what everyone dreams of. The NBA Draft! And just like it should be, the Golden State Warriors selected him with the 7th overall pick in the July 2021 NBA Draft. Do you know what was his age at his debut? Jonathan Kuminga was just 19 when he made his debut in October 2021, and it was clear from the start that GSW saw something special in him. So was he just a rookie trying to fit in? No, he was a young player who could contribute to a superstar roster. And then, in a matchup against the Toronto Raptors, he surprised his team and fans as he showcased his scoring ability and versatility scoring a career-high 26 points. Well, he had more plans to rock his rookie season. When the Warriors went on to win the NBA championship, in 2022, he was just 19, and became the second-youngest player ever to win a title, behind only Darko Miličić. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad A surreal moment for the young forward, right? But for Jonathan Kuminga, it wasn’t just about the title—it was about how much he had grown in such a short period. And what next happened in his career is something that you must be aware of. Beyond his NBA success, JK’s journey took another turn, an international turn. In 2022, he suited up for the DR Congo national team in the 2023 World Cup qualifiers. He demonstrated his skills on a global stage, scoring 18 points in a nail-biter against Cameroon. And so far in the current season, in November, he averages 14.6 points, 4.6 rebounds, and 2.0 assists. So, what do you think, what’s next? Let the world know your perspective.

Really? After the release of the second edition of the Sprint series, Letsile Tebogo harshly chased it. The Olympic champion pointed his fingers at the unequal treatment carried out by the production house in directing the show. How? Tebogo felt that the African athletes received less or zero screen time in the docuseries whereas the American sprinters stole the entire focus. Notably, among the American sprinters, Noah Lyles appeared on the screen for the most minutes. Meanwhile, another African athlete made the same argument.  Akani Simbine also claimed the show was full of partiality, revolving around a particular bunch of athletes. But folks, is it the actual picture? Well, an American track and field sports legend has something to add to the ongoing heated debate. The veteran laid out his statements based on two American sprinters, Noah Lyles and Fred Kerley. As per him, the inequality grows there only. Again, the same question rings: How?  In his podcast, Ready Set Go, Justin Gatlin explained how Fred Kerley’s image was painted in the second installment of Sprint. He said the focus had always been less on the former world champion. “They spoke about Fred in season one; they made Fred seem like he was the guy who was up against Noah, and you didn’t; you didn’t know much about Fred, right like I felt like they could have talked more about how Fred became hit the champion,” Gatlin mentioned.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad In the conversation with Rodney Green, he further added, “They should have given him his flowers; they should have shown him his respect because that was a real competitor that Noah had to really go up against it wasn’t just the guy who was just a 100-meter runner guy.” His words demonstrate the less focus on Kerley’s achievements in the show. However, since episode one of the second edition, there’s been a try to portray the 29-year-old as Noah’s fitting opponent.  via Reuters Paris 2024 Olympics – Athletics – Men’s 100m Round 1 – Stade de France, Saint-Denis, France – August 03, 2024. Fred Kerley of United States reacts after taking first place in heat 8 REUTERS/Alina Smutko In back-to-back scenes, the sprinting ace appears with his similar high-shoulder persona, throwing words at the Olympic champion in ripe moments. In one instance, Fred says, “I don’t think I came here for a fashion show. That’s Noah’s style.” He made those comments just before a pre-Olympics track event. Notably, Noah entered the scene with his classic model attire. But Kerley was in a formal suit. Meanwhile, the two-time Olympic medalist threw a few more fireballs.  Ultimately, Fred said, “It’s weird but that’s his [Noah Lyles] personality. Cocky, arrogant, and all that stuff.” Soon, he drew a line, saying, “I don’t do nothing for attention. I’m here to run fast and go on about my business.” That hypes everything. But does it end with the same momentum? Gatlin thinks otherwise.  He argues, “I feel like that would have been a better dynamic. It have been a more respectful dynamic instead of just saying, ‘hey this is Fred, and this is Noah.’ you know what I’m saying like Fred dropped all the way down from the four to the two to the one… He proved everybody wrong and he ran faster than Noah.” Yet, Lyles has the most number of entries in the show, compared to Fred. Rather, after the men’s 100m final, Fred fades away in the show. So doesn’t Gatlin’s logic hit at the root of the debate? Is it an American show anymore where one of the finest American athletes receives less screen time? Well, the man of the hour has a few things to share.  Is the 'Sprint' series unfairly sidelining African athletes in favor of American stars like Noah Lyles? Debate ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The first edition of Sprint came in July 2024. The second one was released in November. While the first one captures the happenings around the Budapest World Athletics Championships, the second one deals with the Paris Olympics and the related parts. However, Fred Kerley has had a few memorable happenings in these timelines, on and off-court. He had debates and performances as well. The graph, meanwhile, witnessed ups and downs. His story remained compelling as well. In the comparison, Noah Lyles has had thorough outings. He kept on the momentum and continued to build everything around it. In the end, he claimed the Olympic gold in Paris. However, Fred had the bronze.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad So has it been the reason for him missing out on screens in Sprint? The Olympian had his answers ready. Rather, much before November, Kerley cleared the air regarding his take on Sprint. In a tête-à-tête with Justin Gatlin and Rodney Green, he said, “This piece is put together in a way that’s not really meant to be. So this sh** is Hollywood. There’s nothing else to it. It’s cool for the sport, but it’s really not showing us because I feel way more stuff than what really is.” That explains Kerley’s mindset on the seriousness of the docuseries. Now, how would he react to watching himself in fewer scenes compared to Noah? Please let us know.  Let the world know your perspective.

Instead, it’s a deeply personal revelation from Alexis Ohanian, Serena Williams’ husband, that has fans concerned yet inspired. As families gathered to celebrate Thanksgiving, Ohanian took a moment to reflect and share a heartfelt update on social media. He opened up about battling an unexpected health issue that shook him, but with effective treatment and resilience, he’s now on the mend. The 41-year-old took to his X account and shared updates about his health. Ohanian revealed that he battled with a suspicious disease that had the potential of turning cancerous. The Reddit co-founder also shared a couple of pictures as he attempted to depict the various phases of his current life transitioning quickly from hospital bed to enjoying with his children at Disney World. Ohanian also made a special request to all the fathers across the globe regarding their health. Captioning the post, Ohanian revealed, “After tracking some suspicious nodules on my thyroid for the last 4 years, I recently got half of it surgically removed.” Detailing his problems further, he shared, “The nodules were getting bigger & the latest biopsy revealed they’d very likely turn cancerous. My mom had breast cancer around this age (41) and then ultimately died from brain cancer a decade or so later. I hate cancer.” For the unversed, Ohanian’s mother Anke Ohanian was diagnosed with an incurable brain tumor in 2005 and later passed away in 2008 at the age of 54 in her Columbia, Maryland home. Hence, Ohanian did not wish to take anything lightly especially surrounding his health. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad “I wasn’t gonna take any chances; the surgery was smooth and I’m extra grateful this Thanksgiving because I got the call this morning that my now-removed-half-of-thyroid was indeed full of some gnarly nodules that were very likely to become cancerous,” he further added. However, he highlighted that his life is coming back on track and despite not being able to be at the peak of his health for the last two weeks, he was able to take her daughters to Disney World. Continuing further, he made a special request to all dads and wrote, “To my fellow, men — make those doctor’s appointments — especially if y’all are dads. Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.” This, however, is not the only health issue that Ohanian faced recently.    After tracking some suspicious nodules on my thyroid for the last 4 years, I recently got half of it surgically removed.

He also expressed his surprise since he did not spend much time in the Northeast or in other regions where ticks are common. Interestingly, Ohanian was among the rare populations that developed the issue without symptoms. But he seems to have battled through that as well, as he revealed recently.  Does Ohanian's story make you rethink the importance of regular health check-ups? Debate In an X post a few weeks ago, Ohanian shared pictures from the gym and shared, “Dragged my a** in here before flying out. Eating clean the last year, pretty consistent taking my daily atorvastatin, and only drinking booze on special occasions.” He further wrote, “Lift Routine is the same tho.

In fact, he played an instrumental role in clinching Team USA’s first bronze medals after 16 years. However, he shocked fans by announcing that he would soon switch from the gymnastics mat to the ballroom floor. The 26-year-old was one of the first stars to make the Season 33 Dancing With the Stars roster. While the gymnast started his chase for the Mirrorball, just one thing momentarily held him back. The Olympian admitted that he wasn’t as confident as he came across on the pommel horse. On the contrary, he confessed that dancing was never his thing. He described himself as a “very cowardly and scared dancer.” However, he wanted to get on the show to prove that if he could get over his fears, then anyone could. As the music fades, the gymnast bids farewell to the ballroom and his journey. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The grand finale for Season 33 of Dancing With the Stars took place on November 26, and Team Arnold Pommel was one of the five finalists. Even though Stephen Nedoroscik and Rylee Arnold earned a perfect score for their performance, they didn’t win the Len Goodman Mirrorball Trophy. Despite placing fourth, the gymnast had a lot to be thankful for in his journey and left his dance partner one final note.       A post shared by Stephen Nedoroscik (@stephen_nedoroscik)  The Olympian shared an image from their practice on his Instagram with a heartwarming caption for Arnold. “I’m a Pommel Horse specialist. I had never danced, performed with emotion, or had to be delicate. Rylee, I feel so lucky to have had you by my side. Your positivity, kindness, and determination made every second of this experience worthwhile,” he exclaimed. However, that wasn’t all he had to say. Did Stephen Nedoroscik's DWTS journey inspire you to step out of your comfort zone? Debate Stephen Nedoroscik reflected on his journey on the show so far. He reiterated how, during the first rehearsals, the gymnast was timid. However, he had a full-circle moment by receiving a perfect score by the end of the show. The 26-year-old was grateful for everything Rylee Arnold taught him. He called her the best dance partner and an indispensable friend. But he isn’t the only one who appreciates their friendship. For Arnold, meeting the Olympian was the best part of her season. She credits him for the positive outlook she adopted in her life. The professional stated that Nedoroscik changed her in numerous ways, and she deeply appreciated their time together. They might have ended their stellar stint on DWTS without a win, but they will continue to remain friends. This wholesome shoutout made their fans fall in love with their wholesome friendship all over again. What did they have to say? The finale was a celebration with stunning performances, celebrity reunions, and special appearances from reigning champions Xochitl Gomez and Val Chmerkovskiy. But fans couldn’t take their eyes off Stephen Nedoroscik and Rylee Arnold every time they set foot on the ballroom floor. When the duo performed the Argentine Tango, the world fell in love with his heartwarming tribute to the US gymnastics team on October 15.  One fan stated, “This post is everything. I love you guys—you are the epitome of what DWTS should be. What a journey, what a delight, and what a gift. So sad to see it end.” Watching the gymnast fresh off his dreamy Parisian stint felt like a breath of fresh air for many, like this fan. His competitor, Chandler Kinney, agreed, “Stephen!!!!! you ROCKED this season!! so grateful to call you a friend, and here’s to more :)) 🫶🏽” It’s safe to say, competitor or not, everyone loved to watch the Olympian’s journey on the show.  Stephen Nedoroscik had a rocky start to the competition. But he slowly started making the climb up the ranks, earning his first perfect score with his moving gymnastics-inspired freestyle to Coldplay’s “Viva La Vida”. However, that wasn’t his only performance for the night. Team Arnold Pommel also did the redemption quickstep to “I’ll Be There for You” to end their incredible season with a bang.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad A fan confessed, “Yall are the only reason I watched this season! Congratulations!!!!” The gymnast’s inclusion in the show brought on numerous fans like this one. The Olympic Pommel Horse champion, Rhys McClenaghan, simply said, “Congratulations bro!” It’s safe to say that nobody wanted to see the Olympian lose, but it was a good stint nonetheless.  The very reason many fell in love with Stephen Nedoroscik was due to his antics off the mat at the Bercy Arena. It only intensified when many realized that the Olympian couldn’t see much without his glasses. His genetic disorder makes it harder for him to have depth perception, and lights in his face can be super painful. But he pushed through and got to the season finale. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad One fan opined, “Absolutely phenomenal!!! I loved this dance!!! Yours and Rylees freestyle will go down in history as one of if not the best freestyle dance ever performed in dwts!!!!” While Nedoroscik has come a long way since his early days on the show, his dedication to his sport made his dance so much more meaningful. Another fan agreed, “I watched this show for the first time ever this season just to see you on it! Loved every performance!!! Your freestyle in the finale was everything!! Loved this partnership!! Congrats to you both.” Achieving the perfect score during the finals is not an underwhelming feat, and fans couldn’t be happier for them.  Stephen Nedoroscik and Rylee Arnold capitalized on the viewership the show brought to bring awareness to an important cause—the sport. Why’s that, you ask? The NCAA gymnastics programs have been on a decline lately. However, according to the 26-year-old, every Olympic team member used to be an NCAA gymnast. He believed that their win at Bercy Arena would change the narrative. But seeing that it hadn’t, he hoped that his performance on DWTS would help make a difference.

   By holding on for a 23-20 win over the Chicago Bears on Thanksgiving Day, the Detroit Lions improved their record to 11-1, and an increasing number of people believe the Lions will end up holding the Vince Lombardi Trophy this winter. The utter ineptitude they displayed for some three decades is now becoming a more distant memory, and much of the credit for the franchise’s remarkable turnaround has gone to head coach Dan Campbell. He took over in the 2021 season, and while the team struggled that year and for the first half of the 2022 campaign, it has been dynamite ever since by winning 33 of its last 42 games, per The 33rd Team. Dan Campbell started 4-19-1 in his first season and a half as the Lions’ HC Detroit is now 33-9 since Week 9 of 2022 https://t.co/JXmLztRsyF pic.twitter.com/puGivvgAHq — The 33rd Team (@The33rdTeamFB) November 28, 2024  From the early 1990s until last season, the Lions were one of a handful of sports franchises across the nation that were synonymous with failure. They hadn’t won a single playoff game since the 1991 season, despite having some bona fide stars such as Calvin Johnson, Barry Sanders and Matthew Stafford. But Detroit finished the 2022 season by winning eight of their last 10 games, which led to high expectations for last season, and they met those expectations by finishing first in the NFC North and coming within minutes of clinching a spot in the Super Bowl. Although star defensive lineman Aidan Hitchinson is likely out for the rest of the season with a leg injury, their defense has largely held up, and they have the NFL’s top scoring offense. Detroit sports fans have been perpetually frustrated for some 20 years, but this could be the year they get rewarded for their loyalty."

   Trailing 23-20 with just seconds left against the Detroit Lions on Thanksgiving Day, the Chicago Bears had an opportunity to give themselves a real chance of beating arguably the best team in the NFL. They had the football on Detroit’s 41-yard line on a third-and-long with under 30 seconds remaining, but they allowed the clock to run down, and when quarterback Caleb Williams’ pass intended for Rome Odunze missed, the game was over. It was, in the minds of many, a case of football malpractice, and fans are calling for Bears head coach Matt Eberflus to be fired as a result. Like this tweet if the Bears should fire Matt Eberflus pic.twitter.com/BoC3I8DWMz — Dave (@dave_bfr) November 28, 2024  Is Matt Eberflus fired yet? — jay (@jayzthawtz) November 28, 2024  Been there myself, don't wish unemployment on anyone, but I might make an exception for Matt Eberflus. — Yitz Willroth™ (VC Funded) (@coderabbi) November 28, 2024  Fire Matt eberflus i cried because this is stressful man Caleb is playing great yeah he has mistakes but all rookies do but like Matt has to go — GrizzlySports12 (@bgrizzly877) November 28, 2024  There have been rumors for months that Eberflus’ job could be in jeopardy, dating back to last season, and now, despite a talented roster, especially on offense, his team has a poor 4-8 record. Chicago is now on a six-game losing streak and has lost three contests in a row by three points or fewer. There is an old axiom that when a team loses a close game, it is the coach’s fault, and one could argue that a coaching change is needed very soon in order to not waste Williams’ vast potential. The Bears have a long history of failing to get the most out of potential-laden young quarterbacks, and Williams could be the most talented one they have had in decades. But they will need the right infrastructure in place to ensure he and his teammates can have the type of success they should have given their level of talent."

   The Chicago Bears blew a golden opportunity to put themselves in position to defeat the mighty Detroit Lions on Thanksgiving Day with some poor clock management in the final seconds. Trailing 23-20 with less than 30 seconds left and facing a third-and-long, no timeout was called, and their players took valuable seconds off the clock before snapping the ball and failing to get a completion as time expired. Seemingly everyone is criticizing Bears head coach Matt Eberflus for this fiasco, including ESPN’s Dan Orlovsky, who called what happened near the end of Thursday’s game “coaching malpractice.” Zero plan pic.twitter.com/D2Efc3eYhj — Dan Orlovsky (@danorlovsky7) November 28, 2024  Orlovsky, a former NFL quarterback, said the team needed to know what the plan was on the snap prior to that mismanaged third down, contingent on how that prior snap played out. That falls on Eberflus and his coaching staff. This was not only the Bears’ sixth loss in a row, but also their third straight loss by three points or fewer. Plenty have been calling for him to be fired for months, and there seems to be a chance that this major miscue may end up pushing Bears management into giving him a pink slip. The team now has a 4-8 record despite possessing plenty of talent, especially on the offensive side of the football, which means they have virtually no shot at making the playoffs.

   The football world is still buzzing over the fiasco that led to the Chicago Bears losing narrowly to the Detroit Lions early on Thanksgiving Day. With the ball on Detroit’s 41-yard line on a third down and under 30 seconds left, the Bears let the game clock run down pre-snap, and just after quarterback Caleb Williams’ pass attempt intended for Rome Odunze missed, time expired. The Lions held on to win, 23-20, and this fiasco seemed to sum up what has been a ragged season for Chicago, despite the ample talent it possesses. Chicago head coach Matt Eberflus tried to explain after the loss why he didn’t call a timeout to stop the clock, per ClutchPoints. “Like I said, disappointing for the players. They put a lot of work in that short week. Put themselves in a position to win that game."" Matt Eberflus on why he didn't use the final timeout at the end of the Bears-Lions game 👀 (via @dave_bfr)pic.twitter.com/MCK66KEJbv — ClutchPoints (@ClutchPoints) November 28, 2024  Stopping the clock with a timeout would’ve meant giving his players a chance to get organized and know what offensive set they were going to run, or kicking a field goal, albeit a long one, that could’ve tied the game. This was the Bears’ third straight loss by three points or fewer, and overall, they’re now on a six-game losing streak. There have been plenty of people calling for Eberflus to be fired for months, and this miscue will likely increase the chances of those people getting their wish. The Bears have a flawed but potential-laden and talented rookie quarterback in Caleb Williams, as well as three very capable wideouts in Odunze, who is also a rookie, D.J. Moore and Keenan Allen. But all that talent hasn’t coalesced, and they will need to make some changes, especially given how tough the NFC North is these days."

   For the second straight year, the NFL will hold a game on Black Friday, and this time, it will feature the two-time defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs going up against the Las Vegas Raiders. The Chiefs have lost a few key players to injury this season, but they have still managed to go 10-1 thus far, which is the best record in the league. On Friday, one of those key players will return to game action, as running back Isiah Pacheco is expected to play after suffering an ankle injury in Week 2, per Adam Schefter. Chiefs RB Isiah Pacheco is off the injury report for Friday’s game vs. the Raiders and expected to play in his first game since injuring his ankle in Week 2. — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) November 28, 2024  For the last couple of years, Pacheco has become one of the Chiefs’ main offensive weapons, especially as they have evolved into a dink-and-dunk offensive team. In 2023, his second season in the NFL, he ran for 935 yards and seven touchdowns while adding 44 catches for 244 yards and two touchdowns. With Pacheco out, Kansas City brought in running back Kareem Hunt, who started his career with them in 2017, and he has filled in decently with 577 rushing yards and five touchdowns. Despite their stellar record and the fact that they seem favored to win a third straight Vince Lombardi Trophy, eight of their 10 wins have come by seven points or fewer, and it is something that could get exposed down the line. While their defense has largely held up, their lack of major offensive weapons, and the fact that stud wide receiver Rashee Rice is out for the season, is a concern for them moving forward. But having Pacheco back will serve as a shot in the arm for the Chiefs as they look to peak in time for the playoffs."

   This season’s trade market in the NBA isn’t expected to be a very attractive one, but there should still be a few attractive complementary players available as the February 2025 trade deadline nears. The Brooklyn Nets are one team many believe will be involved this season in the trade market as sellers, and their most attractive trade piece is Cameron Johnson. Per Evan Sidery, the Nets will ask for multiple draft picks and perhaps an enticing young prospect in return for Johnson. The Nets will hold a very strong asking price for Cam Johnson in potential trade talks. It will likely take at least multiple first-round picks or an enticing young prospect alongside draft capital for Brooklyn to listen. The 28-year-old wing is under contract through 2026-27. pic.twitter.com/m23MlRWniy — Evan Sidery (@esidery) November 28, 2024  Johnson emerged as a reliable 3-and-D wing early in his career as a member of the Phoenix Suns, especially when he helped the Suns reach the NBA Finals in 2021 with some hot outside shooting throughout the playoffs. But since coming to Brooklyn in 2023 as part of the Kevin Durant trade, he has taken his offensive game to another level. Through 19 games this season, he’s averaging 17.9 points a game while shooting 48.7 percent from the field and 41.7 percent from 3-point range, and that is in addition to the high-level defense he brings to the court at all times. The Nets are currently 9-10, and while they appear to have a real shot of, at the very least, reaching the play-in tournament, some may feel they would be better off tanking for a high draft pick. There have also been rumors that they could be persuaded to let go of guard Dennis Schroder and possibly even guard Cam Thomas, who is leading them right now with an average of 24.7 points a game."

   Bears general manager Ryan Poles remains steadfast in his belief that Chicago stands on the cusp of a transformative moment, despite years of franchise struggles. Drawing from his experience with the Kansas City Chiefs’ front office during their rise to prominence, Poles is determined to replicate that success in the Windy City. However, not everyone shares his optimism. Robert Griffin III delivered a scathing critique, arguing that the Bears are trapped in a cycle of failure rather than breaking free. “The Chicago Bears aren’t breaking the cycle, they are repeating it. I tried to tell you. You didn’t want to hear the truth. Ryan Poles should have moved on from Eberflus instead of making Caleb Williams be the 3rd straight QB with a coach on the hot seat.” Griffin wrote. The Chicago Bears aren’t breaking the cycle, they are repeating it. I tried to tell you.You didn’t want to hear the truth.Ryan Poles should have moved on from Eberflus instead of making Caleb Williams be the 3rd straight QB with a coach on the hot seat.Now look at you 🤷🏾‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/Ps8F5YBlcd — Robert Griffin III (@RGIII) November 28, 2024  He made it clear—nothing has changed, and the team is stuck in the same rut. The Thanksgiving Day loss to the Detroit Lions epitomized Griffin’s concerns. In a brutal 23-20 defeat at Ford Field, the Bears just displayed their ongoing challenges. After clawing back from a 16-point deficit, Chicago seemed poised for a potential game-tying field goal in the final minute. Instead, a series of critical mistakes unfolded: a hands-to-the-face penalty, a sack on Williams, and a curious timeout management that ultimately sealed their fate. Eberflus’s tenure continues to raise questions, with his current record standing at a disappointing 14-32. While Poles maintains his vision of rebuilding the Bears into a competitive force, the mounting evidence suggests significant work remains. The team’s performance indicates they are far from breaking their pattern of disappointment. If the Bears hope to become legitimate contenders by 2025, Poles’s vision must translate from potential to performance."

   The New York Giants’ recent 30-7 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers exposed deeper tensions within the team, particularly through rookie wide receiver Malik Nabers’ unfiltered frustration. After being virtually invisible in the first half with zero targets, Nabers erupted, calling the team’s performance “soft as f—” as they extended their losing streak to a disheartening 6 games and fell to 2-9. Recently, sports radio veteran Mike Francesa spoke candidly when analyzing the situation, directing blame squarely at the Giants’ leadership. In a pointed commentary, Francesa argued that general manager Joe Schoen and head coach Brian Daboll are enabling players by being overly tolerant of talented but undisciplined athletes. “They allow these guys because they are enamored with their talent, to run amok. First of all, Nabers, take care of yourself, catch the ball, concentrate, stay healthy. Do the things you have to do to be a professional, to be a good one.” Francesa proclaimed. ""They allow these guys because they are enamored with their talent, to run amok""@MikeFrancesa answers a listener email on whether Daboll or Schoen are to blame for Malik Nabers' attitude 🏈 pic.twitter.com/xaaRvT1NBr — The Mike Francesa Podcast (@FrancesaPodcast) November 28, 2024  While acknowledging Nabers’ extraordinary potential, Francesa stressed that raw talent alone doesn’t guarantee success. A rookie publicly criticizing the coaching staff crosses a line of professional respect, a sentiment that reflects broader concerns about the Giants’ team culture. Nabers subsequently walked back his heated remarks, expressing regret for his language while maintaining that the team’s execution problems ran deeper than surface-level criticism. He subtly indicated that the struggles weren’t solely quarterback-related but pointed to systemic issues within the team’s strategic approach. For Nabers, this moment becomes a critical learning experience about navigating the complex dynamics of professional football, where performance and respect go hand in hand."

   On a day marked by both individual brilliance and team struggle, Chicago Bears rookie quarterback Caleb Williams carved out his place in NFL history, despite falling short against the Detroit Lions’ formidable lineup. Williams overcame a disastrous first half where the Bears’ offense could barely muster two first downs, transforming the game’s trajectory with a remarkable second-half performance. He connected with veteran receiver Keenan Allen for a touchdown that not only sparked the Bears’ comeback but also etched his name in the franchise’s record books. The touchdown pass to Allen was particularly significant, breaking Charlie O’Rourke Sr.’s longstanding franchise rookie passing touchdown record from 1942. Williams became only the second Bears rookie quarterback to reach double-digit touchdown passes (12), a testament to his extraordinary potential. HISTORY FOR THE NO. 1 PICK 👏  Caleb Williams now has the most passing TDs in franchise history 💪 pic.twitter.com/sXEnw9jqSI — NFL on ESPN (@ESPNNFL) November 28, 2024  By game’s end, Williams had thrown for three touchdowns, bringing his season total to 14, yet the Bears still couldn’t overcome the Lions’ dominant 11-1 record. The team’s initial struggles were stark – managing just 53 total yards and a mere 7:06 time of possession in the first half proved insurmountable. Beyond the scoreboard, Williams achieved a remarkable individual milestone, setting a new single-season rookie record by completing 212 consecutive pass attempts without an interception. This feat surpassed Kyler Murray’s previous record of 211. While the loss was undoubtedly disappointing, Williams’ performance signaled a promising future for the Bears. His ability to rally the team after a catastrophic first half demonstrated maturity beyond his years and even offered fans a sneak peek of potential greatness brewing in Chicago."

   The New York Giants are having a nightmare of a season, with the team struggling to figure things out as they head into Week 13 with a record of 2-8 and fresh off of releasing veteran quarterback Daniel Jones, who recently signed with the Minnesota Vikings. With the Giants having another forgettable season, there have been a lot of questions about what the team’s brass will do during the NFL offseason, as many anticipate head coach Brian Daboll and general manager Joe Schoen to be on the hot seat. However, longtime team owner John Mara might have other plans regarding what he will do with leadership on the football field and in the front office regarding the futures of Daboll and Schoen. According to Dianna Russini of The Athletic, Mara may not want to fire Daboll and Schoen, but that could change in the near future. “It’s been said that Mara doesn’t want to fire Schoen or head coach Brian Daboll, but there’s still a month of football left that could force the owner to make a move. The sticky part of this situation is Schoen and Daboll are seen as a tandem,” Russini said. With New York not showing any signs of life, even after parting ways with Jones, the team parting ways with Daboll and Schoen seems justified, but that would mean a drastic change for the franchise, which Mara appears reluctant to do moving forward. It’ll be an interesting offseason for the Giants, as their primary concern will likely be the quarterback position, and they’ll want the right leadership in place in order to get things back on track in the years to come."
