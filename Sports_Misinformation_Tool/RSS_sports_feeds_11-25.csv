Rodgers is ""absolutely"" the starting quarterback for the Jets (3-8) against the Seattle Seahawks (6-5), Ulbrich confirmed. Responding to questions centered around reports Rodgers was bypassing medical tests for minor leg injuries -- a swollen knee and a tender ankle -- Ulbrich said there has been no discussion about shelving Rodgers. ""All I can say -- and you'd have to ask Aaron if he's fully healthy -- but he's better off today than he's been as of late,"" Ulbrich said. ""So he's definitely feeling healthier than he has for probably the last month, and a healthy Aaron Rodgers is the Aaron Rodgers we all love. So, excited about what that looks like."" Ulbrich, named interim coach in October, said coming back from the team's bye week he wasn't aware of Rodgers skipping scans or X-rays. ""That's news to me,"" Ulbrich said Monday. The Jets have lost seven of their last eight games and Ulbrich said Monday one area of focus after a bye week is keeping players focused regardless of playoff chances. Rodgers turns 41 on Dec. 2 and said he is planning to return for the 2025 season despite disappointment over the results to date of what he framed as a redemption season. Rodgers, acquired in a trade from the Packers in 2023, was lost for the entire season when he ruptured his Achilles on the first possession of his debut with New York. He has 17 touchdowns and seven interceptions in 2024 but hasn't thrown a pick since the Oct. 20 loss at Pittsburgh. The Jets are making plans to move forward with front office interviews for general manager and a permanent head coach. Owner Woody Johnson's relationship with Rodgers has been questioned publicly, but a contradicting report emerged Sunday stating the two recently dined together in New York. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

A reporter followed up with the direct question of whether he planned to return in 2025, and Brown replied, ""Yes."" The Tar Heels had a four-game losing streak early in the season and are coming off a 41-21 loss at Boston College. Following a 70-50 loss to James Madison in September, Brown said he would step down if he felt he could no longer do the job of coaching the program to success. Brown led the Texas team that won the 2005 national championship with a 13-0 record and a classic Rose Bowl win over Southern California.  He spent 10 seasons at North Carolina before taking over at Texas and he returned to the Tar Heels in 2019.

The Bulls look to get back on track in an NBA Cup East Group C game on Tuesday night when they visit the nation's capital to face the Wizards, who have lost 11 in a row. While Washington routinely has found itself on the wrong side of the scoreboard of late, Chicago is keeping the scoreboard operator busy given the generosity of its defense. Case in point: The Bulls dropped a 142-131 decision to the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday, marking the third time the team has allowed an opponent to reach 140 points in the last six games. Chicago is permitting an NBA-worst 123.9 points per game this season -- just ahead of the Wizards (122.9) -- heading into play on Monday. ""At some point, we've got to hold our ground,"" Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. ""I said before the season even started that defense was going to be a challenge, and it is. I think there are times that we have to look at the controllables. ""Is it fixable? Defense is a talent. It's no different than offense, in my opinion. There are guys that are talented defensively. We're going to have to figure out a way to do it collectively. There are moments in time, moments of truth where you are going to be on an island, you are going to be by yourself. You're going to have to make the guy make a couple of different moves."" Zach LaVine pumped in 29 points on Saturday night to lead Chicago in scoring for the third straight game. He is averaging a team-best 22.7 points per game this season. Nikola Vucevic added 26 points and eight rebounds against Memphis. He is averaging a team-leading 9.7 boards per contest to go along with 20.5 points. Rookie Matas Buzelis added a career-high 14 points on Saturday for the Bulls, who were unable to overcome the Grizzlies shooting a robust 57.3 percent from the floor and 45.2 percent from 3-point range. The Wizards' woeful streak started after they recorded a home-and-home sweep of the Atlanta Hawks in late October. Rookie Alexandre Sarr collected 14 rebounds and matched Bilal Coulibaly with 17 points in a 115-103 setback to the Indiana Pacers on Sunday. Malcolm Brogdon, who scored 15 points, provided a calming influence given the team's considerable troubles. ""When things go awry or things are feeling sticky ... Malcolm is a surefire way for us to get back in the groove of what we're trying to do,"" teammate Corey Kispert said Saturday, per the Washington Post. Rookie Kyshawn George recorded 15 points and five rebounds while starting in place of Jordan Poole, who sat out his first game of the season due to left hip flexor soreness. George has scored in double figures in seven games this season and grabbed at least five rebounds in six contests. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Even without their starting point guard, Memphis has excelled at ball distribution this season. The Grizzlies are among the league leaders in assists per game (29.8) and their 38 in Saturday's lopsided road win over the Chicago Bulls tied a season-high. Memphis ranked third behind Denver (30.3) and Golden State (30.2) in the category entering Monday's games. Morant played just nine games last season because of a disciplinary suspension and a shoulder injury. He has played 265 games (263 starts) over six seasons with averages of 22.4 points, 4.8 rebounds and 7.5 assists with two All-Star Game appearances.

In addition to claiming his maiden PGA Tour victory at the season-ending The RSM Classic on Sunday, McNealy claimed the top spot on the Aon Next 10. That means along with the $1.4 million winner's check and a two-year PGA Tour exemption, the former Stanford star also secured a spot in the Masters, The Players and the first three signature events of 2025.

""I've played (Augusta National) twice, but never been there for the tournament.""

Yu was among three players who moved into the top 60 during the course of the fall, along with Echavarria (started No. 108) and Griffin (started No. 61). Those 10 will join the top 50 as automatic qualifiers for the first two limited-event fields with increased prize money in 2025. There were multiple layers of drama that unfolded during the course of the fall. The second layer was the race to finish inside the top 125 and secure fully exempt status for 2025. Daniel Berger, who finished a shot behind McNealy on Sunday, vaulted from No. 127 to No. 100 this week. It was also the seventh start of the fall for the four-time PGA Tour winner, and Sunday marked his best finish since his most recent title at Pebble Beach in 2021. He had returned in January from a back injury that kept him away from the tour for about 18 months. Meanwhile, Henrik Norlander of Sweden tied for 17th at The RSM Classic to move from No. 126 to No. 120. Fan favorite Joel Dahmen made the cut on the number on Friday to keep his hopes alive and then shot a 64 on Sunday to secure a T35 to finish No. 124. That was one spot ahead of Sam Ryder, who held onto the 125th spot. That bumped Zac Blair to No. 126 and into conditional status next year along with those who finished Nos. 126-150. Just missing that group was former United States Ryder Cup star Ryan Moore, who failed to reach the weekend in Georgia for his fourth missed cut in six fall starts. Dahmen, who sank a 5 1/2-foot putt on Friday to make the cut, played in all eight events and spoke openly about the emotional drain of working so hard to keep his fully exempt status. ""This is my eighth year out here, I probably made it longer than I ever thought I would,"" he said. ""You take it for granted a little bit. It's been relatively easy, cruise between 50 and 90 on the FedEx Cup every year and enjoy it, and our best friends are out here. ""This is different. Makes you appreciate things a little more when times are tough. I thought a lot about everything. It came down to the last putt this week. I hit thousands of golf shots this year, missed a lot of cuts, had a lot of opportunities to do everything, so it didn't have to come to this.  ""So I was thankful for the opportunity today, but I don't want to go through this ever again."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

According to Front Office Sports, at least a dozen Mountain West conference players, including San Jose State's Brook Slusser, filed suit against the conference, its commissioner Gloria Nevarez and San Jose State administrators, as well as Spartans coach Todd Kress. Multiple teams elected not to play against San Jose State this season amid claims the team had a transgender player. Mountain West schools Utah State, Nevada, Boise State and Wyoming refused to play the Spartans, resulting in forfeits. Nonconference opponent Southern Utah also elected to forfeit. The Utah State program joined as a plaintiff in the lawsuit, according to the Front Office Sports report. An unidentified San Jose State player, who has been with the program since 2022, was named in the filing. That player has not said she is transgender. Neither San Jose State nor the Mountain West Conference have said anything about the player's gender. Judge Kato Crews cited NCAA Title IX policy that prohibits discrimination against transgender people. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the Mountain West Conference had already implemented a policy that transgender women can compete if tests show levels of testosterone normal for females. The schools that forfeited to the Spartans had already agreed on the rules pertaining to trans players' eligibility, the judge noted. The judge also questioned the timing of the emergency injunction, which was filed just before the conference tournament regarding a matter that had been established at the start of the season. According to the Chronicle report, an appeal could be heard by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

According to Canales, the Panthers and medical personnel are still working through a full evaluation of the injury.  Sanders ""avoided a really bad injury,"" Canales said Monday.  Late in the second quarter Sunday, Sanders was brought down near the sideline after a 10-yard reception and at contact was flipped upside down. He landed directly on the top of his helmet as he went out of bounds on the tackle by cornerback Trent McDuffie. After receiving attention from the team's medical staff, Sanders was strapped to a backboard and taken off the field on a cart with 40 seconds remaining in the first half. He was taken to Atrium Health Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte for observation and later released Sunday afternoon. The 21-year-old rookie out of Texas had a team-leading three receptions for the Panthers at the half for 49 yards.

The two-year starter also is responsible for communicating the coaches' calls on defense through the helmet radio. Justin Jefferson, who backs up Lawson, will take over that role. ""When you lose a guy that is really, he's kind of your steady-maker in the box and does such a great job with the green-dot communication and is such a leader for our guys and a great communicator on the field, that's tough,"" defensive coordinator Kane Wommack said on Monday.

Daboll said he invited conversation about the end result against the Buccaneers, which dropped the Giants to 2-9 this season before a short week and holiday showcase game at Dallas on Thanksgiving, but said he doesn't see effort as the issue. ""I mean we went back, we evaluated the tape this morning. Look, we didn't play well enough,"" Daboll told reporters Monday. ""Some things, whether it's execution stuff, call stuff, that we just didn't get the job done. But in terms of running to the football, giving effort at the line of scrimmage, those didn't stand out.  ""What stands out was three sacks early on in the first half, 0-for-4 on third down, a variety of missed tackles that caused some big plays. And the missed tackles weren't a lack-of-effort missed tackles. Give Tampa Bay credit. They did a good job, and we didn't do a good enough job. ... But the guys played hard, they played with effort."" Daboll said he was leaving the press conference Monday to make some of the same teaching points to the entire team at their usual day-after group breakdown. ""Look, we have good communication. We'll talk about what Jermaine sees,"" Daboll said in reference to offensive tackle Jermaine Eluemunor's comments after the loss. ""And we'll talk about what we see. We'll watch it. It's right on tape. But again, I have confidence in the guys in the locker room."" The loss came six days after the Giants demoted, then waived, starting quarterback Daniel Jones. The defeat stretches the Giants' losing streak to six games and was the fourth time this season New York failed to score more than seven points. After the game, rookie wide receiver Malik Nabers, defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence and veteran offensive lineman Eluemunor separately said the effort against the Buccaneers wasn't there. ""Look, these guys put a lot of work into this, as does everybody involved, and certainly not something that we wanted yesterday. We work hard every week to not have that happen, and that was a tough one,"" Daboll said. ""So, there's frustration that comes with it, understandable. And we communicate, I think we have good leadership in our locker room. I think we communicate on a daily basis. But certainly, a frustrating game, no question about it."" DeVito took multiple hard hits and was sacked four times. Perhaps the most jarring was in the first quarter when DeVito stepped up on the pocket to evade pressure coming from his right and met speedy defensive tackle Calijah Kancey, who delivered a de-cleater upon impact. DeVito miraculously held onto the ball on the third-down sack.  Kancey hit DeVito again in the fourth quarter as he was releasing a pass with enough force to bring his feet well off the ground for a second time. ""I have not talked to the training staff yet. So, I'll wait until they give me the update, then we'll see where we're at. But I'm anticipating he'll be ready to go,"" Daboll said. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""Yeah, definitely. Definitely a bit,"" he told reporters. ""I wanted to give the fans a show, but I didn't want to hurt someone that didn't need to be hurt."" MVP said it was ""illogical and inane"" to suggest the company would risk a new and potentially lucrative partnership with Netflix by breaking the rules. ""Trash talk and speculation are common in sports, and athletes and promoters need to tolerate nonsensical commentary, jokes and opinions. But suggesting anything other than full effort from these fighters is not only naive but an insult to the work they put into their craft and to the sport itself."" MVP's co-founder, Nakisa Bidarian, defended Paul, a YouTube millionaire-turned-pro athlete. ""From day one in this sport, people have doubted his abilities -- unable to reconcile how someone with his background has accomplished so much in such a short time,"" Bidarian said Monday. ""Jake has not only proven himself repeatedly, but he has continuously set historic records that speak for themselves. ... As long as Jake continues to exceed expectations, there will always be those who try to discredit his achievements.

Who will rise from the mediocrity to claim the","It’s not exactly NFC West-level chaos in the South.  But with six weeks left in the regular season, Atlanta, Tampa Bay, New Orleans and Carolina have everything to sort out. There are signs of life and unexpectedly heartening play suddenly behind the division-leading Falcons.  While Atlanta enjoyed its bye week, the Bucs broke out of a four-game losing streak, and the once-lowly—maybe still lowly, but spunky—Panthers showed promise in a gritty loss to the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs.  Becoming kings of the South is not just about prestige. Once again this season, it’s highly likely that only the division winner will secure a playoff spot.  Entering Week 13, the 6-5 Falcons are the fourth seed in the NFC, with a 71% chance of reaching the postseason, according to NFL.com projections. The second-place Bucs (5-6) are currently ninth-seeded behind 6-5 Arizona and given a 52% chance of reaching the playoffs. The odds get incredibly long for the division behind the top two. The Saints are 4-7 at 4% playoff chances and the 3-8 Panthers at less than 1 percent. Even so, all four of these teams will be a factor in which one is left standing in the end. Here’s a team-by-team outlook for the rest of the season. ATLANTA: The Falcons’ main asset is a 4-1 record in the division, having swept the Bucs, splitting with New Orleans and taking the first matchup on the road against Carolina. The remainder of Atlanta’s schedule is a mixed bag, with tough dates against the Chargers at home this week and at Minnesota in Week 14. But there’s also manageable games against the Raiders and Panthers and a fading Washington. Oddly, Atlanta is the only current division leader with a negative net points figure, at a staggering minus-30. TAMPA BAY: Tampa Bay is 1-2 in the South, its victory coming at New Orleans. The Bucs looked explosive and playoff-worthy, albeit against the Giants, in a 30-7 blowout win on Sunday and quarterback Baker Mayfield appears to have his team playing loose and confident. Their remaining schedule seems amenable to a playoff run: two dates with Carolina, hosting Las Vegas and at Dallas. All told, Tampa Bay has three huge division games left in its final six. Crucially, though, none with Atlanta. NEW ORLEANS: The Saints, incredibly, are just two games off the pace after two straight wins, including a 20-17 triumph over Atlanta two weeks ago. The Saints have been an oddity at 2-3 in the division. They’ve split with the Falcons (good), but split with the Panthers (bad). The seven-game losing streak that defines their season included all three division defeats, and there’s tough home matchups ahead against the Rams and Packers.  CAROLINA: The Panthers are incredibly interesting for a last-place team. Benched, then reinstated, quarterback Bryce Young is suddenly playing like a number one draft pick, orchestrating a comeback from an 11-point halftime deficit against Kansas City on Sunday and setting up... a heartbreaking last-second defeat. Carolina is 1-2 in the division, having split with the Saints and lost at home to Atlanta. And it represents a real variable in determining the outcome of the South. Carolina had won two in a row—against the Saints and Giants—before Sunday’s 30-27 loss to the Chiefs. If the last three weeks have been more about a young team and quarterback growing up and less about playing one of the worst teams in the NFL (New York) and another with a flare for making life hard on itself (Kansas City), then the Panthers could go as far in deciding the NFC South as the two teams with a real chance to capture it. It begins in Week 13 when Carolina hosts Tampa Bay. It continues on Dec. 29 with the Panthers at Tampa Bay. Carolina visits Atlanta in the final game of the regular season. Copyright 2024"

For the first time since Super Bowl XLVII, the Harbaugh brothers meet again almost 12 years later as John leads his Baltimore Ravens (7-4) into California to test the Chargers (7-3). Already dueling for wildcard position in the AFC, this matchup finds two teams in good standing for the playoffs win or lose. But a potential tiebreaker in seeding the top seven from the conference comes out of this head-to-head fight for the No. 5 seed and first wildcard position. No team currently on the bubble has better than a 20% chance to reach the postseason, so a loss isn't a death knell to either side. --Pressure is modest on Monday night The Ravens are currently the No. 6 seed in the playoff picture, one spot behind the Chargers. The Chargers have played one fewer game due to a bye in Week 5. Remarkably, none of the nine teams currently outside the AFC playoff picture have up to six wins on the season. Even with a loss on Monday night, the Chargers and Ravens will still have no worse than an 85% chance of making the playoffs.  Those circumstances should allow both teams to play at their best.  We already know the Ravens have one of the most potent offenses in the league. They rank first in the FTN Fantasy Defense-adjusted Value Over Average (DVOA) metric. And it's a good thing. Because their defense can be particularly vulnerable, ranking 25th in allowing 362 yards per game.  --Prop Stop: RBs raised by Ravens Five times the Ravens have allowed 320-plus passing yards in 11 games. Third downs are a problem, and a defense asked to be on the field more than 65 snaps seven times is staring down the barrel at a grind-em-down offensive philosophy that spells doom for the secondary in the second half. A rotation of J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards, former Ravens backs now leading the Chargers' productive running game (121.6 yards per game) is ample enough to force the Ravens to play to defend the run.  But Baltimore's big-play woes in the secondary multiply when they have to commit a safety to slow down an opponent's running game.  Six of QB Justin Herbert's 13 TD passes this season were on pass plays of more than 25 yards. He is thriving in play-action with more than 700 yards and three touchdowns off of run fakes since Week 6, which is No. 1 in the NFL. Big plays are there vertically and in the short screen game to push Herbert across the 300-yard passing mark for the second time this season. Prop pick: Herbert over 300 passing yards (+220, Fan Duel) --Chargers can hurt Ravens by air According to Pro Football Focus, the Ravens' secondary has the lowest grade (63.0) of all three levels of its defense. Moreover, their explosive passing plays allowed of 20 or more yards are the league's second-highest (50). As a result, there's no question that the Chargers can get after this Ravens defense through the air. Quarterback Justin Herbert is known to push the ball down the field. The Oregon product ranks ninth in intended air yards, averaging 8.6 per attempt.  This metric is particularly crucial because it shows the average distance of his passes from behind the line of scrimmage even before the throw reaches the intended receiver. There aren't a ton of check-downs in this Chargers offense, and Herbert has been extremely precise with his accuracy, having thrown just one interception the entire season.  While they generally like to play a more controlled game, the Chargers are more than capable of holding their own in a shootout like last week in their 34-27 victory over the Bengals. Herbert completed only 17 of his 36 pass attempts but still threw for 297 yards. That stat line shows the aggressiveness of the Chargers' downfield strategy, which could be pretty effective against the Ravens' pass defense. The Chargers offense intrigues me the most because of their chances of putting up some points -- everyone does against the Ravens this season. Their team total of 23.5 points is available at DraftKings and well within my projection. Pick: Chargers team total over 23.5 (-125) --Michael Nwaneri, Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Needing 2 yards for a tying two-point conversion late in the fourth quarter against first-place Pittsburgh, the Ravens kept star running back Derrick Henry on the sidelines and subsequently came up short. The Steelers took over, ran off the final 1:06 and secured an 18-16 home win on Nov. 17 that dropped Baltimore 1.5 games behind them in the AFC North. Plenty of questions lingered from the two-point loss, but the biggest one of them all was obvious: Why wasn’t Henry on the field with the game on the line.  Nobody from the Ravens gave an insightful answer, but Baltimore’s decision to sideline Henry encapsulated a dynamic that has hampered the team over the past few seasons.  The Ravens are seemingly afraid of how good they can be. You have Henry, a two-time rushing champion, and Lamar Jackson, a two-time MVP, leading an offense that entered the Pittsburgh contest putting up a league-leading 31.8 points per game. So why is only one of them on the field for the biggest play of the game? Wasn’t this why you signed Henry in March? For moments like this? The guy’s averaging 6 yards a carry and only needs to gain a third of that to tie the game against the lone team that separates you from first place. Put him on the field!  You don’t need to give Henry the ball—I agree that doing so could be a bit too predictable—but at least make the Steelers think. Baltimore didn’t, and instead of having to worry about stopping either Henry or Jackson, Pittsburgh knew the game was in the latter’s hands. The Steelers appropriately sent the house and forced an incompletion on an awkward play that looked doomed from the start. I’m not saying the Ravens would have converted the two-point attempt with Henry on the field, but you have to figure whatever play they ran would have at least been more competent.  How could it not have been? Deploying your bruising running back with your electrifying quarterback is bound to keep a defense—even one as sturdy as Pittsburgh's—on edge.  It was almost like Baltimore chose to make the moment harder than it needed to be. And that’s really nothing new. The Steelers deserve credit, of course, but Sunday’s game was another instance where the Ravens did plenty to beat themselves. This time it was 12 penalties, three turnovers and two missed kicks on top of the questionable call on the two-point attempt. Frankly, that’s how most of Baltimore’s losses in recent seasons have played out. Untimely mistakes and unexplainable lapses that flip a winnable game into an inexcusable defeat. Last Sunday’s game was a bit different in the sense that it didn’t involve a blown fourth-quarter lead. The Ravens have plenty of those losses, including two this season. Baltimore coughed up a 10-point lead at home to Las Vegas in Week 2 and couldn’t hold a one-point edge over the final 2:36 at Cleveland in Week 8. And there could have been more. The Ravens nearly blew a 22-point advantage at Dallas in Week 3 and allowed Tampa Bay to score twice in the final 3:46 of a less-than-comfy 41-31 road win in Week 7. In those cases, it’s almost like Baltimore gets bored and eases up just to make things more interesting, only for it to sometimes backfire in the end. No team has done it more as of late—the Ravens have lost a league-high 10 games over the last four seasons after leading by at least seven points in the fourth quarter. It has to be especially frustrating for Baltimore fans considering that the Ravens are rarely flat-out beat. Baltimore’s last loss by more than eight points came in Week 18 of 2022, a 27-16 defeat at Cincinnati that Jackson missed with a knee injury. With Jackson starting, the Ravens haven’t lost a game by more than eight since Nov. 10, 2021. It’s like Baltimore has no killer instinct. The Ravens have perhaps the deepest roster in the league and are essentially impossible to dominate, yet they can’t stop stubbing their own toe. Whether it’s letting up too soon in the game or—as was the case Sunday—not taking advantage of their weapons when it’s most appropriate, Baltimore has cost itself far too many times. As they chase their first Super Bowl title in 12 years, the Ravens don’t need to look at Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Buffalo or Detroit to find out who their biggest threat is. All they have to do is look in the mirror. Copyright 2024"

Mention Los Angeles Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh, for example, and it’s likely at least part of the free association would steer one to reference his trusty khakis. Harbaugh also will wear a little-brother complex into today’s “Monday Night Football” matchup against the visiting Baltimore Ravens. It’s the third time he’ll face his older brother, John, who, like Jim, has his team positioned for an AFC playoff spot. John has bested Jim in both previous meetings, including a 34-31 Ravens victory against the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII. The Chargers are off to a 7-3 start in Jim’s first season at the helm, with the Ravens (7-4) among the teams on their heels for a wild card. Let’s look more closely at Harbaugh Bowl III and an NHL contest with coaching intrigue of its own. Baltimore stands just one game behind Pittsburgh for the AFC North lead after the Steelers’ snowy loss in Cleveland on Thursday night. Elements won’t be an issue at SoFi Stadium, which doesn’t bode well for Baltimore. The Ravens have allowed 3,351 passing yards, most in the NFL, and only five teams yield more than Baltimore’s 7.7 yards per attempt against. Enter Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert, whose 7.9 yards per attempt are tied for ninth among the league’s regular passers. After a slow start to the season, Herbert has passed for at least 279 yards in three of four games since going for a season-high 349 in Week 7 at Arizona. That includes 297 in last week’s 34-27 home thriller over Cincinnati. Another AFC North foe in town, another Chargers air show. Justin Herbert over 255.5 passing yards, -115 (BetMGM) $100,000 Daily Race Sign up now to claim For help with a gambling problem, call or text the NCPG - (1-800-522-4700)  First Bet Safety Net $1000 or Bet $5 & Get $150 Sign up now and get the choice of two incredible offers.

The Ravens complement that with a rushing attack that leads the league with 5.8 yards per carry and is facing a Los Angeles defense that’s in the bottom third of the league in defensive yards per carry against. Considering that the Chargers have defended the second fewest running attempts in the league, they could be in for a frustrating night against an attack that features Derrick Henry and mobile quarterback Lamar Jackson.

He skated for 67 games for St. Louis as a rookie in 1993-94 and spent 2020-22 as an assistant under Craig Berube. On Monday, St. Louis will be more interested in its new coach’s familiarity with a foe. Just one day after swooping in to hire Montgomery following last week’s dismissal from the Boston Bruins, St. Louis visits Boston’s Eastern Conference counterpart, the New York Rangers. Out of the playoff field the past two seasons, St. Louis entered this campaign eager to snap that drought. Instead, the Blues have been stagnant. At 9-12-1, they’re tied for fifth in the Central Division with 19 points and are 2-6-1 over their past nine games. The Montgomery Era in St. Louis won’t begin with pushovers; after visiting the Rangers (25 points), the Blues head to Eastern Conference-leading New Jersey (30 points) next. With New York coming off consecutive losses in western Canada, though, look for the Blues to capitalize on the famed new coach kickstart and edge the Blueshirts. Montgomery’s sudden availability changed everything, St. Louis general manager Doug Armstrong said, so why not the on-ice results, too?

"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",Bench play could be key for Nets against Warriors,https://deadspin.com/bench-play-could-be-key-for-nets-against-warriors/,2024-11-25T13:02:42.479Z,The Brooklyn Nets hope a productive bench will provide energy to a team on a back-to-back when they visit the Golden State Warriors on Monday night in,"The Brooklyn Nets hope a productive bench will provide energy to a team on a back-to-back when they visit the Golden State Warriors on Monday night in San Francisco. Noah Clowney hit five 3-pointers among 18 points and Shake Milton chipped in 10 as the Nets, getting 44 points from their reserves, opened a four-day, three-game Western swing with a 108-103 win at Sacramento on Sunday. Jalen Wilson added seven points, including a key late free throw, and Keon Johnson had six among the Brooklyn reserves, who spelled their starters for a total of 101 minutes on the front half of the back-to-back. Brooklyn won the battle of the backups 44-9. Trusting the second-stringers is one reason the Nets have been able to adjust quickly to new coach Jordi Fernandez's up-tempo style, starter Cameron Johnson pointed out. ""We're gonna pick up and guard; we're gonna ball-pressure. We're gonna shoot threes and we're gonna run,"" Johnson said. ""We've done a good job of that so far. Not perfect. Room for improvement. But I'm excited about the direction this team is headed."" The Nets, who recorded just 32 victories a year ago, have won two of their past three, including Sunday's hard-earned triumph in Sacramento after blowing an early 19-point lead. They will be seeing the Warriors for the first time this season. Golden State has won five in a row at home, including victories over the Dallas Mavericks and Memphis Grizzlies that propelled them to first place in the West: Group C of the NBA Cup. The Warriors have assured themselves of a spot in the tournament's Western semifinals. Golden State clinched that spot with a 112-108 win at New Orleans on Friday. The Warriors didn't respond well to a back-to-back of their own Saturday, falling 104-94 at San Antonio. Afterward, Warriors coach Steve Kerr insisted a fourth loss in 16 games wasn't about to carry over to a three-day, two-game homestand. Golden State hosts Oklahoma City on Wednesday. ""Keep on keeping on. You move forward,"" he said. ""It's been a great start to the season. Disappointing loss. You learn from it."" The Warriors have lost two of their past four, a stretch in which Stephen Curry has seen his point production drop from 26 to 23 to 19 to 14. Meanwhile, Andrew Wiggins has picked up his pace, scoring 20 or more in all four games, hitting 34 of his 59 shots (57.6 percent). Winning Monday's opener of the season series could carry a little more weight than usual if the clubs continue a recent trend. Each of the teams' two-game series since the 2015-16 season have ended in a sweep, with Brooklyn taking a pair in 2022-23 and Golden State getting even last season. Brooklyn's Cam Thomas and Curry put on quite a show in the most recent meeting in San Francisco last December, with Thomas going for 41 points and Curry 37. Golden State got the better of the bench play that night. The Warriors' reserves outscored their Brooklyn counterparts 30-13. -Field Level Media Copyright 2024"
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",Kansas State looks for consolation in contest vs. Longwood,https://deadspin.com/kansas-state-looks-for-consolation-in-contest-vs-longwood/,2024-11-25T13:02:34.153Z,"Kansas State and Longwood will vie for third place in the Paradise Jam in St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. ,It's not how either team expected to","Kansas State and Longwood will vie for third place in the Paradise Jam in St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  It's not how either team expected to spend early Monday evening. The Wildcats (4-2) dropped a 67-65 decision to Liberty in the second semifinal Sunday night when three shots in the final 10 seconds went awry. The Lancers (6-1), in turn, recorded their first loss after McNeese State's Sincere Parker scored a career-high 31 points in an 84-69 decision on Sunday. Michael Christmas scored 12 points and Emanuel Richards and Johan Nziemi each added 11 for Longwood, but Parker's effort overshadowed the Longwood trio.  ""A disappointing night for the Lancers,"" Longwood head coach Griff Aldrich said. ""While I'm really proud of the group competing in the latter part of the second half, we could not overcome the mental miscues.  ""Tonight will be a valuable learning experience as it exposed some weak spots. While we never want to lose, we will learn from this game and be better for it in the future.""  Kansas State will have trouble finding any silver lining in Sunday's loss. Trailing by two points, the Wildcats had three chances to tie or take the lead on their final possession. Dug McDaniel's 3-pointer caromed off the rim into the hands of David N'Guessan, who misfired on his putback attempt. McDaniel's 3-pointer at the buzzer also was off target. Head coach Jerome Tang tried to put a positive spin on it following the loss. ""At the end of the game, we got a score to cut it to two, and we did it quick so they had to get a shot up,"" he said. ""Then we got a stop. Then Dug McDaniel had an open 3, and I'll live with that every day. David N'Guessan got a chance at a putback and we missed. ""Tough people do the next right thing so we're going to rehydrate, eat, get some rest. The staff will have a game plan put together and we'll be ready to rock and roll (Monday)."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",Thunder's Isaiah Hartenstein aims to make impact vs. Kings,https://deadspin.com/thunders-isaiah-hartenstein-aims-to-make-impact-vs-kings/,2024-11-25T12:57:29.575Z,"Isaiah Hartenstein's return to action came at a good time for the Oklahoma City Thunder.,With star center Chet Holmgren out with a fractured pelvis, H","Isaiah Hartenstein's return to action came at a good time for the Oklahoma City Thunder. With star center Chet Holmgren out with a fractured pelvis, Hartenstein is a pivotal player for the Thunder. Hartenstein will look to follow a strong season debut when Oklahoma City visits the Sacramento Kings on Monday night. Hartenstein missed the Thunder's first 15 games due to a broken left hand. But he excelled Wednesday against the Portland Trail Blazers when he had 13 points, 14 rebounds and four blocked shots in 29 minutes off the bench during his team's 109-99 victory. ""He's still a little bit rusty out there,"" Oklahoma City star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said of Hartenstein. ""But he changed the game for sure. He's an anchor. He sees everything, lets you know early and loud. And it's great to have that behind you. It allows you to adhere to the ball, be aggressive, and be decisive defensively. Yeah, he was special."" Hartenstein was scooped up as a free agent in the offseason with a stunning three-year, $87 million contract offer. The big money came after he started a career-best 49 games with the New York Knicks last season. He averaged 7.8 points and a career-best 8.3 rebounds. He was signed to be a supporting frontcourt player, but his role will grow with Holmgren out approximately two more months after being injured against the Golden State Warriors on Nov. 10. Jalen Williams, who has been playing in the interior with Holmgren and Hartenstein out, also had a strong first impression of his new teammate. He said Hartenstein was putting in the work while waiting for the hand to heal. ""I think just coming in there day in and day out, knowing you have to condition and work on your game without your dominant hand, is tough,"" Williams said. ""He made the most of it, and now he's coming back. ""I didn't really see the ramp-up, obviously. We've been on the road or gone when he got the cast off. I assume he was working just as hard when he got the cast off."" Monday's game will be the first of a stretch in which the Thunder play 10 of 12 games on the road. Sacramento, meanwhile, has dropped a season-worst three straight games after falling 108-103 to the visiting Brooklyn Nets on Sunday night. The Kings allowed 19 3-pointers -- 13 in the first half -- and committed 16 turnovers leading to 24 Brooklyn points. ""To give up 13 made 3s the way we did in the first half is tough to live with,"" Sacramento coach Mike Brown said. ""On top of that, we turned the ball over. We had 16 turnovers for 24 points. Somehow, someway, we have to do a better job of taking care of the basketball."" De'Aaron Fox scored 31 points on 10-of-16 shooting from the field and has topped 30 points in three of the past five games. He is averaging 39.4 points during the stretch, including a franchise-record 60 against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Nov. 15. But during the fourth quarter against the Nets, Fox took just three shots (missing each) and scored only one point. Sacramento was outscored 20-15 in the period and was 6 of 23 from the field and missed all seven 3-point attempts. DeMar DeRozan (18 points) was 3 of 8 in the quarter, and Domantas Sabonis (13 points, 18 rebounds) was 1 of 6. ""These guys have a lot of freedom out there to do what they want out there ...,"" Brown said of DeRozan and Sabonis. ""I would not say those guys were in his way. But we would rather see Foxy stay aggressive, too."" The teams split four matchups last season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

To advance in the winner's bracket, the Eagles (4-1) cruised to an 82-52 win Sunday over Old Dominion.  Missouri State (4-1) topped previously undefeated High point 71-61. Donald Hand Jr. posted a 12-point, 10-rebound double-double and Fred Payne added 11 points in 14 minutes off the bench to lead Boston College in its opener in the Cayman Islands, while the eight other scorers for fourth-year coach Earl Grant's team scored between six and nine points. ""I thought the players really won the day,"" Grant told WEEI. ""I felt good before we came to the Cayman Islands because of the way we practiced. ... I think today was just a carry-over of the fruits of our labor."" A complete effort from the Eagles featured a season-high 18 assists and saw freshman Luka Toews nail two 3-pointers. ""You want (the young players coming off the bench) to grow up,"" Grant said. ""Specifically in a tournament like this, with three games in three days, you need to use the bench. ... Hopefully (our starters) understand that and have a lot of energy for (the next game)."" Boston College has never faced Missouri State, just as it hadn't met Old Dominion. Led by a career-high 27 points and 10 rebounds from Vincent Brady II, Missouri State used a 40-26 advantage on the glass -- including 16 offensive boards -- and 17-of-21 free-throw shooting to hold off High Point. Coach Cuonzo Martin's Bears, who were picked 11th out of 12 teams in the Missouri Valley Conference's preseason poll, have won four straight since a 72-65, season-opening loss at Butler of the Big East.  ""This was a great win against a very talented, well-coached team,"" Martin said. ""We knew we had to get great guard play and fight hard to the final buzzer, and it was a great game between two very talented teams."" Dez White, who spent his freshman season at Austin Peay, remains the team's top scorer with an average of 16.4 points per game after a 13-point Sunday. Brady, a transfer from IU Indianapolis, was last week's Valley Newcomer of the Week. He contributes 15.4 points and 5.6 rebounds a contest while shooting 42.1 percent from 3-point range. In the Cayman final on Tuesday, the winner of the Boston College-Missouri State game will meet the winner of the earlier game Monday between South Dakota State and Boise State. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Each team will enter Monday's matchup with a five-game winning streak. The team that wins Monday's game will own the NBA's longest winning streak.   Both teams will be playing their second game in as many days.   Boston extended its streak with a 107-105 victory over Minnesota on Sunday. Jaylen Brown tossed in 29 points for the Celtics, who improved their home record to 6-2. ""I haven't shot the ball to start off the season as well as I would have liked,"" Brown said. ""I feel like I'm due for a lot of makes. I feel like my shots were good. I feel like I'm a great shooter, but also feel like I'm great at other things as well -- getting to the basket, getting to the paint, drawing opportunities for my guys. So it's just a balance. It's a long season and I'm just focused on trying to rack up wins.""   Brown was 10 of 18 from the floor and 7 of 10 from 3-point range. He scored Boston's first 15 points on five 3-pointers.  Boston coach Joe Mazzulla also praised Brown for his defensive effort, particularly his defense on Minnesota's Anthony Edwards on the game's final possession.   ""Yeah, it's great to have a player of his caliber take defense to another level and take matchups,"" Mazzulla said. ""When your best players are some of your best defenders, it can kind of set the tone for your team in the locker room defensively. So, he takes pride in individual matchups, and he did a great job defensively.""   The Clippers received 23 points and eight assists from James Harden in beating Philadelphia 125-99 Sunday night. The Clippers raised their road record to 4-3.    Ivica Zubac added 16 points and 12 rebounds for the Clippers.   ""We run plays for him just to try and get him touches and establish Zu on the low block,"" Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said of Zubac. ""When he's the anchor of your defense you gotta keep him happy. Having him block shots, having him blitzing pick and rolls, having him be the anchor and talking on the back side, you have to reward him with some touches, and so we've been able to do that.""   Los Angeles has held each of its past four opponents -- Golden State, Orlando, Sacramento and Philadelphia -- under 100 points. The Clippers are 6-0 on the season when the other team scores fewer than 100.   ""You know right now we're just working hard, playing together, trying to do the right things on the floor and right now it's paying off,"" Kris Dunn said.   Norman Powell missed his third consecutive games Sunday while dealing with a sore hamstring. Powell leads the Clippers in scoring (23.3 points per game). Boston center Luke Kornet didn't play Sunday because of a hamstring injury. Al Horford did play against Minnesota, but he likely will sit out Monday's game since he typically doesn't play in both games when the Celtics play on consecutive days. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

On Jan. 26 of last season, superstar Luka Doncic scored 73 points in the Mavericks' 148-143 win. Doncic, who was traded for Atlanta point guard Trae Young on draft night in 2018, will miss Monday's game with a wrist injury sustained in last Tuesday's win over the New Orleans Pelicans. Fortunately for Dallas, the injury shouldn't sideline Doncic for extended time. Monday's contest will serve as the Mavericks' final game of a three-city road trip. Dallas saw its four-game winning streak end with a 123-118 overtime loss to the Miami Heat on Sunday. Dallas was nursing a two-point lead before Jimmy Butler's dunk with 4.1 seconds remaining in regulation. The Heat held the Mavericks without a point for the final 3:21 of overtime. For Dallas coach Jason Kidd, understanding how to play without Doncic could benefit the team in the long run. ""You never know who's gonna have foul trouble or an injury,"" Kidd said. ""The bench has been in the positive since Luka's been out, but unfortunately that wasn't the case tonight. You just never know who's going to be able to play, and this is a great lesson learned for all of us."" Doncic's average of 28.1 points per game ranks eighth in the NBA. Kyrie Irving, who led the way on Sunday with 27 points, is second on the team with 24.1 points per contest. The Hawks haven't played since Friday, when they lost 136-122 to the Chicago Bulls. Young and Jalen Johnson each scored 25 points for Atlanta, which allowed the Bulls to shoot 57 percent from the field and 44.2 percent on 3-pointers. In an all-around effort, Chicago also made 19 of 21 free throws in the offensive barrage. Atlanta's 120.5 points per game allowed are third most in the league, an area of concern for the club. ""When you play a team that puts up 50-40-90, those are Hall of Fame numbers,"" Hawks coach Quin Snyder said. ""That's not to say you can't do more. We could have contested better, we could have kept them out of the paint more. I thought that was a big part of the game, as well as our inability to score at times."" Following a 2-0 start to the season, the Hawks haven't been able to reach the .500 mark since Oct. 28. Atlanta is vying to avoid dropping three in a row for the first time since that stretch. Young paces the Hawks with 22.1 ppg and an NBA-best 11.7 assists per game. Johnson follows with 19.4 points per contest and a team-high 10.4 rebounds. Dyson Daniels, one of the lone bright spots for a struggling defense, leads the league with 3.2 steals per game. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Pacers will try to extend New Orleans' skid to five games Monday night when they face the Pelicans in Indianapolis. Indiana, which had lost straight three games on a winless road trip to Toronto, Houston and Milwaukee, shut down the Wizards' offense after allowing 130, 130 and 129 points during the losing streak. The Pacers allowed just 16 fourth-quarter points to the NBA-worst Wizards. ""We got better defensively,"" Indiana coach Rick Carlisle said. ""We were better at keeping their drivers square in front of us, and we made some good things happen offensively."" Pascal Siakam scored 22 points and Tyrese Haliburton had 21 to lead seven double-figure scorers for Indiana. The Pacers improved to 5-2 at home even though they played without three key injured players - Andrew Nembhard, Aaron Nesmith and Ben Sheppard. ""Right now, we're looking for anybody with energy that will run and will give the best possible effort defensively,"" Carlisle said. The Pelicans are hopeful of ending their losing streak because they slowly are getting injured players back on the floor. Leading scorer Brandon Ingram (ankle) returned from a one-game absence and Jordan Hawkins (back) came back from a seven-game absence in a 112-108 home loss to the Golden State Warriors on Friday.  ""I had a minute restriction on me, but I felt like I got up and down a lot,"" said Hawkins, who scored six points in 20 minutes. ""Still trying to get my conditioning right but it felt good.""  Ingram, who also leads New Orleans in assists for the season, finished with 18 points and seven assists in 36 minutes. ""He's battling through some bumps and bruises right now,"" Pelicans coach Willie Green said. ""We're putting a lot on his shoulders. He's been doing a really good job of coming in every day and getting his work, getting his treatment, and keeping himself available to get on the floor and help his team.""  Trey Murphy III has sat out the back end of two recent back-to-back sets as he manages a hamstring injury that sidelined him for the first 10 games of the season. He has started all five games in which he has played, and his point total has gone up in each game, topping out at 24 against the Warriors. Green praised his team for having ""game-plan discipline and execution"" at ""a high level,"" against Golden State, but added that, ""Unfortunately, in the NBA, there are just no moral victories."" Pelicans guard CJ McCollum said he hopes to return from a 13-game absence due to a strained adductor to play Monday.

His absence on Saturday served to reinforce that.,With Cunningham s","The Detroit Pistons already knew how much they need Cade Cunningham in the lineup. His absence on Saturday served to reinforce that. With Cunningham sidelined by a hip injury, they lost at Orlando 111-100.  Detroit is unlikely to have its franchise player again when it hosts Toronto on Monday night. Cunningham was listed as doubtful by the team on Sunday. Cunningham suffered the hip injury on Thursday when he took a hard fall late in the fourth quarter of an overtime loss to Charlotte. ""Obviously those injuries are tough when you take a blow to the tailbone-ish area,"" coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""That's the core of where your movement starts."" The Pistons' offense predictably suffered without their floor leader, who is averaging 23.5 points and 8.9 assists a game. They committed 17 turnovers against the Magic -- which Orlando converted into 29 points -- and racked up only 16 assists. ""It's hard to overcome that, and a lot of them were preventable and then too many of them came in bunches,"" Bickerstaff said. ""Between the turnovers and offensive rebounds we gave up, it's difficult to overcome. That's where we keep talking about winning the possession battle."" The Pistons, who have lost three straight games, allowed 17 offensive rebounds. They didn't have a 20-point scorer to pick up the slack for Cunningham. ""Let them get too many easy baskets, let them get on the glass and things of that nature, get second chance points,"" forward Tobias Harris said. ""Didn't take care of the basketball well too, offensively. Just a little bit too lax with our execution as well. When we do play and Cade's not out there, it's a chance for us to come out and really just exploit other teams, like the Magic, some of their defensive schemes. ""We didn't get enough ball movement in that second half to do that, and that hurt us -- turnovers and lack of ball movement. We didn't make many shots as well."" The Raptors, meanwhile, will play the second game of a back-to-back set on Monday. Toronto lost to league leader Cleveland on Sunday, 122-108. A poor first quarter doomed the Raptors. They were down 38-22 after the first 12 minutes. Toronto had defeated Indiana and Minnesota -- teams that reached the conference finals last season -- in its previous two games. RJ Barrett scored a combined 70 points in those victories but was held to 16 points on 6-of-18 shooting by the Cavs. ""To be honest with you, I wish we could play this team every week because we could learn a lot,"" Raptors coach Darko Rajakovic said. The loss dropped the Raptors to 0-9 on the road. They'll need a win on Monday to avoid matching the worst road start in franchise history, set in 1997-98. They are in the midst of a four-game road swing. Bruce Brown is expected to make his season debut during the trip. Brown has been rehabbing a knee injury that hampered him last season. ""I was on one leg,"" he said. ""You could watch, first half I was pretty much fine, once the second half started and it got really stiff."" Detroit recorded a 99-95 victory over Toronto on Nov. 15 behind Malik Beasley's 20 points. That game was part of the NBA Cup.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Donovan Mitchell added 26 points, Allen finished with 23 points and 13 rebounds and Mobley chipped in 14 points and 11 rebounds in the win.  Scottie Barnes and Gradey Dick led the Raptors with 18 points each. Jakob Poeltl had 12 points and a game-high 19 rebounds. RJ Barrett added 16 points, six rebounds and six assists for Toronto, which has lost eight of its past 10 games.  With the Cavaliers leading 94-90, Mobley threw down a dunk with 0.8 seconds left in the third to ignite a 12-1 run. Jerome's three-pointer, one of four he hit in the game, capped the surge and gave Cleveland a 106-91 lead with 9:23 left in the game. Mitchell stepped up in the fourth, hitting 5 of 8 shots from the floor and scoring 11 points as the Cavaliers pulled away in the quarter. Issac Okoro's shot from inside pushed the lead to 17 points -- the largest of the game -- with 8:30 left in the fourth. After Toronto went ahead 2-0 -- its only lead of the game -- the Cavaliers responded with a 23-7 run, which was capped by Jerome's three-pointer with 5:17 left in the first. Cleveland shot 65.2 percent from the floor in the quarter and held the Raptors to 36 percent shooting as the Cavaliers led 38-16 after one period. Toronto responded in the second. Jamison Battle scored 11 of his 13 points in the quarter to help the Raptors trim the deficit. Ochai Abaji's runner cut Cleveland's lead to 50-46 with 3:20 left in the half. The Cavaliers battled back and took a 65-55 cushion into the break. Jerome had 17 points and Allen added 15 in the first half to pace Cleveland. Dick scored 12 points for Toronto. The Cavaliers outscored the Raptors 64-42 in the paint while also hitting 16 of 41 attempts from beyond the arc in the win. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Over the past decade, teams that are in playoff position on the U.S. holiday have a better than 75 percent chance of making the postseason. That statistic makes the home-and-home series between the Seattle Kraken and Anaheim Ducks -- Monday night in Anaheim and Wednesday in Seattle -- of greater importance. The Kraken (10-10-1) and Ducks (8-8-3) sit fourth and fifth, respectively, in the Western Conference wild-card chase. The Kraken are three points behind wild-card leaders Colorado and Edmonton and the Ducks are five back. This could be a big week for the Kraken, who also have a home-and-home set against the San Jose Sharks, who are last in the Pacific Division. ""Teams are so close in the division; we're going to need to beat these guys to get in at the end,"" Kraken defenseman Brandon Montour said. ""It seems like it's going to be tight. The first 20 (games) were tight. ... These games we have got to be up for. Anaheim is up next. We got to come with that desperation and get those points."" Despite a 2-1 road loss Saturday afternoon against the Los Angeles Kings, the Kraken have won five of their past seven games. But their play on the road hasn't been strong, as they've lost five in a row away from Climate Pledge Arena and been outscored 17-5 in those contests. Montour scored Seattle's lone goal against the Kings with 1:34 remaining and Kraken goalie Joey Daccord pulled for an extra attacker. ""All around, every guy in our room knows he has to be better and can play better, myself included,"" Kraken forward Matty Beniers said. ""We just didn't play our game, didn't get to our game fast enough."" The Kraken will be without forward Jordan Eberle, their captain, for the next three months after he underwent surgery on his pelvis Friday. The Ducks lost 3-2 in overtime Friday at home to the Buffalo Sabres, ending Anaheim's three-game winning streak. ""The first period we were a little bit slow,"" Ducks coach Greg Cronin said. ""We didn't have the same snap we had the last few games and I thought the second and third period we played the way we wanted to play."" Drew Helleson and Isac Lundestrom scored to give Anaheim a 2-0 lead before the Sabres rallied. Despite making 30 saves, goalie John Gibson suffered his first loss in four starts this season. The Ducks' Frank Vatrano couldn't convert two scoring chances late in the second period that would have extended the lead. Vatrano has just two goals in 18 games after tallying a career-high 37 times last season. ""Last year was a breakthrough year, so the expectation that he's going to be a 30-plus goal scorer has been set,"" Cronin said. ""I'm not worried about him scoring goals. ... I do believe that his shooting percentage will go up. It's really low right now, but the worst thing he could do is stop shooting the puck."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Flames will face McNeese State in the championship game Monday night. The Wildcats will face Longwood in the third-place game. Porter and Metheny, who both stand less than 6 feet tall, had 17 points in the second half against a much taller Wildcats team. Porter's 17 points led Liberty (6-1). Isaiah Ihnen added 16 and Metheny had 13. Kansas State (4-2) was led by Brendan Hausen with 14 points. Coleman Hawkins added 11, and David N'Guessan and Achor Achor chipped in 10 apiece. The Flames built their biggest lead at 41-33 at the 16:06 mark of the second half. They led 50-44 before Hausen hit back-to-back 3-pointers from almost the same spot to tie the game. Liberty kept grabbing the lead and K-State answered. When Achor hit a baseline turn-around jumper, K-State led 63-62, their first lead since 29-27. But Porter's contested 3-pointer allowed Liberty to regain the lead on the next possession. With the Wildcats trailing 65-63 in the final minute, Hausen missed a 3-pointer and Owen Aquino was fouled on the rebound. He hit both free throws, giving the Flames a 67-63 lead. Hawkins hit a driving layup to trim the deficit to two points. After an empty trip for Liberty, the Wildcats had three chances to tie or take the lead on their final possession. Dug McDaniel's 3-pointer caromed off the rim into the hands of N'Guessan, whose putback missed. McDaniel's 3-pointer at the buzzer was off target. Neither team led by more than five points in the first half. Liberty scored the final eight points of the half and took a 32-29 lead into the locker room. The Flames were led by Ihnen with 10 points off the bench in the first half. Metheny had seven and Porter had six. K-State got six points apiece from McDaniel and CJ Jones, and six points from N'Guessan. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Kings are in third place in the Pacific Division, with the second-best goal differential (plus-six) among their regional rivals, while sitting 5-5-2 in road contests. They now head to the Bay Area to face the Sharks, who are bringing up the rear in the division. Los Angeles' attention to detail while on the road had paid dividends during a strong start to the season, but two defeats on a recent trip to Calgary and Colorado proved that more work is left to be done. The Kings were outscored by a combined 7-3 in those games. A return home got them back on track. They got the best of the Seattle Kraken 2-1 on Saturday when Adrian Kempe and Quinton Byfield scored second-period goals for a 2-0 lead that withstood a Kraken onslaught in the third period. David Rittich had 19 saves. The Kings are finding success without defenseman Drew Doughty (ankle) and forward Arthur Kaliyev (collarbone), while goaltender Darcy Kuemper also is on injured reserve. Byfield's goal on the power play was his third of the season and came in his 200th career game. ""A lot of challenging moments in those 200 games, but to come across it still 22, so still young and hopefully a lot more (to come),"" Byfield said. Already with his 11th start this season, and third consecutive, Rittich has allowed just one goal in each of his past three starts, as well as four of his last five going back to Nov. 5. He made 22 starts all of last season, his first in Los Angeles. ""We've got a pretty deep team and that's all that matters if somebody gets hurt,"" Rittich said. ""Obviously, Drew is a huge, huge part of this team and it's an opportunity for other guys to step up."" The Sharks are on a three-game losing streak after a 4-2 defeat to the Buffalo Sabres at home on Saturday. San Jose has won just once in its last seven games (1-3-3). The Sharks had two separate leads Saturday, the first on a goal from Fabian Zetterlund in the first period and again for a 2-1 advantage when Luke Kunin scored in the second period. It got away when Buffalo scored three times in the third, including the go-ahead goal that came short-handed. ""We had 10 scoring chances on the power play but obviously the short-handed goal really hurts and stings. It's a kick in the gut, really,"" Sharks head coach Ryan Warsofsky said. ""I think (the power play) is starting to come. We've gotten some better looks at it and they're starting to see a little more chemistry."" As it stands, San Jose is 26th on the power play (16.4 percent), but it's still better than the Kings (15.6, tied for 28th). The teams have split two meetings this season, with the Sharks earning a 4-2 victory over the Kings at home on Oct. 29. Former Los Angeles forward Tyler Toffoli scored for San Jose in that game and has 16 points on the season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Logan Cooley had a goal and an assist for Utah, which has lost two of three on a four-game road trip. Jack McBain also scored. Utah goaltender Karel Vejmelka, who also played on Saturday, stopped 32 shots. Toronto's Pontus Holmberg hit the crossbar at 8:28 of the first period. The Maple Leafs went 0-for-2 on the power play in the period.  Utah took advantage of its first power play. Mikhail Sergachev passed to Dylan Guenther, whose shot was tipped in by Cooley from the left circle for his fourth goal of the season at 17:48 of the first. Toronto's Jake McCabe was off for interference. John Tavares made a long pass to Marner, who scored on a breakaway at 5:15 of the second period.  With Sergachev off for tripping, Marner scored his eighth goal of the season at 9:34 of the second during a power play, banking in a sharp-angled shot off Vejmelka. Nylander scored his 14th at 10:50 of the second after winning the puck on a breakaway. He tucked in a backhand that beat Vejmelka. Toronto had a five-on-three power play at 13:17 of the second but did not score. McBain deflected Cooley's shot for his seventh goal of the season at 1:51 of the third period. Toronto's Nicholas Robertson hit the right post with a shot at 8:34 of the third. Utah's Michael Carcone also had his shot hit the left post at 13:19.

Those good feelings evaporated in a loss against the h,"The Knicks left for their five-game road trip on a winning streak and brimming with confidence. Those good feelings evaporated in a loss against the host Utah Jazz on Saturday night, and now New York moves on to Denver to face the Nuggets on Monday. New York's four-game winning streak stopped an up-and-down start to the season, but poor shooting and leaky defense led to the loss against the lowly Jazz. The Knicks nearly overcame a 19-point deficit before Utah pulled away for a 121-106 win. ""We've been struggling on the defensive side for the whole season. When you're not making shots and you're not playing well defensively, that's a recipe for disaster,"" Knicks guard/forward Josh Hart said. ""We've got to figure it out on the defensive end."" New York will have to figure it out quickly against a Denver team that is scoring at a high rate. The Nuggets are tied for fifth in the NBA in scoring average at 117.5 points per game despite not having Aaron Gordon for three weeks and having Nikola Jokic miss three games for the birth of his second child. The burden of trying to stop Jokic, the three-time and reigning MVP, will fall on Karl-Anthony Towns, who is familiar with Denver from his nine seasons with the Minnesota Timberwolves. If the Knicks can't stop the Nuggets defensively, they will need to compensate with better offense, which didn't happen against Utah. ""There's going to be nights that you don't shoot it great,"" New York coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""What you can't do, you can't allow missed shots to take away from the energy that you need from your defense. You have to win games different ways."" Denver is coming off a back-to-back set that started with disappointment and ended with a dominant 127-102 win against the Lakers on Saturday night. The Nuggets blew a late lead at home against the Dallas Mavericks on Friday night but bounced back to win at Los Angeles. That victory was No. 433 for Nuggets coach Michael Malone, passing Doug Moe for the most in franchise history. It was a welcome sight after Denver's NBA Cup loss to the Mavericks, where it was outscored 15-7 in the final three minutes of the 123-120 Dallas win. The Nuggets miss Gordon, but Peyton Watson has filled in nicely in his absence. Watson is averaging 10.0 points per game and has been a strong defensive presence in the starting lineup. He had three blocks in Friday night's loss and is averaging a team-best 1.1 blocks per game. He's also seen the benefit of sharing the court more with Jokic, who leads the NBA in rebounds per game (13.9) and is second in assists per contest (11.3). ""I'm just more comfortable, more game experience. Simple as that. Being able to play with one of the best players to ever pick up a basketball, he demands a lot of attention and I get some looks at the rim in the halfcourt,"" Watson said. ""In transition it's all about being confident, attacking the rim with conviction and just trying to get two points down every time."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Donald Hand Jr. posted his third double-double of the season with 12 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Eagles (4-1) to their third straight victory. Fred Payne added 11 points, while the eight other Boston College scorers recorded between six and nine points. Hand, Chas Kelley III, Luka Toews and Joshua Beadle each knocked down a pair of 3-pointers. Roger McFarlane paced the Eagles with 11 points and five assists along with his six points. Boston College advanced to play Missouri State in the semifinals on Monday evening. Old Dominion (2-4) was led by Robert Davis Jr., who scored 19 points with three of his six field goals coming from distance. The Eagles shot 43.3 percent from the field, hit 10 3-pointers and outrebounded the opposition 46-34. After trailing 4-0 and 9-7 early, Boston College went on a 9-0 run that Payne concluded with a driving layup and a 3-pointer off the bench. Chad Venning's layup with 8:50 left before halftime increased the Eagle advantage to 11, and it continued to grow during a 7-0 spurt during which Dion Brown scored five straight points, including a lay-in for a 3-point play. Toews banged down his first career three at the 3:42 mark and Payne capped the period with a last-minute jumper as Boston College went on to lead 43-24 at halftime. Old Dominion responded to Venning's layup out of halftime with seven points, including a Davis catch-and-shoot triple. An Elijah Strong three with 16:32 left stopped the run, but the Monarchs hung within 15 under near the halfway mark as Davis continued his high-scoring night. A 16-2 run across just 3:57 helped the Eagles break the game wide open. The stretch included a triple from Hand before he set up Jayden Hastings for an alley-oop dunk, while Brown finished his second three-point play with 10:38 left. McFarlane's turnaround shot with 6:02 to go made it a 30-point Boston College lead. Beadle and Toews knocked down treys in the final 4:05. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Musketeers (5-0) are coming off an 80-55 victory on Wednesday over Siena, while the Gamecocks (3-2) beat Mercer on Thursday 84-72. Against Mercer, South Carolina sank a season-best 12 3-pointers -- tied for the fourth-most in a single game under third-year coach Lamont Paris. Jamarii Thomas, a senior transfer from Norfolk State, had 19 points and swished 4 of 5 shots from behind the arc. ""Thomas got some good, clean looks,"" Paris said. ""It was good to see those guys make their shots. Hopefully it gets those guys going in the right direction."" On the season, the Gamecocks are making 7.8 3-pointers per game and shooting 32.5 percent from deep. Senior guard Jacobi Wright makes a team-best 1.8 3-pointers per game and shoots 37.5 percent from behind the arc. At 13.0 ppg, he is second on the team behind Collin Murray-Boyles (15.8). Xavier is allowing eight makes from deep per game and is letting opponents shoot 38.5 percent from behind the arc, which ranks 337th in the country. And despite an undefeated record so far for the Musketeers, third-year coach Sean Miller is worried about his players developing bad habits. ""We have a virus that everybody is looking at the stat sheet, trying to get as many points as they possibly can,"" Miller said after the win over Siena. ""They want to win, but they really want to win and score. We need a couple of guys that are willing to rebound, defend, make the extra pass, play at a high level defensively and understand what makes a team great."" Marcus Foster did a decent job of doing a little bit of everything for Xavier against Siena, piling up 12 points, five rebounds, five assists and a steal. It was the first double-digit scoring outing for Foster -- a grad transfer from Furman -- in a Xavier uniform.

Take Monday night's contest between the Minnesota Wild and Winnipeg Jets in Saint Paul, Minn. The game between the top two teams in the Western Conference provides an early measuring stick for players as well as fans. ""It's a chance to showcase yourself against the best,"" Wild forward Marcus Foligno said. Winnipeg enters the game with an NHL-best 34 points. The Jets have won 17 of their first 21 games, and they have outscored opponents 85-51 this season. After winning back-to-back games against the Florida Panthers and Pittsburgh Penguins, the Jets lost 4-1 on the road against the Nashville Predators in their most recent contest. They will try to avoid suffering back-to-back losses for only the second time this season. The task for the Jets will be more difficult because of the injury absence of defenseman Dylan Samberg, who broke his foot in the loss against Nashville. Samberg was placed on injured reserve and is out indefinitely. The 25-year-old is averaging more than 20 minutes of ice time per game this season. He has six points (three goals, three assists) and a plus-12 rating in 21 games. ""He does so much for us,"" teammate Dylan DeMelo told the Winnipeg Free Press. ""Not just shot blocking, but having a good stick and breaking up a lot of plays."" Jets captain Adam Lowry agreed. ""It would be a big loss if he's out for any length of time,"" he said. Minnesota also is dealing with injuries to key players. The Wild will be without forward Mats Zuccarello, who is sidelined with a lower-body injury after being hit by an opponent's shot. The same could be true for top scorer Kirill Kaprizov, who sustained a lower-body injury after absorbing a knee-on-knee hit against Edmonton Oilers forward Drake Caggiula on Thursday. Kaprizov reportedly avoided a significant injury, but he missed Minnesota's game Saturday against the Calgary Flames and his status for Monday is unclear. He leads the team and ranks second in the NHL with 34 points (13 goals, 21 assists) in 19 games this season. Jets goaltender Connor Hellebuyck is expected to get the start in net. He is 14-2-0 with a 2.13 goals-against average and a .924 save percentage. In 28 career games (27 starts) against Minnesota, Hellebuyck is 13-10-2 with a 2.64 GAA and a .916 save percentage. The Wild are expected to counter with Filip Gustavsson in net. He is 9-3-3 with a 2.13 GAA and a .924 save percentage. Gustavsson has faced Winnipeg six times in his career. He is 4-1-1 in those matchups with a 1.76 GAA and a .943 save percentage. Wild coach John Hynes praised his team heading into Monday's matchup. ""I just like our demeanor,"" Hynes said, per the Star Tribune. ""Our focus is there. It's what's next, what we can control, keeping our energy and mindset in the right place. That's what ultimately gives you the opportunity to be successful."" Minnesota is 4-2-1 at home this season. Winnipeg is 8-3-0 on the road. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Naji Marshall had 19 of his 20 points after the first half and Dereck Lively II had 14 points, 13 rebounds, four assists and two blocks. Klay Thompson, who went 0-for-8 from the floor in Dallas' 123-120 win at Denver on Friday, bounced back with 15 points on 5-for-12 shooting. The Mavericks played without reigning NBA scoring champ Luka Doncic (wrist). Miami, which had been off since Monday, had double-doubles from Bam Adebayo (19 points, 11 rebounds) and Tyler Herro (18 points, 10 boards). The Heat went ahead for good on Adebayo's 3-pointer that made it 120-118 with 2:54 left in overtime. Dallas missed its final seven shots after Lively's dunk put the Mavericks up 118-117 with 3:21 remaining. Adebayo finished 3-of-6 from 3-point range for Miami, which shot 34.1 percent (14-of-41) from distance. Dallas hit 10 of 40 threes (25 percent) and shot 41.9 percent overall. The Mavericks took their first lead since the opening quarter on Irving's 3-pointer that made it 106-103 with 4:34 left in regulation. Dallas clung to a one-point edge as Irving stepped to the free throw line with 8.2 seconds left, but he made just 1 of 2 to leave the door open for the Heat. Butler capitalized with a dunk off a Duncan Robinson feed with 4.3 seconds remaining, and the game went to overtime after Spencer Dinwiddie's long 3-point attempt at the buzzer went in and out.

Miami shot just 28.6 percent in the second quarter - including 1-of-10 on 3-pointers -- but still entered halftime leading 56-51. Just like the second quarter (23-23), the third period was played to a draw (33-33), leaving the Heat with an 89-84 lead heading into the fourth. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

After exchanging the lead 20 times, USC (5-1) opened up a 12-point lead midway through the second half on the strength of a 14-0 run. Agbo knocked down a pair of 3-pointers, part of a 4-of-9 shooting night from beyond the arc for him, during the surge. Grambling (1-4) responded with an 13-3 run that brought the Trojans lead back to a one-possession margin. A P.J. Eason dunk with 4:36 remaining in regulation brought the Tigers within 68-66. Desmond Claude responded with a layup on the other end, and Agbo forced a turnover on the ensuing Grambling possession to set up his own score at the rim. The four quick Trojans points gave USC a cushion it maintained down the stretch. Claude finished with 14 points, five rebounds and five assists. His swipe from Mikale Stevenson in the final minute and transition lay-in put the game away for USC, which closed its season-opening, six-game homestand with a pair of wins after last Sunday's loss to Cal. Grambling led for more than 13 minutes of game time and took a 38-37 lead into halftime, but the Tigers' advantage never grew beyond five points. Grambling matched USC in both overall field goals made, with each knocking down 25, and 3-pointers, with seven apiece. Six of the seven Tigers who scored made at least one 3-pointer, led by Kintavious Dozier's 2-of-3 effort. Dozier scored a team-high 17 points to lead three Tigers in double figures. Stevenson added 14 points and dished 10 assists, while Antwan Burnett chipped in 13 points. USC's ultimate advantage came at the free-throw line. The Trojans got to the charity stripe for 33 attempts, making 23, while Grambling went 12-of-14 at the line. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

In the opener of a four-game road trip, Los Angeles shot 58 percent from the field and 40 percent from long range and dominated the boards 44-33 despite playing without leading scorer Norman Powell (hamstring) and two-way standout Kawhi Leonard (knee). Derrick Jones Jr. chipped in 18 points for the Clippers, while Terance Mann had 13 off the bench. Jared McCain scored 18 points on 3-of-15 shooting from the floor for Philadelphia, which continued to play without Joel Embiid (knee) and Paul George (knee). Tyrese Maxey chipped in 17 points, while Kelly Oubre Jr. notched 12. The Clippers shot 60 percent from the field in the first quarter, with Harden and Amir Coffey each knocking down a pair of 3-pointers. Los Angeles stormed in front 17-5 after less than five minutes had elapsed, and it led by as many as 19 en route to a 39-27 advantage after one quarter. Los Angeles led by at least 11 points throughout the second stanza and went into the break in front 62-50. The Clippers opened the third quarter on a 9-1 run -- Jones scored the first five points of that surge -- to bring the lead to 20 for the first time. Maxey's 3-pointer shortly thereafter inched the hosts within 73-56, but the visitors scored 13 of the next 15 points to go ahead 86-58. Kris Dunn's layup with about four minutes left in the third sent the lead north of 30 for the first time. Los Angeles then took its largest lead on Kevin Porter Jr.'s bucket that made it 95-62 less than a minute later. The Sixers made a 10-2 push to end the third quarter, a run capped by McCain's 3-pointer, to get within 25 heading into the final period.

Tonje scored 25 of those points in the second half on 9-of-11 shooting en route to his second game of 30 or more points this season. Kamari McGee was also a big spark for the Badgers (7-0), burying a clutch 3-pointer in the corner with 2:54 to play to give Wisconsin a 74-70 lead. He finished with 10 points. John Blackwell scored 14 and Nolan Winter added 11 for Wisconsin, which trailed by as many as 14 in the first half before battling back. The Badgers are now 3-0 on the year when down at the half and off to their best start since the 2014-15 campaign, when they finished as the national runner-up. The Panthers (6-1) came in riding the high of their best start since the 2018-19 season, winning their first six games by double figures. Ishmael Leggett led the Panthers with 17. Cameron Cohern added 16 points while Jaland Lowe chipped in 15. The Panthers lost one of their top players early on as Damian Dunn came off the court with a hand injury just over two minutes in and did not return. After trailing 34-27 at the half, the Badgers tied the game at 38-38 with 15:47 to go on a drive to the basket by McGee. Pitt responded with a 6-0 run and led 44-38 after a 3-pointer from Amsal Delalic with 15:02 to go. The Badgers rallied again and led 51-50 after Tonje scored off a layup with 11:15 to go.

Paintsil also had an assist for the second-seeded Galaxy, who will host fourth-seed Seattle next Saturday in their first Western Conference final appearance since winning a record fifth MLS Cup in 2014. Manager Greg Vanney's squad is the highest remaining seed, meaning it will also host the MLS Cup final should it advance past the Sounders. Midfielders Riqui Puig and Marco Reus each had first-half assists for LA, which has outscored opponents 15-3 over three postseason matches. Kelvin Yeboah scored a first-half brace for sixth-seeded Minnesota, which lost for the first time in eight matches in all competitions. Dayne St. Clair also saved a penalty kick to deny Pec -- the newly minted 2024 MLS Newcomer of the Year -- a hat trick. But any late hopes for a Loons comeback ended with Jefferson Diaz's dismissal for a second yellow card in the 82nd minute, which preceded the second goals for Paintsil and Joveljic. Even so, the Galaxy were also dominant 11-on-11 also, and from the very opening seconds when Pec's opener gave the hosts an almost instant lead. Puig played an exceptional outlet ball down the right to pick out the Brazilian on the run. Pec still had a lot to do, eluding the pressure of the retreating Diaz before driving his finish past the charging St. Clair from close range. Yeboah's first tied the game at 1-1 five minutes later, before Joveljic's header of Reus' free kick service put the Galaxy up again in the 18th minute. Paintsil added to the lead before Yeboah converted a second from the penalty spot to make it 3-2 at halftime. But it was Pec's sensational second that put things out of reach early in the second half. After receiving an outlet pass from Puig in his own half, Pec used his exceptional pace and ball control to beat three Minnesota defenders down the right flank before dispatching a low finish past St. Clair and inside the far left post. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Florida Atlantic's Leland Walker had 16 points, but he missed a potential winning 3-pointer on the game's last shot. Matas Vokietaitis contributed 10 points and nine rebounds for the Owls (4-4). Seton Hall was up by 15 points early in the second half and held a 54-40 advantage with about eight minutes to play. With back-to-back baskets from Vokietaitis to cap an 8-0 spurt, Florida Atlantic trimmed its hole to six by the game's six-minute mark. Isaiah Coleman had four points during a late-game stretch to help the Pirates fend off Florida Atlantic rallies. But Walker's basket drew the Owls to within 60-57 before Yacine Toumi's tip-in gave Seton Hall a two-possession lead again. A 3-pointer for KyKy Tandy with 25 seconds left pulled Florida Atlantic to within 62-61. Seton Hall's Prince Aligbe made one of two free-throw attempts before Walker misfired and ended up 0-for-5 on 3s. The third-place spot marked Seton Hall's best finish in a multi-team event in six years. This was the third year that the Pirates played in the Charleston Classic and they've posted a 2-1 record in the tournament each time. Middleton shot 4-for-4 from the field with two 3-pointers. Florida Atlantic was 4-for-28 on 3s, with Tandy and Max Langenfeld both draining two, while the rest of the team was 0-for-15 from deep. Seton Hall held a 34-22 halftime edge.

Garcia leads the Golden Gophers with 23 points and 7.2 rebounds per game. He is shooting 54.5 percent from the field and 53.3 percent from 3-point range.

The list of secondary scorers includes Brennan Rigsby (8.6 ppg), Parker Fox (7.8), Lu'Cye Patterson (7.2) and Mike Mitchell Jr. (6.5). Central Michigan is looking for its third win in a row.

The Grizzlies are among the league leaders in assists per game (29.8) and their 38 in Saturday's lopsided win at Chicago tied a season-high. Memphis ranked third behind Denver (30.3) and Golden State (30.2) in the category entering Sunday's games. Scotty Pippen Jr., the Grizzlies' starting point guard until star Ja Morant returns from a hip injury, had 10 assists in the 142-131 victory over the Bulls to go along with a career-high 30 points. Pippen Jr. produced the double-double in the arena his father, Scottie, rose to stardom during the 1990s with the Michael Jordan-led Bulls. Pippen Jr. called his outing ""a dream come true"" in an arena where his father's jersey number hangs in the rafters. He made 13 of his 16 shots. Memphis also has benefited from rookie forward Jaylen Wells' strong early season play. He scored a career-high of his own, finishing with 26 points on 10-of-14 shooting. Pippen's steady play has allowed the Grizzlies to stay above .500 during the absence not only of Morant, but Marcus Smart and rookie big man Zach Edey. Morant, Smart and Edey have been out for various injuries and ailments. Morant injured his right hip in a Nov. 6 game against the Lakers and appears closer to returning. He was listed as doubtful before Saturday's game in Chicago and questionable for Monday's contest. Smart, battling an illness, missed his fourth straight game. Edey remains sidelined by an ankle injury he suffered in last weekend's game against Denver. Despite the injuries that have kept starters Morant, Smart and Edey inactive -- and, briefly, Desmond Bane with a strained oblique -- the Grizzlies have been productive offensively and defensively. They are averaging 120.3 points per game, second in the NBA entering Sunday, and their 7.2 blocks per game lead the league. The Grizzlies surpassed 140 points for only the sixth time in franchise history on Saturday. Memphis shot 57.3 percent (55-of-96) in the win over Chicago, including 45.2 percent (19-of-42) from 3-point range. The team made 19 3-pointers for the second straight game. ""We had a great run by scoring some 40-plus points (45) in the third (quarter),"" Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""Our game plan was pretty well executed."" Portland will bring momentum, too. The Trail Blazers defeated Houston 104-98 on Saturday, rebounding from a 28-point loss to the Rockets on Friday in an NBA Cup game. Portland was led on Saturday by Anfernee Simons (25 points) and Shaedon Sharpe (24 points) in a game in which the Trail Blazers made 18 3-pointers. In addition to Simons and Sharpe, the Trail Blazers got a solid defensive performance from Deni Avdija, who had four blocks. Avdija spent most of the game making things difficult for Houston's Alperen Sengun in the paint. ""It's amazing to see Anfernee make some shots and carry us down the stretch,"" Portland coach Chauncey Billups said. ""And Deni was incredible. We depended on him a lot. He's been begging for that opportunity for quite some time."" Avdija said Simons played a key role in the win. ""I'm proud of him,"" Avdija said. ""He showed what he's made of and, hopefully, he'll continue to be aggressive."" Portland rookie center Donovan Clingan will not play on Monday due to a left knee sprain. He went scoreless on 0-for-4 shooting from the field on Saturday but grabbed a career-high 19 rebounds. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Playing at Sea Island's Seaside Course, the 29-year-old sank a 5-foot, 5-inch birdie putt on the par-4 18th hole to finish at 16-under 266, just ahead of amateur Luke Clanton (66 on Sunday), Nico Echavarria of Colombia (65) and Daniel Berger (67). ""My mind's gone blank, honestly,"" McNealy said. ""It was an unbelievable adrenaline rush there, especially on 18. ... It was a moment I will never forget getting to celebrate with my friends, my family, my wife, my team."" Berger had a shot to force a playoff with McNealy, but he missed his birdie putt after his approach landed about 20 feet from the hole. Despite the loss, Berger finished inside the top 125 of the FedEx Cup Fall standings to secure his full tour status for 2025. Sunday was the final day of the fall series. McNealy, who opened the week with a red-hot round of 62, entered Sunday tied with Vince Whaley for the 54-hole lead. McNealy had two birdies at Nos. 5 and 8 but missed a par putt at the par-4 14th, the bogey dropping him out of the lead and briefly leaving Echavarria all alone at 16 under. Echavarria, however, flew his second shot at No. 18 over the green, chipped up to about 9 feet and could not save par, sliding to 15 under for the event after making six birdies. Clanton also started the final hole at 16 under and went on to finish with a bogey after finding a bunker. That opened the door for McNealy's big finish. Unlike his competitors, his approach at No. 18 was pure. ""I told (caddie and brother Scout McNealy) 195 6-iron,"" McNealy said of his final approach. ""A 6-iron is like a 200 club, so I didn't need to kill it, but I just needed good solid one. He told me compress it, just smash down, take a divot. Scout's coaching has been pretty simple lately, he says swing left and take a divot. So I just swung left, took a divot, all came out right online dead center of the clubface and it couldn't have been a better time for it."" Meanwhile, Clanton's T2 finish earned him another point in the PGA Tour University Accelerated program. With 17, the Florida State athlete needs three more points to secure a PGA Tour card. But Clanton said he was ""really not at all"" focused on qualifying through the accelerated program. ""I'm trying to win, that's it,"" Clanton said. ""I think it's a great system, of course, to have this opportunity to give us our card and it's amazing. Again, I think every time we step out here, the one goal we have is to win. I think PGA Tour U's been a great opportunity for all of us as college players who have these kind of talents and go pro sooner, so it's awesome."" J.T. Poston tied for the round of the day with a 7-under 63, forging a tie for fifth with Lee Hodges (67) and Canada's Mackenzie Hughes (68) at 14-under 268. Eric Cole also had a 63 and finished 11 under. Whaley finished T8 after shooting 71 on Sunday. Michael Thorbjornsen (69) and Patrick Fishburn (69) also tied for eighth at 13-under 269. One another player who will go home happy is Joel Dahmen. A fan favorite, Dahmen entered the week No. 124 in the fall standings, right on the cusp of losing his PGA Tour card. He fired a 6-under 64 on Sunday to finish T35 at 7 under and earn just enough points to retain his tour status for 2025. Dahmen's bogey-free round featured a hole-out eagle at the par-4 13th and four birdies. ""This is my eighth year out here, I probably made it longer than I ever thought I would,"" Dahmen said. ""You take it for granted a little bit. It's been relatively easy, cruise between 50 and 90 on the FedEx Cup every year and enjoy it, and our best friends are out here. Yeah, this is different. Makes you appreciate things a little more when times are tough. I thought a lot about everything. It came down to the last putt this week."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Islanders will aim to establish some momentum Monday night, when they host the Detroit Red Wings in a battle of Eastern Conference rivals in Elmont, N.Y. Both teams were off Sunday after playing at home Saturday night, when the Islanders beat the St. Louis Blues 3-1 and the Red Wings fell to the Boston Bruins 2-1. The win snapped a three-game losing streak (0-2-1) for the Islanders, who squandered a third-period lead in each defeat -- including Thursday night in Detroit, when the Red Wings scored twice in the final 4:46 to earn a 2-1 win. The final 20 minutes began in familiar fashion Saturday night for the Islanders, whose 2-0 lead was cut in half when Jake Neighbours scored a power-play goal for the Blues just 45 seconds after the opening faceoff. But goaltender Sorokin stopped the final eight shots he faced, including Neighbours' wrister with 1:39 left after the Blues pulled goalie Jordan Binnington. Nelson helped ice the win with 37 seconds left, when he fed Kyle Palmieri for the empty-netter. ""Obviously, the way the last couple games have gone, our goalies have given us a chance to win and we haven't found a way to get the insurance,"" said Palmieri, who also scored in the first period in his first multi-goal game of the season. ""So it felt good to do that tonight."" Nelson, 33, who scored the Islanders' second goal in the second period, finished with three points Saturday to increase his career total to 544 points and move into a tie for ninth place on the Islanders' all-time list with John Tonelli. The win was the 100th for Sorokin, 29, who is the sixth New York goalie to reach the century mark. The loss to Boston dropped the Red Wings to 2-5-1 since their most recent stretch of back-to-back wins over the Buffalo Sabres and Chicago Blackhawks from Nov. 2-6. Detroit has scored two goals or fewer in five of those games. Offense has been a season-long problem for the Red Wings, who have scored just 49 goals, the second-fewest in the NHL ahead of only the Anaheim Ducks (48). Detroit recorded 20 shots on Saturday and has 20 shots or fewer in three of its last four games and five times overall in 20 games. The Red Wings were outshot 16-15 in the first two periods Saturday and managed just five shots in the third period, when Bruins left winger Brad Marchand scored the tie-breaking goal with 8:30 left. Boston finished the period with 13 shots. ""I didn't like the way we managed the puck in the third period -- we just couldn't get out of our zone,"" Red Wings coach Derek Lalonde said. ""It didn't hurt us a ton until it did. We had a pretty good game going through the first two periods."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Haliburton's 3-pointer gave the Pacers a 76-73 lead with 6:44 left in the third quarter and Siakam's two free throws gave Indiana its biggest lead of the night, 78-73. Haliburton's fourth trey of the quarter soon made it 81-73 and two more Siakam free throws increased the lead to double digits as the Wizards went over four minutes without a point. Washington rallied as Kispert scored five straight points to cut the deficit to 88-84, and Indiana led by five after three quarters. Haliburton had 14 points in the third. Sarr's dunk sent the Wizards to the locker room at halftime with a 59-57 lead. The first half featured 10 lead changes, with neither team gaining more than a four-point advantage. Brown led all scorers with 11 points for the Pacers, while four Wizards had 10 points each. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Raiders (2-9) have now lost seven games in a row, last winning on Sept. 29 against the Cleveland Browns. The Broncos (7-5) completed the season sweep of the Raiders with the win after entering the season with eight consecutive losses to the Silver and Black. They also beat Las Vegas 34-18 on Oct. 6 in Denver. Will Lutz didn't miss a kick, connecting on five field goals of 38, 53, 54, 45 and 33 yards for Denver. Las Vegas countered with four field goals in four tries from Daniel Carlson of 34, 34, 53 and 22 yards. The game flipped shortly after halftime, as Gardner Minshew threw an ill-advised interception to Broncos safety Brandon Jones on the Raiders' opening possession of the third quarter and Jones returned it to the Las Vegas 18-yard line. Nix found receiver Courtland Sutton in the end zone for a highlight-reel touchdown catch that put Denver up 16-13 with 10:49 remaining in the third quarter. The Broncos did not relinquish the lead. Nix found Sutton again from 2-yards out with 5:30 remaining in the fourth quarter to put Denver ahead 26-16. The score was set up when Marvin Mims II took a short pass from Nix 37 yards to the 2 on Denver's previous play. Sutton finished with 97 yards and two touchdowns on eight catches. Devaughn Vale added 80 yards on six catches as nine different players made receptions. The Raiders led 13-9 at halftime. Ameer Abdullah scored the only touchdown for either side in the first half, hauling in a 6-yard reception from Minshew with 13:36 left in the second quarter. The touchdown capped a seven-play, 40-yard drive that was kickstarted by a 59-yard kickoff return by Dylan Laube after the Broncos had taken a 3-0 lead. Minshew finished with 230 yards through the air, throwing a touchdown and an interception while completing 25 of 42 passes. Backup Desmond Ridder was 4 of 10 for 64 yards. The Raiders' run game struggled as it was held to just 69 yards total on 16 carries. The Raiders' desperation led them to trickery with 7:45 remaining in the second quarter. Punter AJ Cole executed a fake to perfection, finding linebacker Divine Deablo for a 34-yard first-down completion. In turn, Deablo was the Raiders' leading receiver in the first half. Abdullah finished the game with five receptions for 37 yards including the touchdown, while rushing for 28 yards on eight carries. Jakobi Meyers hauled in a team-high 10 receptions for 121 yards, while Tre Tucker added seven receptions for 82 yards. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Geno Smith completed 22 of 31 passes for 254 yards with a touchdown and an interception for the Seahawks (6-5), who won their second consecutive divisional game. Seattle's Jason Myers kicked a 50-yard field goal with 1:56 remaining to help clinch the victory. Kyler Murray was 24-of-37 passing for 285 yards with one interception for the Cardinals (6-5). Tight end Trey McBride established career highs of 12 catches and 133 yards. Trailing 7-3, the Cardinals reached Seattle's 40-yard line on their opening possession of the second half. They decided to go for it on fourth-and-1, with Murray rolling to his right in an attempt to run for the first down. But Murray's path was blocked and he lofted a pass for Michael Wilson that was picked off by Bryant and returned down the left sideline. The Seahawks took the lead for good on a 3-yard touchdown pass from Smith to Jaxon Smith-Njigba with 1:14 remaining in the second quarter. The key to the seven-play, 61-yard drive was a screen pass to Smith-Njigba that he turned into a 46-yard gain to Arizona's 4. Smith-Njigba had six catches for 77 yards. The Cardinals opened the scoring on a 35-yard field goal by Chad Ryland with 9:43 left in the second quarter. That came two plays after Murray found Wilson with a 7-yard pass in the front right corner of the end zone, a touchdown that was nullified by a holding penalty on Paris Johnson Jr. Ryland also booted a 22-yarder early in the fourth quarter to pull the Cardinals within 13-6. The Seahawks appeared to take the lead with 1:33 left in the first quarter when Leonard Williams hit Murray's arm and Tyrice Knight recovered the ball and rumbled 33 yards to the end zone. But a video review determined Murray's arm was coming forward and the call was changed to an incomplete pass. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Chop Paljor scored 22 points on 6-of-8 shooting from 3-point range for the Golden Lions (1-6). The Tigers flexed their depth against the undermanned Golden Lions, using 16 players - with 11 getting double-digit minutes and 13 scoring points. Missouri forced 19 turnovers and scored 33 points off of them. The Tigers outscored the Golden Lions 29-10 at the free-throw line. Missouri struggled early offensively against the Golden Lions' 3-2 zone, missing 8 of 10 shots to start the game. But the Tigers grabbed four offensive rebounds in the first 4:10 of the game as they sprung ahead 8-2.  After a timeout, Arkansas-Pine Bluff responded with a 10-4 run to tie the game 12-12 on a 3-pointer by Raphael Dumont. Missouri answered that with a 12-4 push fueled by put-back baskets by Robinson and Grill. Then the Tigers increased their lead to 39-18 with 15 straight points, with Mitchell converting a three-point play and Grill hitting a 3-point jumper. The Tigers kept attacking, scoring eight straight points to push their lead to 47-19 with 2:09 left in the first half. Despite missing 13 of 17 shots from 3-point range in the first half, Missouri built a 52-25 lead on the strength of 10 offensive rebounds, 14 second-chance points and 19 points off turnovers. Klemen Vuga scored for the Golden Lions to open the second half, but the Tigers rattled off the next 17 points, with Mitchell scoring in transition on consecutive possessions, as the rout grew to 69-27 with 14:06 left.

Green Bay (8-3) avenged last season's playoff defeat to the reigning NFC champion 49ers, who lost their second game in a row to fall to 5-6. Jordan Love passed for 163 yards and two touchdowns, helping the Packers to a season high in points. Green Bay scored the first 17 points, moving the ball efficiently against a San Francisco defense whose inactives included defensive end Joey Bosa (hip, oblique) and cornerback Charvarius Ward (personal matter). Injuries on offense also took a toll. Brandon Allen started at quarterback for San Francisco in place of Brock Purdy, who was out with a sore right (throwing) shoulder, while left tackle Trent Williams also missed the game. Love hit Tucker Kraft for an 11-yard touchdown pass on the opening drive. The Packers made it 10-0 on Brandon McManus' 51-yard field goal late in the first quarter and surged ahead 17-0 on Jacobs' 1-yard TD run with 6:33 left in the second. Jacobs struck again with 4:28 remaining in the third quarter on another score from a yard out. Green Bay capitalized on a short field after Xavier McKinney intercepted Allen and returned the ball to the San Francisco 26. Following a Jake Moody field goal for the 49ers, the Packers scored another touchdown off a takeaway. Jacobs sealed the third three-TD effort of his career with 10:59 left in the game, shortly after Allen fumbled on Lukas Van Ness' sack and Kenny Clark recovered at the Niners' 16. The 49ers punted on their first two possessions but the attack began clicking before halftime. San Francisco collected its initial first down on an Allen pass to fullback Kyle Juszczyk, which proved to be the first play of a 11-play, 65-yard touchdown drive. Allen capped the possession with a 3-yard scoring pass to George Kittle. Green Bay racked up a 218-95 edge in total yards in the first half. Allen was 17-for-29 passing for 199 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Christian McCaffrey gained 31 yards on 11 carries while Kittle had six catches for 82 yards and a TD. Romeo Doubs led Green Bay with three catches for 54 yards. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Coming off a 4-3 loss on Saturday to the Vancouver Canucks -- a game in which two late goals made it a respectable final result -- the Senators have dropped five straight games, the last four in regulation time, heading into the final date of a four-game homestand. The Senators, who have failed to make the playoffs in seven consecutive seasons, the third-longest current drought behind the Buffalo Sabres (13 seasons) and Detroit Red Wings (eight seasons), must right the ship. Ottawa is ahead of only the Montreal Canadiens in the Eastern Conference standings, although only six points out of a playoff position and with two games in hand on the Boston Bruins, who currently hold the final spot. ""I think we're going to turn this around,"" forward Claude Giroux said. ""I strongly believe that. And you know, it's got to be everybody. It just can't be a few guys having good games. We need everybody to be dialed in. The guys are working hard, but we've got to play a little smarter, and it's going to turn around."" The Senators did not play a smart game against the Canucks, a recurring issue for the past few seasons. Costly giveaways have been the norm, without the necessary top-shelf goaltending to survive those woes. ""In the NHL, you can't gift goals,"" coach Travis Green said. ""Look at all four goals, a couple of turnovers, we make a mistake. Those are gifts. You're going to make mistakes. In the NHL, there are a lot of mistakes made. You have to play better."" The surging Flames arrive in the Canadian capital to kick off a four-game road swing while riding a four-game winning streak. Calgary ended a perfect homestand with a 4-3 shootout victory over the Minnesota Wild on Saturday. ""It gives us a lot of confidence,"" said defenseman Rasmus Andersson, who scored the deciding goal. ""We should've won in regulation, but it is what it is and we end up getting two points."" Calgary surrendered a two-goal, third-period lead before regrouping and earning the win, which gives it points in eight of nine games. ""I liked a lot of our game,"" coach Ryan Huska said. ""The part that I didn't like probably, was the last seven or eight minutes, where I felt for the first time this year, we sat back a bit and let them come at us. A lesson for us, we can make sure we're better in that situation next time."" As they kick off the trip, the Flames are finally boasting some power-play prowess. After a lengthy swoon with the man-advantage, in which they scored only twice in 13 games, they have scored a power-play goal in three consecutive games posted a 4-for-8 mark. ""We're just moving the puck well,"" Andersson said. ""When we have shooting opportunities, we shoot, and we try and work the puck back as quickly as possible after we shoot it. ... It's a good thing, now we've just got to keep it going."" Despite battling for top spot in the Pacific Division, the Flames remain one of the lower-scoring clubs. In fact, Calgary has scored three or fewer non-shootout goals in 18 consecutive games, and posted a 9-6-3 mark in that span. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Carolina has just lost once in eight home games this season, tied with the Winnipeg Jets for fewest home defeats at the quarter-pole of the NHL season. But that home mark figures to be tested this week with games against the Stars, the New York Rangers on Wednesday and the defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers on Friday. A big key for the Hurricanes could be the health of goaltender Pyotr Kochetkov. Kochetkov (10-2-0) is third in the NHL in wins to go along with a solid 2.42 goals-against average and a .904 save percentage. He assumed the No. 1 role in place of veteran Frederik Andersen, who underwent knee surgery Friday and is expected to miss at least two months. But Kochetkov had to leave Saturday's loss in overtime with an upper-body injury after being run into by his own defender, necessitating the services of backup Spencer Martin. Martin made one save in overtime but gave up the winning score to Sean Monahan in the shootout. ""Obviously, we're already one goalie down. This is not ideal for sure,"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""I don't know where we're at with that, we'll see. It didn't look great."" Martin, claimed off waivers from Columbus last January, is 1-2-1 in five games (three starts) this season with a 3.21 GAA and an .870 save percentage. He did have a 24-save shutout at Ottawa, his first in the NHL, on Nov. 16. Monday's contest with Dallas, which has won five of its last six games, kicks off a stretch that sees the Hurricanes play nine of their next 11 games at home. This week ends with a very challenging home-and-home back-to-back against Florida on Friday and Saturday. ""We've got some tough games coming up and we should take it as a challenge,"" said Carolina center Martin Necas, third in the league with 33 points (11 goals, 22 assists). ""It's always fun to play against these teams and we'll show our best."" Dallas, third in the Central Division with 26 points, opened up a three-game road trip with a 4-2 victory over Tampa Bay on Saturday. The contest was tied 2-2 entering the third period when Matt Duchene and Roope Hintz scored 58 seconds apart. Duchene scored his team-leading 11th goal with a tight-angle wrist shot past Andrei Vasilevskiy's glove side at the end of a 3-on-1 rush, while Hintz followed with a power-play goal. ""We got better as the game went on, and the third period was our best,"" Dallas coach Peter DeBoer said. ""We talked at the end of the second (period) that we didn't feel we had played our best yet, but we were in a 2-2 game and had a chance to really find another level there in the third and win an important game to start a road trip against a real good team."" Jake Oettinger made 27 saves for his 11th win, second only to the Winnipeg Jets' Connor Hellebuyck, the reigning Vezina Trophy winner, who has 14 victories. ""We've won a lot of games when we're tied going into the third,"" Oettinger said. ""Guys needed to step up and make plays, and we had a few of those."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Rangers allowed a combined 41 shots on goal in the opening periods of the final two games of a four-game trip. They will attempt to produce an improved start and avoid their first three-game losing streak this season Monday night when they host the St. Louis Blues, who will play their first game under new coach Jim Montgomery. The Rangers are actually outscoring opponents 20-16 in the opening 20 minutes this season, but recently are experiencing struggles right from the start. New York outscored opponents 12-3 in six opening periods when it started 5-0-1, but since then the Rangers are getting outscored 13-8 in their opening periods. The past two were especially difficult for the Rangers, who ended a 2-2-0 four-game road trip by getting outshot 41-14 in first periods. In a 3-2 loss to the Calgary Flames on Thursday, Igor Shesterkin made 19 of his 46 saves when the Rangers escaped the first with a 1-0 deficit. Two nights later, they could not overcome their defensive struggles in a 6-2 loss to the Edmonton Oilers. Backup goalie Jonathan Quick stopped the first 18 shots before allowing two goals in the final 2:26 of the first. The Rangers never recovered, allowing two goals in the second and two more in the third to superstar Connor McDavid. ""We're leaving our goalies out to dry right now in the first period especially,"" New York's Vincent Trocheck said. ""And we've got to come out with a little bit more -- a lot more urgency. And we've got to dig, dig deep here and look ourselves in the mirror before next game."" ""These last two games, first period's been just flat-out terrible,"" defenseman Adam Fox added after the Rangers committed 23 giveaways vs. Edmonton. ""And I mean, you're never gonna win a game when you're putting yourself in that big of a hole early."" The Blues are hoping to avoid falling further into a hole in the Western Conference after replacing coach Drew Bannister with Montgomery on Sunday morning, less than a year after firing Craig Berube. Bannister replaced Berube after 28 games last season and was 30-19-5 the rest of the way as the Blues finished six points out of the final wild-card spot. With St. Louis off to a middling 9-12-1 start and 4-9-1 in its past 14 games, president of hockey operations and general manager Doug Armstrong fired Bannister and signed Montgomery to a five-year deal Sunday morning. Montgomery spent two seasons as an assistant under Berube and was fired by the Boston Bruins on Monday after two-plus seasons that included NHL regular-season records of 65 wins and 135 points in 2022-23. Armstrong admitted that was the reason for the change. ""This was more of an opportunity to get someone of Jim's caliber than anything else,"" Armstrong told reporters on a conference call. ""When I talked to Drew (Sunday) I told him this was more of a decision based on the availability of someone I think is a top NHL coach, someone that we have experience with, someone I really do believe can coach this team and also coach the team when it reaches its ultimate level of competitiveness."" The Blues were held to one goal or fewer for the fifth time in their past 13 games when they took a 3-1 loss to the New York Islanders on Saturday. St Louis gave up the first two goals before Jake Neighbours scored on the power play 45 seconds into the third, but the Blues were held to 25 shots on goal, marking the 11th time they were held to 25 or fewer. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Fresh off his second overtime goal in the last five games, Michkov leads the Flyers into Monday's home game against the Vegas Golden Knights. Philadelphia's first-round pick in 2023, Michkov joined the NHL prior to this season and has made a major impact on the young Flyers. He ranks second on the squad in goals (seven) and assists (nine) and has been earning more playing time under coach John Tortorella. Michkov scored in overtime Nov. 14 against the Ottawa Senators and turned the trick again Saturday, netting the decisive tally in a 3-2 win over the Chicago Blackhawks. ""There's not many moments you're going to get,"" Michkov said through an interpreter. ""When you get the moment, you have to be cold-blooded and finish it."" Saturday's OT goal was particularly notable as it capped a late-game comeback for the Flyers, who trailed 2-0 in the third period. Sean Couturier and Noah Cates scored down the stretch to set the stage for Michkov's goal off a perfect feed from Travis Konecny. ""We kept our patience,"" Tortorella said. ""I don't think we played poorly by any means, but when we're down 2-0, we had chances, we couldn't finish. ... I appreciate how the guys just stayed together, kept on playing."" Philadelphia has spent the last month digging out of a 1-5-1 hole to begin the season. The Flyers can get back to .500 with a win Monday in the finale of their five-game homestand. ""We got frustrated at times, but we stuck together and stuck to the same style of play,"" Couturier said. ""We came back, showed some character in the third and capitalized on our chances and found a way to get the two points."" Vegas earned two points in its most recent contest, as well, riding a five-goal second period to a 6-2 victory over the Montreal Canadiens. Ivan Barbashev and Jack Eichel each registered a goal and two assists for the Knights, who have been consistently up-and-down over the last 10 games. During that stretch, the team has won two in a row, lost two consecutive games, then won two straight before losing two straight and then winning two in a row again. That inconsistency was on display against the Canadiens, as the Knights dominated the second period before allowing two goals in a third period that disappointed coach Bruce Cassidy. ""Let's face it, in the third period we got off our game, they pushed us,"" Cassidy said. ""I know it's late, but at the end of the day, good on (the Canadiens) to make a play."" Still, Vegas finished with its highest goal total since scoring seven times Oct. 26 against the San Jose Sharks. ""It's just our style of play,"" forward Keegan Kolesar said. ""We wear teams down. We were able to capitalize on a couple of mistakes they made and we sent our nose to the net. ... That results in some goals for us."" The Flyers and Knights have split 12 all-time meetings.

The No. 1 Gamecocks fell Sunday in Los Angeles as Lauren Betts posted a double-double effort to lead No. 5 UCLA to a 77-62 triumph. The Gamecocks (5-1) suffered their first defeat after 43 consecutive victories, dating back to the loss to Iowa 77-73 in the NCAA Tournament semifinals. South Carolina defeated Iowa last season for the national championship. Betts finished with 11 points, a game-high 14 rebounds, four assists and four blocks to power the Bruins (5-0) to a historic victory. UCLA also got 15 points from Londynn Jones on 5-of-5 shooting from 3-point range, 13 points from Elina Aarnisalo and 11 each from Kiki Rice and Gabriela Jacquez. It's the first time UCLA has beaten South Carolina since 1981. The Bruins lost twice to the Gamecocks in the 2022-23 season, including in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament. Te-Hina Paopao had 18 points for South Carolina on 4-of-4 3-point shooting, while Tessa Johnson had 14 points. UCLA won the rebounding battle 41-34, marking the second time this season the Gamecocks have been outrebounded. South Carolina also got outscored in the paint 26-18. It's rare that a Dawn Staley-coached team -- units that typically revolve around dominant centers from A'ja Wilson to Aaliyah Boston to Kamilla Cardoso -- gets beat in the paint and on the glass, but with 6-foot-7 Betts, UCLA had the recipe to outmuscle the Gamecocks in those areas of the game. South Carolina never led after UCLA began the game with an 18-5 run, capped off by back-to-back 3-pointers from Jones. The Gamecocks cut the deficit to nine points in the second quarter, but the Bruins responded with a 17-5 run and entered halftime ahead by 21 points. Aarnisalo scored seven points during that run. From there, the Gamecocks never got within single digits of the lead in the second half. It's the first time in 21 tries that UCLA has beaten an AP-ranked No. 1 team. And it's the first time South Carolina lost a true road game since 2021, a streak of 33 games. The schedule doesn't get any easier for South Carolina. While UCLA faces UT Martin next on Friday, the Gamecocks play No. 8 Iowa State on Thursday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Wilkinson finished with 16 points and Rytis Petraitis 13 for the Golden Bears (5-1), whose only loss this season was at Vanderbilt. Jacob Holt went for a season-high 25 points for the Hornets (1-4), who dropped their fourth straight after a season-opening win over Cal State Maritime. Seeking a fourth straight home win, Cal led by as many as 12 points in the first half and 40-33 at halftime before Sacramento State rallied. The Hornets used a 14-5 burst out of the gate following the intermission to grab a 47-45 lead. Julian Vaughns had a 3-pointer and three-point play in the run. But Cal dominated pretty much the rest of the game, taking the lead for good on a Petraitis 3-pointer with 14:50 remaining. Stojakovic, a transfer from rival Stanford, went 11-for-15 at the foul line en route to his third 20-point game of the young season. Cal outscored Sacramento State 26-17 on free throws to more than account for the margin of victory.

Sinner, who won his first two Grand Slam titles this year at the Australian and U.S. opens, added a second straight Davis Cup to his sterling resume after Italy beat Australia in the finals last year. Italy's Matteo Berrettini swept past Botic van de Zandschulp 6-4, 6-2 in 78 minutes to open the match. Sinner and Griekspoor didn't break serve throughout the first set until Sinner ran away with the tiebreaker. Then, knotted 1-1 in the second set, Sinner won Griekspoor's next three service games to run out to a 5-2 lead. He grabbed a 40-0 lead in the eighth game but Griekspoor saved three straight match points to remain on life support. Sinner went up an advantage and finally finished the job on his fourth match point. His win meant a doubles match was not required to decide the final. ""It has been an amazing year. I'm very proud of the whole team,"" Sinner said. ""There is a lot of work behind it and I'm very happy to hold this trophy again. It was a very difficult day today, because anything can happen.""

Carter's make sparked a 5-0 spurt for LSU (5-1), which mounted a ferocious second-half rally that began after Darius Johnson drilled a 3-pointer to put the Knights up 52-34 with 12:57 to play in regulation. UCF (4-2) got back within two in the third overtime, but it never found a way to draw even. Vyctorius Miller and Jordan Sears sealed the victory, combining for three buckets down low that gave the Tigers a 106-99 cushion with 17 seconds remaining. Carter was the late-game hero for LSU, scoring the final four points of regulation to forge a 70-70 tie. He also knocked down a go-ahead 3-pointer with 3:19 left in the first extra session to give the Tigers a 76-75 advantage. Sears gave LSU a four-point edge with a triple of his own with 2:10 to go, but the Tigers failed to stay in front, and UCF's Keyshawn Hall kept the game going by sinking two free throws with six seconds remaining to make it 82-82. Neither team led by more than three in the second overtime, with Hall again coming to the Knights' rescue. He made two layups in the final 52 seconds of the frame to knot things at 93 and send the teams to a third OT. Few could have predicted 15 minutes of extra basketball after UCF put together a 25-3 first-half run that lifted it to a 38-18 advantage with 2:12 left until the break. LSU responded with seven unanswered points, but the Knights still led comfortably, 40-25, at intermission. Sears finished with a game-high-tying 25 points to go along with nine boards, while Jalen Reed recorded a 21-point, 13-rebound double-double for the Tigers. Carter netted 20 points, Miller had 16 and Dji Bailey chipped in 14. Johnson collected 25 points, six rebounds, eight assists and five steals for UCF. Hall totaled 21 points and 10 boards, and Jordan Ivy-Curry supplied 20 points. LSU outshot UCF 43.2 percent to 40.7 percent and had narrow advantages from behind the arc (12 made shots to 10) and the free-throw line (21-18). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Brown made 7 of his 10 3-point attempts, including five in the opening quarter. The Timberwolves are winless in their last 18 road games against the Celtics. Minnesota's last win in Boston came in March 2005. Minnesota was within two points, 107-105, following a Julius Randle layup with 33.6 seconds to play. The Timberwolves had the ball trailing by two with 7.1 seconds left, but Naz Reid missed a 3-point attempt at the buzzer that would have given Minnesota the win. The Timberwolves received 20 rebounds and 10 points from Rudy Gobert. Minnesota's Anthony Edwards had 28 points, nine rebounds and seven assists, and Randle finished with 23 points. Minnesota, which shot 42 percent from the field, has lost five of its last seven games. Derrick White added 19 points and nine rebounds for Boston, which made 21 of its 56 3-point attempts (37.5 percent). Brown opened the game with five 3-pointers to help the Celtics build a 15-6 advantage. Boston missed 11 consecutive shots later in the quarter and an 11-0 run allowed Minnesota to go in front 17-15. The Timberwolves led 27-24 after one quarter.

The Panthers, who are set to host the Washington Capitals on Monday night in Sunrise, are 1-5-0 over their past six games. ""We're struggling right now,"" Panthers coach Paul Maurice said. ""We have a structure we need to play, and we're not far off. But we have some execution challenges."" Panthers winger Matthew Tkachuk said Florida needs to impose its will on teams in much the way it was done in the drive for the 2024 Stanley Cup. ""There shouldn't be any more waiting around,"" he said. ""We have to commit to doing it, and it's not an easy style. It's hard to do for 82-plus games, but that's what makes us successful."" On the positive side, the Panthers have center Sam Reinhart, whose 13-game points streak is the longest this season by any NHL player. It's also tied for the second-longest streak by a Panthers player, and it's just four games away from tying Mike Hoffman's franchise record, set in 2018-19. Reinhart has 11 goals and eight assists during this streak, and he's tied for the NHL lead with 16 goals this season. However, Panthers goalie Sergei Bobrovsky allowed a season-high six goals on Saturday in a 7-4 loss to Colorado. For the season, Bobrovsky is 9-5-1 with a 3.18 goals-against average. That is not up to his standards, which include a 2.60 career GAA and a 2.37 GAA last season. Backup goalie Spencer Knight is 3-3-0 with a 2.72 GAA. Florida's first-round pick in 2019, Knight has made 64 NHL appearances in four years, including 55 starts, and he is 35-20-6 with a 2.89 GAA. But even with all of that, the Panthers are still in second place in the Atlantic Division with 25 points, and the Capitals -- despite two straight losses -- are in third in the Metropolitan Division with 27 points. The Capitals are coming off a 3-2 home loss on Saturday to the New Jersey Devils. ""It's frustrating to lose back to back,"" Capitals goalie Charlie Lindgren said. Lindgren is 5-5-0 with a 2.64 GAA. Co-starter Logan Thompson, acquired in a trade in June with Vegas, is 8-1-1 with a 2.58 GAA. Both are undrafted players making $1 million or less this season. Three of the higher-paid Capitals players are all on injured reserve -- forwards Alex Ovechkin (leg); Nicklas Backstrom (hip); and T.J. Oshie (back). Backstrom and Oshie haven't played this season, but Ovechkin has 15 goals and 10 assists in 18 games. Dylan Strome leads Washington in assists (22) and points (28). Last season, the Capitals ranked 31st in the NHL in goals by defensemen (20). This season, they already have 11 in 20 games thanks in part to the additions of Jakob Chychrun (five) and Matt Roy (one). Roy was given a six-year contract, and Chychrun was acquired in a trade with Ottawa. They join two-time All-Star John Carlson and former first-rounder Rasmus Sandin in a suddenly improved defense. Offensively, Washington, which ranked 28th in scoring last year, added forwards Pierre-Luc Dubois, Andrew Mangiapane, Brandon Duhaime and Taylor Raddysh. Those four have combined to score 13 goals so far this season, and Washington is tied for first in the NHL with 4.05 goals per game. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Seminoles (6-1) won their third consecutive game and went 2-0 in the event as they pulled away in the second half, leading by as many as 36 points. It's Florida State's best start since the 2019-20 season when it went 7-1. UMass (1-5) dropped its fifth in a row following a season-opening win over New Hampshire despite a strong game on Sunday from Jaylen Curry, who scored 17 points. Curry, with six free throws, helped propel the Minutemen on a 10-0 run over a four-plus minute span in the first half to take a 24-23 lead with 4:22 left. FSU closed the half on a 13-3 run to lead 37-27 at halftime. A 15-4 surge to open the second half helped the Seminoles break the game open. Florida State's defense frustrated UMass shooters throughout the contest, especially on the perimeter, limiting the Minutemen to 3-for-24 shooting (12.5 percent) from 3-point range and 18-for-58 (31 percent) overall. The Seminoles finished with 22 points off 17 UMass turnovers. On the flipside, Florida State had one of its best shooting games of the season. The Seminoles moved the ball well throughout the game and finished with 25 assists while only turning the ball over 10 times. The Seminoles shot 33 for 58 (57 percent) from the field and made 9 of 18 three-pointers to put together a season-high scoring output. Once again, Florida State shined thanks to its depth as 10 players scored and four scored in double figures. The Seminoles were able to have 16 players participate in the game as well. Jamir Watkins finished with 14 points while Jerry Deng and Justin Thomas each had 10 points. For UMass, Daniel Rivera finished with 12 points and six rebounds while Nate Guerengomba had 10 points. Daniel Hankins-Sanford collected a game-high 13 rebounds. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

With a shutout of ninth-seeded Atlanta -- which won both these teams' regular-season meetings -- No. 4 seed Orlando reached its first conference final since the club began MLS play in 2015. The Lions will host the seventh-seeded New York Red Bulls, who defeated New York City FC in Saturday's East semifinal. Pedro Gallese kept his third clean sheet of the postseason, this time without having to make a single save against an Atlanta side that had scored eight goals in its first four playoff matches. Atlanta's season ends with the club's best postseason finish since reaching the 2019 Eastern Conference semifinals. Atlanta midfielder Dax McCarty played his final MLS game, finishing a career that began in 2006 with 488 league appearances and 35 more in the postseason. The visitors won back-to-back matches just to qualify for the playoffs, then pulled off one of the biggest MLS Cup playoff upsets of all time in a three-game series triumph over Lionel Messi and Supporters' Shield winners Inter Miami in Round 1. But Orlando was the superior side throughout the first half Sunday and took a deserved lead through a set piece, an area that has given Atlanta trouble this season. Enrique helped create the corner kick when he pressured goalkeeper Brad Guzan into spilling the ball over his own endline when trying to catch a high cross. Martin Ojeda's ensuing outswinger dropped to the turf after deflecting off at least one body in the box, and Enrique was first to the loose ball to poke home a finish past Guzan from close range. Interim Atlanta manager Rob Valentino removed injured striker Jamal Thiare -- who scored twice in the Game 3 win over Miami -- moments after Orlando's goal. His replacement Daniel Rios then also had to exit after taking a ball to the head early in the second half. The attackers that remained had more opportunities in the second half than the first, but rarely made Gallese work. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Devils have won their last two games and are 7-2-0 in their last nine games. This impressive stretch includes two wins over the reigning Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers, as well as other wins over last season's Stanley Cup finalists, the Edmonton Oilers, and two division rivals in the Carolina Hurricanes and Washington Capitals. ""We've had to be on our toes,"" said Devils defenseman Brenden Dillon following Saturday's 3-2 road win over Washington. ""We've had to kind of take in a little bit of water at certain points, and kind of bend but don't break. ... A tough stretch of hockey here against some really good teams, and I think we've found ways to win in a tough league."" Despite the 13-point gap between the Devils and Predators in this season's standings, recent history is on Nashville's side. The Predators have a dominant 11-1-1 record in their last 13 games against New Jersey, dating back to the 2016-17 season. Though the struggling Predators find themselves near the bottom of the NHL standings, they're also coming off a victory over top-tier competition. In perhaps Nashville's best overall performance of the season, the Predators scored three unanswered goals in the third period of Saturday's 4-1 win over the league-leading Winnipeg Jets. ""I thought that was a pretty good recipe of what we have to do and understand we've got to continue this,"" Predators forward Steven Stamkos said. ""The story of this year has been we have efforts like this and then we don't follow it up. So let's follow it up and get on a little roll here."" Nashville began the season with a five-game (0-5-0) losing streak but has shown signs of life with a 3-2-2 record in its last seven games. The battle between two elite special-teams units could decide Monday's game. The Predators lead the NHL with a 91.7 percent penalty-kill percentage, while the Devils' 31 percent power-play percentage is second to Winnipeg's 33.9 percent. New Jersey is 7-for-17 on the power play in its last four games, while Nashville has killed 20 of 21 penalties over its last seven games. Since goaltender Jake Allen started Saturday against the Capitals, Jacob Markstrom should face Nashville if New Jersey sticks to its usual rotation of having Markstrom start two of every three games. Markstrom is 9-5-1 with a .907 save percentage and 2.54 goals-against average in 15 starts this season. Juuse Saros has started 17 of Nashville's 21 games, but the workhorse goalie should be back between the pipes on Monday. Saros has an outstanding .937 save percentage and 1.90 GAA over his last nine games, though with just a 4-4-1 record in that span due to a lack of help from the Predators' lackluster offense. Filip Forsberg (eight goals, eight assists) and Roman Josi (four goals, 12 assists) share the Predators' team points lead with 16 apiece. By comparison, the Devils have five players who have 17 or more points this season. Jesper Bratt leads New Jersey with 28 points (10 goals, 18 assists). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

They get a chance to do so again to start Thanksgiving week when the Lightning play host the Colorado Avalanche on Monday night. While Tampa Bay did get past the Stars to win the title in 2020, coach Jon Cooper's team was unable to fight through injuries in the 2022 Final that slipped away to the Avalanche in six games. Offensive spark plug Brayden Point missed most all of that postseason. The 13th-year Lightning coach is combatting new enemies these days. ""One team tried to make six passes and put the puck in the net and turned it over, and the other team made two passes and threw it in the net,"" Cooper said after Saturday's 4-2 home loss, while comparing his team to the Stars. ""One team waited for the other team to make a mistake, they did, and that team capitalized on it. That was it. ""We blinked first and we lost."" The Lightning's Anthony Cirelli scored twice and extended his goal streak to five games, but Dallas forward Matt Duchene broke a 2-2 tie in the third period and Roope Hintz scored 58 seconds later to sink the Lightning and drop them to 3-4-2 in November. Cooper's frustrations in his group's pass-first play have been noted, but they seemed to reach a boiling point after a second straight setback. ""It's almost like the goals don't count unless they make the highlight reel,"" Cooper said. ""We haven't quite figured out that if the puck just crosses the goal line in between the pipes, it counts. It doesn't have to be an all-world play."" As they get healthier, the Avalanche demonstrated Saturday against the defending Stanley Cup champions that they have no problem scoring. Mikko Rantanen notched a goal and three assists as Colorado powered past the Florida Panthers in a 7-4 victory. Wingers Valeri Nichushkin (suspension) and Jonathan Drouin (upper-body injury) were playing their fourth games since returning from season-long absences and had their best showings so far. A power forward, Nichushkin notched a goal and two assists, while the slick Drouin scored twice, the first tallies for each this season. Drouin was injured six weeks ago on opening night while playing left wing on the top line against the Vegas Golden Knights and missed 16 games. He said he and his teammates followed the lead of the champion Panthers. ""I thought we played well after giving up that first goal,"" Drouin said. ""We tried to play a little how they do: Put the puck in deep, try to make them come 200 feet to our net. I don't think we made many mistakes in that game."" The Avalanche are on a three-game winning streak and are 7-3-0 this month. That surge has them in fourth place in the Central Division behind the first-place Winnipeg Jets, Minnesota Wild and Stars, respectively. Colorado turned defense into offense in the win. ""We shut down the rush attack and that is important to get above them because they are a dangerous rush team,"" Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said. ""They push north hard. For most of the game, we did a real good job of that. Our defensive play led to good offense."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Thompson made his first basket by sinking a jumper with 10:37 left to get Oklahoma State within 64-56 left, and Keller's triple cut the margin to 70-64 nearly three minutes later. The Cowboys were within 78-72 on a basket by Avery with 3:56 remaining, but he fouled out about a minute later and the Wolfpack outscored Oklahoma State 12-6 the rest of the way as Sanders sank five free throws. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

As Sanders was brought down near the sideline after a 10-yard reception, he was flipped upside down and landed directly on the top of his helmet as he went out of bounds on the tackle by cornerback Trent McDuffie. After receiving attention from the team's medical staff, Sanders was strapped to a backboard and taken off the field on a cart with 40 seconds remaining in the half. He was taken to Atrium Health Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte for observation and later released Sunday afternoon, according to the team. On the CBS broadcast following halftime, Panthers head coach Dave Canales said Sanders had movement in all his extremities, while extreme precaution was taken because of back tightness.

Dixon came through again, slithering to the rim and finishing with his right hand for a 75-74 lead with 28 seconds left. Queen was fouled near the hoop on Maryland's ensuing possession and sank both free throws with 19 seconds to play. Villanova had two good looks from 3-point range on its last possession, but Tyler Perkins missed from the top of the key and Dixon misfired in front of his bench in the left corner at the buzzer. Dixon finished 15-of-29 from the floor and 5-of-11 from 3-point range for the Wildcats (3-4), who led 40-28 at halftime. Perkins finished with seven points and six rebounds and Jhamir Brickus scored 11 points with four of the Wildcats' nine assists. Queen ended up with 22 points, 18 of which came in the second half, and grabbed 11 rebounds for the Terrapins (5-1). Julian Resse bundled 18 points with 10 boards, Rodney Rice chipped in 16 points and Ja'Kobi Gillespie scored 12. Maryland went up 57-55 with 8:46 remaining when Queen nailed a one-legged fadeaway from the left elbow with Dixon in his face. Queen drew another roar from the crowd with a baby hook that capped a 9-0 run. Villanova responded with seven straight points, the last five from Dixon, to slide ahead 62-59 and set up a back-and-forth final 6 1/2 minutes before Queen's decisive free throws. Maryland finished 14 of 19 from the line, while the Wildcats went 8 of 9. Dixon wasted no time settling in for Villanova, hitting two threes en route to 10 quick points as the Wildcats raced ahead 15-5. He added two more triples and finished the first half with 22 points. Reese led the Terrapins with 11 points before halftime. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Buckeyes (4-1) defeated Evansville 80-30 and Campbell 104-60, the latter without injured forward Sean Stewart (concussion), guard Ques Glover (ankle) and 7-foot-1 center Aaron Bradshaw. ""We might be down a few guys, but we can't let that affect our games,"" guard Evan Mahaffey said. ""We've still got to come out, play hard and do what we do and get the win. I feel like when everybody has that approach of not dwelling on it and getting things done, it helps us for sure."" That's bad news for Green Bay (2-4), which is coming off a 98-81 loss at Evansville. First-year coach Doug Gottlieb is still determining who he can rely on during crunch time. With eight freshmen and five transfers on the roster, Gottlieb has been giving heavy minutes to his more experienced players. ""I'm trying to learn to trust some of these younger guys,"" he said. ""For us as a mid-major to make somebody play our style is kind of a win, but we have to learn to play when somebody matches us small ball for small ball and how that looks. We've got to get a little bit better and I've got to trust a couple of guys."" Small ball is exactly what Ohio State played against Campbell without Stewart and Bradshaw. It didn't seem to hurt the Buckeyes, who shot 65 percent from the floor and hit 10 straight 3-pointers in one stretch. ""I thought we were really connected on both sides of the ball,"" Ohio State coach Jake Diebler. ""(The smaller lineup) gives us great versatility on both sides of the floor."" The status of Bradshaw, a Kentucky transfer, is unknown. The program issued a statement Friday saying he was not participating in team activities for an undisclosed reason. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

After receiving attention from the team's medical staff, he was strapped to a backboard and taken off the field on a cart with 40 seconds remaining in the half. On the CBS broadcast following halftime, Panthers head coach Dave Canales said Sanders had movement in all his extremities, while extreme precaution was taken because of back tightness. CBS later reported he had a concussion. The 21-year-old rookie out of Texas had a team-leading three receptions for the Panthers at the half for 49 yards.

Zeb Jackson added 12 points for VCU (5-2), which snapped a two-game skid. Lynn Kidd paced Miami (3-3) with 14 points and 10 rebounds. Jalen Blackmon scored 11 and Nijel Pack had 10. It was another slow start for Miami, who fell behind Drake 13-4 and Oklahoma State 9-0 in previous Charleston Classic losses.

Russell converted the free throw for the four-point play and VCU had an eight-point lead less than three minutes into the game.

Miami had also battled back in the first half, cutting the deficit to 20-19 on a layup by A.J. Staton-McCray 10 minutes in.  But the Rams answered by exploding for a 13-2 run, keyed by a pair of 3-pointers from Bamisile, to go up by 12. Shulga made it a 13-point lead at 39-26 with a 3-pointer with 4:10 to play in the half.

The availability of Steven Ashworth is in question after the senior guard sustained a right ankle injury during the Bluejays' 74-63 setback to in-state rival Nebraska on Friday.  Ashworth matched his scoring average by totaling 16 points against the upstart Cornhuskers. He trails only Big East Preseason Player of the Year Ryan Kalkbrenner (21.4) for top honors on the team, while Ashworth's 6.4 assists lead the club.  ""We have no idea how long Steven's going to be out,"" Creighton coach Greg McDermott said. ""I think it's going to be a while."" The timing of the injury is troublesome for the Bluejays (4-1), who have a busy slate ahead. Creighton will square off against No. 23 Texas A&M on Wednesday at Las Vegas and another opponent in the tournament on Saturday before facing top-ranked Kansas on Dec. 4. Nebraska clamped down on Kalkbrenner, forcing the Bluejays to navigate away from the 7-foot-1 star center and try their luck from the perimeter.  ""Great defensive plan to keep the ball out of the paint,"" McDermott said. ""When they do that, we've gotta take advantage and make some 3-point shots, and obviously we didn't shoot it very well."" The Bluejays made just 12 of a program-record 42 attempts from 3-point range. Texas Tech transfer and Las Vegas native Pop Isaacs highlighted his season-high 25-point performance by connecting five times on 12 shots from beyond the arc.  Kalkbrenner, who erupted for a career-high 49 points in the season opener, finished with a paltry four points -- all free throws -- for his lowest scoring output since Christmas 2022 against DePaul.  ""I think that what this team has shown so far is not what its ceiling is,"" Kalkbrenner said. ""I know we have a lot more in us than what we've shown."" San Diego State (2-1) is well rested since dropping an 80-67 decision at home to Gonzaga on Nov. 18.  Nick Boyd collected 23 points and nine rebounds before exiting with 13 minutes to play due to muscle cramps.  ""I started cramping in the second half when I was about to check back in,"" Byrd said, per the San Diego Union-Tribune. ""That's why they held me out the rest of the game. It was just probably that I didn't really do anything on my ankle all week. It was just getting a little dehydrated. I'll take (responsibility) for that one."" Boyd averages a team-leading 14.7 points per game for the Aztecs, who will need all hands on deck considering they face Oregon on Wednesday at Las Vegas and another foe on Saturday.

Tulsa wraps up its season against FAU (2-9, 0-7) next Saturday. Wilson, 63, posted a 26-47 record, including losses in two bowl games, during six seasons as the head coach of Indiana (2011-16). In between head-coaching jobs, he was the offensive coordinator at Ohio State. Switzer, 30, excelled as a wide receiver at North Carolina and played in 41 NFL games (one start) over three seasons with the Dallas Cowboys (2017) and Pittsburgh Steelers (2018-19). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Per the report, the test will be performed Sunday and is being done to rule out the possibility of structural damage. After the game, Ewers called his ankle ""just a little tender,"" and he recalled the first-half scramble play during which the injury occurred. ""I was around the 50-yard-line and I stepped up and kind of took off running a little bit and then kind of got hip-drop tackled and I think he kind of just rolled up on it a little bit. But it's football and stuff like that happens,"" he said. With Ewers hobbling, the Longhorns turned to the run game in the second half, which opened with a 24-7 Texas lead.  Ewers was 20-of-31 passing on the day for 191 yards with two touchdowns. Only 14 of those yards came in the second half, when Texas gained 132 on the ground. The Longhorns will end their regular season next Saturday at Texas A&M with the winner earning a berth to meet No. 10 Georgia in the Southeastern Conference championship game. The No. 15 Aggies were upset Saturday, losing 43-41 to Auburn in a four-overtime classic. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Once the chance to claim Jones on waivers passes Monday at 4 p.m. -- a team that put in a claim would owe him nearly $35 million -- quarterback-needy teams likely will come calling for the free agent, according to multiple reports. The Giants decided to move on from Jones on Monday, then released him on Friday at his request. Former third-stringer Tommy DeVito will start Sunday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in East Rutherford, N.J. New York was 2-8 with Jones as the starter this season (24-44-1 overall), but that record isn't expected to dissuade teams. And Jones is said to want to land with a playoff contender. NFL.com reported Sunday that Jones' options could include the San Francisco 49ers, whose starter, Brock Purdy, is dealing with a shoulder injury. The Baltimore Ravens, who could add him to their practice squad as a viable backup option to Lamar Jackson, also could be in the running for Jones, per the report. ESPN reported that Minnesota also could be a landing spot, should the Vikings decide Jones could be a better fit to back up Sam Darnold than Nick Mullens and Brett Rypien. While not a playoff contender, the Las Vegas Raiders (2-8) -- dissatisfied with their quarterback play this season -- could provide him with a chance to audition for other teams looking for a 2025 quarterback. Jones, 27, was the No. 6 overall pick by the Giants in the 2019 draft. He suffered a season-ending ACL tear last season but returned in time to start this season as the No. 1 quarterback. He was benched with a record of 3-13 over his past 16 starts. He has 14,582 passing yards, 70 touchdown passes and 47 interceptions in 70 career games (69 starts). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Russell finished 7.313 seconds ahead of teammate Lewis Hamilton for his second Grand Prix victory of the season and the third of his career. Russell led by a wide margin for a majority of the race, but Hamilton was able to make a significant dent in that margin over the final 20 laps. Mercedes ended the weekend having swept all three practice sessions, the pole, and the top two spots on the podium. Ferrari's Carlos Sainz rounded out the podium. For Russell and Mercedes, there's no better place than the Las Vegas Strip to celebrate the capping of an ideal Grand Prix. ""I was planning on flying in a couple of hours, but I'm definitely not getting on that flight,"" Russell said. ""I'm going to enjoy this evening with all my team. It's been a dream of a weekend. I don't know how we've been so quick, but I'm just riding this wave right now. ""Vegas is just a crazy, crazy place. And when you're driving, you see all of this in the background. ... I can't even describe this place. To get a victory here, pole position, dominant weekend, one-two with Lewis as well. We couldn't have chosen a better place to make this happen."" Verstappen finished Sunday's Grand Prix a spot ahead of Lando Norris in sixth, which put him an insurmountable 64 points ahead of Norris in the title chase and allowed him to clinch the championship in the season's 22nd Grand Prix. Verstappen became the third driver to clinch the WDC in Las Vegas. He joins Nelson Piquet (1981) and Keke Rosberg (1982), who did so in the only two editions of the Caesars Palace Grand Prix. It brings to a close a turbulent championship push for Red Bull, which lost its chief engineer Adrian Newey in May amid a misconduct investigation surrounding team principal Christian Horner. Verstappen won seven of the first 10 races this season but has only won once since taking home the Spanish Grand Prix on June 23. Norris and McLaren ended up providing a far more worthy championship battle than anyone, including Verstappen, could have imagined. One certainty for 2025 is that nobody will be overlooking Verstappen. ""I think in a way, of course, I still prefer last season,"" Verstappen said. ""But I think this season definitely taught me a lot of lessons. I'm very proud of how we handled it as a team, so in a way, of course, that makes it all so very, very special and a beautiful season. ""If you look at next year right now, I think it's going to be a proper battle between a lot of cars."" Pierre Gasly suffered the first misfortune of the night as he lost his engine on the 16th lap. It was a heartbreaking end to a promising weekend for Gasly, who started third on the grid after a brilliant qualifying session in an attempt to reach the podium in a second consecutive Grand Prix. Alex Albon was then forced to retire on lap 26, as a power unit issue ended a nightmarish weekend for Albon and Williams Racing that also saw Franco Colapinto suffer a hard crash in Friday's qualifying session. It was a rough night for McLaren as a whole, as it lacked pace in both cars from the opening lap owing to rear wing issues. It was a costly performance in terms of clinching the Constructors' Championship, which will have to be decided in the final two races after Ferrari was able to get within 24 points. Red Bull also made a dent in that margin and now also sits within striking distance, 53 points out going into Qatar. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

A Jack Adams Award winner as NHL coach of the year in 2022-23, Montgomery posted a 120-41-23 record with the Bruins before being dismissed after an 8-9-3 start to this season. The Blues also limped out of the blocks under Bannister, losing seven of their past nine games (2-6-1) to fall to 9-12-1 on the season. They reside in sixth place in the Central Division.  Montgomery, 55, owns a 180-84-83 record in 297 games behind the bench as a head coach with the Dallas Stars (2018-20) and Bruins. He also served as an assistant in St. Louis for two seasons (2020-22) under then-head coach Craig Berube. During his first season behind the bench in Boston (2022-23), Montgomery guided the team to a 65-12-5 record for 135 points and an .823 points percentage -- all NHL single-season marks.  However, the Florida Panthers stunned the Bruins in seven games in the Eastern Conference opening round in April 2023. Last season, Boston won its first-round series against the Toronto Maple Leafs in seven games before falling to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Panthers in six games.  Bannister, 50, took over behind the bench on Dec. 14, 2023, after Berube was fired following a 13-14-1 start.

The Browns have badly underachieved with a 3-8 record but have won two of their past four games, both against AFC North rivals in the Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers. And the win over the Steelers came in frigid, snowy conditions in which a bad team might fold. Cleveland even blew a 12-point fourth-quarter lead against Pittsburgh but remained engaged and recovered for a 24-19 victory. That's a team that is still playing extremely hard for its head coach. Stefanski certainly hasn't been as good a coach as last season, when he won 11 games and was named NFL Coach of the Year for the second time in four seasons. The Browns have lost four games by at least 16 points. Getting blown out that many times is never a good thing. But funny, the team seems more cohesive now that Deshaun Watson is out for the season with an Achilles' tendon injury. Watson has been a massive $230 million mistake, and his reputation is even worse, with more than two dozen massage therapists accusing him of sexual misconduct. No matter what players say outwardly, just know that many talk differently in private to each other about Watson and aren't impressed with his off-field behavior. So perhaps the real decision is whether or not to go another direction at quarterback and part ways with Watson. In that case, find your quarterback of the future and go with Jameis Winston as the bridge signal caller until the youngster is ready. I look at those two 11-win seasons the Browns enjoyed under Stefanski and think about how Cleveland didn't even have a single winning season from 2008-19. You may recall they experienced the embarrassing winless season in 2017 while going 1-31 in two seasons under Hue Jackson. At that pace, it would have taken Jackson 22 seasons to get 11 total wins. Or how about that playoff victory over the Steelers under Stefanski in 2020? That marks the lone postseason win in 25 seasons since this version of the franchise began play in 1999. Granted, things didn't go well last January as the Browns were clobbered 45-14 by the Houston Texans in the AFC wild-card round. Stefanski is 40-38 with the Browns, and his previous worst record for Cleveland is 7-10 in 2022. The Browns would have to really rally to reach seven wins this season, but perhaps splitting their final six games and finishing 6-11 is doable. The only real way to consider letting Stefanski go would be if the team totally collapses down the stretch and finishes 3-14 or 4-13. Of course, owner Jimmy Haslam isn't known for his patience, so perhaps this season is disappointing enough for him to make a move. In that case, he needs to take stock of some of the coaches the Browns have had over the past 16 seasons. Freddie Kitchens. The aforementioned Jackson. Mike Pettine. Rob Chudzinski. Pat Shurmur. Eric Mangini. None of those guys had a single winning season. Stefanski will never be the next Paul Brown, but he's certainly a better coach than anyone on that list. Those two 11-win seasons—for THIS franchise—should say it all. Bring back Stefanski and give it one more go. If he underachieves in 2025, then show him the door. But for next season, Stefanski is clearly the best man for the job on the shores of Lake Erie. Copyright 2024"

Can they turn things around?,"The Indiana Pacers have lost five of six games and went from looking like the next big thing to the land of the lost.  They waltz into a get-right game Sunday with Washington hoping to find the directions for a turnaround before they fall further behind the stumblebums masquerading as contenders in front of them in the Eastern Conference standings. There’s no panic—yet—for these Pacers, but plenty of confusion about how they went from the precipice of the NBA Finals to deep concern permeating from point guard Tyrese Haliburton throughout the roster. Haliburton was the player the Pacers turned to for answers and emphatic statements when Indiana needed a play, a spark, a stop, a weirdly machine-like catapult of a 3-point shot in a big moment. He can’t answer that call this season because he appears barely capable of answering the phone when Rick Carlisle calls his number.Haliburton, just 24 and with more than enough time to prove he’s not Ben Simmons, has gone deeper than a slump. The pace-setter for the Pacers continues to make plays. He’s delivered in other ways, like the five-steal, two-block, one-turnover in 39 minutes against show at Toronto last Monday. But he also shot 27.8 percent from the floor—22.2 percent from 30-point range—and then shot 14.3 percent at Houston in back-to-back losses. Indiana can still be exciting and plays with the energy of a team that won’t be trapped in this cage all season. Indiana is 12th in the East, wearing a record that matches rebuild-on-the-fly Brooklyn and Charlotte. But to get out of the merge lane, they’ll need Haliburton to take the wheel with both hands.  Asked after a third straight loss if he has a sense for how he’s in a slump, Haliburton calmly answered, “Nah, nah, I don’t.” Indiana’s upcoming schedule might be the tonic it needs, with three games before Thanksgiving at home starting Sunday with the Washington Wizards (2-12), a back-to-back Monday with the Pelicans (4-13) in town and a Thanksgiving Eve matchup in Indy against the Blazers (7-10).

However, their campaigns have followed similar trajectories, as the Gators and Jayhawks have emerged as two of the most impactful 6-5 and 5-6 teams the game has seen. Both teams shook up the College Football Playoff race in Week 13, but more importantly to each respective program, they continued impressive midseason turnarounds. In Florida’s case, a 24-17 win over No. 9-ranked Ole Miss was the program’s most noteworthy victory since the peak of the Urban Meyer era. Seriously. According to Florida athletic communications, the Gators last beat Top 25 opponents in consecutive weeks when they capped off the 2008 season’s Bowl Championship Series title with a run of three straight wins over Florida State, Alabama in the SEC Championship, and Oklahoma in the title game. The shadow of the Meyer era has loomed large over Gainesville throughout current Gators coach Billy Napier’s tenure. The timing of Netflix’s release of the documentary Swamp Kings, which celebrated Florida’s two national championships under Meyer while downplaying some of the more unsavory elements surrounding the program at the time, couldn’t have been worse. Swamp Kings dropped just as the 2023 Gators were starting a dismal 5-7 season—Florida's third straight sub-.500 finish and second in as many years under Napier. Post-Meyer predecessors were on short leashes, getting dismissed two years after a Sugar Bowl appearance (Will Muschamp), less than a full season removed from consecutive SEC Championship Game appearances (Jim McElwain), and a year after another SEC title game run (Dan Mullen). Expectations may have suggested the same for Napier. Heck, one of the many interchangeable ESPN shows even theorized about Napier’s job security before his second season had even kicked off. Opening this campaign at 3-3, with losses by 24 points to Miami and 13 points to Texas A&M—both at home—precedent suggested Napier wouldn’t have made it to Halloween. Florida had every reason to punt on 2024, but by continuing to soldier on, the Gators have reached this point. “Leadership is very hard, and I think these guys have stepped up in a major way,” Napier said following Saturday’s win. “That first month of the year was a challenge in every facet. Young people, at that point, have got to decide who they want to be and what they’re about.” Florida is finding its identity on the defensive side of the ball, holding both LSU and Ole Miss to fewer than 20 points in the last two weeks. Saturday’s win also signals a possible way forward for the Gators to continue building on this strong finish. Bryce Thornton, a sophomore, was dynamic against Ole Miss with two interceptions. Caleb Banks and Tyreak Sapp, both juniors, made 2.5 and 1.5 sacks, respectively. Whereas previous Florida coaches saw early success but diminishing returns, this era of Gators football is showing encouraging growth. Building a program can be a long, frustrating process, but Florida is beginning to produce results. Few programs understand the arduous process of building like Kansas. Between the Pepper Rodgers-coached Orange Bowl team of 1968 and Lance Leipold’s debut in 2021, almost as many Jayhawks teams won one game or fewer in a season (eight) as qualified for bowl games (nine). Leipold hasn’t worked under the same kind of shadows in Lawrence as those looming over Napier in Gainesville. So when the career-long overachieving coach’s 2023 Jayhawks went 9-4 and finished ranked in the Top 25, it was a surprising achievement. When Kansas regressed to 1-5 midway through 2024, with no FBS wins to its credit, the general vibe among the fan base was one of business as usual. A few Jayhawks supporters photographed at a 35-31 loss at Arizona State on Oct. 5—the fifth of five straight losses—wore paper bags over their heads, one with a reference to the 1998 film The Waterboy scrawled on it reading, “We suck again.” Now, after winning three straight—all against teams ranked in the top 20 and harboring Playoff aspirations—Iowa State, BYU, and Colorado—Kansas most certainly does not suck. The Jayhawks may be the most meaningful team in altering the complexion of the Playoff race since the committee began revealing weekly rankings. “I’m so proud of this group and our coaching staff because so many people had written this team off,” Leipold said following Saturday’s 37-21 victory over Colorado. “Everyone was frustrated, pointing to things that should’ve been changed or done differently. But this group stuck together, stayed committed to the process, and did everything we asked of them.” Buffs wide receiver Travis Hunter entered Week 13 widely considered the favorite to win the Heisman Trophy—and to his credit, he caught for 125 yards and two touchdowns, possibly strengthening his case. But while Hunter was celebrating his success with Heisman poses, Devin Neal was celebrating a win. Neal rushed for 207 yards and three touchdowns, caught for 80 yards and a fourth score, and as a hometown product, he put a stamp on the kind of performance that will live in the pantheon of Jayhawks running backs, alongside The Kansas Comet Gale Sayers. “I said it before, that a lot of guys would have given up on this,” Neal said in his postgame interview with Fox Sports. “But it’s special. And you see the crowd that showed up today; we built this. We take a lot of pride in that.” From winless in 2020 and 1-5 just a few weeks ago, Kansas is now one Week 14 victory over Baylor away from advancing to its third straight bowl game—an unprecedented feat in Jayhawks history. That Kansas has never been to three straight bowls underscores just how different that program is compared to Florida. But in 2024, there may not be two more similar teams with more surprising imprints left on the college football landscape. Copyright 2024"

It’s not that a singular loss stings after winning 16 in a row dating to last Christmas, but the margin for error is surprisingly tiny in the AFC. Mahomes and the crew are headed to Carolina to face a Panthers group that, well, almost never wins. But somehow Bryce Young is 2-1 since reclaiming the starting job. Is there an upset brewing? Maybe Carolina can stick around for a quarter? Maybe not. This is more about the Panthers’ inability to get defensive stops. Carolina has risen to a productive level of offense thanks to a grinding offensive line that helped pave the way for a Chuba Hubbard breakout. With Jonathan Brooks debuting Sunday, they’ll have another weapon in the running game. But Kansas City’s front seven has been stellar, and Carolina lacks a counterpunch. We’d double down on the Chiefs topping their projected total of 27 points based on Kansas City’s first-drive success in the first and second half and the likelihood Mahomes’ defense gets him the ball back a time or two.

We get the sense many have about road favorites, but the Colts are nowhere near the same class as these Lions. During their current win streak, Detroit is putting up more than 38 points per game, and the Lions can get the job done with a mean streak that wins in any environment. Can the Colts keep it close? The formula is to keep the game plan aggressive enough to be unpredictable but not asking Anthony Richardson to throw 30-plus passes. Good luck keeping pace with this juggernaut playing keepaway. If you want a parlay to package with this Lions’ cover, don’t look past the wide receiver yardage totals for Jameson Williams and Amon-Ra St. Brown. They should both eat again from combining for more than 250 receiving yards last week.

It comes down to one matchup with multiple tentacles: Brian Flores’ blitz-mad defense sending five or more on better than 35 percent of snaps against rookie QB Caleb Williams. Williams has avoided an interception for four consecutive games. He’s also avoided throwing a touchdown in that stretch and has been sacked more times (41) than any QB in the league. Flores vs. rookie QBs has been a major mismatch. They’re 1-7 against Flores as defensive coordinator or head coach and average 15.5 points scored and 3.8 sacks allowed per game.

The freshman reclassified in the spring to go to college this fall.,Riley also could be in the","Illinois wing Will Riley could still be in high school. The freshman reclassified in the spring to go to college this fall. Riley also could be in the starting lineup for No. 25 Illinois. The 6-foot-8 Canadian has found a way to lead the Fighting Illini (4-1) in scoring despite coming off the bench in all games to date. Entering Monday's non-conference home game against Little Rock (3-3) in Champaign, Riley paces Illinois in scoring (18 points per game) and 3-point shooting (14 of 22). He is adding six rebounds per game. Riley is athletic and long enough to crash the offensive glass effectively and skilled enough to get his own shot whenever the ball is in his hands. He even took a spin at point guard late in Illinois' 87-40 win over Maryland Eastern Shore on Saturday. ""Will just hoops,"" Illinois coach Brad Underwood said. ""Will just simply ... I'm going to use a guy's name, Michael Beasley, that I was around at Kansas State. Nothing fazes them. Nothing fazes Will."" Beasley, of course, was a one-and-done at Kansas State. After he averaged 26.2 points and 12.4 rebounds for the Wildcats, he went No. 2 in the 2008 NBA Draft. Riley doesn't seem likely to go that high in the draft, but maybe that's underestimating his ability to adapt and improve. For example, when Illinois played at No. 8 Alabama on Wednesday, Riley missed his first four field goals and first two free throws in the opening 12 minutes. He looked a little rushed and tried some atypical shots trying to solve Alabama's tall and athletic frontcourt. Then, with 6:23 left in the first half, Riley showed he's a fast learner. He got the ball at the top of the arc, faked a shot to get his defender to fly past, then took one small step to the left and cashed in a 3-pointer. He finished with a team-high 18 points, a career-high nine rebounds and four assists with no turnovers in a 100-87 loss to the Crimson Tide. ""He just plays the game. The thing I was most upset with him at Alabama was he took contested twos with about 20 seconds on the shot clock,"" Underwood said. And he sees great potential in his freshman. ""When he learns to continue to get fouled, phew. Those are what lottery picks look like,"" Underwood said of Riley. ""He's got a gift to not be worried about what I say, not be worried about a missed shot (or) a bad half. He just plays in the moment and takes what the game gives him."" Riley and the Illini figure to face their second-toughest test of the season so far in Little Rock, which collected 20 of the 22 first-place votes in the Ohio Valley Conference's preseason poll, with teams unable to vote for themselves. On Friday night, Little Rock fought back from a 22-point first-half deficit at No. 20 Arkansas to get as close as seven points before winding up with a 79-67 loss. ""I think if we hadn't dug such a big hole for ourselves in the first half, it would have been a lot easier for us to stay in the game,"" forward Mwani Wilkinson said. While the Trojans have high expectations, they're not at 100 percent. OVC preseason player of the year KK Robinson could miss the whole season due to a knee injury suffered in late October, while backup power forward Creed Williamson -- the son of Corliss Williamson, a two-time All-American at Arkansas and a former 12-year NBA player -- has missed the past two games with a foot injury. In their absence, Creighton transfer Johnathan Lawson (16.3 points, 7.2 rebounds, four assists) and Wilkinson (17.2 points), an LSU grad transfer, give the Trojans a pair of productive wings with high-major size and experience. They're also prolific 3-point shooters who each hit at a 41 percent clip or higher. ""We're going to see a team that mixes up defenses,"" Underwood said. ""This is a very good Little Rock team. Let's not forget they could have been an NCAA Tournament team last year. They're very long, very athletic."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Tar Heels (3-1) and the Flyers (5-0) both qualified for the NCAA Tournament, and North Carolina is one of four teams in the field ranked in the top 10 of the Associated Press poll.  Three of those four are on the same side of the bracket, with the winner of Monday's nightcap between North Carolina and Dayton advancing to face the winner of No. 4 Auburn vs. No. 5 Iowa State. Two-time reigning national champion and second-ranked UConn is on the other side of the bracket.  North Carolina got a jump playing on the islands, as it visited the University of Hawaii on Saturday. The Tar Heels walked away with an 87-69 victory.  RJ Davis scored 18 points, Elliot Cadeau had 17 and Seth Trimble added 13 for North Carolina. ""One of the things we talked about was attacking the rim through the post and penetration,"" Tar Heels coach Hubert Davis said. ""Our guards could get to the rim any time that wanted to and put a lot of pressure (on the defense).""  The victory was a reflection of North Carolina's offensive identity overall thus far into the 2024-25 season.  The Tar Heels' perimeter trio of 2023-24 All-American Davis, Cadeau and Trimble have combined to average 48.8 points per game.  Dayton looks to disrupt the efficient North Carolina offense, bringing a defense that has been the consistent hallmark of Flyers teams under coach Anthony Grant.  Last season, a Dayton team that reached the second round of the NCAA Tournament ranked 30th nationally in scoring defense at 66.5 points per game. Through the early going of 2024-25 and entering play on Sunday, the Flyers are No. 20, limiting opponents to 60.0 points per game.  Dayton has yet to allow more than 69 points through its undefeated start. The Flyers have scored 71 points or more in all five contests.  Enoch Cheeks' 15.0 points per game pace what has been a balanced Flyers offense, with five players averaging more than nine points per contest. Nate Santos scored 23 points to pace Dayton to a 74-53 rout of New Mexico State on Wednesday. Grant said the performance sent Dayton into Maui on the right foot, which the Flyers will need against a field that is ""loaded.""  ""You look at our side, and you've got three of the top 10 teams in the country,"" Grant said. ""Great for basketball fans. I know we've got a great group that will be traveling out there to Maui. It's a great opportunity.""  This year's appearance at the Maui Invitational is Dayton's first since 2019 when the Flyers advanced to the championship game. They lost a 90-84 overtime thriller to Kansas, one of only two losses for the 2019-20 Flyers before COVID-19 forced the season's cancellation.  North Carolina is 20-3 all-time at the Maui Invitational with four tournament championships (1999, 2004, 2008, 2016). In their run to their three most recent Maui Invitational titles, the Tar Heels won the national championship the same season.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Still,","No. 20 Arkansas has a date with visiting Maryland Eastern Shore on Monday night in Fayetteville with the hopes of moving to 5-1 on the season. Still, it hasn't been all smooth sailing for the Razorbacks. Arkansas led Little Rock by 18 points at halftime on Friday before losing focus down the stretch. Little Rock outscored Arkansas 43-37 in the second half and shrunk its deficit to as little as seven points. The Razorbacks ended up winning 79-67, but it was a concerning result for a team that failed its only test against a power conference opponent thus far. That test was a 72-67 loss to Baylor in Dallas on Nov. 9. Arkansas went down by nine points at halftime in that game and couldn't make up the deficit in the second half, despite 24 points from forward Adou Thiero. While things haven't been perfect, the Razorbacks have beaten all five of the mid-major foes on their early season schedule. This includes 16-point wins over Lipscomb and Troy, as well as a 19-point win over Pacific. ""We're a team that's a work in progress,"" Arkansas coach John Calipari said. ""There are times I look at us and say, ‘Wow, we're as good as anybody.' Then there's other times I look at us and I say, ‘Wow, we're as bad as anybody.' So, it just tells you we can be something. Let's get healthy. Let's do this together. Let's understand."" Thiero has been the unquestioned leader for Arkansas on both ends of the floor. His averages of 19.4 points, 6.2 rebounds and three steals per game all lead the team. Boogie Fland has made his presence felt as well, averaging 17.4 points and a team-high 5.4 assists per game. Maryland Eastern Shore is going through an early season gauntlet. The Hawks already have played eight games and have suffered four double-digit losses on the way to a 2-6 start. They enter Monday's contest coming off an 87-40 defeat at No. 25 Illinois on Saturday, marking the first of two consecutive games against power-conference opponents. Arkansas will be the Hawls' third opponent from a power conference overall, as they also suffered a 102-63 loss to Vanderbilt in the season opener. A visit to No. 2 UConn, two-time defending NCAA champion, is slated for Saturday. Ketron Shaw leads the Hawks in scoring, averaging 21.4 points to go along with a team-high 3.8 assists per game. ""(Shaw) continues to be efficient and consistent,"" first-year head coach Cleo Hill Jr. told HBCU Gameday. ""He works on his craft every day and I am just happy he followed me to UMES (from Winston-Salem State)."" The Hawks is 0-6 against Division I opponents this season. Their two wins have come against Division III foe Gallaudet and Penn State Schuylkill of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

While the high-level matchup is unusual for the opening round, it does give the Tigers and Cyclones a chance to see how they stack up among the NCAA elite. And although Iowa State (3-0) has hammered three mid-major teams, Auburn (4-0) already owns a measuring-stick victory at then-No. 4 Houston on Nov. 9. Now comes more challenging competition as the tournament includes No. 2 UConn and No. 10 North Carolina, as well as three other teams that arrive in Maui with undefeated records -- Memphis, Colorado and Dayton. ""The next four games are against Elite 8-caliber teams,"" Auburn coach Bruce Pearl said, referring to the tournament games as well as including a Dec. 4 date at Duke. ""It'll be a true test and a true measure of where we're at."" The Tigers are currently at a good place. In addition to their win over Houston, they've beaten up on three mid-majors.  Johni Broome made 13 of 17 shots to finish with 30 points in Auburn's 102-69 victory over North Alabama on Monday. He also pulled down 17 rebounds, while Dylan Cardwell made 5 of 6 shots to finish with 12 points. ""Our bigs shot an incredible percentage,"" Pearl said. ""Johni and Dylan are two of the best centers in college basketball and we've got both of them."" Meanwhile, the rest of the Tigers' starters scored in double figures. Denver Jones delivered 13 points and nine assists in the win. Playing three games in three days will be a big change for Iowa State, which has been one of the least active teams in Division I. Its only three games have come on the three Mondays in November. ""We've had these experiences in years past. Last year it didn't go as well,"" Iowa State coach T.J. Otzelberger said, referring to last November when the Cyclones lost two of three games in the ESPN Events Invitational. ""Yes, you want to win every game, but last year we had a great season and we weren't as good at this point,"" Otzelberger said of his team, which went 29-8 and reached the Sweet 16 in the NCAA Tournament. With five double-digit scorers, the Cyclones have shown balance, led by backcourt players Curtis Jones (15 points per game), Tamin Lipsey (13.7) and Keshon Gilbert (12.3). St. Mary's transfer Joshua Jefferson recorded his first double-double for his new team by collecting 16 points and 10 rebounds in Iowa State's 87-52 victory over IU Indianapolis last Monday. He made all seven of his shots from the floor. On Monday night, the Cyclones face a team that is ""playing as well or better than anyone in the country,"" Otzelberger said. ""They're a tremendous team. They pressure defensively, really get after you. They've got tremendous depth. They try to wear you down,"" Otzelberger said.

The degree of difficulty will go up on Monday, however, when the Huskies meet Memphis in the opening round of the Maui Invitational in Lahaina, Hawaii.   UConn (4-0) owns lopsided nonconference victories over Sacred Heart, New Hampshire, Le Moyne and East Texas A&M.  Although the Huskies have won by an average of 37.8 points, head coach Danny Hurley said his team has been underwhelming at times. He especially was critical of UConn's effort in its 81-46 victory over East Texas A&M on Tuesday. The Huskies turned the ball over 19 times in that win, shot 29.2 percent from 3-point range (7 of 24) and were outrebounded by the undersized Lions 21-17 over the game's final 20 minutes.   UConn, the two-time defending NCAA champion, held a 26-17 lead with 5:57 left in the first half before igniting its offense. The Huskies made their next five shots from the field and ended the half on a 16-3 run. ""Ball security throughout the game ... it's been a long time since we've been that bad,"" Hurley said. ""To (have) a negative assist-to-turnover ratio? We're one of the best passing and ball security teams in the country. You know, I think at times we played hard, but once we got it to 37 with 12 minutes to go it turned into just a debacle out there. (We) just played so far below the standard across the board. Older players, younger players. Some steps backwards. ""When you've established such a level of play in our program and we work so hard at what we do as a program, you can have bad shooting nights, but you just can't play like that."" Memphis (4-0) received a strong performance off the bench from Dain Dainja in Thursday's 68-64 victory over San Francisco. Dainja recorded 18 points, seven rebounds and three blocked shots for the Tigers, who overcame a 31-22 halftime deficit.   Memphis also has defeated Missouri, UNLV and Ohio. The Tigers have trailed at halftime in three of their four games but are averaging 49.5 points in the second half this season. ""I told the guys we gotta stop doing this, stop putting ourselves in this situation (trailing at halftime),"" Memphis coach Penny Hardaway said following the win over the Dons. ""First half was good looks, we just didn't make them. In the second half we went at their guys in foul trouble.""  The winner of the UConn/Memphis game will play either Michigan State or Colorado on Tuesday. The eight-team field also includes No. 4 Auburn, No. 5 Iowa State, No. 10 North Carolina and Dayton.   ""Maui's no joke,"" UConn forward Alex Karaban said. ""You see the teams in there? Playing the best of the best."" Hardaway said he wanted to put together a strong non-conference schedule for his team.   ""It's part of the recruiting tool as well,"" he said. ""For guys to see that schedule, their eyes light up -- they get big -- and they go, ‘Man, this is a great non-conference schedule.' And you put yourself in some deep water because you're going against some great teams every game, and a lot of coaches won't do this.""   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Dylan Guenther scored two goals and set up another and Clayton Keller had three assists for Utah, which went 3-for-4 on the power play.  ""It's huge for us, just for a confidence booster,"" said Guenther, who scored twice in the third period with the man advantage. ""Nice for us to get a few there."" ""It just came down to compete,"" said Nick Bjugstad, who scored Utah's other power-play goal. ""I think that's kind of the theme of the night. Good things happen when we work hard."" The Maple Leafs recorded their third win in a row and sixth in their past seven games with a 3-0 victory over the visiting Vegas Golden Knights on Wednesday. Toronto again will be without captain Auston Matthews (upper body), who skated before the team's practice on Saturday. The center spent five days in Germany recently for evaluation by a doctor. ""It kind of flared up a little bit in preseason and then it felt better and then it was just kind of getting worse, so I thought it was time to kind of take a step back and re-evaluate it and take it day-by-day,"" Matthews said. ""It hadn't necessarily gotten worse but it wasn't really getting better, so I wanted to be proactive."" Matthews could return next week, possibly on Wednesday when Toronto visits the Florida Panthers. ""He's feeling a lot better, which is good,"" Toronto coach Craig Berube said. ""He skated (Saturday) and he will probably get on the ice again (Sunday)."" Matthews led the league with 69 goals last season. He has five goals this season, playing in 13 of Toronto's 20 games. ""We're missing him a lot out there, the leadership he brings and everything he can do on the ice,"" said William Nylander, who leads the team with 13 goals. Toronto also is without fellow forwards Matthew Knies, Max Domi, Calle Jarnkrok, David Kampf and Max Pacioretty. Knies has an upper-body injury, while the others have lower-body ailments. The Maple Leafs have responded well to Berube's philosophy of emphasizing defense. ""As players, we feel it, and I think you can tell by watching that it's a different kind of game than what we've played in the past,"" defenseman Morgan Rielly said. ""It has been a bit of an adjustment, but it has been good. I think we're doing all right."" Utah will be playing on back-to-back nights for the first time this season.  Karel Vejmelka made 27 saves on Saturday and has played in five straight games, including four starts. He has allowed a total of two goals in the past two games.  ""He radiates confidence,"" Utah coach Andre Tourigny said of Vejmelka. ""We will surely talk about it (starting Vejmelka on Sunday). I don't know if it's the right move because it's four (games) in six (days). Probably, the answer will be no, but we'll see.""

The Aggies had a chance to force another extra session, but Amari Daniels dropped Marcel Reed's pass in the end zone. The setback severely hurts the chances of Texas A&M (8-3, 5-2 SEC) being part of the 12-team College Football Playoff field. Auburn blew a 21-point lead and later forced overtime on Ian Vachon's 29-yard field goal with five seconds left in regulation. Thorne was 19-of-31 passing for 301 yards, two touchdowns and one interception for the Tigers (5-6, 2-5). Jarquez Hunter rushed for 130 yards and three touchdowns on 28 carries. Reed completed 22 of 35 passes for 297 yards, three touchdowns and one interception for the Aggies.

Texas (10-1, 6-1 SEC) survived despite having six fumbles (losing two), including one that was returned for a touchdown in the third quarter to give Kentucky some hope. Cutter Boley, who entered at quarterback for the Wildcats (4-7, 1-7) to start the second half in favor of starter Brock Vandagriff, passed for 160 yards. Kentucky amassed just 232 yards of total offense. No. 4 Penn State 26, Minnesota 25 Nicholas Singleton rushed for a go-ahead touchdown in the third quarter and the Nittany Lions converted a fake punt late in the fourth, helping them secure a victory over the Golden Gophers in Big Ten play in Minneapolis.

The Cougars (9-2, 6-2 Big 12) used two timeouts, and Arizona State quarterback Sam Leavitt tried to burn time by running backward on a couple of plays to the BYU 39. Two delay of game penalties put the ball at the BYU 49 with seven seconds left. Leavitt tried to burn those seconds by dropping back and throwing the ball high into the air. The ball dropped out of bounds with one second left. A throng of fans rushed the field thinking that Arizona State (9-2, 6-2) won. The game was delayed at least 20 minutes before Retzlaff's Hail Mary pass fell incomplete short of the end zone. Kansas 37, No. 16 Colorado 21 Devin Neal scored four touchdowns as the Jayhawks upset the Buffaloes at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo. Kansas (5-6, 4-4 Big 12) became the first team in college football history with a losing record to win three straight games against ranked opponents.

No. 25 Illinois 38, Rutgers 31 Pat Bryant caught a 40-yard touchdown pass on fourth down with four seconds remaining as the Fighting Illini rallied for a dramatic victory over the Scarlet Knights in Piscataway, N.J. Bryant's dramatic catch came after Illinois (8-3, 5-3 Big Ten) initially decided to attempt a go-ahead 57-yard field goal into the wind. Following a timeout, the Ilini went for it on fourth down. Bryant finished with seven catches for a career-high 197 yards.  Kyle Monangai rushed for 122 yards on 28 carries and Athan Kaliakmanis completed 19 of 37 passes for 175 yards for Rutgers (6-5, 3-5).

Kiefer Sherwood recorded a goal and an assist for the Canucks, who prevailed despite Hughes being issued a game misconduct for boarding Josh Norris with 7:31 remaining in the first period. DeBrusk, who entered with just three goals, snapped a six-game goal drought as the Canucks improved to a franchise-best 7-1-0 on the road. Ottawa's Brady Tkachuk posted his 10th goal and received his own misconduct penalty with less than seven minutes left in the game. But late goals from Claude Giroux and Tim Stutzle made things interesting for Ottawa, which is mired in an 0-4-1 slide. The Senators couldn't take advantage of the early departure of Hughes, Vancouver's leader with 19 points, who earned a major penalty for his check on Norris, whose head hit the end board. The Canucks were already without fellow stars Thatcher Demko (knee), Brock Boeser (upper-body injury) and J.T. Miller (personal reasons). However, the Canucks killed the five-minute Senators' power play that followed. Then they made the most of their own power play when DeBrusk deflected in Conor Garland's shot with 1:24 left in the first to open the scoring. Ottawa, though, converted on its next power-play opportunity at 3:41 of the second period as Tkachuk's quick stick pushed the puck past Vancouver's Kevin Lankinen (26 saves), who has won all seven of his road starts. But the Canucks stormed back with three straight goals. With 10:37 remaining in the second, Vancouver's Max Sasson sent a pass into the slot that Blueger sent past Ottawa's Linus Ullmark (17 saves).

Russell led by a wide margin for a majority of the race, but Hamilton was able to make a significant dent in that margin over the last 20 laps. Mercedes ended the weekend having swept all three practice sessions, the pole, and the top two spots on the podium. Ferrari's Carlos Sainz rounded out the podium.

It was a heartbreaking end to a promising weekend for Gasly, who started third on the grid after a brilliant qualifying session in an attempt to reach the podium in a second consecutive Las Vegas Grand Prix.

It was a rough night for McLaren, which lacked pace in both cars from the opening lap owing to a rear wing issue. It was a costly performance in terms of clinching the Constructors' Championship, which will have to be decided in the final two races after Ferrari was able to get within 24 points. Red Bull also made a dent in that margin and now sit within striking distance themselves, 53 points out going into Qatar. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Raptors had dropped seven games in a row before beating the Indiana Pacers 130-119 on Monday, and they followed that with a 110-105 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves three days later. It marked the first time this season that Toronto strung together wins.  RJ Barrett poured in a game-high 31 points while hauling in seven rebounds against Minnesota, and Jakob Poeltl supplied 15 points and 12 boards. But it was Scottie Barnes who pushed the Raptors over the top, scoring nine of his 17 points in the fourth quarter.  Before its seven-game skid, Toronto had a four-game losing streak earlier in the season. Although the Raptors are 4-12 to start the campaign, guard/forward Garrett Temple, one of Toronto's few veterans, believes that the team is better than what its record shows.  ""It's different if we're 2-11 and eight of the games were blowouts,"" Temple said ahead of the Raptors' modest winning streak. ""We're playing really, really good basketball, and I think everybody understands how close we are to reaching that potential. ... ""So I think that's where the positivity comes from, and it's great to have all these young guys cracking jokes all the time."" Cleveland, meanwhile, has had plenty of reasons to be positive. A season-opening victory over Toronto on Oct. 23 ignited a historic start for the Cavaliers, who went 15-0 before falling 120-117 to the defending champion Boston Celtics on Tuesday.  Only three other teams in NBA history -- 1948-49 Washington Capitols, 1993-94 Houston Rockets, 2015-16 Warriors -- began a season with 15 wins in a row. Golden State went on to win its first 24 contests to set a league record.  It didn't take long for Cleveland to flush the loss against Boston from its system, as the Cavaliers coasted to a 128-100 blowout win over the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday. Making the victory all the more impressive was that the Cavs were missing starting guard Darius Garland due to a groin injury and star Donovan Mitchell put up only 10 points.  Ty Jerome stepped up for Cleveland, recording a season-high 29 points while filling in for Garland. Georges Niang came off the bench to chip in 20 points.  Garland is not listed on the injury report ahead of the meeting with Toronto.  The Cavaliers were also missing Caris LeVert (knee), Isaac Okoro (ankle) and Dean Wade (ankle) on Wednesday, leading Cleveland coach Kenny Atkinson to stick rookie Jaylon Tyson in the starting lineup.  Tyson responded with 16 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists in 37 minutes of action. He had never played more than eight minutes in an NBA game.  ""We got to start Jaylon because it's important for a young guy to be around vets to start,"" Atkinson said. ""And I thought that was great."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

USC (6-5, 4-5 Big Ten) went the game's first 53:05 without scoring a touchdown against a stout UCLA defensive effort. Each of the Trojans' three scores in the first half came on Michael Lantz field goals of 19, 23 and 22 yards. USC's touchdown came at an opportune time. After the Trojans' first three possessions of the second half produced 17 total yards, they got a boost when a punt by UCLA's Brody Richter went only 25 yards to set USC up at the Bruins' 49-yard line. On the second play of the possession, the Trojans ignited their stagnant offense with some trickery. Makai Lemon took a lateral pass from Maiava then found a streaking Kyron Hudson down the sideline for 39 yards to the UCLA 4. That led to Maiava's throw to Lane, who made a spectacular, toe-drag reception to stay in-bounds under pressure. Mason Cobb came up big for USC on the defensive end, holding quarterback Ethan Garbers to no gain on a fourth-and-1 sneak attempt. Another field goal by Lantz, this one covering 30 yards, gave USC a six-point cushion that forced UCLA to try to move the ball 75 yards in just over two minues. The Bruins (4-7, 3-6) had four straight pass attempts go incomplete, ending UCLA's bowl-game aspirations in the process. Maiava finished with 221 yards on 19-of-35 passing in his second start for USC. Hudson caught six passes for 79 yards, and Woody Marks rushed for 76 yards on 18 carries. Easton Mascarenas-Arnold, Braylan Shelby and Nate Clifton all produced sacks to punctuate the Trojans' stout defensive effort. The 13 points USC surrendered on Saturday were the Trojans' fewest in a conference game since a 56-10 blowout of former Pac-12 counterpart Stanford last September. Garbers went 20-of-29 passing for 265 yards and threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Moliki Matavao in the third quarter to give UCLA a 10-9 lead. The Bruins' other points came on field goals of 51 and 29 yards by Mateen Bhaghani. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Wildcats (4-1) beat George Washington 83-71 in the first round Friday, building a big first-half lead but struggling to put the Revolutionaries away. The Flames (5-1), on the other hand, opened their tournament Friday with a convincing 89-69 victory over Louisiana -- shooting both a program- and tournament-record 67.3 percent (33-of-49) from the field. Liberty was 9 of 18 from 3-point range. The Flames were led by Kaden Metheny's 20 points that came on 7-of-10 shooting from the field (4-of-6 from beyond the arc). Metheny, however, isn't satisfied with just one victory, regardless of the history that came with it. ""We've got two more games here,"" he said. ""We want to come away with three wins. My coach wouldn't like me saying this, but this is some really good weather. But this is a good win. ""We've got a lot of unselfish dudes on the team. They hit me in the right spots."" Kansas State led George Washington 46-27 at halftime, but the Revolutionaries trimmed the deficit to 59-55 before K-State pulled away late. Still, George Washington outscored the Wildcats 44-37 after intermission. David N'Guessan led five Wildcats in double figures with 17 points. He and Coleman Hawkins tied for the team lead with nine rebounds. ""We knew we had to come out strong in the second half,"" N'Guessan said after the game. ""Coach (Jerome) Tang talked about it in the locker room. They came out and went on a run, but Coach always says basketball is a game of runs. We had to regroup and make our own run.""

McCollum, who won four NCAA Division II national titles at Northwest Missouri State (2017, 2019, 2021, 2022), brought in four players from his former school to Drake. One of those players is Bennett Stirtz, who has been brilliant at Charleston, averaging 19.0 points and 6.0 assists in two games. Mitch Mascari, a 6-5 shooting guard who also came over from Northwest Missouri State, is averaging 18.5 points at Charleston, thanks to 9-for-16 shooting on 3-pointers. As for Vanderbilt (6-0), coach Mark Byington arrived from James Madison, which he led last season to a 32-4 record -- the most wins in program history -- and a win in the NCAA Tournament. Byington brought in 10 transfers for this season, including all five starters: AJ Hoggard (Michigan State); Jason Edwards (North Texas); Devin McGlockton (Boston College); Tyler Nickel (Virginia Tech); and Grant Huffman (Davidson). Hoggard, who made 83 starts at Michigan State, posted 18 points and seven assists in Vanderbilt's 73-71 win over Nevada on Thursday in Charleston.

Seattle will play the winner of Sunday's match between Minnesota and the Los Angeles Galaxy in the conference final. The Sounders, who tied the score at 1-1 on an own goal by LAFC's Maxime Chanot in the 59th minute, snapped a 10-match winless streak (0-8-2) against LAFC and beat them for the first time in five tries this season. That included losses in the Leagues Cup quarterfinals and the U.S. Open Cup semifinals. Sounders goalkeeper Stefan Frei made nine saves, including a stop on a bicycle kick by Aaron Long in the 87th minute, another on Ryan Hollingshead's attempt in second-half stoppage time, a kick save on Mateusz Bogusz in the first overtime and another on Hollingshead while crashing into the left post in the 120th minute. The Sounders got the winner after a left-wing corner kick by Joao Paulo in the 109th minute. LAFC headed the ball to the top of the 18-yard box, where Seattle's Cristian Roldan kept it in play. The ball went off a Los Angeles defender and fell to Morris outside the top right corner of the 6-yard box and he spun and put a shot into the upper right corner of the net. After a scoreless first half, Los Angeles broke through in the 50th minute. After a Seattle turnover near midfield, LAFC pushed forward on the counterattack. Bogusz got the ball at the top right of the 18-yard box and fed Hollingshead, who was just outside the penalty spot. Hollingshead's right-footed one-timer skimmed inside the far post and just out of the reach of a diving Frei.

Draisaitl moved into a tie with the Florida Panthers' Sam Reinhart for the league lead by scoring his 16th goal of the season.  McDavid scored 5:49 into the third on a redirection of an Evan Bouchard shot, then faked a pass when New York defenseman Victor Mancini dove in the slot before lifting a shot over Jonathan Quick's right pad. Darnell Nurse scored a short-handed goal in the waning seconds of the first period while Vasily Podkolzin and Bouchard also scored for the Oilers, who are 5-2-1 in their past eight games. Connor Brown and Mattias Janmark collected two assists apiece for Edmonton, which is 8-2-1 in its past 11 meetings with New York. Stuart Skinner made 32 saves and was only beaten by Artemi Panarin with 4:58 left in the second and 3:31 remaining in the third.  Quick allowed six goals on 40 shots. The Oilers spent virtually the entire opening period in the offensive zone. After Panarin lost the puck along the boards near the right side of the blue line, the Oilers quickly moved into the offensive zone, and Podkolzin sent a one-timer from the edge of the right circle past Quick with 2:26 remaining. Edmonton took a 2-0 lead when Nurse entered the offensive zone unimpeded, waited for a pass from Janmark, gained possession in the right circle and sent a shot past Quick's glove. A little over three minutes after Draisaitl scored, Bouchard took a drop pass from Janmark and lifted a shot from the slot over Quick's stick. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Blakes' heroics came after a series of missed free throws in the final 1:09 following an Oziyah Sellers 3-pointer that had drawn the Cardinal (6-0) even at 67-all. Adama-Alpha Bal put the Broncos (2-4) back on top by making one of two free throws, after which Raynaud countered from the interior to give Stanford a 69-68 lead with 32 seconds to play. After Bal missed from point-blank range, Blakes bricked a free throw and Raynaud couldn't convert a second-chance shot, leaving Santa Clara with another chance. This time, Christoph Tilly made just one of two foul shots, tying the score with eight seconds left and setting up a Stanford timeout, after which Blakes buried the eventual game-winner. Down by as many as 11 in the first half and 10 at the break, Stanford scored the first 12 points after halftime to take its first lead at 39-37. Raynaud and Sellers each had two- and 3-point hoops in the run, which led to a tightly contested second half. Raynaud complemented his 32 points with a season-high 16 rebounds, 10 of which were offensive boards. He came within one point of matching his season-best point total, which he set in a 79-65 win at U.C. Davis last Sunday. Sellers provided plenty of support with 23 points, while Blakes finished with eight points, a game-high 10 assists and four steals. Sellers (three) and Raynaud (two) combined for all five of Stanford's 3-point baskets. The Cardinal shot 5-of-13 from distance (38.5 percent), while Santa Clara finished just 4-of-19 beyond the arc (21.1 percent). Playing on the road for the first time this season, Stanford won despite making just 10 of its 21 free throws. Santa Clara went 21-for-26 but missed two of its last three. Tilly paced the Broncos with 16 points, while Carlos Stewart Jr. had 11 and Bal 10 to go with a team-high-tying five rebounds. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Rasmus Dahlin had a goal and an assist and Bowen Byram had two assists for the Sabres, who swept a three-game road swing through California. Fabian Zetterlund and Luke Kunin scored for the Sharks, who have lost three straight games. Mackenzie Blackwood made 27 saves. Tuch scored short-handed to give the Sabres a 3-2 lead at 5:27 of the third, cutting off Mikael Granlund's pass attempt and taking the puck on a breakaway to beat Blackwood five-hole from the right circle. Dylan Cozens tied the game at 2 at 2:07 of the third period, taking a feed high in the zone from Dahlin and one-timing it from above the slot to beat a screened Blackwood stick side. Zetterlund gave San Jose a 1-0 lead at 9:59 of the first period. William Eklund sent the puck to Jake Walman at the point. Reimer made a pad save, but the rebound was there for Zetterlund to collect in front and put past the netminder. Peyton Krebs tied the game, 1-1, at 11:03. Byram was just inside his own blue line to cut off Will Smith's attempt to send the puck in, and he sent it up to Krebs at the Sharks' blue line for a two-on-one. The center took it to the left circle before firing a wrist shot into the far top corner of the net. Kunin put the hosts ahead 2-1 at 4:07 of the second period when he took a feed from Tyler Toffoli in front of the net and slipped a backhand past Reimer's right pad. Reimer kept the deficit at one as Buffalo struggled to generate much through the first half of the middle frame. He made a highlight-reel stop on Macklin Celebrini, getting his left arm behind his back while on his stomach to snare a shot from the bottom of the right circle. Dahlin scored an empty-net goal from his own end with one second left in the third period for the 4-2 final. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Badgers (6-0) are coming off an 86-70 win over UCF on Friday in the opener of the tourney. John Blackwell led the way with 17 points and five rebounds. Missouri transfer John Tonje finished with 15 points and six boards. Head coach Greg Gard liked the way his team played as a unit as it continues to click offensively, putting up 79 or more points in each of its six games. Against the Knights, five Wisconsin players at least three assists in a game for the first time since 2020 as Tonje, Blackwell, Steven Crowell, Max Klesmit and Kamari McGee all achieved that feat. The Badgers finished with 21 assists as a team and have 95 so far this season. McGee and Nolan Winter scored 14 and 13 points, respectively, while Winter also grabbed 10 rebounds for the Badgers. ""It was obviously a good team effort,"" Gard said in a postgame interview. ""A lot of things we'll learn from this game on both sides of the ball."" Still, there is always room for improvement. ""I think we shared it and moved the ball well in spurts,"" Gard said. ""But obviously in November you're still looking to try to continue to improve."" The Panthers are also unbeaten on the season, sporting a 6-0 record and riding the momentum of an impressive 74-63 win over the LSU Tigers on Friday. Jaland Lowe played a pivotal role in the win, scoring a career-best 22 points and adding eight rebounds, six assists and three steals. Ishmael Leggett added 21 points. Wisconsin is perfect through six games for the first time since the 2014-15 season when it opened with seven straight wins and went on to play for the national championship. The Badgers are averaging 87.8 points per game and allowing 71.0. Tonje is the leading scoring threat at 21.3 points per game. He's also pulling down 5.2 rebounds per outing. Blackwell and Klesmit also average double figures for the Badgers at 16.3 and 13.3, respectively. Pittsburgh is 6-0 for the first time since the 2018-19 season and has won each game by double figures. Leggett and Lowe have been key players in that strong start. Leggett is averaging 18.2 points and 6.3 boards per contest. Lowe is pouring in 15.0 points per game. Damian Dunn and Cameron Corhen also boast double-digit scoring averages, with Dunn averaging 13.0 points and Corhen scoring 12.8 points per outing. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Aggies had a chance to force another extra session, but Amari Daniels dropped Marcel Reed's pass in the end zone. The setback severely hurts the chances of Texas A&M (8-3, 5-2 SEC) being part of the 12-team College Football Playoff field. Auburn blew a 21-point lead and later forced overtime on Ian Vachon's 29-yard field goal with five seconds left in regulation. Thorne was 19-of-31 passing for 301 yards, two touchdowns and one interception for the Tigers (5-6, 2-5). Jarquez Hunter rushed for 130 yards and three touchdowns on 28 rushes, Cam Coleman had seven receptions for 128 yards and two touchdowns, and Lambert-Smith had 104 receiving yards on two catches for Auburn. Reed completed 22 of 35 passes for 297 yards, three touchdowns and one interception for the Aggies. Noah Thomas caught five passes for 124 yards and two touchdowns, Jahdae Walker had a receiving score and Terry Bussey added a rushing touchdown for Texas A&M. The Aggies never led until Daniels scored on an 8-yard run up the middle with 4:01 remaining in regulation. Daniels rushed for 90 yards on 27 carries. Texas A&M had first possession in overtime and scored when Reed tossed a 12-yard touchdown pass to Walker. Auburn answered with Hunter's 2-yard scoring run. The Tigers settled for a 41-yard field goal by Vachon in their second possession. Randy Bond kicked a 42-yard field goal for the Aggies to tie it at 41. In the third overtime, when teams solely go for two points, both squads threw incomplete passes. In the fourth overtime, Lambert-Smith made a superb catch to put Auburn ahead, before Daniel couldn't keep control for Texas A&M. Auburn was sharp offensively while scoring three touchdowns over the first 17 minutes. Hunter scored on a 2-yard run and Thorne threw a 63-yard touchdown pass to Coleman in the first quarter. Early in the second quarter, Thorne connected with Coleman on a 15-yard scoring pass for the 21-0 lead. Bussey scored from the 1 to get the Aggies on the board with 4:13 to go in the first half. Reed hit Thomas on a 14-yard scoring pass to bring the Aggies within 21-14 with 9:25 left in the third quarter. When Texas A&M next had the ball, Reed hit Thomas at the Aggies' 40-yard line and he raced the rest of the way to conclude a tying 73-yard scoring play with 7:57 remaining in the period. Auburn took a 28-21 lead on Hunter's 1-yard scoring run with 2:27 in the third quarter. Bond's 32-yard field goal moved the Aggies within four with 12:47 remaining in the game. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Sophomore guard Isaiah Coleman's career-high 20 points weren't enough for the Pirates (3-3) in their 76-60 semifinal loss to Vanderbilt on Friday.   ""We got beat like a drum,"" Seton Hall coach Shaheen Holloway said during a postgame radio interview. ""They were driving the basketball, driving the basketball, driving the basketball. ... It's a tournament, man. If you can't get ready (on a quick turnaround) and get pumped up for something like this, I don't know. No excuse."" Fifth-year guard Chaunce Jenkins matched a career-high with nine rebounds for the Pirates, but there seemed to be no number or statistic that impressed Holloway. ""I'm going to end this conversation because I know I am going to say something that's not going (to) be good for my players or for me,"" Holloway said. The Owls (4-3) tumbled 75-63 to undefeated Drake in the other semifinal on Friday. Florida Atlantic led 35-32 early in the second half but gradually fizzled down the stretch and finished the game at a 32-23 disadvantage on the glass. Leland Walker led the Owls with 14 points and added five assists, while top scorer Kaleb Glenn (13.9 points per game) finished with six points in just 16 minutes off the bench. First-year coach John Jakus was especially frustrated by his team's struggles to generate extra possessions on Friday.   ""To have four offensive rebounds out of 30 chances, with the seven missed free throws (and) 23 missed shots ... that's just not enough,"" he said. ""So that's an issue for us. Having to address that issue in the hotel (while on the road) isn't great.""   The Owls are still adjusting to Jakus after he took over for Dusty May, the winningest coach in program history (129-69), but Jakus said his team is not making excuses in the season's early stages.   ""We're not going to run away from anything,"" he said. "" ... We're going to get there, just going to take some time."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Sunday's matchup pits two of the league's surging scorers against each other, as the Nets' Cameron Johnson (19.3 points per game) will square off against the Kings' De'Aaron Fox (28.8). Johnson racked up 34 points in a 116-115 home win over the Charlotte Hornets on Tuesday and then tallied 37 in a 113-98 loss at Philadelphia on Friday to tip off a four-game trip. Friday's total fell one short of matching a career high for Johnson, which he set with Phoenix against New York in March 2022. Johnson has shot 25-for-41 (61 percent) overall and 15-for-25 (60 percent) on 3-pointers in his two-game flurry. His nine 3-pointers Friday equaled his career-high, also set in that Suns-Knicks matchup two years ago. Johnson credited teammates Ben Simmons and Dennis Schroder, who combined for 11 assists on Friday, for his big night in Philadelphia. ""When you play with people like Ben and Schro, they're able to find you,"" he said. ""Just know that those looks are coming. There'll be days I make them. There'll be days I miss them. I'll just keep shooting."" Only two teammates joined Johnson in double figures against the 76ers. Cam Thomas had 18 points, while Nic Claxton came off the bench for 12 points and a team-high eight rebounds. The Nets head west having lost seven of their nine road games, including three in a row. Friday's defeat dropped them to 1-2 in the NBA Cup, knocking them out of contention in East Group A. The Kings also suffered a second Cup loss Friday, falling 104-88 on the road to the Los Angeles Clippers. They are 0-2 in West Group A. Fox had 29 points against the Clippers, giving him five straight games with 28 or more. The stretch includes 60 and 49 points in back-to-back games against the Minnesota Timberwolves and Utah Jazz, respectively, last week. The reigning Western Conference Player of the Week was rejoined in the Sacramento lineup in LA by co-stars Domantas Sabonis and DeMar DeRozan. But according to coach Mike Brown, the Kings forgot to pack something for the overnight trip south: Their energy. ""That first half was probably ... if it wasn't the worst half of basketball I've seen us play since I've been here, it was close,"" Brown observed. ""We were not a step slower, we were three to four steps slower to whatever was going on ... On both ends of the floor."" Returning from a two-game absence due to a sore back, Sabonis was healthy enough to put in 40 minutes against the Clippers. He accumulated 24 points and 15 rebounds. DeRozan, who had missed three straight with back issues, shot poorly in his return, going 6-for-19 overall and 0-for-5 on 3-pointers. He finished with 16 points in 36 minutes. The Kings swept each of the last two season series from the Nets, winning the two games last year by a total of 43 points.

Both teams are trending in opposite directions as they enter the nonconference contest. The Seminoles (5-1) won their first game of the event 78-69 over Temple on Friday. It was Florida State's second win in a row after it suffered its only loss of the season to rival Florida on Nov. 15. On the other hand, the Minutemen (1-4) lost 87-80 to Temple on Saturday, dropping their fourth game in a row after a season-opening win over New Hampshire. UMass has lost all four by 10 points or fewer. Massachusetts coach Frank Martin said earlier in the week he was hoping for a better start from his team after the Minutemen fell behind early in their previous three losses. UMass trailed by as many as 15 in the first half against Temple. Although the Minutemen closed the gap before halftime, they never took the lead. Jaylen Curry had 17 points but went 4-for-16 from the field. Daniel Hankins-Sanford added 15 points and 10 rebounds. ""I'm not into, ‘Let's clap because we played hard to get back into the game,'"" Martin said after the loss earlier in the week to Hofstra. ""We have to figure out the first six or seven minutes of a game."" Florida State has been the opposite, ending the first half with a lead in each of its wins. Jamir Watkins is averaging a team-leading 18.3 points and chips in 5.2 rebounds per game. The Seminoles had a day to rest in between games and will look to mimic the success it had against the Owls on the glass (39-34 advantage) and on the defensive end where they had nine steals and six blocks. FSU will look to limit Watkins and Hankins-Sanford's effectiveness from the floor. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Bhayshul Tuten's 29-yard run and backup quarterback William Watson III's two-point conversion run with 9:19 remaining trimmed Virginia Tech's deficit to 31-28.   Duke was in position to seal the win with a first down at Virginia Tech's 16-yard line, but a fumble gave the Hokies life with 1:44 to play. Virginia Tech gave the back on downs.   The Hokies fell behind 14-0 before rattling off 17 consecutive points. But the Blue Devils were relentless in compiling 396 yards of total offense.   Virginia Tech (5-6, 3-4), which has lost three straight, started Collin Schlee at quarterback over Kyron Drones, who was out with a lower-body injury.

Cincinnati (5-6, 3-5 Big 12) needs a home victory over TCU on Nov. 30 to get bowl-eligible. Kansas State's defense held the Bearcats to 3-of-12 on third-down conversions and 0-of-5 on fourth-down attempts. The Wildcats (8-3, 5-3) held just a 428-374 advantage in total yards, with the big advantage coming on the ground, 281-174. Johnson was 13-of-23 for 147 yards and rushed 10 times for 72 yards. Cincinnati tried to get back in the game when Brendan Sorsby found Tony Johnson in the back of the end zone for a 9-yard touchdown with 4:54 left in the third quarter. The Bearcats were unable to make the two-point conversion and were trailing 27-9. But Kansas State answered with an 11-play, 73-yard drive. Giddens ran 17 yards for his second touchdown of the game for a 34-9 lead. Johnson later found Will Swanson for an 8-yard touchdown, and Sorsby hit Johnson for a 6-yard touchdown with just over five minutes left to finish the scoring.

Miami has been off since Monday, while Dallas beat the host Denver Nuggets 123-120 on Friday night. Adebayo, 27, is a three-time All-Star, but he appears to be struggling with his role of captain, which he assumed after Udonis Haslem retired in the summer of 2023. ""Do I hate it? Yeah, but it's the responsibility I've been dealt with,"" Adebayo said on Friday in an interview with Clutch Points. ""It's like anything -- pros and cons."" Adebayo explained that he likes the title ... until it's time to act. ""They put you in this role where they want you to bring everybody (up) with you,"" Adebayo said. ""That's kind of the captain's role, being able to have everybody motivated, (player) one through 15."" Adebayo, who said he still gets advice from Haslem, is not at all happy with Miami's 6-7 start. ""That's below average,"" he said. Miami's top player so far this season has been Tyler Herro. The guard is averaging 24.2 points and 5.2 assists -- both tops on the team -- while shooting 48.6 percent overall and 45.2 percent from 3-point range. All those stats are on pace to be career highs for the sixth-year pro. Adebayo's numbers are down, however. Last season, he averaged 19.3 points and a career-high 10.4 rebounds while shooting 52.1 percent from the floor and 35.7 percent from deep. This season, he is posting 16.3 points and 9.5 rebounds per game on 42.6 percent shooting (31.3 percent from distance). Jimmy Butler, a six-time All-Star and the third member of Miami's ""Big Three,"" is averaging 17.7 points, which is well below last season's stat line (20.8). Butler didn't practice on Saturday and is questionable for Sunday's game with an illness, per the South Florida Sun Sentinel. The Heat may be down Butler, but the Mavericks know they'll be without superstar guard Luka Doncic, who remains sidelined with a strained right wrist. Doncic, a five-time All-Star and the reigning NBA scoring champ, leads Dallas in points (28.1), assists (7.6) and steals (1.6). Still, the Mavericks have won four straight after losing four in a row. Dallas slipped past Denver despite Doncic's absence and a scoreless night from Klay Thompson (0-for-8 from the floor), instead relying on double-digit scoring efforts from seven players. Naji Marshall scored a career-high 26 points off the bench, while Dereck Lively II made a significant contribution with 11 points on 4-for-4 shooting and two key blocks with the score tied in the final two minutes. ""This is a character game for us,"" Dallas coach Jason Kidd said after the win, per The Dallas Morning News. ""I think we learned from that situation -- being able to keep our composure."" Kyrie Irving, second on the Mavericks with 23.9 points per game, had 19 on Friday. The eight-time All-Star is also averaging 5.3 assists while shooting 53.2 percent from the floor and 51.2 percent beyond the arc.

The Warriors were playing the second game of a road back-to-back after downing the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday in NBA Cup action and looked worse for wear, especially in the final quarter, where they were outscored by 20 points. San Antonio trailed by 17 late in the third but eventually tied the game at 90 when Castle canned a driving layup with 4:25 to play in the fourth. Castle then proceeded to knock down a 3-pointer on the Spurs' ensuing possession. Wembanyama, who had missed San Antonio's previous three games due to a knee injury, added to the lead with a triple, then Castle sank a free throw with 2:28 remaining to cap an 11-0 run and stoke the Spurs' lead to seven points at 97-90. A reverse layup by Harrison Barnes off a Wembanyama assist with 1:28 to play all but sealed San Antonio's third consecutive win. Barnes added 22 points for San Antonio, which was without Devin Vassell (knee) and Keldon Johnson (hamstring).  Andrew Wiggins finished with 20 points to lead Golden State. Stephen Curry added 14 points, Trayce Jackson-Davis had 12 and Buddy Hield and Lindy Waters III scored 11 apiece.  Golden State was up 29-17 after 12 minutes of play. The Spurs cut their deficit to as few as six points before the visitors swung back, as Wiggins drained a shot from beyond the arc with 23 seconds remaining in the first half to give the Warriors a 50-38 advantage at the break. The visitors were up by as many as 17 in the third quarter before settling for an 81-71 edge heading into the fourth because of a 7-0 spurt by the Spurs to end the frame.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

On the first possession of the second half, Vanderbilt (6-5, 3-4) converted a fourth-and-1 from its own 45 and reached the LSU 27. The drive stalled from there, and Brock Taylor kicked a 47-yard field goal to trim the Tigers' lead to 14-10.   On the ensuing possession, LSU converted a fourth-and-5 when Nussmeier threw a 24-yard pass to CJ Daniels.

Vanderbilt never got the ball back as LSU moved 66 yards to run out the clock and send the Commodores to their second straight loss. The hosts went three-and-out on the game's first possession before Pavia connected with Quincy Skinner Jr. for Vanderbilt's only touchdown until Pavis's run in the fourth quarter. On the ensuing possession, LSU drove 90 yards, the final 20 of which came on Williams' tying touchdown run.   LSU moved to the Commodores' 3-yard line on its next drive, but Nussmeier threw incomplete on fourth-and-goal to leave the score 7-7 at the end of the first quarter.

Hansen's score capped a 75-yard drive for the Cyclones (9-2, 6-2). His halfback pass to Gabe Burkle on third and 1 on the previous play went for 26 yard to set up his winning score. The Utes (4-7, 1-7) had a chance to force overtime but Cole Becker, who earlier made field goals of 34 and 47 yards, missed wide right on a 54-yard attempt with nine seconds left. Utah reached the 33-yard line earlier in the drive but backup quarterback Luke Bottari was flagged for intentional grounding, backing it up just far enough to affect the field-goal try. Rocco Becht completed 20 of 38 passes for 256 yards with a touchdown and an interception for Iowa State, which hosts Kansas State next week. The Cyclones are tied with Arizona State, BYU and Colorado atop the conference. Bottari hit 5 of 9 passes for 55 yards for Utah in relief of starter Isaac Wilson, who was 8 of 8 for 74 yards before suffering a leg injury in the third quarter. Looking to stay bowl-eligible after being picked to win the conference in preseason polls, Utah initiated scoring at the 9:52 mark of the first quarter as Becker finished its opening drive with the 34-yard field goal. Iowa State took its first lead on its next drive, a six-minute possession that Becht capped with a 7-yard touchdown pass to Jayden Higgins. The Cyclones were on their way to another score early in the second quarter before Lander Barton picked off Becht and lugged it 87 yards for six points for the Utes. Iowa State regained the advantage with 8:05 left in the quarter on Hansen's 8-yard touchdown run. The teams exchanged field goals in the final 3:38, Kyle Konrardy answering Becker's 47-yarder with a 35-yarder with 29 seconds remaining for a 17-13 Cyclones edge at the break. Becht stretched the lead to 24-13 with a 1-yard scoring run for the only points in the third quarter. A blocked punt that was recovered for a touchdown by Jackson Bennee and a 1-yard scoring run by Micah Bernard gave Utah the first 15 points of the fourth quarter -- the latter score giving the Utes a 28-24 lead before Hansen's winner on the ensuing possession. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The win snapped a four-game losing streak in the Southeastern Conference for Oklahoma (6-5, 2-5 SEC) and clinched bowl eligibility for the Sooners for the 26th consecutive season. Only Georgia has a longer active bowl streak (28). The Crimson Tide (8-2, 4-3) had their three-game winning snapped and their chances for a berth in the College Football Playoff in serious jeopardy. The loss was the Crimson Tide's biggest since their 44-16 loss to Clemson in the 2018 College Football Playoff title game. The Sooners' coach, Brent Venables, was Clemson's defensive coordinator in that game. Alabama's 234 yards were its fewest since 2014. Oklahoma led 10-3 at halftime, mostly keeping the ball on the ground with a steady diet of runs by Robinson and quarterback Jackson Arnold. Arnold finished with a career-high 131 yards on the ground and went 9 of 11 for 68 yards through the air. The Sooners' defense blew the game open with two turnovers in the third. Cornerback Eli Bowen jumped Alabama's route and picked off Jalen Milroe's pass on the third play of the second half, returning the ball 25 yards to the Alabama 14. Five plays later, Robinson's 1-yard touchdown put Oklahoma up 17-3. On the next drive, the Sooners' defense did it themselves. Linebacker Kip Lewis picked off Milroe and returned it 49 yards for a score. Alabama drove 75 yards on its second drive of the game, but had to settle for a field goal after replay showed Ryan Williams stepped out of bounds at the 11 on a 30-yard pass play after he was initially credited with a touchdown. It was the last sustained drive the Crimson Tide would put together until the fourth quarter when the Sooners held a comfortable lead. Milroe finished 11 of 26 for 164 yards and three interceptions and 15 carries for 7 yards. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

After catching a pass, Williams lost a fumble that was recovered by Oregon State's Jaden Robinson at the Cougars' 49-yard line with just under two minutes remaining. John Mateer was 17-of-23 passing for 250 yards and two touchdowns and also rushed for 75 yards and two scores for Washington State (8-3, 0-1). The victory was just Oregon State's second in the past 11 meetings with the Cougars. Ten teams formally departed the Pac-12 in the summer to join other leagues.

Rosemonde Kouassi was assessed a yellow card in the 28th minute for pulling Banda to the ground in a tussle for the ball, but Orlando made nothing of the ensuing free kick.   Then came Banda's goal. She received a lead pass from Angelina in the right corner, dribbled into the box and hit a left-footed shot that glanced off Kingsbury's leg and into the net.   Moorhouse saved shot attempts by Hatch in the 65th and 67th minutes. Moorhouse stopped Rodman's header in the 74th.   Washington had possession for most of second-half stoppage time and got into the box on multiple occasions, but Orlando's physical defense kept the ball away from danger. On a Spirit corner kick, Kingsbury came up from her post to play offense and headed the incoming kick, but it went straight to a Pride defender. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

After Columbus won in overtime against Tampa Bay on Thursday, the Blue Jackets provided their home crowd another entertaining contest, but they needed to go into a shootout for the first time this season to win their third straight game. Neither team led by more than one goal at any point on Saturday.   Kirill Marchenko scored twice for the Blue Jackets, including the game-tying goal with just 66 seconds remaining in regulation after Columbus pulled Merzlikins for an extra attacker.   Pyotr Kochetkov made 27 saves for Carolina, but he had to leave the game with 2:08 remaining in overtime after teammate Sean Walker, who was blocking Zach Werenski from driving to the net, collided with his netminder and hit him in the head.   Spencer Martin replaced Kochetkov. He made one save in the three-on-three extra session, but Sean Monahan beat him to start the shootout in what proved to be the only goal during one-on-ones. Carolina, which lost its second straight, rallied from a 3-2 deficit to take a 4-3 lead in the second period when Jackson Blake scored his sixth goal of the season with 6:37 left in the frame. Blake's tally came after Sebastian Aho pulled the Hurricanes even at 3-3 on the power play at 10:39.   Columbus scored its first two goals in a similar fashion, converting turnovers in the Hurricanes' attacking end to breakaway tallies. Dante Fabbro skated almost the length of the ice to score on Kochetkov's stick side and make it 1-0 just 2:04 into the game. Marchenko would cash in after forcing a turnover at the blue line with 9:40 left in the first.   Jack Roslovic scored Carolina's first goal at 6:41 in the first for a 1-1 tie. Aho added an assist, while Martin Necas contributed two assists for the Hurricanes.   Dmitri Voronkov's power-play goal with 12:50 left in the second period gave the Blue Jackets a 3-2 lead. That advantage would stand until Aho's goal on the man advantage less than four minutes later. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Palmieri scored late in the first and even later in the third on an empty-netter for the Islanders, who snapped a three-game losing streak (0-2-1) inwhich they squandered a third-period lead each time. Brock Nelson had a power play goal in the second and two assists for the Islanders. Goalie Ilya Sorokin earned his 100th career win by making 24 saves. Sorokin lost his previous four starts (0-2-2). Jake Neighbours scored in the opening minute of the third for the Blues, who have lost seven of nine (2-6-1). Goalie Jordan Binnington recorded 28 saves. Palmieri's persistence paid off when he scored the game's first goal with 1:09 left in the first. Ryan Suter's pass glanced off the stick of Neighbours, who was hounded by Palmieri. The Islanders' right winger couldn't corral the puck, which skittered back to Suter near the St. Louis blue line. Suter dished backward to Pierre-Olivier Joseph, but his pass off the boards in the neutral zone was picked off by Brock Nelson, who passed to Palmieri. His shot from the top of the slot sailed under Binnington's stick. A tripping penalty on Suter led to Nelson's goal with 4:05 left in the second. Maxim Tsyplakov shuffled the puck behind the Blues' net before sending a pass underneath Colton Parayko just as Nelson fell in the slot. But Nelson, from his knees, fired a shot over Binnington's glove. Islanders defenseman Isaiah George was whistled for cross checking just 35 seconds into the third to set up Neighbours' goal 10 seconds later. Robert Thomas won a faceoff against Nelson before Neighbours, stationed next to Sorokin, took a cross-crease pass from Pavel Buchnevich and tucked a shot over Sorokin's stick. Noah Dobson's goal with 8:27 left was overturned due to goalie interference on Palmieri, who fell into Binnington just before Dobson's shot went past him. Anders Lee was robbed twice by Binnington with 3:01 remaining before Palmieri iced the win a little more than a minute after Binnington was pulled. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Baylor (7-4, 5-3) is one of nine teams with a mathematical chance to play for the Big 12 title with one week remaining in the regular season. The Bears got help from losses by other opponents earlier in the day, then took care of business by holding an inept Houston offense to 239 yards.   Robertson finished 15-of-23 passing for 204 yards and threw three interceptions. Tight end Michael Trigg had four catches for 96 yards and a score and Ashtyn Hawkins added six receptions for 65 yards and a TD.   Zeon Chriss completed 13 of 24 passes for 126 yards and three picks for Houston (4-7, 3-5). Jeremiah Wilson had two interceptions in the first quarter and returned the latter for the Cougars' only touchdown of the game.   Both quarterbacks threw an interception on their first drives of the game, with Devyn Bobby picking off Chriss' pass in the end zone.   On third-and-goal from the 5-yard line, Robertson threw a high pass to Trigg, who made a difficult one-handed grab despite tight coverage. Trigg tucked the ball behind his back as he landed for a stylish touchdown.   Two Baylor drives later, Robertson passed to the left sideline and Wilson jumped in front of it for his second pick of the first quarter. He hustled 41 yards for a game-tying touchdown with 32 seconds left in the period.   Not long after Trigg made another one-handed catch for a 42-yard gain, the Bears had a third-and-goal at the 2-yard line in the final minute of the half. They attempted a direct snap to Washington but the snap sailed over his head and he ran back to fall on it, a loss of a 25.   Isaiah Hankins' 45-yard field goal as time expired gave Baylor a 17-7 halftime lead.   Houston wasted a 13-play drive that lasted 6:45 to open the third quarter, as Jack Martin missed a 47-yard field-goal attempt.   After forcing a three-and-out, the Cougars marched 74 yards on another 13-play drive, the drive lasting into the fourth quarter. Martin connected from 24 yards to trim Houston's deficit to 17-10 with 14:52 to play.   With 6:26 left, Chriss' pass was tipped high in the air and Lorando Johnson came down with the interception in Houston territory. Baylor made it a two-possession game with Hankins' 50-yard field goal, effectively quashing any hopes of a comeback. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Marchessault, who left the Vegas Golden Knights in the offseason and signed to five-year, $27.5 million free-agent contract with Nashville, scored his fourth goal of the season and first in six games. Roman Josi scored twice, Steven Stamkos also scored and Juuse Saros made 23 saves for the Predators, who had lost four of five (1-2-2). Adam Lowry scored and Eric Comrie made 32 saves in his fifth start of the season for the Jets, who have lost three of five following their 15-1-0 start. The Predators took a 1-0 lead at 9:55 of the first period. Marchessault passed the puck back to Josi at the left point, and he sent a slap shot through heavy traffic and into the net. Alexandre Carrier appeared to give Nashville a 2-0 lead with a wrist shot 16 seconds later, but Winnipeg challenged for offsides and the goal was disallowed. Lowry tied it 1-1 with 10:02 left in the second period during a delayed penalty. A shot from the right point was blocked by Predators defenseman Luke Schenn. Mason Appleton retrieved the rebound and took a spinning shot that ended up in the crease, and Lowry pushed the puck across the goal line before Saros could cover it. The Predators went on their third power play of the game and Stamkos scored off a rebound for a 2-1 lead at 3:20 of the third. Marchessault extended the lead to 3-1 at 5:04 when he scored a rebound from the slot. Josi scored into an empty net with 1:20 left. Nashville, which came in with the top penalty kill unit in the NHL at 91.3 percent, killed all three penalties by the Jets, who came in with the most efficient power play unit (35.6).

Locked in a 2-all tie in the final frame after erasing a pair of one-goal deficits, Dallas turned to its speed game and exploited the Lightning's rear guard to win for the fifth time in its past six contests (5-1-0). Duchene, who added an assist, started and finished a give-and-go from the right side during a strong rush, taking a pass from Tyler Seguin before burying a sharp-angle wrister at 6:55 of the third for his 11th goal of the season.  Dallas doubled its lead 58 seconds later when Hintz blew by the Lightning defense and flipped in his eighth goal of the campaign for a sudden 4-2 edge. Evgenii Dadonov and Miro Heiskanen also found the back of the net as Dallas beat Tampa Bay for just the fifth time in the past 15 matchups between the teams (5-8-2). Goaltender Jake Oettinger stopped 27 shots for the Stars.  Anthony Cirelli had both of the Lightning's goals and has now scored in five straight games. Brandon Hagel had two assists, and Andrei Vasilevskiy made 24 saves. Tampa Bay's dismal November continued, as the team fell to 3-4-2 this month.  In the Stars' only meeting with the Lightning in Tampa Bay this season, Cirelli was a one-man wrecking crew in the first period. A bad-angle wrister by Hagel kicked out to Cirelli, who banged home the game's first tally 4:09 into the first, but Dadonov answered just under two minutes later with his sixth marker of the season. However, Cirelli's strong presence in front of Oettinger put the home side back up thanks to a similar goal off a rebound at 8:34. It was Cirelli's eighth goal of 2024-25.  Following a delay of game penalty by Heiskanen, the defenseman redeemed himself by taking a backhanded saucer pass from Duchene and depositing his third goal of the campaign into the back of the net to tie the affair at 2-all at 15:49. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Kiefer Sherwood recorded a goal and an assist for the Canucks, who prevailed despite Hughes being issued a game misconduct for boarding Josh Norris with 7:31 remaining in the first period. DeBrusk, who entered with just three goals, snapped a six-game goal drought as the Canucks improved to a franchise-best 7-1-0 on the road. Ottawa's Brady Tkachuk posted his 10th goal and received his own misconduct penalty with less than seven minutes left in the game. But late goals from Claude Giroux and Tim Stutzle made things interesting for Ottawa, which is mired in an 0-4-1 slide. The Senators couldn't take advantage of the early departure of Hughes, Vancouver's leader with 19 points, who earned a major penalty for his check on Norris, whose head hit the end board. The Canucks were already without fellow stars Thatcher Demko (knee), Brock Boeser (upper-body injury) and J.T. Miller (personal reasons). However, the Canucks killed the five-minute Senators' power play that followed. Then they made the most of their own power play when DeBrusk deflected in Conor Garland's shot with 1:24 left in the first to open the scoring. Ottawa, though, converted on its next power-play opportunity at 3:41 of the second period as Tkachuk's quick stick pushed the puck past Vancouver's Kevin Lankinen (26 saves), who has won all seven of his road starts. But the Canucks stormed back with three straight goals. With 10:37 remaining in the second, Vancouver's Max Sasson sent a pass into the slot that Blueger sent past Ottawa's Linus Ullmark (17 saves). It was Sasson's first career NHL game. Less than four minutes later, working a two-on-one with Sherwood, DeBrusk brilliantly deked Ullmark for a 3-1 lead. DeBrusk then earned an assist when Sherwood won a net-front scrum with 11:19 left in regulation for a 4-1 Canucks' lead. Giroux's power-play goal came with 3:31 left in the third and Stutzle notched the 100th goal of his career with 44 seconds to go and Ullmark pulled. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

That will likely continue Sunday when the Tigers (4-1) host the Arkansas-Pine Bluff Golden Lions (1-5) at Mizzou Arena in Columbia, Mo. Gates has used 16 players this season, counting brief appearances by two walk-ons. Missouri deployed 12 players in their 91-56 victory over Pacific Friday and 11 of them scored. ""In my career, you know, this is normal for me,"" Gates said. ""I've been able to do it as an assistant coach at Florida State, where we had 12, 13 deep, you know, in certain years. And then as a head coach at Cleveland State, and obviously, the last two years here. This is the deepest team I've had here, but not the deepest team I've had as a coach. ""It gives you added insurance that your team will always continue to fight and get better."" Guard Tony Perkins, a transfer from Iowa, hasn't played in the last two games while resting a leg injury. Forward Aidan Shaw sat out after averaging 16 minutes in the first four games. Both could play against the Golden Lions. ""We have three games in six days,"" Gates said. ""Aidan Shaw will play next game, but it gives you the glimpse of how deep our team is."" Guards Caleb Grill (15.8 points per game), Tamar Bates (13.0) and Anthony Robinson II (10.2) are driving Missouri's offense. Forward Mark Mitchell is averaging 10.8 points and 4.8 rebounds. The Golden Lions lost the top three scorers from their team that fell 101-79 at Missouri last season. Kylen Milton, who scored 34 points in that game, transferred to Murray State and Joe French and Rashad Williams are playing professionally. Arkansas-Pine Bluff coach Solomon Bozeman is trying to build chemistry with 11 new players. ""I just think that's just the new normal with college basketball and the transfer portal,"" Bozeman said. ""It's definitely hard. But at the end of the day, you have to get the job done."" North Texas transfer Christian Moore is averaging 14.2 points, 3.8 assists and 2.3 steals per game for the Golden Lions. North Idaho Community College transfer Dante Sawyer averages 12.3 points and Monmouth transfer Klemen Vuga averages 10.8 points and 5.5 rebounds. The Golden Lions have allowed 97 points per game in their five road losses. They lost 98-64 at Texas Tech on Monday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Cal (4-1) opened the four-team, round-robin event with a 78-69 win over Air Force on Thursday night, riding a breakout 23-point performance by freshman guard Jeremiah Wilkinson. Sacramento State (1-3) will play its three Cal Classic games over the course of the next seven days, visiting Air Force on Wednesday before hosting Mercyhurst next Saturday. With three starters out of the lineup, Wilkinson took advantage of greater opportunity to score 12 more points than he'd totaled in the first four games of his college career. Jovan Blacksher Jr., DJ Campbell and BJ Omot are all still considered questionable, so Wilkinson could get a chance to further introduce himself to his new fans when the Hornets visit. ""I know we got guys going down, (so) it was going to be my chance to step up and have a bigger role,"" Wilkinson said. ""My thought process is to use my athleticism and get downhill. That's kind of like my strength. That's really the goal: Get downhill and put pressure on the defense."" Cal has done a lot of that at home this season, going 3-0 on the strength of 85.0 points per game. Sacramento State has been much stingier than that on defense so far, limiting Fresno State and U.C. San Diego to 64 points apiece in its two previous road games. The Hornets lost those contests, then returned home and dropped a third straight last Saturday to Cal State Northridge, 79-69. Jacob Holt had a career-high 20 points in the loss to Northridge before fouling out of a two-point game with 3:30 remaining. The 6-foot-10 forward knows the game plan against Cal, which would be down a key big man if the 6-foot-8 Omot misses a second straight game. ""One thing the coaches emphasize is being aggressive,"" Holt said. ""They want me to be aggressive and they have belief in me to make plays and really play free.""   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Coming off a pair of strong showings following disappointing opening round results, Oklahoma State and Nevada seek a second win at the Charleston Classic in Sunday's fifth-place game in South Carolina. Picked 14th in the Big 12's preseason poll, the Cowboys (4-1) are showing a potent offense so far as they are averaging 82.4 points and yet to score fewer than 78 points.  Oklahoma State opened this event with an 86-78 loss to Florida Atlantic when it shot 34 percent, but in Friday's 80-74 win over Miami, the offense was improved as the Cowboys built a 16-point halftime lead and shot 47.4 percent for the game. Bryce Thompson scored 17 and Marchelus Avery added 15 after Thompson had eight and Avery six against Florida Atlantic. The Cowboys picked up the win despite struggling to finish it. The Cowboys held a 20-point lead with 14:35 remaining, a 17-point lead with 4:55 left and an 11-point edge with about two minutes left. ""We dropped a tough game on Thursday and we went back and watched film,"" Thompson said in his postgame radio interview. ""We watched film on Miami and 24 hours later we came back with a good win."" Nevada (5-1) seeks its second win of the event after playing a pair of one possession games against Vanderbilt and Virginia Commonwealth. After taking a 73-71 loss in the opening round, the Wolfpack overcame an 11-point halftime deficit to earn a 64-61 win over VCU by hitting two late 3-pointers and continuing to shoot well from behind the arc (48 percent in the first six games). Nick Davidson scored 13 of his 15 points after halftime when Nevada outscored VCU 41-27. Nevada also went 7-of-13 from 3-point range and got a tying 3 from Tre Coleman with 54 seconds left and the tiebreaking 3 from Kobe Sanders with five seconds left a night after missing a potential go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:40 left against Vanderbilt. ""That's growth,"" Nevada coach Steve Alford said. ""That's what we're looking for early in the season. We've been able to play Vanderbilt out of the SEC.

Felipe Carballo added his second goal of the postseason on an early long-distance strike that helped the seventh-seeded Red Bulls reach their first conference final since 2018. They'll face the winner of Sunday's second East semifinal between Orlando and Atlanta, and will host that game if Atlanta advances. Carlos Coronel made six saves to keep the clean sheet and earn RBNY's first win over their city rivals this season in the first-ever postseason Hudson River Derby fixture. The best of those stops thwarted NYCFC leading scorer Alonso Martinez, one only two minutes after Vanzeir doubled RBNY's lead in the first half and one only three minutes into the second half. Thiago Martins also struck the woodwork late for the sixth-seeded Cityzens, who were in pursuit of a second MLS Cup title in three seasons. Carballo sent the Red Bulls in front in the 16th minute. Goalkeeper Carlos Coronel drove the ball from his own penalty area toward NYCFC's, prompting an initial headed clearance attempt. Vanzeir won the second header, and the ball dropped to the feet of Carballo, who took a touch to control it before unfurling a powerful left-footed strike that beat the diving Matt Freese to the top left corner. Nine minutes later, it was Vanzeir in the right place following an aerial challenge, finding the ball at his feet following a corner and dispatching it nearly off the inside of the right post. The only blemish of the evening for the visitors came in the second half, when Sean Nealis departed in the 62th minute after a collision with City's Justin Haak. Replays appeared to show Nealis losing consciousness from the initial impact, though he walked off the field under his own power. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

OG Anunoby scored 27 points to pace the Knicks, who had won four consecutive games. Markkanen made 11 of 15 field goals, including 5-for-8 from 3-point range, and grabbed nine rebounds as the Jazz opened a five-game homestand with their fourth win. Collin Sexton added 25 points with six 3-pointers, and John Collins totaled 20 points and 13 rebounds. Walker Kessler had 11 points, 10 rebounds and three blocks, while Keyonte George scored 11 with nine assists.  Markkanen sparked a 10-0 run in the fourth quarter with a layup to help Utah reestablish an 18-point lead en route to the win.

Isaac Brown rushed for 93 yards and two scores on 13 carries for the Cardinals (7-4, 5-3 ACC), who racked up 505 yards. Louisville dominated on both sides of the ball and led 34-0 just 62 seconds into the third quarter after Chris Bell's 68-yard catch-and-run touchdown on a flat pass from Shough. Bell finished with 101 yards receiving on two catches. The Panthers (7-4, 3-4) entered Saturday averaging nearly 429 yards a game, but the Cardinals allowed just 265 and forced three turnovers as Pittsburgh lost its fourth straight contest. Pittsburgh took the opening kick and marched to the Louisville 7, only for Stanquan Clark to pick off Eli Holstein's pass in the end zone for the first of his two interceptions on the night. Louisville converted that turnover into Brock Travelstead's 41-yard field goal to take a 3-0 lead with 6:35 left in the first quarter. Holstein started at quarterback for Pittsburgh after missing last week's loss to Clemson due to a head injury. However, he left the game with 5:32 left in the opening quarter after being sacked by Ashton Gillotte at the Panthers 49. As he was going down, Holstein's left ankle rolled under Gillotte. He was already in a walking boot as he was carted off the field. He was replaced by Nate Yarnell. After throwing for 350 yards against Clemson last week, Yarnell managed just 96 yards on 11-of-23 passing. He also threw an interception by Clark that led to Brown's 15-yard scoring run. David Lynch replaced Yarnell to start the fourth quarter.

Sellers completed 23-of-27 passes and ran for 53 yards on 13 carries for the Gamecocks (8-3). After throwing an early interception, Sellers settled in and completed 17 of his next 18 throws, a stretch that included two of his touchdown tosses. Dalevon Campbell hauled in five of Sellers' targets for 120 yards, and the South Carolina offense was also boosted by Raheim Sanders rushing for 72 yards and a score on 15 carries. For Wofford (5-7), Amari Odom finished with 215 passing yards and a touchdown while completing 15-of-28 passes. The Terriers actually got on the board first with Devery Cagle capping off the game's opening five-play 66-yard drive with a 27-yard field goal. Sellers threw his lone interception of the day to end South Carolina's first possession, but the Gamecocks forced the Terriers into a quick three-and-out to get the ball back. Nine of South Carolina's ten drives after that ended with touchdowns. The final series of the day for the Gamecocks' offense -- a 10-play, 85-yard drive that chewed up about four minutes of clock -- ended with the first career rushing touchdown for redshirt senior walk-on running back Bradley Dunn, a five-yard scoring tote. Wofford's only touchdown came in the second quarter when Odom ended a 10-play drive with a six-yard scoring strike to Dylan Djete. South Carolina converted on 10-of-12 third down tries, while Wofford converted just 2-of-12. The Gamecocks held the Terriers to just 28 rushing yards while piling up 265 yards on the ground on their own. All that remains on South Carolina's regular season schedule is a nonconference clash next Saturday at rival No. 17 Clemson -- a game that could have an impact on the College Football Playoff.

With all the offense, it was a defensive play that perhaps made the biggest difference. Instead of Oklahoma State pulling even as had been the trend on the afternoon, Texas Tech's Jacob Rodriguez scooped a fumble and ran for a touchdown with 4:45 remaining for the first of his two key late-game plays.  Suddenly, the Red Raiders (7-4, 5-3 Big 12 Conference) held a two-possession lead. But Maealiuaki Smith connected with Rashod Owens for a 10-yard touchdown (the extra-point attempt failed) to close the gap to eight points with 2:35 left in regulation. Morton finished 35-for-50 for 366 yards with an interception. Ollie Gordon II rushed for three touchdowns and 156 yards for Oklahoma State (3-8, 0-8), which lost its eighth consecutive game. Smith threw for two touchdowns and 326 yards with one interception for the Cowboys. Smith played in place of Alan Bowman, a former Texas Tech player who had led Oklahoma State in passing in every game this season. After Owens' late touchdown, Texas Tech tried to keep possession to run out the clock. Morton had a 12-yard run on third-and-11. Still, the Red Raiders ended up punting, but Oklahoma State's last-ditch effort was doomed by Rodriguez interception at the 50 with 7 seconds remaining. Caleb Douglas, Jalin Conyers, Mason Tharp and Brooks made TD receptions for the Red Raiders. Brooks also gained 133 rushing yards on 28 carries, and Douglas accumulated 105 receiving yards on five catches. Oklahoma State's De'Zhaun Stribling (133 yards) and Owens (124) were tops in receiving yards. Texas Tech never trailed, but the score was tied at 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42. Brooks put the Red Raiders up 49-42 on his 1-yard touchdown run with 6:12 remaining in the fourth quarter. That was his third touchdown run in a 15-minute span.

Kentucky answered to tie the game with a 4-yard TD pass from Vandagriff to Josh Kattus - also on fourth down - with 11:36 to play in the second quarter.   Texas retook the lead at 14-7 via a 5-yard touchdown run by Blue at the 6:39 mark of the second quarter. The scoring play came one snap after a personal foul penalty by the Wildcats' Maxwell Hairston on third down kept the Longhorns' drive alive.   Ewers found Helm again for a 17-yard touchdown connection to expand Texas' advantage to 21-7 with 3:12 remaining until halftime.

Green completed 20 of 37 passes with an interception as the Razorbacks (6-5) clinched bowl eligibility despite a spate of mistakes. They were flagged eight times for 78 yards, including a holding call on the opening kickoff that negated a 100-yard touchdown return by Rodney Hill, and committed three turnovers. However, Arkansas controlled both sides of the scrimmage line. It outgained the Bulldogs 454-229 and permitted just 39 yards in 33 rushing attempts. The Razorbacks ran for 233 yards, getting 112 on only 15 carries from Rashod Dubinion.

Bullock worked under steady pressure, absorbing three sacks and being harassed on other throws. Arkansas snapped a scoreless tie with 14 second-quarter points to take a two-score lead to halftime. Green capped an 80-yard drive that lasted nearly six minutes with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Isaac TeSlaa with 5:49 left, followed by his 41-yard touchdown run just after the two-minute warning.

Robinson made the interception on a second-and-10 play at the Arizona State 39, returning the interception all the way to the BYU 7. The Cougars used their two timeouts and Arizona State quarterback Sam Leavitt tried to burn time by running backward on a couple of plays to the BYU 39. Two delay-of-game penalties put the ball at the BYU 49 with 7 seconds left. Leavitt tried to burn those seconds by dropping back and throwing the ball high into the air. The ball dropped out of bounds with 1 second left. A throng of fans rushed the field thinking that Arizona State won. The game was delayed at least 20 minutes for the last play of the game to be played. Retzlaff's hail mary pass fell incomplete short of the end zone on the last play. Arizona State (9-2, 6-2) now holds the head-to-head tiebreaker over BYU (9-2, 6-2) in the Big 12 standings with each having one game remaining. Cam Skattebo rushed for 147 yards on 28 carries with three touchdowns for Arizona State. Sam Leavitt completed 16 of 25 pass attempts for 247 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Retzlaff passed for 297 yards while completing 22 of 38 pass attempts with a touchdown and two interceptions. BYU scored touchdowns on its three first possessions of the second half to cut into a 21-3 halftime lead for Arizona State. Keelan Marion's 10-yard run with 2:49 left in the third quarter cut the lead to 21-9. A 2-point conversion run by LJ Martin was stopped short. Arizona State responded with a 61-yard touchdown pass from Leavitt to Xavier Guillory to increase the lead to 28-9 with 2:06 remaining in the third quarter. The Cougars scored on a 21-yard pass connection between Retzlaff and JoJo Phillips with 43 seconds left in the third quarter. Retzlaff completed a 2-point conversion pass to cut the lead to 28-17. After forcing Arizona State to punt, BYU put together an 88-yard scoring drive that was culminated by a 1-yard touchdown run by Marion. The 2-point conversion pass attempt by Retzlaff was incomplete.

Mendoza threw for 299 yards and three scores, the first of which was a second-quarter, 16-yard toss to Trond Grizzell for Cal's only TD in the game's first three quarters as Stanford built a 21-10 lead. But Mendoza found Brady for a 30-yard TD to cap a 71-yard drive with 10:09 to play to get the Golden Bears (6-5, 2-5 ACC) within five, then hit his wideout again for a 22-yard score that put Cal on top with 2:40 to go. A two-point shovel pass from Mendoza to Jaydn Ott increased the margin to 24-21, before the Cal defense forced a turnover on downs on Stanford's ensuing possession, giving the host Golden Bears command of the game. Mendoza's late accuracy left him 25-for-36 without an interception, helping the Golden Bears gain bowl eligibility with a sixth win. Brady finished with five catches for 64 yards and his two scores, while Grizzell had four catches for a game-high 70 yards and the first-half TD. Mendoza also was Cal's leading rusher with 11 carries for 35 yards. Stanford dominated the early going, taking a 14-0 lead in the 14th minute of the game on 1- and 2-yard plunges by Stanford backup quarterback Justin Lamson. Seeking to end a three-game losing streak in the rivalry, the Cardinal (3-8, 2-6) created a two-touchdown cushion midway through the third quarter when running back Micah Ford flipped a 2-yard TD pass to Emmett Mosley V on a fourth-down trick play. Emmet Kenney's PAT made it 21-7. Ryan Coe hit a 46-yard field goal with 47 seconds left in the third period, getting Cal within 21-10 and setting up the fourth-quarter rally.

The Jayhawks' bowl chances seemed all but eliminated after they lost at then-No. 16 Kansas State on Oct. 26 and fell to 2-6. But if they win at Baylor next Saturday, they'll be bowl-eligible.   Neal had three rushing touchdowns while gaining 207 yards. He also caught four passes for 80 yards and a score. Jalon Daniels was 14-of-21 passing for 189 yards and a TD and rushed for 72 yards on six carries.

Colorado got deep in Kansas territory with 6:22 left but turned it over on downs.   Kansas received the opening kickoff and went 73 yards on six plays to take a 7-0 lead. Daniels hit Neal on a short screen to the left side and Neal went 51 almost untouched for the score.   After forcing a Colorado three-and-out, Kansas drove deep into Buffaloes territory. The drive stalled and the Jayhawks settled for a 24-yard Tabor Allen field goal.   The Jayhawks then stopped Colorado on a fourth-and-2 just past midfield. On the ensuing drive, Kansas went 61 yards in eight plays, capped by Neal's 9-yard touchdown run.

On its first possession, the Mountaineers traveled 68 yards on eight plays, capping it when Donaldson plunged in from 1 yard out at 10:34. White later produced a short scoring run inside the quarter's final two minutes. UCF came alive in the second quarter and got a key fourth-and-3 conversion from backup quarterback Jacurri Brown on a 4-yard run. On the next play, Harvey rambled in from 2 yards at 8:37.

Quentin Jones led Northern Illinois (2-4) with 16 points, Tsvet Sotirov scored all 11 of his points after halftime and Dominic Gooden added 10 off the bench. The Huskies hit just 25.4 percent from the field and 20.7 percent on 3-pointers.   DePaul wasted little time avenging last season's 10-point home loss to Northern Illinois, even though both teams' rosters are dramatically different.   Blocker, who missed Tuesday's win over Eastern Illinois with a thigh injury, returned to the starting lineup and drilled two 3-pointers in the opening four minutes to steer DePaul to a 11-2 lead. He added a dunk and a coast-to-coast layup to push the Blue Demons' margin to 17-4 with 12 minutes left in the half.

Goaltender Dan Vladar made 20 saves before overtime and then denied four of five Wild he faced in the shootout. Marco Rossi scored once in a two-point game, while Marcus Johansson and Brock Faber added goals for the Wild, who were without top scorer Kirill Kaprizov due to a knee injury sustained in the previous game. Matt Boldy collected two assists, which gives him three goals and four assists in a six-point point streak. Goalie Filip Gustavsson stopped 28 shots for the Wild, who have only one regulation-time road loss this season (9-1-3). Andersson notched his second career shootout winner with a low five-hole shot to complete an entertaining affair in which Calgary had a couple of leads and the Wild showed plenty of grit. Despite the Wild dominating play in the early going, Rooney opened the scoring by deflecting Daniil Miromanov's point shot at the 15-minute mark for his second goal of the season. Johansson tied the clash 63 seconds later when he converted the pass from Boldy during a two-on-one rush for his third goal of the campaign. Pospisil, with his first goal since the season opener, put the Flames ahead a second time with 30.3 seconds remaining in the second period. The pesky winger deflected a shot-pass on the power play to snap a 19-game goal drought. Sharangovich doubled the lead with another man-advantage marker at 3:53 of the third period.

Mascherano, 40, is a former teammate of Miami star Lionel Messi. The two were teammates at FC Barcelona from 2010-18. Inter Miami's job came open Friday when Gerardo ""Tata"" Martino resigned due to personal reasons. Inter Miami co-owner Jorge Mas told reporters on Friday that the club was close to making a hire. He also said that he sought out Messi's input. ""Leo shared his thoughts with me,"" Mas said. ""This is a very attractive position for a coach."" Mascherano also played with Messi for Argentina and is a former captain of the national team. He won two Olympic gold medals as a player. Mascherano has served as head coach of the Argentina under-20 and under-23 teams and also coached Argentina in the 2024 Olympics at Paris. The squad lost to France in the quarterfinals. Either way, leading a top-flight MLS team would rate as a step up. Plus, Miami won the Supporter's Shield with a league-record 74 points this season. But the club was eliminated in a stunning first-round upset at the hands of Atlanta United. Messi, 37, recorded 20 goals and 16 assists in 19 MLS matches (15 starts) this season, his first full season with Inter Miami.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Davin Cosby had 11 points as the Demon Deacons (6-1) won their second straight since their only loss, which came a week earlier at Xavier. But it wasn't easy as the visiting Titans (3-3) were persistent as they trimmed a 19-point deficit to nine points with plenty of time remaining (5:54). Orlando Lovejoy led the Titans with 15 points and TJ Nadeau had 13 points and nine rebounds off the Detroit Mercy bench despite shooting 1-for-8 on 3-pointers. Jared Lary added 10 points. Wake Forest doubled up the Titans in 3-point production by making 10 compared to Detroit Mercy's five. But the Demon Deacons took more than half of their attempts (61) from beyond the 3-point arc (35). As a result, they were just 9-for-13 on free throws. The Titans also held a 48-31 advantage in rebounding. Some of that might have been attributed to the absence of Wake Forest center Efton Reid III, who has been dealing with migraines. Detroit Mercy trailed 36-23 at halftime, but Wake Forest couldn't put the Titans away. Sallis shot 12-for-18 from the field and made five 3-point shots. He ended up two points shy of his career-high mark. Sallis came through with clutch shots, including a 3-pointer to go up by 12 with 4:59 left.  Cosby had three 3-pointers before hitting his lone 2-point basket with 3:33 left to push the lead back to 14. The Titans shot only 5-for-19 on 3-pointers and they checked in at 33.3 percent overall from the field. Detroit Mercy was charged with 14 turnovers compared to only five for Wake Forest. Detroit Mercy was coming off Wednesday night's victory at Ball State. That outcome marked the team's first true road triumph since February 2023, but the Titans couldn't duplicate it. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Williams carried nine times for 80 yards, scoring on runs of 1 and 20 yards in the first half. Hoover completed 19 of 26 passes, with one touchdown and one interception, before being pulled midway through the fourth quarter when the Frogs were up by 21.   TCU took control after leading 21-13 at halftime, going up 35-13 on a 38-yard reception to JP Richardson midway through the third. Arizona kept its hopes alive, ending a 15-play, 75-yard drive with a 3-yard touchdown pass to Chris Hunter on fourth down on the first play of the fourth quarter. The two-point conversion made it 35-21.   But the Horned Frogs responded with another TD drive, capped by a 6-yard run by Cam Cook for a 42-21 advantage. Arizona added a 70-yard fumble return touchdown with one minute to go for the game's final score.   Tetairoa McMillan caught nine passes for 115 yards to become the Arizona career leader in receiving yardage with 3,355. He surpassed his receivers coach, Bobby Wade (3,351), at the top spot.

She calmly knocked in her fifth birdie of the day on 17 to put herself at 5 under on the day and 15 under overall, then a par on 18 assured her a share of the lead going into final-round action Sunday.

After five seasons with the Clippers, George signed a four-year, $212 million deal with the Sixers in the offseason. However, the team has won only three times in its first 15 games with stars Joel Embiid, Tyrese Maxey and George all missing significant time due to injuries. Embiid continues to nurse a knee injury and will miss this matchup, while George (hyperextended knee) will not be available to face his former team. Meanwhile, the Clippers have been up-and-down this season while playing the entire campaign without two-way standout Kawhi Leonard (knee). Los Angeles opened the season 2-1 before losing three in a row. The team then won four straight, then lost three consecutive games and now has won four straight entering Sunday's opener of a four-game road trip. The Clippers announced over the weekend that Leonard would miss the entire trip, which puts more pressure on former Sixers guard James Harden, who is averaging 20.4 points, 7.6 rebounds and a team-high 8.8 assists. Norman Powell is the Clippers' leading scorer at 23.3 points per game. He will miss his third consecutive game with a hamstring issue.  The Clippers won twice at home without Powell, including Friday's 104-88 triumph over the Sacramento Kings. Harden had 22 points to lead the way in that contest, while Ivica Zubac notched 10 points and 15 rebounds. ""All games are meaningful for us,"" Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said after the win in NBA Cup play. ""Playing for the Cup and having a chance to go to Vegas to play for the big money is always intriguing as well. But we got to play the same way every night, whether it's the Cup, whatever we are doing, being short-handed."" After committing 22 turnovers in the victory over the Orlando Magic on Wednesday, the Clippers committed just 12 turnovers against the Kings. ""We've just got to take care of the basketball,"" Lue said. That will be particularly important Sunday against a Philadelphia squad that forced 19 turnovers in Friday's 113-98 victory over the Brooklyn Nets. On the offensive end, rookie Jared McCain and All-Star guard Tyrese Maxey combined for 56 points as the Sixers snapped a five-game slide. ""I ain't gonna lie, it felt good to win,"" Maxey said after shooting 11-of-17 for 26 points. ""I'm not going to sit here and talk about making shots. We played so hard, offensively and defensively, (and) played together. Guys stuck together."" McCain was caught on camera in the fourth quarter saying, ""I'm Rookie of the Year."" The guard finished with 30 points -- his seventh straight game with at least 20 points. ""It's one of my goals for the season, obviously,"" McCain said, ""but it was just that competitiveness coming out of me. I respect every other rookie in this league, but obviously I'm a believer in myself and so, yeah, some words definitely came out at that point."" The teams met Nov. 6 in Los Angeles, where the Clippers posted a comfortable 110-98 victory behind 26 points from Powell. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Ketron ""KC"" Shaw, who entered Saturday in the top 20 of Division I scorers at 22.3 points per game, went scoreless in the first half and finished with seven points on 2-of-11 shooting.  The Hawks canned just 22.1 percent of their shots from the floor.   Illinois broke out to a 6-0 lead in the first 2:06, then missed its next six shots.

Sampson scored on a 14-yard TD run early in the second quarter for the game's first points to deliver his 22nd TD of tje season to break the Tennessee single-season mark set by Gene McEvers in 1929. Iamaleava was 15 of 20 for 173 yards for Tennessee (9-2), while Bru McCoy caught a pair of TD passes and Squirrel White and Ethan Davis each had a TD reception. Tennessee moved its all-time record to 2-0 against the Miners, also having blanked the Conference USA school 24-0 in 2018. Jermod McCoy and John Slaughter had interceptions for the Volunteers, while Dominic Bailey recovered a fumble to set up a score. Skyler Locklear was 10-of-19 passing for 50 yards with an interception for UTEP (2-9), while rushing for 37 yards on eight carries. JP Pickles also had a turn at QB for the Miners and was 10 of 15 for 72 yards. Kenny Odom had eight receptions for 70 yards. Both defenses set the tone in the first quarter. The UTEP defense allowed just one first down to the Southeastern Conference team in three ugly series in the opening quarter and only 22 yards.  In the second quarter, Sampson ended a 68-yard drive by dashing up the middle for 14 yards for the record-setting score to take a 7-0 lead with 13:22 remaining before halftime.  After Bailey's fumble recovery, Iamaleava flipped a screen pass that White took 9 yards to the end zone nearly six minutes later.  Davis put the Volunteers up 21-0 when he grabbed a short pass for a 1-yard TD. Iamaleava then found Bru McCoy from 18 yards with eight seconds left in the second quarter for a 28-0 halftime lead.  McCoy caught his second TD and Peyton Lewis rushed for a pair for a 49-0 lead in the third quarter, but the biggest roar from Volunteers fans came when it was announced Florida beat No. 9 Ole Miss 24-17, to enhance the Volunteers' College Football Playoff hopes. Cameron Seldon's 3-yard run capped the scoring as the Volunteers finished the season undefeated at home for the second time in four years. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Seminoles (2-9) convincingly snapped a six-game losing streak and ensured that the Buccaneers (1-11) would finish theirs on a 10-game skid. Florida State has not had much to celebrate during one of its worst seasons in program history. But on Saturday, the Seminoles overcame a rough start and put together one of their more complete efforts of the season. Florida State had not scored more than 21 points in a game prior to Saturday's contest and its 175 rushing yards more than doubled its average (80.5 per game) this season. No single runner had over 40 yards, but seven rushers combined for that output on 34 attempts. The Seminoles entered the game ranked 130th out of 133 FBS teams in rushing offense. Holmes, a senior, finished with three carries for 38 yards, including touchdown runs of 3 and 18 yards. Kromenhoek gave Florida State a sliver of hope for its quarterback future as he completed 13 of 20 passes for 209 yards and no interceptions. He threw TD passes for Amaree Williams, Ja'Khi Douglas and Hykeem Williams. The highlight was a 71-yard touchdown pass to Douglas on the first play from scrimmage of the second half to put the Seminoles ahead 24-0. Douglas finished with 82 yards receiving on three catches, and 10 different Florida State players caught passes for 240 total yards. The Seminoles went 6 of 10 on third downs after averaging only a 25 percent conversion rate all season. Their defense held Charleston Southern to 275 total yards (57 rushing) and forced two turnovers. Florida State was unable to hang on to the shutout, however, as Bucs quarterback Kaleb Jackson found Landon Sauers for a 7-yard touchdown pass with 57 seconds left in the fourth quarter. Jackson completed 22 of 32 passes for 218 yards, one touchdown and one interception.  The Bucs defense recorded three sacks led by Davion Williams, who had eight tackles, 2.5 tackles for loss and one sack. The Seminoles will conclude their season next Saturday at home against rival Florida. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Bryant's dramatic catch came after Illinois initially decided to attempt a go-ahead 57-yard field goal into the wind. Following a timeout, the Ilini went for it on fourth down. Altmeyer's two-point conversion attempt to Bryant was incomplete, but the visitors recorded a safety on the game's final play.

Lewis Hamilton finished second to give Mercedes the top two positions. Given the turmoil surrounding the team — Hamilton moves to Ferrari next year — and the disappointment of not contending for the constructors' championship, Mercedes at least had this night. Even if some of that spotlight was shared with Max Verstappen, who clinched his fourth consecutive title, doing just enough with a fifth-place finish. This is the first time since the 2022 race in Brazil that Mercedes went 1-2, that being the same order with Russell and then Hamilton.  Team principal Toto Wolff said Mercedes could carry over this success to next weekend’s race at Qatar because the weather and track are similar. He was less optimistic about the season finale at Abu Dhabi. But that’s for another day. He was happy to celebrate what Mercedes accomplished on this night, but unlike Russell, Wolff was following through on his plan to return to Los Angeles on Sunday and be with his family. “It’s good to come back with a 1-2, and I’m happy with the way we got there because we dominated the race,"" Wolff said. ""There are laps when we were two seconds faster and it feels good.” Brazil in '22 was Russell's only victory until this season when he won in Austria in June. He's considered a three-time winner because his July victory in Belgium resulted in disqualification for failing the car's minimum-weight limit in the post-race inspection. Hamilton, instead, was given the victory. Otherwise, that also would've been a top-two finish for Mercedes. Of Hamilton's F1-record 105 victories, his first with Mercedes occurred nearly 10 years ago to the day. He had the car capable of racing to win No. 106, putting together the best practice times before stumbling in the third and final qualifying run Friday night. That landed him 10th on the starting line. “I guess it would've been a breeze today (with a better starting position), but it's OK,” Hamilton said. “I had fun coming back from 10th. The team did a fantastic job. We don't know why we are so quick this weekend.” Wolff said he was impressed how Hamilton fought his way through the field for such a strong finish. But next year, Hamilton will be on another team, and Wolff will be searching for ways to keep him off the podium. In the post-race news conference, Hamilton deflected any disappointment about what could've been and instead heaped praise on the winner. “George did a great job,” Hamilton said. “He did everything you're supposed to do. I'm happy for him, and I'm just grateful I could get back up there and support the team like I want to.” Russell showed what he was capable of accomplishing in Las Vegas by securing the pole though he said starting first hasn't always been beneficial to him. It was this time. “I think we won the race from step one,” Russell said. “It was exceptional and I knew from there on in ... the only way we were going to lose the victory was if I (damaged) the tires. So it was just a case of managing my pace ... and bringing it home.” ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

And another eagle-birdie finish — for the second straight day — made it happen. Thitikul claimed the record-setting $4 million first-place check by winning the CME Group Tour Championship on Sunday. It's the biggest money prize in women’s golf history, bigger than even the winner’s shares in three of the four men’s major championships this year. “Today, standing here with the trophy, it's more than I can ask for,” Thitikul said. Thitikul shot a 7-under 65 on Sunday and finished the week at 22 under, one shot ahead of Angel Yin (66). Yin had a two-shot lead walking to the 17th tee, only to wind up settling for the $1 million runner-up check. Yin — who missed the start of the season after breaking her leg over the winter — hardly sounded defeated after finishing second and more than doubling her 2024 earnings in four days. “I’m pretty awesome. ... I’ve learned that I just need to believe my myself and that’s what I did,"" Yin said. The win and the massive check came down to the 18th hole, Thitikul and Yin tied at 21 under after a back-and-forth day atop the leaderboard — both knowing a mistake would likely come at a $3 million cost. Both hit the fairway on 18. Thitikul’s approach was nearly perfect, stopping about 5 feet from the cup. Yin’s response stopped maybe 15 feet away, giving Thitikul the edge as they walked up the fairway. She was smiling broadly as she approached the green, almost as if she knew what was about to happen. Yin’s birdie putt just missed. Thitikul’s was dead center. And history was hers. Her plans for all that cash? “Definitely spend it,” Thitikul said. “That’s an honest answer, for sure. Definitely going to spend it for a little while.” She already had clinched a $1 million bonus this week through the Aon Risk-Reward Challenge, a competition based on how players score on a designated hole each week. In the end, it wound up as a whopping $5 million week for the 21-year-old from Thailand — and going 8 under on the Nos. 17 and 18 over the four days at Tiburon Golf Club made the difference. “All the hard work paid off,” said Thitikul, whose eagle-birdie close to Saturday's round pulled her into a tie for the lead with Yin going into Sunday at 15 under. It didn’t take long on Sunday for Thitikul to jump in front, with birdies on two of the first three holes to grab a two-shot edge. Her lead vanished with a two-shot swing on the par-4 fourth; Yin made birdie, Thitikul bogey. It seemed like Yin grabbed control on the par-3 16th. Her birdie putt from across the green — about 25 feet — rolled in for a two-shot lead with two holes to play. But her second shot at the par-5 17th missed the green right, and the door was opened for Thitikul. The eagle-birdie finish Saturday gave her hope. The eagle-birdie finish Sunday gave her so much more — even though, it turns out, the second shot on the par 5 wasn't one that she caught flush. It worked out anyway. “Just lucky enough,” Thitikul said. Olympic gold medalist Lydia Ko (63) finished third at 17 under, her nine birdies coming in a 13-hole span. “I’m excited to be able to work hard this offseason and have another great 2025,” Ko said. Ruoning Yin (68) was alone in fourth at 16 under, and LPGA player of the year Nelly Korda (66) finished at 15 under along with Narin An (68). Ayaka Furue finished at 13 under, good enough to give her the Vare Trophy as the LPGA’s season-long scoring champion over Haeran Ryu. “I feel very happy to have this trophy in my hands,” said Furue, the first Japanese player to win the Vare. Lexi Thompson — a 15-time winner as a pro who plans to step away from full-time golf — finished at 2 under. It’s not clear how often Thompson plans to play in 2025 and beyond; that said, she returns to Tiburon the week of Dec. 9 for the Grant Thornton Invitational, where she’ll team with Rickie Fowler in the event featuring PGA Tour and LPGA Tour players. “I’m not going anywhere, guys.” Thompson said. “I’ll be back in two weeks.” There were two players who said they were retiring after Sunday’s round: Marina Alex, who shot 66 to finish at 12 under, and Ally Ewing, who closed with a 68 to wrap up the week at 11 under. “I’m happy to have ended on my best,” said Alex, a bottle of sparkling wine in her right hand, a bouquet of flowers in the other. Added Ewing: “I’ve been at peace with my decision. It’s just so nice to be able to share the walk with my family this week.” But in the end, the week belonged to Thitikul. And as the sun was setting over Tiburon on Sunday, she was ready for her offseason to begin with a well-deserved celebration. “Anybody hungry?” she asked. “I am.” With Sunday's check in her pocket, she can dine anywhere she wants for a while. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Rookie Alexandre Sarr and Bilal Coulibaly each had 17 for the Wizards, who have now lost 11 in a row and have the NBA's worst record at 2-13. Sarr also had a game-high 14 rebounds. Bennedict Mathurin had 16 points, Moses Brown 15 and T.J. McConnell 12 for the Pacers. Wizards: The visitors won't take much solace in staying close for much of the game because another loss in a losing streak is just that, but there were positives amid the setback and the Wizards can build on them with six of their next eight at home. Pacers: After not playing well defensively for the past three games, allowing 129.6 points per conest, the finish qualified as modest improvement as Indiana allowed just 16 fourth-quarter points. Now 5-3 at home, the team needs to figure out how to win on the road, where it is 2-8. Indiana went on a 7-2 run in a span of about four minutes to build a 105-98 lead with 4:53 remaining. Washington missed six shots during the stretch and was unable to close the gap in the final minutes. Brown, signed last week, scored Indiana's first eight points and had 11 in the first quarter. The 25-year-old New Yorker is playing for his eighth team in six seasons. The Pacers play host to New Orleans on Monday night and the Wizards play host to Chicago on Tuesday night. __ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
ABC News: Sports,Players allege embattled ex-Oregon State volleyball coach used same abusive tactics in Australia,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/players-allege-embattled-oregon-state-volleyball-coach-same-116209548,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 13:22:43 -0500",Reporting by The Associated Press about abusive culture in Oregon State&rsquo;s volleyball program led to an outpouring of similar stories from the coach&rsquo;s homeland of Australia,"Reporting by The Associated Press about abusive culture in Oregon State’s volleyball program led to an outpouring of similar stories from the coach’s homeland of Australia Reporting by The Associated Press about abusive culture in Oregon State's volleyball program led to an outpouring of similar stories from the coach's homeland of Australia, where a four-year process led officials there to apologize to athletes who had played in his program. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation published a story Saturday quoting players who read the AP reporting in 2020 about Oregon State's Mark Barnard and, according to one, felt ""it was like reading one of our own training sessions.” “I just started shaking, my heart started racing,” one player, Selina Scoble, told ABC. Scoble said her difficulties on the team “snowballed into depression and bulimia, and I have a lot of shame and guilt around that.” The AP investigation cited more than a dozen players who told of an abusive culture at Oregon State. Among their allegations were that Barnard, who left the program in 2022, pitted players against each other in team meetings while he was there and pushed them past health warnings in practice as punishment. The so-called coach-on-one drills the Oregon State players described — in which coaches make players dive after difficult-to-retrieve balls they throw — were the same drills Barnard ran as both an assistant, then later the head coach at what was then Australia's nascent women's volleyball program being run by the country's Institute of Sport. “On any given day, we were fearful for our physical being, for our emotional being,” Elizabeth Brett, one of the first players recruited to the Australian team, told ABC. Brett quit volleyball after the 2000 Sydney Olympics, where the Aussie women finished ninth. “I still don’t sleep on Sunday nights,” Brett said. “That physiological response stayed with me and the anxiety around it.” ABC said the day after the AP report came out, Volleyball Australia, which oversees elite and Olympic volleyball in the country, published a letter of support for Barnard on its Facebook page, and that the letter galvanized the players and motivated them to speak up. “That post itself was infuriating for the group, because it was without any consultation with any of the past players,” said one of the players, Rowena Morgan. Morgan described Barnard as a coach who could diffuse situations when he served as an assistant but said his personality changed once he became the man in charge. “He would yell abuse and nothing was good enough,” Morgan told ABC. “You know: ‘You’re (expletive) useless. You’re weak. If you played any other sport, you’d never get anywhere. You’re pathetic. You disgust me.’ That sort of thing.” The players' outpouring triggered a review by Sports Integrity Australia, which included interviews with 27 participants, including medical staff, and 16 written submissions. The review, completed in 2022, found the program from 1997-2005 fostered a culture of fear and punishment, unacceptable training practices, an inadequate complaints-handling procedure, a lack of coach accountability and limited athlete support. It took two more years for Volleyball Australia to issue a public apology to the players. Without mentioning Barnard or Brad Saindon, who served as head coach of the Aussie program before him, with Barnard as his assistant, the apology acknowledged the former players suffered through “an environment of fear."" As part of the AP reporting, Oregon State disputed allegations that players were pushed past their physical limits as punishment and said “appropriate action was taken” after an internal investigation into Barnard's program. The OSU players said they never felt heard by the university and that their complaints were either swept under the rug or not looked into appropriately. Two of the players who spoke to the AP said they considered suicide. One of them, upon reading the first AP story in the series, said she “genuinely thought the article was written about me,” even thought it was about a different player. Both those players were among more than a dozen who quit or transferred from the Oregon State program during Barnard's tenure, with some saying they were forced out. The coach, who came to Oregon State as an assistant in 2005, then went 70-132 over seven seasons as head coach, left the school after the 2022 season. The school thanked him for his “long-time commitment to our athletic department” but made no mention of the abuse allegations. Barnard did not immediately return messages left by the AP seeking his comment about the ABC report. Saindon told ABC, “I’m not that kind of a coach, I’ve never done that in my whole coaching career, let alone to the young women on the national team in Australia.” After the first two AP stories were published, Oregon State went to court to fight the AP's efforts to obtain documents related to Barnard's case. The AP received a favorable ruling from the local district attorney when it first pressed for the documents, but the university spent more than two years fighting the disclosure. Oregon State ultimately paid the AP’s legal fees in exchange for AP agreeing to drop the request. During the legal wrangling, Oregon State spokesman Steve Clark said the school fought the disclosure because if records were released, it ""would have a chilling effect and potentially stymie people with concerns from ever reporting allegations of wrongdoing.” ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
ABC News: Sports,Cavaliers' unexpected 17-1 start to season also produces unexpected star: reserve guard Ty Jerome,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/cavaliers-unexpected-17-1-start-season-produces-unexpected-116214920,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 16:02:48 -0500",The M-V-P chants weren't only directed at Cleveland All-Star Donvan Mitchell on Sunday night,"The M-V-P chants weren't only directed at Cleveland All-Star Donvan Mitchell on Sunday night CLEVELAND -- As the Cavaliers were pushing their home record to 10-0 and improving the franchise's historic start to an eye-popping 17-1, a solitary voice rose from the seats that could be heard throughout the lower bowl of Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse. ""M-V-P! M-V-P!” the lone fan chanted. Down on the floor, Donovan Mitchell noticed. However, it wasn't directed at the five-time All-Star, but a teammate shooting free throws. Later, Ty Jerome wanted proof it happened. ""Did you get it on video?” the reserve guard asked. Cleveland's unexpected start has produced an unexpected rising star. After missing all but two games last season with a severe ankle injury that dragged on and required surgery, Jerome has not only become an invaluable piece for first-year Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson but is emblematic of the team's early-season success. This wasn't expected — not by the Cavs and certainly not by Jerome. “He's in this zone,” Atkinson said of the 27-year-old Jerome, already with his fourth NBA team. “It's phenomenal.” While he's been good from the jump this season, Jerome has taken his game to another level this past week. One night after the Cavs lost in Boston after 15 straight wins, Jerome made seven 3-pointers — two on Steph Curry-like heat checks just inside the halfcourt logo — in the first half and finished with a career-high 29 points in a win over New Orleans. For an encore on Sunday, he matched Mitchell, his longtime friend and boyhood teammate in New York, with 26 points and six assists as the Cavs downed Toronto. That performance prompted the MVP chant from the fan who once reserved the somewhat sarcastic salute for popular Cavs sub Cedi Osman. Jerome has a been a marvel since the beginning of training camp, when he made a first impression on Atkinson that has only grown stronger. “Since the moment he stepped in our gym,” Atkinson said when asked how long he knew Jerome would be a major contributor this season. “He’s been phenomenal every day. I mean, (general manager) Koby (Altman) jokes about MVP of August, September, October. We're all expecting, not expecting, but when is it going to start dipping? ""OK, it’s open gym. OK, it’s training camp. OK, first five games. He just keeps going and it's a real, real credit to him. He’s just in a state of grace right now. It’s beautiful to watch.” The same could be said for the Cavs, whose burst from the gate under Atkinson is one of the league's best stories. The 57-year-old Atkinson, an affable, fast-talking hoops junkie from Long Island, has made Cleveland an offensive powerhouse. The Cavs lead the league in virtually every statistical category — points, field-goal percentage, 3-point percentage, point differential and offensive rating. It's a system based on pace, ball movement and fundamentals and it's hard to defend. “A chaotic environment with standard principles,” Atkinson said. Atkinson is getting the best from Cleveland's core four of players — Mitchell, Darius Garland, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen — while also developing his bench, something predecessor J.B. Bickerstaff struggled to do. Jerome, who played on Virginia's national championship team in 2019, gives Atkinson a multi-skilled player capable on both ends of the floor. He's come off the bench to provide points or a key assist, and Atkinson deploys him defensively to pester point guards. “It's hard to take him out of the game,” Atkinson said. ""He’s in every conversation at all times. ‘Do we need Ty in there?’ He’s playing phenomenally.” Mitchell isn't surprised. He's goes way back with Jerome, playing with him on a Riverside (N.Y.) Hawks youth team coached by Jerome's dad. “His dad used to cuss us out at 8 years old,” Mitchell said with a smile. “I tell people all the time that I don’t like positive reinforcement. I think it’s just PTSD from my AAU days with his pops. Getting chewed out at 9 a.m. definitely is something that you don’t forget.” Mitchell also finds it funny that Jerome's comeback is getting such attention. “Y’all be saying that like he died and came back to life,” Mitchell said. ”For him to come back, not only be a solid player, but be dominant, be a special player for us, it kind of gives us life. He’s just done so much for us on a nightly basis, and I have no doubt he’ll continue to keep this up.” The Cavs figure to come back to the pack at some point. But a season that began with them considered a contender has turned into become something more. “17-1,” Atkinson said Sunday, reminded of his team's record. ""It's like, wow. I’ve been in his league 17 years and it just doesn’t happen. You should have six, seven losses. You could be .500 at this point. Even in a game like tonight, you lose these games. ""We’re not exactly on top of our game and we still come up with a ‘W.’ It’s pretty shocking where we are, and that’s not to disparage anybody. It’s more about how hard this league is to do that.” ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

For the first time in 11 years, the 85-year-old patriarch of the Harbaugh family has to be a neutral observer with Jim’s Los Angeles Chargers hosting John’s Baltimore Ravens in the third matchup between the coaching brothers. Manning, more than anyone, knows the attention and conflicting emotions of these games. He had to go through it three times when his sons, quarterbacks Peyton and Eli Manning, faced off. Peyton won all three meetings over Eli and the New York Giants, first with the Indianapolis Colts in 2006 and ’10, and then with the Denver Broncos in 2013. At least Manning and his wife, Olivia, had something to root for during those games — the offenses of both teams their sons were leading. Jack and Jackie Harbaugh can’t get that since the head coaches are responsible for all the players. ""The first thing is you’re proud because it is pretty unique. The second thing is, you don’t like it,"" Archie Manning said during a phone call. ""You’re proud that both are in the National Football League, but you just assume it wouldn’t happen. It wasn’t fun. I guess we were lucky it happened only three times. Heck, they could have been in the same division and done it 20 times."" Jack Harbaugh didn’t do interviews this week. He said that, leading up to Super Bowl 47, he appreciated hearing from Manning before it happened the first time in 2011 when Jim’s San Francisco 49ers visited John’s Baltimore squad. The Ravens won that game 16-6. John received even more bragging rights the following season after the Ravens’ 34-31 victory in New Orleans on Feb. 3, 2013, on football’s ultimate stage.  Before the first “Harbaugh Bowl,” Archie Manning offered Jack Harbaugh some advice — “It will be over soon enough.” Jack and Jackie Harbaugh attended the first two meetings, but will not be at Monday’s game. Instead, they will be at their daughter Joanie’s house in Bradenton, Florida, for Thanksgiving and to celebrate their 63rd wedding anniversary. Chargers defensive analyst Rick Minter went up against Jack Harbaugh before getting to coach with both sons. John Harbaugh was on Minter’s staff at the University of Cincinnati and has been on Jim Harbaugh’s staffs at Michigan and the Chargers when his son, Jesse, was hired as defensive coordinator. “Both sons are so tuned into their father with great respect. He’s passed (the game) down in so many ways to them, but they still look to him for advice,” Minter said. “Jack still does it where he watches game films (of the Ravens and Chargers) and writes up reports. “Jack is a crowd-pleasing speaker. He’s excitable and emotional, and he brings it out and gets his message across. I don’t know if Jack and John are either one. They are more modern, less authoritative and more connective, collaborative and well-spoken and all those types of things.” The Harbaughs, though, aren’t the only connections in this matchup. Five assistant coaches on Jim Harbaugh’s staff — including offensive coordinator Greg Roman and Jesse Minter — also coached for John Harbaugh in Baltimore. Chargers general manager Joe Hortiz spent 26 seasons in the Ravens front office before coming to Los Angeles when Jim Harbaugh returned to the NFL earlier this year.  Roman, who has been an assistant for Jim Harbaugh for seven years at Stanford, San Francisco, and the Chargers, along with five seasons with John Harbaugh in Baltimore, said the feeling going into Monday night has been the same as any other game on the schedule. Roman was asked again this past week to point out the differences between the two brothers, but he pointed out the similarities. “I learned a lot from both of them. Every brother and sister, everybody’s different, you know. So it’s an interesting juxtaposition if you will,” he said. “But very similar in a lot of ways and just a little different nuances with each. But they’re very strong leaders.”  Six players, including running backs J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards, are also former Ravens. Linebacker Kyle Van Noy was with the Chargers during the 2022 season, while backup quarterback Josh Johnson (San Diego) and outside linebacker David Ojabo (Michigan) played for Jim Harbaugh in college. The Chargers (7-3) have a four-game winning streak.  The Ravens (7-4) entered the weekend trailing the Steelers by a game in the AFC North and also can’t afford to fall behind in the wild-card race.  “It’s going to be different but fun because it is two similar type ballclubs hashing it out,” said Chargers safety and former Raven Tony Jefferson. “It is two physical teams on both sides of the ball and dynamic players at quarterback. It lines up to be a good matchup, and that’s what you strive for in games, especially prime time.” ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

ABC News: Sports,St. Louis Blues fire Drew Bannister and hire Jim Montgomery as coach,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/st-louis-blues-fire-drew-bannister-hire-jim-116177098,"Sun, 24 Nov 2024 17:30:16 -0500",The St. Louis Blues have fired coach Drew Bannister and hired Jim Montgomery as his replacement,"The St. Louis Blues have fired coach Drew Bannister and hired Jim Montgomery as his replacement Drew Bannister is out as coach of the St. Louis Blues after less than a full calendar year on the job. Jim Montgomery is back behind the bench of an NHL team five days after he was fired by the Boston Bruins. The Blues fired Bannister on Sunday and hired Montgomery as his replacement, a stunning move a quarter of the way through the NHL season that puts a seasoned coach in charge of shepherding St. Louis through a retooling period and into the potential re-opening of the organization's Stanley Cup-contending window.  President and general manager Doug Armstrong said he did not anticipate making a change until Montgomery became a free agent. “This was more of an opportunity to get someone of Jim’s caliber than anything else,” Armstrong said on a video call with reporters. “When I talked to Drew today I told him this was more of a decision based on the availability of someone I think is a top NHL coach, someone that we have experience with, someone I really do believe can coach this team and also coach the team when it reaches its ultimate level of competitiveness."" Armstrong showed no hesitation in cutting ties with Bannister, who had the interim tag removed from his title and became the full-time coach in May. Bannister was promoted from Springfield of the American Hockey League to replace 2019 Cup-winning coach Craig Berube last December, and the Blues missed the playoffs despite winning 30 of their final 54 games. The Blues lost 13 of their first 22 games this season. Only two teams have scored fewer than their 2.36 goals a game, and they rank in the bottom third of the league on the power play and penalty kill while ravaged by injuries. “It wasn’t an easy situation for him to walk into,” Armstrong said, adding he felt Bannister was learning on the fly as a first-time NHL head coach. “He was making mistakes. We were all making mistakes. ... I was more than willing to go through the peaks and valleys with Drew until Monty became available.” Montgomery, 55, is tasked with getting the most out of the talent available, something he has accomplished elsewhere. Every team he has coached for a full season has qualified for the playoffs, and his .659 points percentage ranks among the best in NHL history. “He’s got a wealth of experience, and he’s at really the prime of his coaching career,” Armstrong said. “He’s the full package, or at least we hope he’s the full package.” The Bruins opted to move on from Montgomery after their rough start, going 8-9-3, with the final defeat being a 5-1 home loss to Columbus. Boston won 120 of 184 regular-season games with Montgomery running the show, including setting the league records for victories and points in 2021-22 when he was the obvious choice for the Jack Adams Award as coach of the year. His second act as a head coach in the NHL came after Montgomery's first ended abruptly. Hired by the Dallas Stars in 2018, he led them to the second round and then was fired in December 2019 for unprofessional conduct. Montgomery called his dismissal appropriate, entered rehab and began putting his life back together.  “He’s obviously gone through things at the rink and away from the rink that defined who he is today,” Armstrong said.  Montgomery got his re-entry into hockey from the Blues, with Armstrong hiring Montgomery as an assistant on Berube's staff in September 2020. That was the first sign of the longtime executive's affinity for Montgomery, and the latest comes with job security. St. Louis signed him to a five-year contract. Montgomery is the latest coach to be fired and re-hired midseason, a more common occurrence in the NHL than most professional sports leagues. Being out of a job for mere days is reminiscent of Bruce Boudreau's experience in 2011, when he was fired by Washington on a Monday morning and replaced Randy Carlyle in Anaheim later that week. This is the 23rd coaching change among the league's 32 teams since January 2023, with the Blues among those making multiple moves in that time. “A coach that I believe is a difference-maker became available, and we reacted to it,” Armstrong said. “We have a top-level NHL coach, and now it’s time for all of us to do our jobs and support him.” ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

An assistant with the Blues from 2020-22, Montgomery is overjoyed to be back with St. Louis. “Crazy — there’s no other word for it,” the 55-year-old said less than a week after he was fired by the Boston Bruins and hired by St. Louis to replace Drew Bannister. “I have worked with over half this lineup already, and I know how committed they are. For me, this was a no-brainer for me to come back home."" The Blues — who missed the playoffs last season after Bannister took over for 2019 Stanley Cup-winning coach Craig Berube in December — have work to do. They started the season 9-12-1, only two teams have scored less than their 2.36 goals a game and they rank in the bottom third of the league on the power play and penalty kill. Montgomery guided the Bruins to a record-setting 65-win, 135-point season in 2022-23 and was named coach of the year. When he became available, Blues president and general manager Doug Armstrong pounced. “When you get a phone call and you hear Doug Armstrong’s plan and how you’re a big part of it, that makes you feel it is the right place to go,"" Montgomery said. “The best line that put his hooks into me is, ‘When something delicious falls on my plate, I eat.’ I don't know. I guess I was a T-bone that day."" Every NHL team Montgomery has coached for a full season has qualified for the playoffs, and his .659 points percentage ranks among the best in league history. “I believe in this group,"" Montgomery said. “It’s not easy to make the playoffs in this league. Half the teams miss it. But I do think that in time this is a caliber playoff team.” Blues players reacted positively to the coaching change. “He’s detailed and structured, but at the same time he lets guys play hockey,"" captain Brayden Schenn said. “He’s a guy you want to play hard for who has had success in this league.” Robert Thomas, a first-round draft pick by St. Louis in 2017 now in his seventh season with the Blues, said he was sorry to see Bannister go but happy the energetic Montgomery was back as head coach. “He was a huge help for me and someone I really relied on a couple of years ago,"" Thomas said. “He’s someone a lot of us have a ton of respect for. He's got a big personality.” The Bruins fired Montgomery last Tuesday after losing 12 of their first 20 games. Boston won 120 of 184 regular-season games with Montgomery behind the bench, though its playoff success was limited to a first-round series win over Toronto last spring. His first NHL coaching job, with the Dallas Stars, ended when was fired in December 2019 for unprofessional conduct. Armstrong hired Montgomery in September 2020 to serve on Berube's staff. Now he gave his new coach a fresh, five-year contract and the expectation of trying to help St. Louis get back into the league's elite tier. “He’s one of those coaches that I really do believe can be with this team now and as it grows,” Armstrong said Sunday. “The proof of that is the five-year commitment. One of the things I think is the next part for Jim’s career is to get that longevity in one spot.” Leaving the Bruins after success in Boston wasn't easy, but Montgomery said he immediately chose a positive mindset. “I’m a firm believer that when one door closes, another one opens if you do the right thing,"" he said. “It’s about your relationships in life. ... The five-year deal shows the commitment of Tom Stillman and the ownership group, that we are in this together.” ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

ABC News: Sports,Judge rejects request to sideline transgender college volleyball player,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/judge-rejects-request-sideline-san-jose-state-volleyball-116213995,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 17:37:51 -0500",The ruling comes in a suit filed by nine players challenging league policies.,"The ruling comes in a suit filed by nine players challenging league policies. A judge on Monday rejected a request to block a San Jose State women’s volleyball team member from playing in a conference tournament on grounds that she is transgender. The ruling by U.S. Magistrate Judge S. Kato Crews in Denver will allow the player, who has played all season, to compete in the Mountain West Conference women’s championship opening this week in Las Vegas.  The ruling comes in a lawsuit filed by nine current players against the Mountain West Conference challenging the league’s policies for allowing transgender players to participate. The players argued that letting her compete was a safety risk and unfair. While some media have reported those and other details, neither San Jose State nor the forfeiting teams have confirmed the school has a trans woman volleyball player. The Associated Press is withholding the player’s name because she has not commented publicly on her gender identity. School officials also have declined an interview request with the player.  Crews' ruling referred to the athlete as an “alleged transgender” player and noted that no defendant disputed that the San Jose State roster includes a transgender woman player.  San Jose State will ""continue to support its student-athletes and reject discrimination in all forms,"" the university said in a statement, confirming that all its student-athletes are eligible to participate under NCAA and conference rules. “We are gratified that the Court rejected an eleventh-hour attempt to change those rules. Our team looks forward to competing in the Mountain West volleyball tournament this week."" The conference did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The players filed a notice for emergency appeal with the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Crews said the players who filed the complaint could have sought relief much earlier, noting the individual universities had acknowledged that not playing their games against San Jose State this season would result in a loss in league standings. He also refused a request to re-seed the tournament without the forfeited losses. The judge said injunctions are meant to preserve the status quo. The conference policy regarding forfeiting for refusing to play against a team with a transgender player had been in effect since 2022 and the San Jose State player has been on the roster since 2022 -– making that the status quo. The player competed at the college level three previous seasons, including two for San Jose State, drawing little attention. This season’s awareness of her reported identity led to an uproar among some players, pundits, parents and politicians in a major election year. Crews' ruling also said injunctions are meant to prevent harm, but in this case, he argued, the harm has already occurred. The games have been forfeited, the tournament has been seeded, the teams have made travel plans and the participants have confirmed they're playing. The tournament starts Wednesday and continues Friday and Saturday. Colorado State is seeded first and San Jose State, second. The teams split their regular-season matches and both get byes into Friday's semifinals.  San Jose State will play the winner of Wednesday's match between Utah State and Boise State — teams that both forfeited matches to SJSU during the regular season. The conference tournament winner gets an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. San Jose State coach Todd Kress, whose team has not competed in the national tournament since 2001, has said his team has been getting “messages of hate” and that has taken a toll on his players. Several teams refused to play against San Jose State during the season, earning losses in the official conference standings. Boise State and Wyoming each had two forfeits while Utah State and Nevada both had one. Southern Utah, a member of the Western Athletic Conference, was first to cancel against San Jose State this year. Nevada’s players stated they “refuse to participate in any match that advances injustice against female athletes,” without elaborating. Nevada did not qualify for the conference tournament. The nine current players and others now suing the Mountain West Conference, the California State University Board of Trustees and others include San Jose State senior setter and co-captain Brooke Slusser. The teammate Slusser says is transgender hits the volleyball with more force than others on the team, raising fear during practices of suffering concussions from a head hit, the complaint says. The Independent Council on Women’s Sports is funding a separate lawsuit against the NCAA for allowing transgender women to compete in women’s sports.  Both lawsuits claim the landmark 1972 federal antidiscrimination law known as Title IX prohibits transgender women in women’s sports. Title IX prohibits sexual discrimination in federally funded education; Slusser is a plaintiff in both lawsuits. Several circuit courts have used a U.S. Supreme Court ruling to conclude that discriminating against someone based on their transgender status or sexual orientation is sex-based discrimination, Crews wrote. That means case law does not prove the “likelihood of success” needed to grant an injunction. An NCAA policy that subjects transgender participation to the rules of sports governing bodies took effect this academic year. USA Volleyball says a trans woman must suppress testosterone for 12 months before competing. The NCAA has not flagged any issues with San Jose State. The Republican governors of Idaho, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming have made public statements in support of the team cancellations, citing fairness in women’s sports. President-elect Donald Trump likewise has spoken out against allowing transgender women to compete in women’s sports. Crews was a magistrate judge in Colorado’s U.S. District Court for more than five years before President Joe Biden appointed him as a federal judge in January. ___ Gruver reported from Cheyenne, Wyoming, and Hanson from Helena, Montana.  24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Instead, the three-time Super Bowl MVP cut back inside and raced another 23 yards up the field, helping to set up Spencer Schrader's 31-yard field goal as time expired as the Chiefs held on to beat the Carolina Panthers 30-27 on Sunday. “At that point, yards are more important than getting out of bounds,” Mahomes said. “With three timeouts, I just tried to just cut through and Justin Watson had a great block and was able to get down the field and get out of bounds.” The game-winning drive was the 21st of Mahomes' career, and the Chiefs won a game decided in the final seconds for the fifth time this season. Eight of the Chiefs' wins have come by one-score margins. “You always want to have some blowouts and be a little calmer in the fourth quarter, but I've always said it could be a good thing when you get to the playoffs later in the season knowing that you have been in those moments before, and knowing how to attack it play by play not making it too big of a moment,” Mahomes said. Then he smiled and said: “But I would say this more than anybody, I would love to win a game not by the very last play.” Mahomes completed 27 of 37 passes for 269 yards and three touchdowns in his first game at Bank of America Stadium and ran for 60 yards — including 33 on that last-minute play — as the Chiefs (10-1) scored on six of their eight possessions. Noah Gray caught four passes for 66 yards and scored two touchdowns for the second straight week, and DeAndre Hopkins also found the end zone for the two-time defending Super Bowl champions. Kareem Hunt ran for 68 yards on 16 carries and caught three passes for 19 yards.  Bryce Young played well for Carolina (3-8), finishing 21 of 35 for 262 yards and a touchdown while leading the Panthers back from an 11-point deficit in the fourth quarter to tie the game on Chuba Hubbard's 1-yard touchdown run and 2-point conversion with 1:46 remaining. Panthers coach Dave Canales, who benched Young earlier this season for veteran Andy Dalton, said last year's No. 1 overall draft pick “absolutely” will remain the team's starting QB next week. That's a break from Canales' recent pattern of waiting a few days to name a starter. “Bryce is certainly making the most of his opportunities,” Canales said. “And he is making a statement to all of us. Showing us he can make plays in critical areas. He did a great job extending today.” Said Young: “For me, I just want to focus on what I can control. Regardless, I always have the same mindset and preparation, wanting to be better throughout the week. I am definitely grateful for confidence.” Still, there is room for improvement. The Panthers moved the ball well but struggled in the red zone, resulting in field goals of 30, 32, 29 and 33 yards for Eddy Pineiro, the most accurate kicker in NFL history. The Chiefs wasted no time setting the tone as Samaje Perine returned the opening kickoff 56 yards and Mahomes found Gray for a 35-yard touchdown strike on the third play of scrimmage for a 7-0 lead. Gray went nine games without a TD catch before hauling in two last week against Buffalo. His 11-yard score late in the second quarter gave him two more against the Panthers. Chiefs coach Andy Reid praised Mahomes' poise but said he was concerned about his team's nine penalties for 90 yards. Kansas City's Travis Kelce had six catches for 62 yards and moved into third place in career yards receiving by a tight end. He ranks behind only Tony Gonzalez and Jason Witten. However, Kelce failed to find the end zone for the ninth time in 11 games this season. Running back Jonathan Brooks made his NFL debut for Carolina, but the second-round pick was limited to 7 yards on two carries. Panthers: Rookie TE Ja'Tavion Sanders was taken to a hospital, where he was evaluated for a neck injury and released. He landed awkwardly on his head after making a catch near the end of the second quarter. Chiefs: Host Las Vegas on Friday.

Jaxon Smith-Njigba had six catches for 77 yards and the first offensive touchdown against the Cardinals (6-5) in three weeks. But it was the defense that made the difference for the Seahawks (6-5) against their division rivals, who had their four-game winning streak snapped. “I thought he was dominant,” Seattle coach Mike Macdonald said of Williams. “I knew he played great and then I looked at the stat line and I realized he played out of his mind.” Williams finished with six tackles and four quarterback hurries for Seattle, which has beaten Arizona six straight times. The teams play again in two weeks. The Cardinals averaged more than 29 points per game in their previous three, but the Seahawks held them to 298 total yards and 49 yards rushing while sacking Murray five times. Williams said the team has been coming together since a leadership meeting following their bye week two weeks ago. He said the Seahawks declared the remainder of the season a playoff run and he woke up Sunday feeling positive about the team. “I think that made it just crunch time for us,” Williams said. “We just understood the urgency of getting the job done.” Geno Smith threw for 254 yards with a touchdown pass and an interception for Seattle. Murray threw for 285 yards, and tight end Trey McBride had 12 catches for 133 yards. Seattle led 7-3 midway through the third quarter when Arizona went for it on fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks 40. Murray was flushed right, then threw the ball over defender Devon Witherspoon and his own receiver into the arms of Bryant, who dashed to the end zone for a 13-3 lead. “I don’t think I’ve ever run that fast,” said Bryant, who finished the score with a dive into the end zone that resembled Marshawn Lynch's “Beast Mode” celebration. “I know I’m going to get fined, so hopefully Marshawn saw it.” Murray drove the Cardinals to the Seattle 4 early in the fourth quarter, but Arizona settled for a 22-yard field goal by Chad Ryland. Arizona had converted 16 straight touchdowns in goal-to-go situations coming into the game. Ryland missed a field goal with about 40 seconds remaining that would have set up an onside kick try. “Obviously, it's a hostile environment,” Murray said. “We just didn’t execute, did not execute at a high enough level to win that game.” Smith-Njigba set up his touchdown when he took a pass on a shallow cross and sprinted downfield for a 46-yard gain to the Arizona 4. He scored two plays later on a 3-yard pass from Smith to the right side of the end zone, with a clear-out by DK Metcalf, for a 7-3 halftime lead. It was the first touchdown allowed by the Cardinals' defense since the fourth quarter against Miami three weeks ago. Arizona's James Conner, who entered with 697 yards rushing, was held to 8 yards on seven carries. It was Seattle's best defensive performance of the season under first-year coach Macdonald, who had lost his previous four home games. “Coach was in his bag this week,” Witherspoon said. The Seahawks prepared this week while dealing with the effects of a storm that knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of residents and team facilities. Some fans were still without power as more rain began to fall Sunday. “We were happy for the hot shower, I’m not gonna lie,” Witherspoon said. “Boy, it felt so good.” Both teams had apparent touchdowns overturned. Late in the first quarter, Williams appeared to complete a strip-sack of Murray that Tyrice Knight recovered and returned for a touchdown. A review determined Murray's arm was moving forward when Williams hit him, making it an incomplete pass. Murray hit Michael Wilson for an apparent 7-yard TD midway through the second, but Paris Johnson Jr. was flagged for holding. Later in the drive, an apparent completion to Marvin Harrison Jr. in the left front corner of the end zone was overturned because officials determined that he only got one foot down. Arizona settled for a field goal on that drive. Cardinals: Murray received trainers’ attention after he appeared to injure his shoulder on a hard hit in the fourth quarter, but never left the game. … DL Roy Lopez was helped off the field late in the fourth quarter. Seahawks: G Anthony Bradford was helped off the field in the first quarter with an apparent leg injury. Cardinals: At Minnesota next Sunday.

Bam Adebayo had 19 points and 11 rebounds, Tyler Herro had 18 points and 10 rebounds, Alec Burks scored 15 and Pelle Larsson added 14 for Miami.

The Mavericks played without Luka Doncic, still sidelined with a sprained right wrist. The Heat were without Terry Rozier, who was expected to play but wound up being scratched with a recurrence of right foot discomfort. Mavericks: Dallas has played 17 games this season — and 11 of them have been decided by eight points or less. The Mavericks are 4-7 in those close games, 5-1 in all others. Heat: Butler has scored at least 30 points in back-to-back games. It's the ninth time — including playoffs — that he's had a multi-game streak of scoring at least 30 since joining the Heat. Butler's dunk tied the game with 4.4 seconds left in regulation and the Heat unsuccessfully argued he was fouled by Lively on the play. Spencer Dinwiddie's desperation 3-point try for Dallas rimmed out as time expired and to overtime they went. Dinwiddie was 0 for 9 from 3-point range in the game.

The 76ers turned back the clock — “way back,” the public address announcer noted — wearing uniforms Sunday night designed to pay homage to their old home, the Spectrum. Their old players? Well, they hit Philly, too. Simmons, a former No. 1 pick once deemed a franchise cornerstone, returned Friday night with Brooklyn while Harden, now banging 3s with the Los Angeles Clippers, had his unceremonious homecoming Sunday night. Simmons and Harden each raised the promise of deep playoff runs — yes, even a championship — before their sensational starts with the Sixers disintegrated into toxic tenures full of ill will and, ultimately, a feeling of good riddance from all parties involved. Simmons and his shooting woes; Harden and his contract demands; no matter the symptoms for seasonal dysfunction through the years, the headache still pounds in Philadelphia. The malady these days: bad knees. Joel Embiid and Paul George, who signed $405 million worth of contracts in the offseason, remained pinned to the bench with knee injuries. George, a left knee bone bruise. Embiid, swelling in his left knee. Heck, even six-time All-Star Kyle Lowry (hip strain) sat out against the Clippers, left to watch the game wearing one of those goofy, oversized Philadelphia Eagles hats. “It’s certainly not ideal and not that easy to manage,” coach Nick Nurse said. “But it is part of the game. Guys come and go all the time. There’s guys in and out, both sides of the ball. Again, I’m always disappointed for the player.”  The public address announcer ran down the injury report — “Joel Embiid, Paul George and Kyle Lowry are out” — to a muted response from 76ers fans accustomed to sitting stars. If these walls could shrug. It’s easy for Sixers fans — and the front office — to wonder what could have been the franchise’s ceiling had Simmons or Harden stayed happy and healthy while they teamed with Embiid. George was just the latest star expected to help Embiid chase the 76ers’ first championship since 1983. Yet, the early returns have been dismal. George has played in just eight of 16 games; Embiid only four. Without them, the 76ers fell to 3-13 following a 125-99 loss to the Clippers.  Embiid, wearing an all-blue 76ers sweatshirt and sweatpants, shared a few quiet conversations with his teammates in the locker room. “Kept trying to keep his spirits high,” All-Star guard Tyrese Maxey said. “He loves basketball. He wants to play basketball every single day. If he could play all 82 games, every single game of the playoffs, I promise you, he would.” He doesn't, so Nurse, in his second season, does what he can and trotted out a starting lineup that included Kelly Oubre Jr. and Guerschon Yabusele in front of a crowd dotted with empty seats. The good news, Nurse said Embiid and George were both “progressing OK.” George, the nine-time All-Star, got in some work on the court on Saturday. Nurse said Embiid’s swelling was “looking better” ahead of more exams this week. Embiid’s season was a disaster since training camp. The 30-year-old Embiid skipped the entire preseason, was suspended for scuffling with a columnist, called out by teammates in a closed-door team meeting and has fallen out of favor with fans that have tired of his will-he-or-won’t-he-play melodrama. “As things go up and down, we’re all trying to keep things level,” Nurse said. “I think he has kept things pretty level. He’s been very communicative and seems to be OK. He understands that we’re trying to figure this out as we go here. He also understands the team’s not getting good results. So there is a lot to talk about.” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue was an assistant coach on the U.S. team that won gold in Paris and declined to enter the fray over Embiid's health at the Olympics. “I don’t know if he was supposed to be healthy or not,” Lue said. “He helped us win a gold medal, it’s all I know.” At least the Sixers announced Friday night that Embiid would miss the Clippers’ game, allowing fans to try and dump a pair of tickets on the secondary market for the price of a couple of coffeehouse chain drinks. Of note, rookie Jared McCain has about been worth the price of admission on those discount ducats. The Clippers, coming off a 4-0 homestand, played without Kawhi Leonard and other teams missing their All-Stars for reasons both fishy and fair are the norm around the league. The 76ers have no choice — much as they have since Embiid was drafted in 2014 — but to find a way around the absences. “Almost all the time,” Nurse said, “we need to try something.” ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
ABC News: Sports,Bo Nix sets Broncos rookie TD record as Denver beats reeling Raiders 29-19,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/bo-nix-sets-broncos-rookie-td-record-denver-116187089,"Sun, 24 Nov 2024 23:14:29 -0500","Bo Nix passed for 273 yards and had two touchdown passes to break the team&rsquo;s rookie record, and the Denver Broncos finally won in Las Vegas with a 29-19 victory over the reeling Raiders on Sunday","Bo Nix passed for 273 yards and had two touchdown passes to break the team’s rookie record, and the Denver Broncos finally won in Las Vegas with a 29-19 victory over the reeling Raiders on Sunday LAS VEGAS -- The music could clearly be heard outside the doors to the Broncos' locker room, the players inside truly enjoying finally getting to experience a victory in Las Vegas. Bo Nix passed for 273 yards and had two touchdown passes to break the team's rookie record Sunday, and Denver beat the reeling Raiders 29-19. The Broncos (7-5) took another step toward an unexpected playoff spot with their second victory in a row. “A year ago, we don't win that game,” Broncos coach Sean Payton said. “It wasn't our best, but it was good enough. We're on to the next one, so we have a lot to clean up, but it was good to handle these guys for a second time.” The Broncos won the first meeting 34-18 in Denver on Oct. 6 to end an eight-game losing streak to the Raiders. Las Vegas (2-9) has lost seven consecutive games, its longest skid since the 2017-18 seasons. “I never doubt the mindset of everybody in that locker room,” Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby said. “Everybody shows up every day with the mindset to get better, so that's all you can ask for.” Nix finished 25 of 42, and his 18-yard touchdown pass to Courtland Sutton in the third quarter broke the club rookie record of 14 TD passes set by Marlin Briscoe in 1968. Nix and Sutton later hooked up for a 2-yard TD with 5:30 left to give the Broncos a two-possession lead. Those plays helped erase a 13-9 halftime deficit. The Broncos outscored Las Vegas 20-6 in the second half after adjusting to the Raiders' willingness to repeatedly bring more pressure than anticipated. “We had to shift that mindset,” Nix said. “We went into the game expecting (some). We had some calls for it, so now we had to get to those and adjust to them. I thought we did a good job handling the pressure, getting some more 1-on-1s.” Denver lost its previous four games at Allegiant Stadium. This also was the Broncos' first road win in this series since defeating the then-Oakland Raiders on Oct. 11, 2015. “I think the tide is turning,” Sutton said. “The Broncos are in a spot where we want to be back in the AFC West, and I think that's a really exciting spot to be in. Job's not finished.” Sutton caught eight passes for 97 yards and two touchdowns to extend his streak of 70-yard games to five. That's the longest streak by a Broncos player since Demaryius Thomas' eight straight in 2014. Raiders quarterback Gardner Minshew landed hard on his left shoulder late in the game and was replaced by Desmond Ridder. Minshew will miss the rest of the season with a broken collarbone, according to multiple reports. Minshew completed 25 of 42 passes for 230 yards, with a touchdown and interception. The best passing play, however, came on a fake punt when AJ Cole completed a 34-yard pass to linebacker Divine Deablo to set up a second-quarter field goal. That was one of four field goals by Daniel Carlson, whose duel with Broncos counterpart Will Lutz kept Las Vegas in the game. They combined to make all nine of their attempts, including three from more than 50 yards. Jakobi Meyers caught 10 passes for 121 yards. That’s his best game since 2020, when Meyers played for the New England Patriots and caught 12 passes for 169 yards against the New York Jets. Crosby recorded his 100th tackle for loss in the second quarter, becoming the fourth player to reach that number since at least 1999 in his first six seasons. The others were J.J. Watt, Aaron Donald and DeMarcus Ware. The Raiders are a shell of themselves. They played this game without their top two running backs as well as two starters at cornerback, two on the defensive line and one at safety. “Credit Vegas,” Payton said. “They came out and had some fire about them, but they lost.” Raiders special teams coordinator Tom McMahon did not coach, but no reason was provided. Derius Swinton II handled those duties. Broncos: CB Riley Moss (knee) left the game late in the first half. DE Zach Allen (heel) didn't play. Raiders: RBs Alexander Mattison (ankle) and Zamir White (quadriceps) and CBs Nate Hobbs (ankle) and Jakorian Bennett (shoulder) did not play. Broncos: Host Cleveland on Monday, Dec. 2. Raiders: At Kansas City on Friday afternoon. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Amorim was talking on Sky Sports after United's 1-1 draw with Ipswich on Sunday when Sheeran walked up to embrace analyst Jamie Redknapp. The interview was paused before Redknapp told Sheeran to “come and say hello in a minute."" Sheeran is a lifelong Ipswich fan and holds a minority stake in the club. He was pictured celebrating after Omari Hutchinson's equalizing goal in the game at Portman Road. “Apologies if I offended Amorim yesterday, didn’t actually realize he was being interviewed at the time, was popping to say hi and bye to Jamie,” Sheeran wrote on his Instagram story Monday. Redknapp posted pictures on his Instagram account of Sheeran in the Sky studio with analysts Roy Keane and Izzy Christiansen, as well as presenter Kelly Cates. It was Amorim's first game since taking over at United and started in explosive fashion with Marcus Rashford scoring after two minutes. But the points were shared after Hutchinson's deflected effort. Last week, Ipswich CEO Mark Ashton said Sheeran had helped the club sign a new player in the offseason when taking a Zoom call with him just before going on stage with Taylor Swift. ___ James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

We’re seeing teams traverse the ebbs and flows of their expectations during lulls and high points. Players have stepped up in the absence of stars. There have been players we’d forgotten about getting signed just to help field a rotation. We’re already seeing teams fall apart right in front of our eyes. That massive gulf between the East and West? It’s still there! All of this, and a really fun second year of the NBA Cup, is happening so far. Advertisement Here’s your latest NBA Rewind! Teams like the Milwaukee Bucks and LA Clippers have been written off because of injuries or poor coaching (Doc Rivers, not Ty Lue) or just poor attention to detail. The Orlando Magic were briefly written off after Paolo Banchero went down. Now, we’re singing their praises while wondering what’s wrong with an Eastern Conference finalist and two teams now dealing with big injuries to major players. It’s the NBA Stock Report, extended addition! 📈 Milwaukee Bucks (8-9): Remember that one-point Bucks loss to Charlotte that Doc Rivers blamed solely on the refs because accountability is a myth? That’s the only thing keeping the Bucks from having won seven straight games. Instead, they’re at four straight wins and just about even on the season after starting 2-8. This is a big step forward for the Bucks, who have wins over Houston, Chicago and Indiana during this streak. Over the last seven games, the Bucks are ninth in offense and seventh in defense. The schedule doesn’t look like the toughest, but Milwaukee is still currently beating the teams in front of them. During this stretch, Giannis Antetokounmpo is averaging 33.4 points. 10.9 rebounds, 7.9 assists and shooting 60.8 percent from the field. GO DEEPER Antetokounmpo-Lillard combo finding its groove as 'vibes ... are high' after Bucks top Pacers 📉 Indiana Pacers (7-10): The Pacers are not in a good place. Remember that free-wheeling, historically high-powered offense from last season? It was the second-best offense in NBA history, only bested by last year’s Celtics. Remember Tyrese Haliburton playing like a mutated X-Men version of Steve Nash? He was averaging 23.8 points, 12.5 assists and just 2.5 turnovers with 49.7/40.3/86.8 shooting splits before his hamstring injury last season. All of that has normalized in a bad way. The Pacers are 16th in offense this season and have lost five of their last seven, and Haliburton still doesn’t look recovered from that hamstring injury. He’s currently averaging 15.8 points, 8.5 assists and 1.8 turnovers with putrid 37.8/30.7/83.3 shooting splits this season. Where have the Pacers gone? Advertisement 📈 LA Clippers (11-7): Don’t look now, but the Clippers have become a defensive juggernaut over the last week. Actually, I don’t know why I’m telling you not to look now. Clearly, this is something I deem noteworthy and think you should look at. Hey, look! The Clippers have become a defensive juggernaut over the last week! After a rough defensive road trip, the Clippers have limited the Jazz to 105 points, the Warriors to 99, the Magic to 93, the Kings to 88, and what’s left of the Sixers to 99. All wins. The Clippers put up an unbelievable 98.4 defensive rating during that five-game stretch. For a reference point, the Thunder have the best defensive rating on the season, giving up 102.7 points per 100 possessions. Ty Lue has this team fifth in the league in defensive rating for the season. 📉 New Orleans Pelicans (4-13): The Pelicans have been so bad, because of injuries, in the first month of the season that I checked to see if they have their first-round pick in 2025. They do, by the way. The Pelicans are so injured, they signed Elfrid Payton before a game last week. He hadn’t played a game since April 2022. He started for the Pelicans after they signed him. They were 3-3 on Nov. 1. They’ve lost 10 of 11. During these 11 games, their top six in minutes played are Brandon Boston Jr., Brandon Ingram, Jeremiah Robinson-Earl, Javonte Green, Yves Missi and Jaylen Nowell. As if it can’t get worse, Zion Williamson’s PR team can’t let that video go out. The internet has not been kind to it. 📈 Franz Wagner, Orlando Magic: Not only are the Magic on a great run, winning eight of their last nine, but Wagner has enjoyed a level of dominance we haven’t seen him sustain before. Over these nine games (all without Paolo Banchero), Wagner is averaging 28.3 points, seven assists and 6.3 rebounds. Most importantly? He’s shooting 47.7 percent from the field, 36.2 percent from 3 and 90.2 percent from the line. The 3-point shooting is the difference between him being guardable and him being a viable No. 2 on a serious team once Paolo is back. After shooting about league average his first two seasons, Wagner made just 28.1 percent of his 3-pointers last season. It was a massive and confusing regression. It didn’t deter the Magic from giving him a max contract extension this summer. Now, he’s showing that faith in him looks pretty good. GO DEEPER Hollinger: Franz Wagner is writing his All-Star origin story 📉 Detroit Pistons (7-11): Remember how we celebrated the Pistons for being on the way up last week? Welp! That’s not so much the case anymore. After being on the verge of .500 for the first time this late into the season since 2018, the Pistons lost three straight games to Chicago, Charlotte and Orlando. To add literal insult to injury, the Pistons lost Cade Cunningham to a hip injury after he had a hard fall at the end of the Hornets loss. Hopefully, it’s not serious and he’ll be back any game now. The Pistons are about league average defensively so far under J.B. Bickerstaff, but their offense has really come up short. It’s all relative, as it’s not anywhere close to approaching last season’s disaster, but the Pistons have to feel a little deflated here. 📈 San Antonio Spurs (9-8): I was a little skeptical about putting the Spurs into this going into Saturday night’s game, even though I really like what we’ve seen out of them recently. Then, they rallied to beat the Warriors. Their three wins this week are over the Thunder, Jazz and Warriors. That’s a great run for a team missing Victor Wembanyama for two of those wins. San Antonio is now above .500 on the season and has the league’s eighth-best defense. Rookie Stephon Castle looks really good and comfortable out there on both ends of the floor. The Harrison Barnes pickup has been tremendous for them. One month into the season, there is so much to marvel at and celebrate. We’re seeing unreal individual performances, historic starts, dramatic storylines and, unfortunately, so many injuries. We’ve even had a great start to the second inaugural NBA Cup (more below). One of the bigger stories I keep seeing other people talk about, hear from friends and colleagues about, and can’t take my eyes off of is the imbalance between the Eastern and Western conferences. It’s almost alarming how big the gulf is. Advertisement Any of my friends who have allegiances to Western Conference squads will often lament the tough start of their team or a bad stretch for their beloved franchise, only to then exclaim what their positioning would be in the East. For friends of mine who root for a team in the East, almost any alarming moment or slow start will eventually get tagged with, “At least it’s the East and we have plenty of time to recover.” It makes me wonder how Pelicans fans feel just 17 games into the season, when their 4-13 start looks like they should already begin doing some scouting of Duke and Rutgers games. Then, you have Philadelphia 76ers fans watching an incomprehensibly bad start (3-13), but they could very easily talk themselves into being right in the mix when they finally get healthy. Both the Sixers and the Pelicans have been decimated by injuries throughout their rotation. And yet, the Sixers know they can recover to make the top six in the East. The Pelicans hope they haven’t lost too much ground for just competing for a Play-In Tournament spot by April. The West is 44-25 against the East so far. Here are more facts about the two conferences: Eastern Conference Western Conference As you can see, we’re almost talking about the difference between the big leagues and the minor leagues when it comes to how disparate these team conferences are. We expect teams like Philadelphia, Milwaukee and Miami to get their acts together. Maybe the Pacers will, as well? What about the Hawks? Outside of reaching with Atlanta, things in the East are mostly set for which teams will be good and in the postseason. That’s not the case in the West. Let’s do a little thought exercise here. If the season ended today, we’d be shocked that the 2024-25 season didn’t even make it to Thanksgiving. Once we got past that massive abrupt stop to the season in this hypothetical, we are presented with the NBA deciding it’s only fair to eliminate conferences and go find the best 12 teams with an eight-team Play-In Tournament format. This is how that would look: 1. Cleveland Cavaliers | 17-1 2. Boston Celtics | 14-3 | 2.5 games back Advertisement 3. Golden State Warriors | 12-4 | 4 games back 4. Oklahoma City Thunder | 12-4 | 4 games back 5. Houston Rockets | 12-6 | 5 games back 6. Los Angeles Lakers | 10-6 | 6 games back 7. LA Clippers | 11-7 | 6 games back 8. Orlando Magic | 11-7| 6 games back 9. Denver Nuggets | 9-6 | 6.5 games back 10. Memphis Grizzlies | 10-7 | 6.5 games back 11. New York Knicks | 9-7 | 7 games back 12. Phoenix Suns | 9-7 | 7 games back ———— Play-In Tournament —————- 13. Dallas Mavericks | 9-8 | 7.5 games back 14. San Antonio Spurs | 9-8 | 7.5 games back 15. Minnesota Timberwolves | 8-8 | 8 games back 16. Miami Heat | 7-7 | 8 games back 17. Sacramento Kings | 8-8 | 8.5 games back 18. Milwaukee Bucks | 8-9 | 8.5 games back 19. Portland Trail Blazers | 7-10 | 9.5 games back 20. Atlanta Hawks | 7-10 | 9.5 games back The Pacers and Nets have the same record as the Hawks and Blazers, but they’d miss out on tiebreakers with the Blazers being 1-0 against Atlanta, the Nets being 0-1 against Atlanta, and the Hawks having a better conference record than the Pacers. We’ll pretend those are the tiebreakers in this dystopian, conference-elimination hypothetical. Maybe we’re getting too in the weeds on this now. The point is, the Blazers have a chance at the postseason in this scenario. So many East teams do not. Maybe things will start to even out over the next month or four. Who knows? This just feels like one of the most extreme chasms we’ve seen between the two conferences. People have been wondering which Western Conference squad will be moved East if the NBA eventually adds Seattle and Las Vegas in expansion. Eventually, someone is going to start poking around the idea that the NBA needs to eliminate conferences for playoff purposes. The league has always been resistant to that because of tradition and logistics. The West has to hate that. We’ve had four NBA Cup nights so far, and we’re using this space to update what each group in the East and West is looking like. That’s just in case you’re still a little confused by this relatively new ordeal. Reminder: Each group consists of five teams, and they will all play four games in group play. The winner of each group moves on to single-elimination for the NBA Cup, along with one wild card from each conference (based on record and point differential as the top two tiebreakers). Also, overtime periods do not count toward the point differential. We didn’t have those numbers accurately last week because of it, but it has been corrected. Advertisement Driver’s seat: Orlando Magic (2-0, plus-37), New York Knicks (2-0, plus-14) Lingering: Brooklyn Nets (1-2, minus-16) You’re basically out: Philadelphia 76ers (1-2, minus-9), Charlotte Hornets (0-2, minus-26) What’s happening with this group? The Hornets and 76ers are effectively out because of tiebreakers. This is likely all going to come down to the Knicks and Magic game on Dec. 3. Assuming the Knicks beat Charlotte and Orlando beats Brooklyn, they’ll both be 3-0 in group play when they face off on the Knicks’ orange court. The Magic have a big advantage for getting through as the wild card, if they lose that possibly 3-0 matchup against New York. That plus-37 point differential is big right now. The Knicks need to blow out the Hornets. Games this week: Knicks at Hornets on Friday | Magic at Nets on Friday Driver’s seat: Milwaukee Bucks (2-0, plus-26), Detroit Pistons (2-0, plus-4) Lingering: Miami Heat (1-1, plus-13) You’re basically out: Toronto Raptors (0-2, minus-18), Indiana (0-2, minus-25) What’s happening with this group? The Pistons were in the driver’s seat, and now we see the Bucks pull ahead of them because of point differential, after double-digit wins over the Raptors and Pacers to start their group play. If the Bucks beat the Heat on Tuesday and the Pistons beat the Pacers on Friday, then we’ll have a 3-0 showdown between Milwaukee and Detroit on Dec. 3. If the Heat beat the Bucks on Tuesday, then they get thrust into the mix for winning the group. Miami would need some help via Detroit losing its final two group games, since the Pistons beat them already. Indiana will not be the NBA Cup darlings again this season. Games this week: Bucks at Heat on Tuesday | Pistons at Pacers on Friday | Raptors at Heat on Friday Driver’s seat: Atlanta Hawks (2-1, minus-1), Boston Celtics (2-1, plus-14) Lingering: Cleveland Cavaliers (1-1, plus-15), Chicago Bulls (1-1, minus-4) You’re basically out: Washington Wizards (0-2, minus-24) What’s happening with this group? Despite having a better point differential, the Celtics are behind the Hawks because Atlanta beat Boston to tip off group play. However, both teams will be playing to advance in their final respective games on Friday. If the Hawks win, they win the group. If the Celtics win, they either win the group with an Atlanta loss or they could win the wild card if point differential helps them in that way. If the Cavs win over the Hawks, they need the Bulls to beat the Celtics. If the Bulls beat the Wizards and the Celtics, they need the Hawks to win against Cleveland and they get the group. The Wizards, as always, are already out. Advertisement Games this week: Bulls at Wizards on Tuesday | Cavs at Hawks on Friday | Celtics at Bulls on Friday Driver’s seat: Houston Rockets (2-0, plus-49) Lingering: LA Clippers (1-1, minus-5), Portland Trail Blazers (1-1, minus-14), Minnesota Timberwolves (1-1, minus-14) You’re basically out: Sacramento Kings (0-2, minus-16) What’s happening with this group? This one is pretty simple. If the Rockets beat Minnesota on Tuesday, they win West Group A outright. Nothing else matters after that. That means the Clippers and Blazers need to up their game to try to win the wild card. If the Wolves beat the Rockets and the Clippers on Friday, they’ll win the group as long as Portland loses one more game. The Clippers can win the group if they win out and the Rockets lose both of their remaining games. Same for Portland. Games this week: Rockets at Wolves on Tuesday | Clippers at Wolves on Friday | Kings at Blazers on Friday Driver’s seat: Los Angeles Lakers (2-0, plus-11) Lingering: Oklahoma City Thunder (1-1, plus-10), San Antonio Spurs (1-1, plus-1), Phoenix Suns (1-1, minus-8) You’re basically out: Utah Jazz (0-2, minus-14) What’s happening with this group? No offense to the Spurs and the Jazz, but the fate of this group will be decided by the Lakers this week when they play their two toughest group play opponents: Phoenix and OKC. The Lakers have never lost an In-Season Tournament/NBA Cup game. The Suns look very vulnerable right now, but the Thunder still look very formidable without Chet Holmgren. If the Thunder beat the Lakers on Friday, they’ll have a chance to win the group at home against Utah on Dec. 3. The Suns can win the group if they win out and OKC loses a second game. If the Spurs win out, they need the Lakers to lose two for them to win the group. Games this week: Spurs at Jazz on Tuesday | Lakers at Suns on Tuesday | Thunder at Lakers on Friday Advertisement Driver’s seat: Golden State Warriors (3-0, plus-12) Lingering: Dallas Mavericks (2-1, plus-41), Denver Nuggets (1-2, plus-2) You’re basically out: New Orleans Pelicans (1-1, minus-38), Memphis Grizzlies (0-2, minus-17) What’s happening with this group? The Warriors have already won the group! It doesn’t matter what happens in their game against Denver because they have a win over Dallas. Dallas is in great position to take the wild card thanks to its point differential. If the Mavs beat Memphis, they’ll probably snag the wild card. It depends on the Thunder, Spurs, and Lakers in their remaining games, as they have positive point differentials. The Pelicans could grab the wild card if they win their final two group play games by about 100 combined points.

He has a lot of writing left to do, a columnist for The Athletic writes.","NFL INGLEWOOD, Calif. — The lasting image of this indelible season will be a running back in the open field. It will be the fusing of memories: a cut, a catch, a careening force of MVP caliber, carving his name into Philadelphia sports lore. Saquon Barkley supplied two runs on Sunday night that will not soon be forgotten. They will be relished between rounds inside the most desolate dive bars on the most depressing days. Yeah, but remember that run? Someone will immediately ask which one. Sometimes the first will be cited. Someone will chortle. They’ll joke about how Landon Dickerson flattened that Los Angeles Rams linebacker who flailed helplessly as Barkley slipped by for a 70-yard score on the first play of the second half. Advertisement A beer will crack open the second story. Suds will flow through fingers, like Barkley off the left side of the line. Remember how he planted that foot and exploded? Diving Rams edge rusher Jared Verse only grabbed air. Barkley was already gone, already dashing, already mashing two single-game franchise records simultaneously on a 72-yard touchdown run.

It’s new to me. I’m just enjoying the show right now, just like everybody else is.” The majority of Sunday’s announced 74,400 paid attendees were wearing green. A rowdy contingent crowded one of the stadium tunnels, chanting “M-V-P” as Barkley exited the field. No Philadelphian has ever seen a running back like him. No teammate can even summon the words to describe the player whose seven 100-yard games spurred on a winning streak that’s now reached seven games. “You can’t,” Dickerson said. The left guard would’ve at one point also lacked the breath. He was somehow out in front of Barkley, blocking on a screen, one of the running back’s four receptions for 47 yards. Barkley is the all-around catalyst. Coach Nick Sirianni said, “He’s got everything you look for in a back.” The head coach watched his offense squander their first two red zone opportunities, then lean on Barkley while trailing 7-6 on a second-quarter drive in which he logged 42 of 62 its total yards, including a toe-tapping, 13-yard catch along the sideline to the Rams 7. Advertisement Two plays later, Jalen Hurts completed a 6-yard touchdown to A.J. Brown, a catch that required an official review. Brown, a three-time Pro Bowler, is finding himself the beneficiary of favorably shaped defenses. He caught six passes for 109 yards, a significant total considering his tandem playmaker, DeVonta Smith, was sidelined with a hamstring injury. “When you combine an issue with other issues, you got a problem,” Hurts said. Issues. Oh right. There were some in-game issues. But that baggage will rot on the LAX tarmac, long forgotten by an Eagles team whose offensive talent and defensive dominance can apparently erase any error. Three penalties in four plays forced the Eagles to settle for a second field goal in the first quarter. And, inexplicably, Sirianni and offensive coordinator Kellen Moore called a fourth-down Hurts draw that, upon being stopped, gave the Rams two seconds to attempt a Hail Mary just before halftime. But Josh Sweat sacked Matthew Stafford to purge any potential damage. After surrendering 8.8 yards per play on their first two defensive drives, the Eagles held the Rams to negative six yards on the final four drives of the first half. Defensive coordinator Vic Fangio’s unit held the Rams to fewer total yards (290) than Barkley gained. They sacked Stafford five times. Brandon Graham’s will long be remembered. The 15-year veteran pumped up what felt like a home crowd before clobbering Stafford on a third-and-9. He moved into third place on the franchise’s all-time sack list (76.5), trailing only Reggie White (124) and Trent Cole (85.5). But that’s where Graham will likely stay. The team’s longest-tenured player told reporters that his season is over after tearing his tricep in the second half. He said a Rams running back chipped him on the play, striking his arm with pain he first thought was something small. But the injury “stung a little longer.” He stayed on the sideline. He began embracing his teammates. Later, in the locker room, he called his wife and kids. They cried together. Graham, who announced earlier this year that 2024 is a final farewell tour, may have played his final down. “Hate it had to go like this, but at the end of the day, man, I don’t have no regrets,” Graham said. “Man, I really put it all, put it all today, like I do every weekend. We just gonna see where we go from here, man. But I’m hoping we hold that trophy regardless in the end. And like I say, I’m gonna do my part as far as a captain. And the mission’s still the mission. And I’m still gonna be me.” Advertisement Sirianni wouldn’t even speak on the possibility of losing Graham without some finality from upcoming medical counsel. “Love him,” Sirianni said. “One of my favorite guys I’ve ever been able to coach. We’ll see where it is. Again, I’m not ready to talk about it yet. We’re holding out hope.” “That sucks,” Barkley said of Graham’s assessment. “I’ve only been able to be his teammate for such a short period of time, but I felt like I’ve known him for my whole life. He’s the reason why this transition for me has been so easy, him along with all the other guys. It’s cool to have a vet like that, to be able to talk to him about anything. I remember OTAs, sitting in the sauna and we were just talking about life and getting to know each other. The energy and the passion that he brings, not only to his team but to the city. He epitomizes what it means to be a Philadelphia Eagle.” Brandon Graham announces that he is out for the year. pic.twitter.com/Mi9j0x5Mot — Tim McManus (@Tim_McManus) November 25, 2024  Barkley is fulfilling the requirement himself. His impact on the success of the Eagles is unquestionable. His influence has reached the level of the quarterbacks who’ve dominated the NFL’s MVP honors for the last 12 years. The last non-QB to win the award was Adrian Peterson in 2012. Barkley should at the very least be considered to break that streak. His production defies human limits. He spoke with reporters next to his locker, where there was a notice from the league for a randomized drug test. It was actually tight end Dallas Goedert’s. He’d jokingly slapped it on the Barkley’s locker to deliver an unsaid point. Barkley signed with the Eagles to rewrite his story. He’s now produced more yards than ever before in his career with the Giants. “My story’s not finished,” Barkley said. “It’s gonna keep going. When the season is all said and done, we’ll look back and smile and be happy with the things that I did or the things I didn’t do. Right now, we’re just getting ready for the flight. Get some good sleep. Get rest and recover.” (Top photo: Ronald Martinez / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,Longtime U.S. Women’s Soccer Goalie Alyssa Naeher Plans to Retire,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5947493/2024/11/25/uswnt-goalkeeper-alyssa-naeher-announces-retirement/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 21:46:58 +0000",Naeher is the only U.S. goaltender to earn a shutout in a World Cup final and an Olympic gold medal game.,"NWSL U.S. women’s national team goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher announced her retirement from international soccer Monday, ahead of the team’s two European friendlies against England and the Netherlands. She said the European matches will be her last. A 2019 World Cup winner and gold medalist at this summer’s Paris Olympics, she will continue playing for the Chicago Red Stars in the NWSL. She re-signed with Chicago in September to play through the 2025 season, which will be her 10th season with the club. Advertisement For the USWNT, however, it’s the end of a major goalkeeping era. Naeher’s career stands comfortably in the top three amongst other World Cup winners Briana Scurry and Hope Solo. “Every tear shed in the challenging times and disappointments made every smile and celebration in the moments of success that much more joyful,” Naeher wrote Monday in her announcement on social media. “This has been a special team to be a part of and I am beyond proud of what we have achieved both on and off the field.”     A post shared by Alyssa Naeher (@alyssanaeher)  Naeher made her debut a decade ago in December 2014, and after stints as the primary backup goalkeeper for the 2015 World Cup and 2016 Olympics, she took over the no. 1 spot following that quarterfinal exit. Ahead of what could be her two final games for the United States, she holds a record 88 wins, 14 draws and only six losses through 113 appearances. “Having the opportunity to be a part of the USWNT for the last 15 years has been the greatest honor,” she wrote. “When I began this journey, I never could have imagined where it would take me.” She earned her 100th cap earlier this year during the W Gold Cup and cemented her status not just as someone who could save penalty kicks, but convert them as well. In the W Gold Cup semifinal against Canada, she buried her attempt from the spot but also saved three of Canada’s attempts — marking her as the only USWNT goalkeeper to make three saves in a PK shootout. She’d repeat the same double later that spring, against Canada, during the SheBelieves Cup. At the Olympics this summer, she once again stepped up to help propel the USWNT to their gold medal victory, including a poster-worthy save against Brazil in the closing moments of the gold cup game at Parc des Princes. Off the field, she bonded with the forward line of Trinity Rodman, Sophia Smith and Mal Swanson (also known as “Triple Espresso”) who pulled her out of her shell. GO DEEPER USWNT on goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher: 'We’re making her a little more mushy gushy' “We’re making her a little more mushy gushy with us, which I think is nice,” Rodman said in France. “We’re opening up a side that I think has always been there, but it’s hidden a little bit.” (Top photo: Joe Robbins / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,"What’s the Difference Between the Giants and the Jets? Sadly, Not Much.",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5935383/2024/11/25/giants-jets-john-mara-woody-johnson/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 21:46:58 +0000","Both New York teams have become known for puzzling decisions, a columnist for The Athletic writes.","NFL The New York Jets’ roots as a brash and unapologetic upstart, cemented by Joe Namath’s Super Bowl III bravado, differentiated them from the old-guard New York Giants for decades. When the Jets had bombastic and playful Rex Ryan as their coach, the Giants had stern taskmaster Tom Coughlin. When the Jets were going all-in on the polarizing Aaron Rodgers, the Giants were hoping the fifth and sixth seasons of nice guy Daniel Jones might turn out differently. Advertisement If the Jets aspired to be cryptocurrency, the Giants hoped to be the S&P 500. What’s the difference when both are competitively bankrupt? The Pick Six column leads this week by examining how the Giants resemble the Jets, in results if not always process. If Tampa Bay’s Baker Mayfield mocking Giants fill-in Tommy DeVito during a 30-7 Buccaneers rout at MetLife Stadium helped drive home the point, great, but the evidence has been accumulating for years. The full Pick Six menu this week: • No difference between Jets, Giants?
• Can Eagles threaten Lions atop NFC?
• Great week for Bills, not Chiefs
• Surviving the Will Levis roller coaster
• Should a HOF coach win most of time?
• 2-minute drill: Roman and Lamar  Daniel Jones’ recent farewell speech and the Giants’ decision to grant the quarterback’s request for his release reflected the latest major failure for an organization with two winning records over its past 12 seasons. But, as reaction after reaction after reaction after reaction noted, this latest failure was handled in a “classy” manner. The Jets, meanwhile, give off “clown show” vibes even while having a (slightly) better record this season, and a similar record over the past dozen (Giants are 69-120-1, Jets are 66-124). What’s the difference between the Giants and Jets again? “The difference is, the Giants have won championships and have done so most recently (2007, 2011), so they have the most credibility capital to burn,” a coach from another team said. “That is all. They are burning through it.” If that credibility didn’t run out when DeVito was promoted ahead of Drew Lock, who had been the backup to Jones all season, how about when the Giants fell behind Tampa Bay 23-0 at halftime and 30-0 through three quarters? Advertisement What about after the game, when rookie Malik Nabers, who wears jersey No. 1 after the Giants got permission from Hall of Famer Ray Flaherty’s heirs to use the long-retired number, called the team “soft as f—“? Or when star nose tackle Dexter Lawrence conceded the Bucs “beat the s—” out of the Giants? “They beat the shit out of us today”  DL Dexter Lawrence on the “soft” #Giants pic.twitter.com/zvEDjSCpA3 — Connor Hughes (@Connor_J_Hughes) November 24, 2024  These quotes could have been coming from the Jets’ locker room just as easily, except the team had a bye amid reports the relationship between Rodgers and owner Woody Johnson was strained. GO DEEPER Russini’s what I’m hearing: The day the Jets fell apart and the Broncos rallied, Belichick best fits While the Jets have chased aging legends in Rodgers and Brett Favre, the Giants were slow to move on from highly drafted homegrown quarterbacks in Eli Manning and Jones. Those are differences, but what played out at the position this past week felt similar. Johnson, per The Athletic’s Zack Rosenblatt and Dianna Russini, suggested to Jets coaches after four games that the team should bench Rodgers. He fired coach Robert Saleh a week later without consulting general manager Joe Douglas, per the report. More recently, the Giants promoted DeVito over $5 million backup Lock as Jones’ replacement, which made zero sense unless DeVito’s popularity among some fans was a factor. “That move made less sense than anything that has happened in the league this season,” one exec said. How could a team make such a move? Well … Giants owner John Mara previously lamented losing star running back Saquon Barkley to the rival Philadelphia Eagles in free agency because, in Mara’s words, Barkley was “the most popular player we have, by far.” To what degree was player popularity a factor in DeVito over Lock? “It has to be the owner trying to drum up some local support playing off of last year’s success,” an offensive coach said. (The Giants’ defense was primarily responsible for the three victories DeVito started in 2023.) Advertisement If Mara influenced the DeVito decision, it’s bad. If the football people made it on their own, that might be worse. Seven years ago, then-coach Ben McAdoo benched Manning in favor of Geno Smith when the Giants were 2-9, ending Manning’s streak of 210 consecutive regular-season starts (the third-longest streak in NFL history). Mara fired McAdoo and GM Jerry Reese the day after Smith lost his first start. Manning was reinstated as the starter. Smith never again played for the Giants. He later emerged as a productive starter for Seattle — better than any Giants starter since then, for sure. Lock might or might not be another Smith, but the next coach or executive who thinks DeVito has a future as a starter will be the first I’ve encountered. The Giants finished Sunday with 245 yards — 10 fewer than Barkley gained on the ground (and 57 fewer than he gained in total) for Philadelphia on Sunday night — against a Tampa Bay defense that had allowed 425 per game over its previous six. Despite all that, every logical football person would rather work for Mara than for the Jets’ Johnson. As one exec put it, “Mara, I respect. He might make his thoughts known, but I haven’t seen evidence he forces it. I think you could talk to him and make things make sense. Woody and his crew? Who knows? They might just do something on their own. That is scary.” Even so, the Giants’ winning percentage (.457) since John Mara succeeded his late father, Wellington, as owner during the 2005 season ranks 22nd among win rates for all current owners since each took control. The Jets’ Johnson ranks 23rd with a .430 win rate since purchasing his team in 2000. What’s the difference between the Giants and Jets again? Not as much as the Giants’ two Super Bowl victories this century (with two wild-card teams that got hot) suggest. Advertisement Wellington Mara was the owner of record when the team hired Coughlin and traded for Manning on draft day in 2004. The Giants are 50-91-1 (.356) since Coughlin departed. That ranks 30th in the NFL. “What we are watching (with the Giants) is, Paul Brown passes the Bengals to Mike Brown (in 1991) and all mayhem breaks out,” a veteran coach said. One difference is that the Giants had Coughlin and Manning for roughly a decade after their ownership was passed to the next generation in 2005. In Cincinnati, those early 1990s Bengals teams were already transitioning away from their Super Bowl coach, Sam Wyche, and their Super Bowl quarterback, Boomer Esiason. They fell off faster. The Giants are the ones free-falling now. Only the Jacksonville Jaguars (.338) and Jets (.310) have worse records since Coughlin resigned under pressure following the 2015 season. What’s the difference between the Giants and Jets again? The Giants do not have to worry about Mara landing his helicopter on the practice field and summoning their GM to the office for his firing, as Fox’s Jay Glazer reported Johnson did with Douglas last week (see video below at the one-minute mark). The Inside Scoop with @JayGlazer! 👏 Jay breaks down what is going on with the 49ers, Giants and more!! pic.twitter.com/2kW0tOa155 — FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) November 24, 2024  The differences do not show up in how these teams have hired. Mara and Johnson have combined to hire 13 head coaches (including interim coaches). The only one with a winning record during his tenure was Al Groh, who went 9-7 in his lone season with the Jets (2000). Mara’s hires have a combined 50-91-1 (.356) record. Based on this, the team should put Coughlin (.531) in its Ring of Honor a second time. Johnson’s hires have a combined 171-227 (.430) record — bad, but not as bad as Mara’s hires. “It seems like the Jets are in disarray and the Giants are the prideful heirs to a great legacy,” a defensive coach said. “In reality, neither makes a lot of good decisions.” Nearly a quarter-century after the Jets were rebuffed by Bill Belichick, only to settle for Groh, rumors persist that the Giants could bring back Belichick, their former defensive coordinator under Bill Parcells. Belichick passed up the Jets over what he called at the time “various uncertainties” regarding ownership shortly before Johnson purchased the team in 2000. There can be no uncertainties about Giants ownership now. It needs help. Advertisement After watching Barkley and the Eagles dominate the Los Angeles Rams 37-20, NBC’s Cris Collinsworth declared Philadelphia a team that could win it all. The Athletic’s playoff model agrees, with a caveat. The model sees the Lions as about twice as likely to win the Super Bowl, 21 percent to 11 percent. GO DEEPER NFL playoff projections 2024: Can Eagles overtake Lions for top seed in NFC? How do NFL insiders see it? “One game, head to head, yes, the Eagles could win, but if they played five games, Philly would lose at least three of them, maybe four of them,” an NFC coach whose team faced the Eagles said. Another assistant from the NFC called the gap between the Lions and Eagles “substantial” even though a single game separates them in the conference standings. “I don’t know if I trust Philly still,” he said. “There is something about if (Jalen) Hurts gets behind and they have to throw. Now, the defensive turnaround has been enormous for them.” This was not a consensus view. “I don’t think the Eagles are far behind because, with Saquon Barkley, they can run it on anybody,” an NFC exec said. “That would be a really good game. I don’t think the gap is as big as some think it is. Vic Fangio’s defense can be a little tricky, but I think they are buying in. They seem to be getting it, making calls, making adjustments.” The Lions, Eagles and Packers are the only teams ranked among the NFL’s top 10 in EPA per play on both sides of the ball, led by Detroit (second on offense, third on defense), per TruMedia. Two execs thought Green Bay was the NFC team most likely to threaten the Lions or Eagles. “I like Jordan Love,” one of them said. “Something makes him short-circuit still, and that is just a growing pain you are going to have to live with. It’s like some of the stuff Josh Allen went with early on.” Advertisement The second exec questioned Minnesota because of Sam Darnold. “I don’t see anyone else in Detroit’s category,” he said. “I don’t trust Darnold. I would say Green Bay because of their overall talent, and because I trust Matt LaFleur and I trust their playoff performance last year.” The table below stacks all NFC teams by percent chance of reaching the playoffs, according to the model. Bills coach Sean McDermott holds the NFL’s best regular-season record among head coaches (14-2) since an investigative report published Dec. 7, 2023 painted McDermott as an obstacle the organization had to overcome in order to win. The three-part series by NFL writer Tyler Dunne for his “Go Long” website featured devastating testimonials from anonymous McDermott associates. “This job’s too hard to fight from within and that’s what you do there,” one of the sources said. “You’ve got to overcome the head coach.” McDermott’s intensity and its potential negative effects were something I’d explored earlier last season when suggesting the team needed its coach to find a new gear. The criticisms aligned with the Bills’ late-game struggles in pressure situations, but if we’re going to question McDermott when it appears his team might be on the verge of crumbling, we should appreciate the successes when things appear to be operating smoothly. Could this season be going much better for the Bills? They are 9-2 and riding a six-game winning streak after handling the Chiefs 30-21 in Week 11. They’ll come out of their bye with a home game against the depleted 5-6 San Francisco 49ers. GO DEEPER Reassessing AFC contenders: Bills the best? How dangerous are the Steelers? Sando’s Pick Six Drama? There seems to be none in Buffalo. “The coach and GM (Brandon Beane) had the foresight to get rid of the receiver (Stefon Diggs) because they knew it was detrimental to the quarterback and the atmosphere,” a coach from another team said. “All of sudden, they are playing with Curtis Samuel and draft picks and just whatever, and the quarterback is playing good. And then they add Amari Cooper.” Advertisement Any Bills fan watching the Chiefs struggle to a 30-27 victory over the Carolina Panthers on Sunday has to like Buffalo’s prospects in a potential playoff rematch. Against Carolina, Kansas City suffered its 10th-worst defensive EPA performance (-13.2) in 72 regular-season and playoff games since 2021, per TruMedia. The chart below identifies the Carolina game with a yellow dot. The Bills’ offense is responsible for five of the Chiefs’ 18 worst defensive EPA games since 2021. Those games appear via blue dots. Buffalo’s offense has averaged 11.3 EPA per game in the six most recent matchups, including playoffs, with Kansas City dating to 2021. Only 12 teams since 2000 have averaged 11.3 or better over a full season. The Bills’ offense has performed better across these six games against Kansas City than it has performed, on average, against the NFL’s other 30 defenses over the same period. The production has remained steady across three Bills offensive coordinators even as the Chiefs’ defense has improved. We do not yet know whether the Bills and Chiefs will meet again in the playoffs. If they do, the focus should be on what the Chiefs’ defense can do to stop Buffalo from producing even better against Kansas City than it produces against the other 30 teams. That seemed especially true Sunday after the Panthers nearly outscored Kansas City. “I don’t see how Buffalo melts down unless they have a ton of injuries,” an exec said. “I’m not sure what the catalyst has been, except that maybe they have been off everybody’s radar long enough, and the offseason did not target them as much, and they are clearly operating better in those conditions than having the spotlight on them.” Will Levis took eight sacks and threw a pick six for the Tennessee Titans against the Houston Texans. Advertisement According to Pro Football Reference, which has unofficial sack data since 1960 (sacks became official in 1982), this was the 36th time since then that an NFL quarterback checked both those dubious boxes — at least eight sacks, at least one pick six — in the same game. Here’s the deal: Levis was already on the list, despite Sunday marking only his 17th career start. He took eight sacks and threw a pick six in a 30-14 defeat to Green Bay in Week 3. The difference Sunday was that Levis’ Titans won the game. Levis played a positive role in the outcome as well, completing 18 of 24 passes for 278 yards and two touchdowns. But the Titans’ 32-27 victory over the Texans was an outlier among outliers. Starting quarterbacks are now 3-33 (.083) since 1960 when taking eight sacks and having an interception returned for a touchdown. Levis is the only quarterback to appear twice on the list. His penchant for taking sacks was already on my radar entering Week 12. I’d been looking for any statistical category for Levis that correlated with Tennessee winning. The answer was clear: Levis’ sack EPA was the key. His ratio of sack EPA in victories versus defeats was the most lopsided through any quarterback’s first 16 starts since 2007, per TruMedia. That changed Sunday when the Titans lost 10.8 EPA on his sacks but still won the game. The table below stacks Levis’ starts from best to worst sack EPA. The correlation with winning is stark. Why so many sacks? “I don’t think he’s naturally instinctive,” an offensive coach who studied quarterbacks in the 2023 draft said. “Bad things happen as a result.” Callahan, who raised some eyebrows by using the word “dumb” to characterize a Levis fumble against the Jets in his Week 2 postgame news conference, sounded much different Sunday. “I thought he played for the most part fantastic, particularly in the first half,” Callahan said. “You throw interceptions sometimes. To see him come back and fight was great. But I really was happy with the way he played. He put some great balls down the field. He did some really nice things and he protected the ball well outside the interception. That is what quarterbacking looks like.” Advertisement The 29 coaches already enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame had winning records in 71 percent of their combined seasons. No current coach with at least seven qualifying seasons in the role has posted winning records as frequently as the Pittsburgh Steelers’ Mike Tomlin, whose 15 in 17 seasons equates to an 88.2 percent rate (one more victory this season will get him to 88.9 percent). McDermott, Kansas City’s Andy Reid and Jacksonville’s Doug Pederson have already won or lost enough games for the 2024 season to qualify in their totals. The other coaches in the table below could still have winning or losing records this season, so 2024 was excluded for them. The subject is topical because the Pro Football Hall of Fame plans to announce on Dec. 3 which retired coach will advance from the semifinalist to finalist round, a big step toward enshrinement. I recently joined eight other members of the Hall of Fame Blue-Ribbon Committee in discussing and voting on the semifinalists: Tom Coughlin, Mike Holmgren, Dan Reeves, Chuck Knox, Marty Schottenheimer, George Seifert and Mike Shanahan among long-time head coaches, plus Clark Shaughnessy (primarily an assistant) and Bill Arnsparger (exclusively an assistant). We do not yet know which coach will advance. These are fun candidacies to think through. I lean toward asking the most basic questions. How frequently does a head coach win? How consistently does the coach win when he changes organizations? How about when he changes starting quarterbacks? Does he take his teams to Super Bowls? Has he won a championship? How many? George Allen, John Madden and Vince Lombardi are the only Hall of Fame coaches to produce winning records at a higher rate than Tomlin has produced them. They combined for 30 winning records in 30 seasons before the salary cap promoted parity. The table below shows Allen, Madden and Lombardi leading the way among the 29 Hall of Fame coaches. I’ve slotted in the seven longtime head coaches who are Hall semifinalists this year. This is only one lens through which to view coaches. In general, the lower a coach resides on that list, the more I think he needs special achievements for enshrinement (example: Marv Levy taking the Buffalo Bills to four consecutive Super Bowls). Dick Vermeil and Weeb Ewbank are the only Hall of Famers with winning records in less than half their seasons as head coaches. Advertisement While the Monday night game between the Baltimore Ravens and Los Angeles Chargers focuses a spotlight on the Harbaugh brothers, that is not the only storyline. The game also brings together Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson and his former longtime offensive coordinator, Greg Roman, who now serves in that role with the Chargers. Lamar Jackson with a long hesitation when asked how he’d characterize his time with his former offensive coordinator Greg Roman pic.twitter.com/1WpnS5OaWC — Sarah Ellison (@sgellison) November 21, 2024  While Roman’s offense played a role in Jackson becoming a dual-threat star right away, the way Jackson smiled and paused when asked about his former coordinator during the week played into the idea that change was needed in Baltimore for the quarterback to take another step in his development. “You have to develop your running quarterback into a passer at some point or you hit a ceiling,” a veteran offensive coach said. “You have to recognize that and make a move when you can, when you think you can hit it.” Jackson’s production has returned to what it was at his best under Roman, except he’s been more productive as a passer, and less productive as a runner. Some might have read Jackson’s response as an indictment of his former coordinator, but the situation could be more nuanced than that. The relationship between Jackson and the Ravens seemed to deteriorate through the pandemic and what turned into a tense standoff regarding a new contract. Roman left the team in January 2023, when that relationship still seemed strained. The sides worked through those issues over a three-month period before reaching a $260 million contract extension. Roman wasn’t with the Ravens during that time, so he wasn’t part of whatever healing process took place. All parties have moved on, and all seem to be in a better place than they were the last time Jackson and Roman were together on the Ravens. Advertisement If Roman’s offense was holding back Jackson, we might expect Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert to bump up against a schematic ceiling at some point. “They let Herbert run wild throwing the ball earlier in his career, and it didn’t work,” the offensive coach said. “Now, they have reined him in. Herbert has to take a step back for the good of the organization, and within it, he has to grow and come out the other side. You hope there is enough balance over time.” • Packers roll: The Green Bay Packers’ 38-10 victory over San Francisco at Lambeau Field was about what should have happened without Brock Purdy, Nick Bosa, Trent Williams or Brandon Aiyuk available to the 49ers. Is there much to read into this outcome, beyond the fact that the 49ers are in trouble? “It’s a combination of injuries and then Kyle Shanahan’s late-game management, blowing all those leads earlier in the season,” an exec said. “They look tired, like Manti Te’o was saying before the season. They had a year like this before (in 2020). I want them to do well because I don’t want to see them get another stud in the draft after a down year.” • Seahawks D: Seattle won while every other NFC West team lost, and its defense continued its recent improvement under first-year coach Mike Macdonald. The Seahawks rank sixth in defensive EPA per play since Week 9, a span of games against all three NFC West opponents. They held Arizona’s Kyler Murray to the ninth-worst statistical game of his 77-start career by EPA per pass play in the 16-6 victory. GO DEEPER Led by 'f---ing beast' Leonard Williams, Seahawks' D smothers Cardinals for NFC West lead • On Washington: Will allowing two kick-return touchdowns in the fourth quarter and missing an extra point that would have forced overtime during an inexplicable home defeat to the Dallas Cowboys wind up defining this once-promising Commanders season? It was a wild way to punctuate a three-game losing streak. Advertisement A 223-yard fourth quarter padded the Commanders’ offensive stat sheet, but that will not spare offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury from continued questions about staying power over the second halves of seasons. Washington finished with negative offensive EPA (-5.7) for a third consecutive game, all defeats, after enduring only one such game in the first nine weeks. • Better late than never: Dallas, for all its struggles, is the only team to score more than 17 points in the final 9:00 of regulation this season.

NYT > Sports,Ranking 134 College Football Teams After a Weekend of Mayhem,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5945494/2024/11/25/college-football-fbs-team-134-rankings/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 21:46:58 +0000","Notre Dame has jumped into the top five, and the changes don’t stop there.","NCAAF Editor’s note: The Athletic 134 is a weekly ranking of all FBS college football teams. Winning games is hard. That’s a press conference cliché you’ll hear from every coach, but it’s true, especially for coaches dealing with college athletes. How else can you explain what happened on Saturday? For two weeks, SEC fans beat the narrative drum that Indiana hadn’t played anyone. On Saturday, Indiana played Ohio State and got manhandled 38-15. Vindication! Well, until a few minutes later when Ole Miss lost to a previously 5-5 Florida team. Then Alabama lost to a 5-5 Oklahoma team (by a 24-3 score). Then Texas A&M lost to a 4-6 Auburn team. Suddenly, three SEC teams that entered the day with two losses and a clear path to the College Football Playoff had a third loss. Advertisement It turns out, winning is hard. That’s not to say all 10-1 records are created equally, or that more wins should equal a higher ranking. They don’t. Beating good teams matters. But there has to be an appreciation for winning games, even against average or above-average teams. At one point Friday, the SEC appeared to have a path to send five teams into the 12-team College Football Playoff. By the end of the weekend, three SEC teams are in the CFP field based on this week’s Athletic 134 rankings. Every week this season has given us an upset that has upended the CFP. I wouldn’t pencil anything in heading into the final weekend either. It’s why we love college football. But college football is more than strength of schedule rankings, betting lines and hypotheticals. You have to play games. That’s what sports are about. You never know what can happen. So when you get a win, no matter what kind of win it is, make sure you enjoy it. Here is this week’s edition of The Athletic 134. Notre Dame fans, I told you I’d put you into the top five once you beat Army, and you did, so here you are. Beat USC, and the Irish will host a Playoff game in South Bend. I nearly put Notre Dame over Penn State, considering the Nittany Lions’ close calls against USC and Minnesota. But Penn State’s win against Illinois is now a top-25 win, and the Irish’s loss to Northern Illinois continues to be a drag. If they handle a USC team that took Penn State to overtime, there’s reason to jump the Nittany Lions. Indiana drops to No. 9 after its loss to Ohio State, thanks to those aforementioned SEC losses. But the Hoosiers also have a good amount of solid blowout wins, and their strength of schedule in ESPN’s metric jumped up to No. 51, higher than Oregon, Miami, SMU, Notre Dame or Boise State, for what it’s worth. SMU is up to No. 8 in my rankings. The Mustangs are rolling and have that quality loss to BYU. I still don’t understand why Miami is higher than SMU in the polls and CFP rankings. Advertisement Boise State moves up to No. 10 after escaping a bad Wyoming team, but the Broncos are teetering with some recent close calls. Still, the UNLV win and Week 2’s close Oregon loss keep them around here for now. But with a rematch against No. 24 UNLV now likely in the Mountain West championship game, that Group of 5 spot in the Playoff is far from wrapped up. Also, Georgia and Tennessee had better not overlook Georgia Tech and Vanderbilt, respectively, this week.  Miami is up to No. 11, even if it took a surprising amount of time to pull away from Wake Forest. But along with Indiana, the biggest winner from the SEC losses could be the ACC, which now has a strong case to get two Playoff bids, presuming SMU and Miami win this week. I have Miami in my CFP field as an at-large team. Alabama and Ole Miss fall to Nos. 12 and 14, respectively. I don’t think the Tide are out of the CFP mix yet, but they’ll need help. Arizona State moves up to No. 13 after the win against BYU to take the top spot in the Big 12, while BYU falls to No. 16. The Cougars still have wins against SMU and Kansas State, so they don’t fall too far. Clemson moves up to No. 17, and I don’t understand why the Tigers are No. 12 in both polls. They don’t have any good wins, and they shouldn’t be behind two SEC teams that beat Georgia, since Georgia whipped Clemson. If Clemson beats South Carolina, then we can start a CFP at-large conversation, but the Tigers shouldn’t be near there right now, and it’s going to be hard to convince me a second ACC spot shouldn’t go to SMU or Miami. I’m very curious where the committee puts Clemson. Anything close to No. 12 opens the possibility the Tigers jump the loser of the potential SMU-Miami matchup. Kansas State is up to No. 19, back ahead of No. 20 Colorado and still ahead of No. 21 Tulane because the Wildcats beat both. Iowa State is at No. 22 and has a path to the Big 12 Championship Game after all. Advertisement Army drops out of the top 25 to No. 27 after a 49-14 loss to Notre Dame. No. 28 Syracuse is quietly an impressive 8-3 in Fran Brown’s first season, including a win against UNLV. Florida climbs all the way up to No. 33 after beating Ole Miss, one week after the win against LSU. The Gators are the highest-ranked 6-5 team, with all five losses coming to top-25 teams. Washington State tumbles to No. 43 after losing to Oregon State, which came after a loss to New Mexico. Oklahoma jumps up to No. 46 after beating Alabama, its first win since September. No. 47 Kansas is the best 5-6 team in the country. The Jayhawks are the first team in history to beat three consecutive top-25 teams while a sub-.500 team, the latest a dominant performance against Colorado. West Virginia beat UCF to get bowl-eligible and climb up to No. 50. Boston College planted North Carolina and moves up to No. 52. James Madison drops to No. 55 after losing to Appalachian State in the snow, and the Tar Heels fall to No. 56. Cal came back to beat Stanford, get bowl-eligible and move up to No. 54, still ahead of Auburn, which climbs after beating Texas A&M. Cal’s win against Auburn keeps the Golden Bears ahead. Marshall jumps up to No. 65 after beating Coastal Carolina and remaining atop the Sun Belt East division. No. 73 Jacksonville State has won eight consecutive games after an 0-3 start and clinched a spot in the Conference USA Championship Game. Liberty’s win against Western Kentucky puts those two plus Sam Houston in the mix for the other CUSA spot. Colorado State got bit, losing at Fresno State to significantly damage the Rams’ Mountain West championship hopes. They now need UNLV to lose to Nevada. Miami (Ohio), Ohio and Bowling Green are all 6-1 in MAC play heading into the final weekend, and all three move up after wins. No. 84 East Carolina is now 4-0 under interim head coach Blake Harrell, who is putting himself into the conversation to get the full-time job. Oregon State moves up to No. 88 after beating Washington State but stays behind San Jose State due to the head-to-head result. Texas State tumbles to No. 91 after losing to Georgia State. Oklahoma State finally showed a pulse but lost 56-48 to Texas Tech to make it eight consecutive losses and an 0-8 record in Big 12 play. Advertisement No. 103 Florida State finally got a second win, against FCS Charleston Southern. No. 112 Charlotte beat FAU in a battle of interim coaches. No. 113 Central Michigan beat Western Michigan, and then coach Jim McElwain retired. No. 134 Kent State missed its last best chance at a win in a 38-17 loss to No. 128 Akron. The Golden Flashes must win at Buffalo to avoid an 0-12 season. The Athletic 134 series is part of a partnership with Allstate. The Athletic maintains full editorial independence.

NYT > Sports,A Former M.L.B. Executive Is Spearheading a New Pro Softball League,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5944861/2024/11/25/softball-league-kim-ng/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 21:46:58 +0000","Kim Ng, who was the general manager of the Miami Marlins, is working with Athletes Unlimited to launch a four-team league in 2025.","MLB For the first time since its founding in 2020, Athletes Unlimited (AU) is organizing a traditional team-based league meant to be “Major League Baseball for softball,” in the words of former Miami Marlins general manager Kim Ng, the senior advisor of the inaugural Athletes Unlimited Softball League (AUSL). Advertisement AU has annually hosted weeks-long competitions for pro women’s sports, including softball, basketball, volleyball and lacrosse, with no coaches or GMs involved. A player, as opposed to a team, would win the so-called championship for a given season based on an unorthodox points system, with all games held at one location. Softball is the first sport for which AU is implementing a team format. The AUSL, scheduled to start in June 2025, is set to facilitate a 30-game slate for each of its four teams. The sites of said games will vary across to-be-determined touring locations, meant to help inform the league’s leadership on which cities might be most receptive to supporting a professional softball team in the long term. Starting in 2026, the AUSL plans to station up to six teams in different cities. At least 30 AUSL games will be exclusively broadcasted on ESPN, ESPN2 or ESPNU. Softball icon Jennie Finch, an Olympic gold medalist, is one of four supporting advisors to Ng, whose tenure as Marlins GM from 2020 to 2023 made her the first female GM in North America’s big four sports leagues (MLB, NFL, NBA, NHL). Ng believes the establishment of a premier softball league has been long overdue. But perhaps there is no better time than now, given the momentum stirred in recent years by sports such as women’s college basketball and the WNBA. GET HYPE Y'ALL 🗣️ we are thrilled to introduce the first group of players to join the #AUSL ✍️ 👉 https://t.co/F5bUlvhV0D pic.twitter.com/UQIdaBtJWn — AUSL (@theAUSLofficial) November 22, 2024  “There are people every day saying, ‘On Saturday night, I was watching the WNBA game with my 10-year-old son.’ … Stuff we didn’t think would happen for quite some time has all of a sudden just become so much more mainstream,” Ng said. Ng hopes AUSL will serve as a training ground for the best softball players in the world ahead of the sport’s return at the 2028 Summer Olympics. Advertisement The group of coaches and GMs selected for the first season are prominent softball figures. Stacey Nuveman-Deniz, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, is one of the four coaches. The GMs include Lisa Fernandez, a three-time Olympic gold medalist, and Cat Osterman, a four-time National Pro Fastpitch champion, among others. And among the first nine players signed are Olympic silver medalists Carley Hoover and Dejah Mulipola. The four teams will construct their rosters via the AUSL Allocation Draft in early 2025 and a college draft in the spring, a significant shift from how AU’s leagues have previously functioned. Players with the most points on an individual leaderboard would be deemed captains and given the power to pick their teams on a weekly basis, with an individual being crowned as champion at the end of the season. This setup will not go away entirely. After a best-of-three championship series decides the AUSL champion, the AUSL All-Star Cup, formerly known as the AU Pro Softball Championship season, will take place over four weeks to determine an individual champion. Such a format was born of a player-centric mission sported by AU, which has no owners or investors and instead enables players to serve as direct shareholders. Ng said she probably should’ve taken more time off after stepping down from her GM role with the Marlins in October 2023. The AUSL, and what it might enable for the future of softball and other professional women’s sports, was just too important for her to pass up. “Being a woman who has fought for other women in sports, and now to have the opportunity to be someone on the inside fighting for women’s sports, that’s really cool,” said Ng, who joined AU this past summer to lead the AUSL.

NYT > Sports,Formula 1 to Expand Grid as General Motors Will Become 11th Team in 2026,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5947118/2024/11/25/formula-1-expands-grid-general-motors/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 21:46:58 +0000",A big American manufacturer with an extensive motorsports series joining the grid could bring fresh eyes to the sport.,"Formula One announced Monday that “an agreement in principle” has been reached “with General Motors to support bringing GM/Cadillac” to the grid as the sport’s 11th team in 2026. “We’re excited to partner with General Motors in bringing a dynamic presence to Formula 1,” Dan Towriss, CEO of TWG Global’s motorsport business, said. “Together, we’re assembling a world-class team that will embody American innovation and deliver unforgettable moments to race fans around the world. We appreciate the FIA and FOM’s support of our application and their recognition of the value we can bring to the championship.’’ Advertisement “General Motors and Cadillac’s commitment to this project is an important and positive demonstration of the evolution of our sport,” said F1 president and CEO Stefano Domenicali. We look forward to seeing the progress and growth of this entry, certain of the full collaboration and support of all the parties involved.” This comes after news broke during the Las Vegas Grand Prix weekend that General Motors was nearing approval to join the grid in 2026. Andretti Global initially put forward the bid, which included GM building its power unit in 2028, but F1 rejected it. Still, the project continued. Andretti has undergone restructuring recently, with Michael Andretti leaving his operational role and Dan Towriss taking over. It seemed the grid may be open to welcoming GM, based on comments made during Thursday’s news conference. Mercedes’ Toto Wolff said, “We have an obligation, a statutory obligation as directors to present the standpoint that is the best for our company and for our employees, and we’ve done that so in the past. I think if a team can add to the championship, particularly if GM decides to come in as a team owner, that is a different story. And as long as it is creative, that means we’re growing the popularity of the sport, we’re growing the revenue of the sport, then no team will be ever against it. So I’m putting my hope in there.” A prominent American manufacturer with an extensive motorsports history joining the grid could bring fresh eyes to the sport, but it also means the prize money will be split up even more. This will be the first team to join the grid since Haas in 2016, and the sport has had 10 teams on the grid since 2017. F1 has said before that it was open to a GM works team. When it rejected Andretti’s big, F1 said it “would look differently on an application for the entry of a team into the 2028 championship with a GM power unit, either as a GM works team or as a GM customer team designing all allowable components in-house.” Advertisement However, GM will need another customer power unit. It planned to have its F1 engine ready in 2028, two years into the new regulations. New teams joining the grid must add something, which GM does by becoming an engine manufacturer. The plan is still for GM to enter through its Cadillac brand. According to F1’s press release, “Over the course of this year, they have achieved operational milestones and made clear their commitment to brand the eleventh team GM/Cadillac, and that GM will enter as an engine supplier at a later time.” There will still be Andretti involvement, though it remains to be seen how much. GM’s announcement includes the news that Mario Andretti, the last American F1 world champion, will be on the team’s board, serving as the director. “My first love was Formula 1, and now – 70 years later – the F1 paddock is still my happy place. I’m absolutely thrilled with Cadillac, Formula 1, Mark Walter, and Dan Towriss,” Andretti said in the announcement. “To still be involved at this stage of my life — I have to pinch myself to make sure I’m not dreaming.” According to GM’s press release, the other power player involved is TWG Global, which is a holding company that “owns and operates” Andretti Global. As for the Department of Justice’s investigation into F1’s Andretti rejection, what will happen remains to be seen. (Photo: Mario Tama/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,"When Brian Kelly Left Notre Dame for L.S.U., He Didn’t Expect This",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5945266/2024/11/25/brian-kelly-lsu-notre-dame-recruiting/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 21:46:58 +0000","The coach chased a championship. Now he’s further away from that than ever, a columnist for The Athletic writes.","NCAAF The low point of Brian Kelly’s 38 games as head coach at LSU came in Gainesville two weeks ago, with a third consecutive loss and two heated sideline exchanges with his players. The first sideline interaction looked familiar: Kelly got in the face of wide receiver Chris Hilton with a stern lecture that featured a couple of expletives. The second was different: Kyren Lacy, the team’s leading receiver, seemingly startled Kelly when he yelled at his coach after another failed LSU possession. Advertisement The loss to Florida snapped Kelly’s string of seven straight seasons with at least 10 wins, dating back to his time with Notre Dame, and feels indicative of larger issues at LSU. It’s difficult to look toward 2025 and project a significant turnaround for the Tigers — especially after five-star quarterback Bryce Underwood flipped his verbal commitment from LSU to Michigan late last week. GO DEEPER Bryce Underwood's meetings with Tom Brady helped flip QB to Michigan Kelly’s first season included an SEC West title and win over Alabama, and his second featured a Heisman Trophy winner and 10 victories. But the Tigers (7-4) head into their regular-season finale against Oklahoma playing out the string on a disappointing year. “It’s just not up to the standard. It’s been patchwork,” a person long affiliated with LSU football said. Almost three full seasons after Kelly made the audacious decision to leave Notre Dame to chase a national championship at one of the SEC’s most volatile superpowers, it remains to be seen whether he fits the job and can effectively recruit and coach the players the Tigers need to reach that goal.  The Athletic spoke with more than a half-dozen people who have ties to LSU and Kelly for this story. Most were granted anonymity to speak candidly about how Kelly’s tenure at LSU has gone and whether the marriage can be successful. LSU’s last three coaches — Nick Saban, Les Miles and Ed Orgeron — had all won national championships by the end of their fourth seasons in Baton Rouge. Kelly ran toward, not away from, that standard upon his arrival. “I want to be in an environment where I have the resources to win a national championship,” Kelly said in the spring of 2022. “And I came down here because I want to be in the American League East,” a reference to the hyper-competitive Major League Baseball division that features the Red Sox and Yankees. Advertisement Instead, Kelly will enter Year 4 still searching for the right combination of assistant coaches and with a roster that looks more like the early stages of a rebuild than one ready to contend in the toughest conference in the country. From the moment LSU athletic director Scott Woodward made the surprising move to pull Kelly from Notre Dame on Dec. 1, 2021, with a 10-year, $95 million contract, the biggest question was: How would the Massachusetts native fit at the SEC school? While some pointed to Kelly’s career spent coaching in the North and an awkward foray into a Southern accent — “my FAM-i-lee” — at an introductory appearance as signs that his long track record of success might not be transferrable to LSU, those familiar with the program and the coach say his hands-off and at times detached management style has not matched what’s needed at LSU. “Brian Kelly’s trying to be the same guy he was at Notre Dame at LSU, and it ain’t working,” a former assistant said. Last week on the SEC coaches’ teleconference, Kelly was asked by The Athletic to what extent he was still learning what works best at LSU. “I don’t know that it’s as much about me as much as it’s about us, and how we continue to build our program consistently,” Kelly said. With the full backing of Woodward, who felt the program lacked structure under Orgeron, Kelly cleaned house when he arrived at LSU. It was an unusually deep cleaning for a power-conference program just two years removed from a national championship. But Orgeron was seen by Woodward as running too loose a ship, and the volatility made it difficult to sustain success. The idea was to start anew and implement a more buttoned-up approach. About 50 people were replaced, from assistant coaches to support staff, including longtime strength and conditioning coach Tommy Moffitt, now at Texas A&M. Advertisement “I think just that first (coaching) staff was not what the staff needed to be, and it probably was trying to be too clean of a break,” a former staffer said. That appears to have been an overcorrection. “You lose your way a little bit,” the source long affiliated with LSU said. After pivoting hard away from Coach O’s regime, Kelly, again with input from Woodward, pivoted back after the 2023 season to try to fix an abysmal defense that undercut Heisman winner Jayden Daniels and a spectacular offense, and to fortify credibility on the recruiting trail close to home after Kelly’s first full signing class had only 10 in-state players. Corey Raymond, a former LSU player who was part of the 2019 national champion staff, was brought back to coach the secondary. Raymond helped establish LSU’s reputation for elite defensive back play. Bo Davis, another former player who was part of the 2003 national title staff under Saban, returned as defensive line coach. “I think to recruit Louisiana, you have to have Louisiana guys,” the former staffer said. In addition, Blake Baker — who had a brief stint as linebackers coach at LSU in 2021, Orgeron’s final season — was brought back from Missouri as defensive coordinator at $2.5 million per year. The defense is better than last year’s version, which was maybe the worst in school history, but it still ranks near the bottom of the SEC. It was expected for the offense to regress some from the best in the country with the departure of Daniels and two first-round NFL Draft pick receivers in Malik Nabers and Brian Thomas. Instead, the drop-off has been drastic for what appears to be LSU’s more talented side of the ball, led by two offensive tackles with first-round potential and quarterback Garrett Nussmeier. The offensive coordinator transition from Mike Denbrock, who left LSU after last season to return to Notre Dame, to Joe Sloan, who was promoted from quarterbacks coach to replace Denbrock, has not gone well. The Tigers are ninth in the SEC in yards per play (6.11) and 11th in points per game (28.6). Advertisement “Scott Woodward and Brian Kelly made a personnel gamble when they decided to let Mike Denbrock out the door because they felt like Joe Sloan was the answer,” the former assistant said. “The data right now would tell you that that’s not the case.” Woodward declined a request to be interviewed for this story through an LSU spokesman. Kelly could very well be heading back into the market for an offensive coordinator after this season. Kelly has always taken something of a 30,000-foot approach to running a program, and the results show he knows what he’s doing. Kelly has a .725 winning percentage over 21 years coaching in the FBS, which doesn’t include 118 victories in 13 seasons leading Division II Grand Valley State. But even at Notre Dame, particularly after going 4-8 in 2016, Kelly conceded he needed to be more present for his players, acknowledging they wanted him to be more available and connected to the team. Changes were made and the Fighting Irish took off on the best run the program had since its glory run under Lou Holtz, bulldozing to five consecutive double-digit win seasons and two College Football Playoff appearances. “When Brian Kelly’s at Notre Dame, he can be his CEO self. He’s often surrounded by excellent staff members and business just goes on as usual,” the former assistant said. Thirty years of being one of the most successful coaches in college football has made Kelly confident in his ability to build a winning program. At LSU, he seems to have underestimated the need to adjust. Kelly brought with him from Notre Dame an accountability system for the players, which rewards and penalizes things such as timeliness, dress code, health and wellness check-ins and taking nutritional supplements. Players are either above the line or below the line, and being below can result in a loss of playing time. Advertisement “You can’t be late for meetings. You’ve got to take your vitamins every day. You have to do a wellness check-in app on your phone every day, and for (some of) these guys it’s a foreign language to them,” the former staffer said. “… Installing culture is a great idea, but now the way you’re installing culture is actually creating a culture problem.” Charles Turner, who arrived at LSU in 2019 for the Tigers national title team and was the team’s starting center in 2022 and ‘23, said he had hardly any personal interactions in two seasons playing for Kelly. Turner said players had to schedule appointments to visit Kelly, which was much different than Orgeron’s open-door policy. “For Coach Kelly, I think this is a different dynamic for him. … When I was playing for Kelly the last two years, I didn’t talk to him. I started every game for him. Just, ‘Hey, hi. How you doing?’ And that was really it. We never talked Xs and Os. I never sat in his office and got personal with him. He really never got to know me.” Turner said he hopes Kelly can get it turned around but added he “might not be the best fit” for LSU. “He’s definitely a good coach, but as far as championships and all that other stuff, you gotta come a different way with your players,” Turner said. “You have to let your players know that you really got ’em.” A second former assistant echoed Turner: “If you don’t really know the players, if you don’t know how to come at them, don’t know how to talk to them, don’t know how to build relationships with them — if you’re not involved with them, it’s not gonna work.” Another source said Kelly makes an effort to try to connect with his players, though it doesn’t always seem to come naturally to the coach. “I think the (players) that believe in him, believe in him,” the source long affiliated with LSU said. “He’s had to find his way when he first got here because it is a different animal.” Advertisement Of the two sideline dust-ups at Florida, Kelly chewing out Hilton drew the most attention. “I do think he is held to a little bit of an unfair (standard) because people want to see him fail,” the former assistant said. Kelly alluded to this during an interview with Paul Finebaum on the SEC Network last week.  “I find it kind of interesting that I am the only coach in the country that has conversations with their players on the sideline. But be that as it may, we were having a coaching moment with one of my wide receivers, you know, who is desperately wanting to make big plays for us,” Kelly said. Lacy initiating an exchange with Kelly was more notable. Whether it was a red flag signaling deeper problems or an isolated incident, it was something not seen much at the college level between head coach and player. Kelly said during the interview he had no issue with Lacy expressing his frustration. “Unfortunately sometimes the camera’s in our office where we’re working, and that comes with being the head coach at a high-profile institution like LSU,” he said. It was one of the first questions Kelly faced after the move: Would he be able to recruit in the SEC against the likes of Georgia’s Kirby Smart and Alabama’s Nick Saban? Kelly and his initial staff were short on recruiting ties and institutional knowledge of a talent-rich state where battles can be fierce. New Orleans native and longtime SEC assistant Frank Wilson was the one notable addition to the first staff to build those Louisiana connections, but Kelly put Brian Polian, who had been a key member of his staff at Notre Dame, in charge of recruiting. Kelly himself has never been as hands-on and immersed in the recruiting process as might be necessary to compete with SEC machines, where a top-10 national class might rank closer to the middle of the conference than the top. Advertisement “You sit down with these parents and these guardians and these people that are around these kids, and a big part of their decision making is, ‘Who do I trust? Who gives off this vibe that, you know, I want my kid to be with?’ And I think BK probably struggles there a little bit. I think they bring him in as the closer, and I don’t know that that’s his specialty,” the former staff member said. LSU’s recruiting classes under Kelly haven’t been poorly rated. The 2022 class he mostly inherited was ranked 12th in the country by 247Sports’ composite rankings, because it only had 15 players. The stars were offensive tackles Will Campbell and Emery Jones, tight end Mason Taylor and linebacker Harold Perkins Jr., all juniors who could jump to the NFL after this season. Almost half that class, seven players, has already transferred out. LSU’s first full recruiting class under Kelly in 2023 ranked sixth in the country in the 247Sports Composite. Only 10 of the 26 signees were from Louisiana high schools. Only 15 members of the class are still with the team. Most notably, five-star offensive lineman Lance Heard from Bonita, La., transferred to Tennessee, where he starts. The class that should be the backbone of next year’s LSU team has so far produced four significant contributors, led by linebacker Whit Weeks. Instead, there is a glaring hole in the roster. “We didn’t need to go to all those other places (outside LSU’s traditional footprint) to get guys. We’ve got guys right here. I think you had arrogance, and that’s what happened. It set us back. There’s no doubt,” the source long affiliated with the program said. “(Polian) was still recruiting like he had at Notre Dame.” Of course high school recruiting isn’t the only way to improve a roster these days. LSU found a Heisman winner in Daniels in the transfer portal in 2022. Two of the team’s best players this season, edge rusher Bradyn Swinson and receiver Aaron Anderson, were portal additions in 2023. Still, LSU under Kelly has not shown the capacity to transform the roster through transfers the way SEC rival Ole Miss has done under Lane Kiffin. Though Kelly’s biggest win this season came against the Rebels, who have shown portaling to the championship can be a perilous path. Advertisement There are also questions about how well LSU is keeping up with the competition when it comes to name, image and likeness compensation for players. “Some of it has been the misperception that this place is rolling in dough, when the reality of it is they are losing recruits because they’re simply being outbid,” one of the former assistants said. That appears to be the case for what might turn out to be a bigger loss than anything that has happened on the field this season. Late last week, Underwood — who was primarily recruited by Sloan — decommitted from LSU after 10 months. Underwood is reportedly set to receive an NIL deal worth millions over multiple years for going to Michigan. Back in May, Kelly lamented LSU coming up short when portal shopping: “We were in the market, in the transfer portal, looking for defensive linemen. It hasn’t fared very well, quite frankly, because we are selling something a little bit differently. And that is, we want to recruit. We want to engage, build relationships. We want to develop, retain, and have success. We’re not in the market of buying players. … And unfortunately, right now, that’s what some guys are looking for. They want to be bought. … We’re not going to go out and buy players.” With revenue-sharing with players on the horizon, and possibly less emphasis on booster-funded NIL deals, the system might be moving in Kelly’s favor. Despite dissatisfaction at LSU — there were some “Fire Kelly” chants coming from the student section early in Saturday’s 24-17 home victory against Vanderbilt — Kelly will not be ousted anytime soon. “Nothing happens without him being the head coach because it is an economic problem that they cannot solve,” a second former LSU staffer said. Woodward gave Kelly a 10-year guaranteed contract, and the buyout currently sits at $64.5 million. That goes down by $9.5 million annually. Advertisement It’s easy to look at the declining results and apparent trajectory of LSU football and conclude Kelly will enter Year 4 on a hot seat, with a roster unable to compete for a Playoff spot. Economics might force patience, and not everybody believes this situation is irreversible. “I think where LSU’s in a good spot is BK is Scott’s guy. Scott is BK’s guy, they’re gonna work together. (LSU) President (William) Tate’s supportive. They do actually have the pieces in place right now, they just don’t have the roster in place,” the former staffer said. A victory over the Commodores is no cause for celebration at LSU — more of a temporary respite after three weeks of mostly bad news and a little something to back up the signs of progress Kelly insists he sees. “Based upon the feedback that I’m getting from (weekly meetings with) our leadership council here, we’re right on where we need to be in terms of building the foundation of our program,” Kelly said last week. “We have to continue to recruit. Our players are playing hard. They’re playing with the right kind of attitude. But this is the SEC. And the talent is real.” (Top photo: Meech Robinson/ The Athletic; Photo: James Gilbert / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,Why Some N.H.L. Fans Are Happily Paying $30 for Chicken Fingers,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5938987/2024/11/25/vegas-zamboni-chicken-gravy/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 21:46:58 +0000","Sales for a Zamboni filled with chicken are exceeding expectations, according to the Las Vegas Golden Knights.","NHL The Zamboni is an institution in hockey. Anyone who grew up attending hockey games as a child likely has fond memories of the machine slowly circling the rink, humming along while leaving a pristine, glistening sheet of ice in its wake. Perhaps some even had the honor of riding shotgun, listening to the 1990 song “(I Wanna Drive the) Zamboni” by the Gear Daddies. Advertisement For those who played hockey at any level, the Zamboni has served as a universal clock for the start of the game. You’re in your dressing room lacing up your skates when a teammate walks through the door and says, “The Zam has two turns left,” and suddenly everyone in the room knows exactly how much time they have to finish getting dressed. The Zamboni is so iconic the actual name for the machine — ice resurfacer — is rarely if ever spoken. Perhaps the only way to make the vehicle more revered by hockey lovers, is to fill it with delicious food. That’s exactly what the Vegas Golden Knights have done. The team’s newest promotion is selling small, plastic Zambonis at concession stands inside T-Mobile Arena, filled with chicken fingers and fries. “It was something that would be memorable for all fans, something that is unique to the game of hockey, and something that was just very different from a traditional bucket or cup that would create a lasting experience,” said Kris Knief, the Golden Knights’ vice president of strategy and innovation. “It’s one of the most iconic elements of hockey. It’s not just youth-driven. It’s every demographic across the board.” The chicken-filled Zamboni costs approximately $30, and the sales are already exceeding the team’s expectations. They sold more than 2,000 units during the first 10 home games. “We didn’t know if this would be sticky or not, but in the end the sentiment has been fantastic,” Knief said. “We’re getting calls from several different NHL clubs around the league, and Levy (a restaurant and hospitality company that supplies food and beverage for T-Mobile Arena) is looking at other elements of what this concept could be for different venues outside of the traditional core-four sports.” Kid is obsessed with Zambonis and calls them “momma” which is incredible. Gravy boat is definitely second to chicken finger basket Zamboni. pic.twitter.com/OQsymyOFnp — Everett Duke (@Everett_Duke) November 20, 2024  The chicken buckets aren’t the only Zamboni-themed promotion for the Golden Knights this season. The team also created a special ticket package for the Nov. 11 game against the Hurricanes that included a Zamboni gravy boat — a promotion that is becoming a popular trend around the NHL. Vegas’ ticketing department generally orders 500 units for each special collectible giveaway in order to make it rare or exclusive, but Vegas knew the demand for the Zambonis would be much higher than usual. Advertisement “We doubled the order size just because we knew it was going to be such a success,” said Amanda Fleming, senior director of group and event suite ticket sales for the Golden Knights. Fans received the gravy boat as a part of their single-game tickets, and the team also offered season-ticket holders who already have tickets the chance to add the gravy boat on for an additional $45. The gravy boats are currently selling on eBay for around $65, but there haven’t been too many that have made it to the secondary market yet. “As you would imagine, it was one of our largest add-ons to date,” Fleming said. The Golden Knights didn’t invent the gravy boat promotion. The Detroit Red Wings have been producing them for years, and ran their promotion this month. Other NHL teams, such as the Buffalo Sabres, Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington Capitals, will be doing gravy-boat giveaways. But as with just about everything, Vegas did have to put its own twist on it by painting it in chrome gold. “The factory pushed back a couple of times just because you can’t microwave that chrome material, or put it in the dishwasher, but we really wanted the look and feel of what is true to the VGK brand that we’ve created,” Fleming explained. Kitchen tables across the Las Vegas Valley will be glistening with gold Zambonis overflowing with gravy this Thanksgiving. The gleaming, lustrous centerpieces are sure to spark conversation, which is exactly what the team is hoping for. “Our anticipation is to continue to evolve with more holiday, family talking points,” Fleming said. “We started with the apron (giveaway last season). We have a few more ideas in the mix to continue to bring Golden Knights merchandise to the family setting.” The creative process is a lengthy one. Fleming says the team begins brainstorming ideas in March for promotions for the following season. That leaves plenty of time for them to work out the licensing and overseas production. Advertisement Vegas typically has approximately 20 special ticket packages throughout the season. They held an “Emo Knight” in October with distressed graphic t-shirt giveaways and puck rock music in the arena, and will host “Hello Kitty Knight” in late January. The minor league AHL affiliate, the Henderson Silver Knights, have followed suit. They gave team-themed Zamboni gravy boats to the first 5,000 fans in attendance for their game against the Abbotsford Canucks on Nov. 22. we know what your holiday season needs! 🎁 pic.twitter.com/m8iSR2Yphp — Henderson Silver Knights (@HSKnights) November 7, 2024  The Zamboni-themed promotions are a universal success, so expect plenty more to come.

Tonight's Monday Night Football game is a matchup between two seven-win AFC teams. It's also a contest between the Harbaugh brothers, John and Jim, squaring off for the first time as dueling coaches since Super Bowl XLVII.  Stream the game on Fubo and find the best deals on StubHub.   Jim Harbaugh called it a “big-time football fight,” and that feels like an apt description of the Los Angeles Chargers’ Sunday night win over the Cincinnati Bengals. “It was like two heavyweights going at it,” Harbaugh said. The Chargers dominated the early rounds. The Bengals — namely Joe Burrow, Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins — got their haymakers off in the later rounds. The Chargers delivered the knockout blow in the waning seconds of the final round. Read more on the Chargers thrilling Week 11 win below.  GO FURTHER What we learned from the Chargers’ win over the Bengals: ‘Tremendous feeling of victory’ Advertisement  Who doesn’t love a bet in a game involving two brothers coaching against each other? The Ravens pass defense is the issue for me here. Despite giving up only 18 points against a meh Steelers offense last week, the Ravens allowed Russell Wilson to move the ball with relative ease. Justin Herbert shouldn’t have an issue moving the ball either. Now, I do have some worries about some injuries on the Chargers defense. I think Khalil Mack should be good to go, but the status of Cam Hart and Denzel Perryman will be key to watch here after they got banged up on Sunday Night Football. Worst price to bet: Chargers +3 (-115) Getty Images For Los Angeles, tight end Hayden Hurst (hip) and linebacker Denzel Perryman (groin) have both been ruled out. Hurst has been placed on injured reserve. Linebacker Khalil Mack (groin), linebacker Bud Dupree (foot), and cornerback Cam Hart (concussion/ankle) are all questionable. Wide receiver Ladd McConkey (shoulder) is also listed as questionable but is expected to play.  Other roster moves the Chargers made today include:  For Baltimore, center Tyler Linderbaum (back) and defensive tackle Travis Jones (ankle) are both questionable. Cornerback Arthur Maulet (calf) and safety Sanoussi Kane (ankle) have been ruled out. Linebacker Roquan Smith (hamstring) is also listed as questionable but is not expected to play tonight.  Baltimore Ravens (-3) at Los Angeles Chargers The Ravens defense (285 yards per game against) has been bad against the pass all season and now faces one of the hottest quarterbacks in the league in Herbert. He has thrown for 1,022 yards, tossed seven touchdowns and had zero interceptions during the four-game winning streak. Harbaugh gave him some high praise, while he also has the Chargers defense leading the league, giving up just 14.5 points per game. Khalil Mack rested up last week so he could help chase down Lamar Jackson. The Chargers held Jackson to 39 yards rushing in a 20-10 loss last season and have a better run defense this year, so Derrick Henry may also have a hard time busting out. Plus, Justin Tucker stinks all of a sudden. Los Angeles is the NFL capital of the world after Sunday and Monday night. The pick: Chargers  In their 2023 matchup, the Baltimore Ravens trounced the Los Angeles Chargers 20-10. Lamar Jackson went 18-of-32 passing for 177 yards and one touchdown.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Memphis knocks off UConn in OT thriller at Maui Invitational after Dan Hurley technical,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5947714/2024/11/25/uconn-memphis-maui-invitational-dan-hurley/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 22:37:25 GMT",Penny Hardaway's Tigers dealt the two-time defending national champs their first loss since Feb. 20.,"NCAAM LAHAINA, Hawaii — It was Maui magic. An instant classic. But at the end of 45 back-and-forth minutes — which featured an 18-5 UConn run to end regulation; a buzzer-beating 3 by Solo Ball to force overtime; offsetting technical fouls due to a shoving match in overtime; a technical foul on Huskies coach Dan Hurley for calling officials a “f—ing joke”; Memphis making seven of its eight free throws, six by PJ Carter; and UConn airballing its desperation 3-point heave as time expired — Memphis outlasted No. 2 UConn 99-97 to snap the longest winning streak in Division I at 17 games, dealing the two-time defending national champs their first loss since Feb. 20. Advertisement And that was all before lunchtime locally. Turns out the Maui Invitational did miss the Lahaina Civic Center. The tournament’s triumphant return to its longtime home, after moving to Honolulu last year in the wake of the August 2023 wildfires, more than delivered. Tyrese Hunter led Memphis with 26 points, tying a career high with seven 3-pointers, but Carter was the late star, saving Memphis by canning all six of his overtime free throws after Hurley’s late technical. Ball, whose 3-pointer with 1.2 seconds left in regulation capped a frantic UConn comeback attempt, finished with 10 points but fouled out in overtime, one of three Huskies who ended the game stuck to the pine. Tarris Reed Jr., who set a new season high with 22 points, led UConn in scoring, while Alex Karaban’s four 3-pointers were critical to the game even making it past regulation. When Hunter hit his seventh 3 with 8:35 left, putting Memphis up 10, it seemed like the Huskies would lose their first nonconference game since last season’s epic against Kansas in Allen Fieldhouse. But the Huskies never withered, with Karaban and Liam McNeeley’s 3-point shooting pulling them back into it. Memphis, meanwhile, didn’t make a field goal over the final four minutes of regulation. And as if this game needed any more theatrics, the reason UConn got one last look to send the game to extra time? Because Memphis was called for a 10-second violation with 14.2 seconds left, setting up Ball’s big-time 3. In overtime, both teams traded baskets to start, but hoops eventually gave way to hysteria when Memphis bigs Moussa Cisse and Dain Dainja got into an altercation with UConn big Samson Johnson, bringing both benches to the brink of clearing. Even Hurley and Hardaway got involved, with Memphis assistant Nolan Smith trying to play peacemaker. Eventually Dainja and Samson were both assessed technical fouls, but it was Samson’s fifth, leaving UConn without a viable big man for the game’s final few minutes. Meanwhile, Memphis star PJ Haggerty — who finished with 22 points, 11 of which came at the free-throw line — had fouled out in the final 30 seconds of regulation trying to go for a game-sealing defensive rebound. Advertisement But the deciding factor Monday afternoon was when Hurley, whose bench was assessed an early technical for complaining to officials after UConn picked up six personal fouls in the game’s first five minutes, blew his top with 40 seconds left after McNeeley was called for an over-the-back foul trying to grab an offensive rebound. Hurley had to be restrained by assistant Luke Murray, but the damage was done. His technical gave Memphis two more shots in addition to the two it earned from McNeeley’s foul. Carter sank all four, giving Memphis the margin it ultimately needed to ride out the rest of the game. Memphis will now play the winner of Michigan State and Colorado in the semifinals on Tuesday, while UConn will take on the loser in the consolation bracket.

Are the 49ers out of time? (Getty Images)              The Washington Commanders may need to snap their three-game losing streak without a trio of offensive starters. Running backs Austin Ekeler and Brian Robinson, and right tackle Andrew Wylie were injured during Sunday’s surprising 34-26 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. Updates from head coach Dan Quinn on Monday afternoon suggest uncertain status for each player in the Week 13 home game against the Tennessee Titans. Ekeler, along with Wylie, is in concussion protocol. The running back took a blow while returning a kickoff in the final moments of Washington’s failed comeback. Down on the field for several minutes, Ekeler walked off the field wobbly. The team sent him to the hospital following the game for observations. Scans came back,” good,” Quinn said after visiting earlier on Monday with Washington’s third-leading rusher (355 yards) and receiver (33 catches). Ekeler previously sat out one game after a concussion in the Week 3 victory over Cincinnati. Having already missed three games with hamstring and knee injuries and limited in another, Robinson only received five carries after suffering an ankle injury on Washington’s opening drive. The power back received treatment on Monday. “We'll see how much work he does during the week,” Quinn said. “I'll have a better sense …  as we get further along.” The 7-5 Commanders are 2-3 in games either without Robinson or when he carries the ball less than 10 times. Should Ekeler or Robinson miss the upcoming home game against the Titans, Jeremy McNichols is the only active running back on the roster. Washington released Chris Rodriguez this weekend to open a roster spot. Rodriguez offers the best chance to replace Robinson’s interior running if he re-signs to the practice squad. GO FURTHER The Commanders split apart on the field Sunday, continuing an ill-timed reversal of fortune Advertisement When the Baltimore Ravens met as a team in preparation for Monday night’s game against the Los Angeles Chargers, coach John Harbaugh wanted to get ahead of the most prominent storyline of the week. Yes, the Chargers are coached by Jim Harbaugh, John’s younger brother. And yes, the connections between the two franchises run deep. The Chargers’ front office, coaching staff and roster is loaded with former Ravens. Yet, John wanted his players to know that none of that mattered inside the building this week. “We’ve told some stories in the past, but not this week,” Harbaugh said. “Really this week, for the players and the coaches, it’s not about that. We have such a challenge. The challenge is playing the game. Getting in that game and playing that game against that team is the biggest challenge you could have, and that’s what everybody is focused on.” Harbaugh’s Ravens are 7-4 after last weekend’s deflating defeat by the Pittsburgh Steelers. Issues with penalties and their normally reliable kicker, and injuries in the middle of their defense, are concerns for the Ravens, who have two tough games in six days. A loss by the Steelers (8-3) to the Cleveland Browns on Thursday keeps the Ravens in striking distance of first place in the AFC North. Yet, a second consecutive defeat Monday would be damaging, particularly with the Philadelphia Eagles arriving in Baltimore on a short week for a game Sunday. The third matchup between the head-coaching brothers — John won the first two, including a victory over Jim’s San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII nearly a dozen years ago — comes at a time when the Chargers have rattled off four consecutive wins to emerge as contenders in the AFC.

GO FURTHER The Seahawks are finally playing contender-level defense. When will the offense catch up? (Getty Images)              EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — It took 11 games. Two meager wins and nine disappointing losses for the frustrations of a season to boil over for New York Giants rookie wide receiver Malik Nabers. It took 11 games for the rookie to be ready to stand at his locker and spill to reporters how disgusted he felt after yet another Giants defeat, their sixth straight. The overall message wasn’t surprising — “I’m tired of going out there and losing” — but the rookie didn’t mince words when asked how he’d describe the team’s effort during Sunday’s 30-7 drubbing at the hands of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. “Soft as f—,” said the No. 6 pick in the 2024 draft. To be clear, Nabers wasn’t the only person in the Giants locker room delivering scathing remarks about the team’s poor performance Sunday. “We played soft,” team captain Dexter Lawrence said. “And they beat the s— out of us today.” That Nabers was among the players speaking out only demonstrates how far off the rails this season has gone. The receiver was selected out of LSU to help lift the Giants offense and lend it a new explosive dynamic. Instead, the Giants offense has become the league’s worst, and Nabers is fed up with it. Read more here. GO FURTHER Giants’ Malik Nabers is ‘tired of losing,’ sick of trying to explain why offense is inept The New York Jets’ roots as a brash and unapologetic upstart, cemented by Joe Namath’s Super Bowl III bravado, differentiated them from the old-guard New York Giants for decades. When the Jets had bombastic and playful Rex Ryan as their coach, the Giants had stern taskmaster Tom Coughlin. When the Jets were going all-in on the polarizing Aaron Rodgers, the Giants were hoping the fifth and sixth seasons of nice guy Daniel Jones might turn out differently. If the Jets aspired to be cryptocurrency, the Giants hoped to be the S&P 500. What’s the difference when both are competitively bankrupt? The Pick Six column leads this week by examining how the Giants resemble the Jets, in results if not always process. If Tampa Bay’s Baker Mayfield mocking Giants fill-in Tommy DeVito during a 30-7 Buccaneers rout at MetLife Stadium helped drive home the point, great, but the evidence has been accumulating for years. The full Pick Six menu this week: GO FURTHER Are the Giants less ‘clown show’ than the Jets? It’s getting harder to tell: Sando’s Pick Six Advertisement (Getty Images)              The Indianapolis Colts are one game away from entering their Week 14 bye. The time away should help them refocus over the final stretch of what’s shaping up to be an eventful conclusion to the regular season. It’s not just that the Colts, despite losing four of their past five games, remain in the playoff hunt. It’s that the teams they’ll face down the stretch give them a realistic shot to earn their first postseason berth since 2020. Indianapolis’ final five games feature matchups against the Patriots, Broncos, Titans, Giants and Jaguars. Excluding Denver, which is 7-5, the other four opponents are a combined 10-35. In other words, these are very winnable games. Of course, the Colts still have their own issues to figure out if they hope to take advantage of their soft schedule. Quarterback Anthony Richardson has played better since returning from his benching, but the offensive line has struggled, running back Jonathan Taylor has become a non-factor, and too much is being asked of a middling defense that was bad to start the season but has made significant strides to give Indianapolis chances it keeps squandering. So, now I’ll turn it over to you. What’s on your mind amid yet another up-and-down Colts campaign? Whether it’s schedule-, coaching- or personnel-related, please share your questions here, so I can answer them in a post-Thanksgiving mailbag! GO FURTHER Submit a question for James Boyd’s Indianapolis Colts mailbag Jourdan Rodrigue writes that between all the Saquon Barkley big runs and explosive plays by the Eagles and harassment of Matthew Stafford, the Rams didn't look like a team ready to hang with the NFL serious contenders “You just go back to work. I don’t know any other way to go about it,"" Rams coach Sean McVay said after the Eagles beat them up Sunday. ""Sunday Night Football"" live blog GO FURTHER Rams can’t run with the big-time postseason teams if they can get run over (Getty Images)              Indianapolis Colts wide receiver Josh Downs sustained a right shoulder injury in his team’s loss to the Detroit Lions on Sunday, and he is considered week-to-week, a league source told The Athletic on Monday. Downs’ availability for next week’s game at New England is also in question, though the belief is that he did not suffer a severe injury. Downs got hurt after making a 7-yard catch and being tackled with about 11 minutes left in Sunday’s game. His right shoulder appeared to be driven into the turf as Lions linebackers Malcolm Rodriguez and David Long Jr. took him to the ground. Downs immediately grabbed at his right shoulder and stayed down before eventually getting up and walking off the field. He reentered the game on the Colts’ next series and wound up playing 29 of a possible 55 offensive snaps. Indianapolis could choose to be cautious with Downs since it only has one game left before its bye week. If Downs is held out against the Patriots, it would be a significant blow to the Colts’ offense. The second-year pro missed the first two games of the season due to a right high ankle sprain, but he still leads Indianapolis in targets (78), catches (53) and receiving yards per game (59.4). Downs is also tied with fellow wideout Alec Pierce for the team-high in receiving touchdowns (four). Pierce got banged up as well in the second half of Sunday’s contest. He had his right ankle re-taped by trainers on the sideline, and he was walking gingerly in the locker room after the game. Despite his gait, Pierce is “good,” a league source told The Athletic, and there’s no reason to be overly concerned about his status moving forward. Pierce is averaging a league-high 23.3 yards per catch this season. NFL Network's Ian Rapoport first reported the news of Downs' shoulder injury. GO FURTHER Colts ask too much of QB Anthony Richardson in sloppy loss to Lions After a hot start with Russell Wilson, the Steelers' offense has hit a rut. Let's take a closer look at which areas need improvements. 8 — times sacked Even though the Steelers have invested heavily in their offensive line, they have not done a great job of protecting the quarterback at any point this season. Through the first nine games, they allowed 2.67 sacks per game, tied for the 11th most. Over the last two games? That’s jumped up to four sacks per game. The underlying numbers have also regressed. Over the first nine games, the Steelers allowed a sack on 8.9 percent of dropbacks (ninth-highest rate) and pressure on 38.6 percent of snaps (fifth-highest). Over the last two, that’s up to 11 percent and 40 percent, respectively. When it comes to identifying the problem, it’s really been a mix of everything. In some instances, individual players have been exposed. Both offensive tackles, in particular, have had their rough moments. Other times, the Steelers haven’t adapted well to the opponent’s schematics. For example, the Browns confused the Steelers’ offensive line with several stunts, including when Myles Garrett twisted inside to blow right past center Zach Frazier. It was one of the few times in his young career Frazier has looked like a rookie. There have also been several times when Wilson has held the ball too long. He led the league in sacks taken in two of the previous five seasons. The Steelers will need to reverse this trend, or the offense might continue to sputter. Read here for more stats. GO FURTHER Explaining the Steelers’ 7 touchdown-less quarters with 7 stats LANDOVER, Md. — Sunday’s game puts you in a strange spot as a fan. At 3-7, you assume your team’s season is over, so a part of you wants as many losses as possible, leading to the highest possible draft pick. But then your fandom kicks in. Your team has a chance to win a game they entered as double-digit underdogs. The Dallas Cowboys outlasted the Commanders in a wild finish Sunday at Washington. It ended Dallas’ five-game losing streak, its longest in the last nine years. But it also provided a significant blow to those who were hoping for a chance at the No. 1 overall pick. And by the looks of the rest of the schedule, it’s unlikely that the Cowboys will end up in the top 5 and maybe not the top 10. According to Tankathon.com, if the season ended today, Dallas would have the 11th overall pick. Heading into Sunday’s game, the Cowboys had worked their way up to ninth, a game and a half back of No. 1 overall. They’re now two games back of the Jacksonville Jaguars, New York Giants and Las Vegas Raiders, who all seem committed to legitimately competing for No. 1 overall. Of the 10 teams currently ahead of the Cowboys, three are still remaining on Dallas’ schedule: Thursday vs. the Giants (currently picking second), Week 14 vs. the Cincinnati Bengals (10th) and Week 15 at the Carolina Panthers (fifth). If your goal was to land Colorado superstar CB/WR Travis Hunter, the dream died in Landover, Maryland. The mock draft studying probably needs to shift to more of the 10-to-20 range.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Newcastle 0 West Ham 2: Wilson makes return but Burn a big miss in a limp home defeat,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5940191/2024/11/25/newcastle-west-ham-defeat-burn-wilson/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 21:56:13 GMT","Newcastle miss a chance to go sixth in the table, and only two points off second-placed Man City, after a disappointing 2-0 loss to West Ham","EPL Newcastle United suffered a disappointing home defeat to West Ham United in the Premier League, ending their three-match winning run in all competitions. Goals from Tomas Soucek — the first Newcastle had conceded from a corner in the league this season — and the right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka secured a 2-0 win for West Ham, whose manager Julen Lopetegui has been under pressure in recent weeks. Advertisement It was only the third time that Newcastle have lost in the league at St James’ Park in 2024, and counts as a big missed opportunity for Eddie Howe’s side, who sit 10th in the table after 12 games. Chris Waugh analyses the key talking points from the defeat at St James’ Park… The international break definitely did come at the wrong time for Newcastle. Three successive wins in all competitions heading into the two-week hiatus and that momentum has been well and truly checked.
 Optimism and expectation are dangerous in these parts. There was so much belief among the home faithful heading into this game and, given the respective recent fortunes of both sides, that was understandable.
 But Newcastle’s season so far has been a case of false starts, stuttering form and inconsistency. Howe keeps mentioning the word “consistency”, admitting that, while it is “boring”, it is what Newcastle desperately require.
 Newcastle have scored just 13 goals in 12 Premier League matches and only five players have found the back of the net this season, the second-lowest in the top flight. They are not the free-flowing side in attack of the past two seasons, or at least they have only been so on frustratingly few occasions in 2024-25.
 This defeat was costly, not only affecting their confidence levels, but also representing a missed opportunity. A win would have sent Newcastle sixth, only a point behind the Champions League positions and two shy of second-placed Manchester City.
 Instead, Newcastle are ninth, only three points above West Ham, who are 14th. The table is ridiculously congested, but even so, until Newcastle start stringing a run of wins together, they will not be able to realise their European-qualification ambitions. Heading into this match, Newcastle had the second-meanest defence in the Premier League. After conceding just four goals in their last seven matches across all competitions and registering four clean sheets during that time, Howe’s side were showing signs of rediscovering the excellent defensive form they displayed throughout the 2022-23 campaign, when they qualified for the Champions League. Advertisement While West Ham were restricted to a first-half expected goals (xG) return of just 0.21 and managed only two shots on target, Newcastle did show uncharacteristic sloppiness when defending a set piece to gift the visitors a 10th-minute lead. Lloyd Kelly, deputising at left-sided centre-half with Dan Burn serving a one-match suspension after picking up five bookings, was marking Soucek. But a couple of feints and some decent movement from Soucek bamboozled Kelly, who lost his man, allowing the Czech Republic international to direct a free header into the right-hand corner of the net from an Emerson Palmieri corner. It was the first time Newcastle had conceded from a corner this season, at the 70th attempt, highlighting Burn’s importance in such situations. He was a fixture of the team who qualified for the Champions League two seasons ago, albeit primarily from left-back, and his height and experience are influential. There was so much optimism and expectation on Tyneside heading into this game and yet one lapse of concentration burst that positive momentum inside 10 minutes. For the first time this season, Callum Wilson was named in a matchday squad. And, for the first time since the final day of 2023-24 at Brentford, he made an appearance, too.
 Wilson missed the first 14 matches in all competitions due to back and hamstring injuries, while he had featured in just six of a possible 37 across all competitions in 2024.  Across six appearances this calendar year, he had played for only 262 minutes due to a succession of fitness issues.
 Having the 32-year-old back among the substitutes was a huge boost for Newcastle. Yet, by the time he was introduced in the 68th minute, the home side were already 2-0 down and lacking direction.
 Wilson replaced Anthony Gordon and joined Alexander Isak up front, as Howe switched to a 4-4-2 formation, with Harvey Barnes on the left wing and Jacob Murphy on the right.
 Advertisement It did not have the desired effect. The gaps between the defence, midfield and front two were too large, and Newcastle were disjointed in their build-up play, at times even directionless. Wilson was rarely given a clear-cut chance, even if he did appeal for a penalty when Konstantinos Mavropanos appeared to put his arms around the striker in the box.
 Wilson being fit again is a positive for Newcastle, even if it was not on the night. We will bring you this after he has spoken at the post-match press conference.

Advertisement Rather than have the Rays host the Los Angeles Angels as originally planned in August, they’ll now host that series from April 8-10. The Rays will travel to California for another three-game series with the Angels beginning Aug. 4. The Minnesota Twins’ visit to Steinbrenner Field was moved from the Fourth of July weekend to May 26-28. The Rays will visit the Twins for a three-game series starting July 4. The Rays will not play the 2025 season at Tropicana Field because of damage to the stadium and its roof caused by Hurricane Milton in October. Repairs for the stadium were estimated to cost more than $50 million. Whether the Rays will be able to return to Tropicana in future seasons is still unknown. If construction were to begin in March, as laid out in a timeline in the damage estimate report, the repairs would not be completed until just days before the likely start of the 2026 season. The city of St. Petersburg, Fla., and the Rays still have to decide whether rebuilding is worth the investment because the team was already planning to move into a new stadium in 2028. However, that plan is currently on hold after the Pinellas County Board of Commissioners postponed a vote to approve bonds that would finance the ballpark’s construction.

Peppers had been on the list since Oct. 9, which barred him from practicing or playing with the team. By removing him from the list, the league has paved the way for Peppers to play with the Patriots, potentially as soon as Sunday’s game against the Indianapolis Colts. Advertisement Peppers was charged in October with assault and battery, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, strangulation, and possession of a Class “B” substance believed to be cocaine, per a police report. Police responded to an incident involving Peppers and a woman. At a hearing last week, Peppers’ attorney claimed that the woman sought $10.5 million to drop the case, an allegation that representatives for the woman denied. A judge in Quincy, Mass. set a jury trial to begin on Jan. 22, which is a couple weeks after the Patriots’ season is scheduled to end. “I just want to be clear that any act of domestic violence is unacceptable for us,” Patriots coach Jerod Mayo said in October. “… As a team and staff, we’re wholeheartedly against domestic violence. With that being said, I do think Jabrill has to go through the system and go through due process. … “As a father of three daughters, I understand the seriousness of the allegations and hopefully they’re not true.” Peppers had been voted a captain by his teammates and had become a vocal leader for a rebuilding team. He signed a three-year, $24 million extension in August. Peppers has missed the last six games while on the exempt list — he missed a seventh with a shoulder injury before being placed on the exempt list — which is only used for what the league calls “unusual” circumstances. Those circumstances can include players facing either felony charges or charges that involve the use of physical force. Players on the list are still paid. The NFL said it opened a preliminary investigation into the incident. That investigation remains ongoing while Peppers awaits a jury trial and while he’s now cleared to return to the football field. The Patriots are 3-9 this season and have a rare Tuesday practice scheduled due to the holiday week, which means that will be Peppers’ first chance to be on the field with teammates since October.

The 21-year-old underwent surgery to insert a pin in his foot in the U.S. last Friday, with his German club Wolfsburg confirming the procedure “went smoothly”. Sources close to the player indicate that he may not return until January. Advertisement Paredes, who shone for the U.S. men’s Olympic team in Paris this summer, has been unable to play any part in Wolfsburg’s season so far following a breakthrough campaign in 2023-24 when he made 28 appearances and scored three goals. He fractured his foot during training in August and had been close to a return earlier this month. However, persistent pain prompted the decision to have a small pin inserted to complete the healing process. Normally, the recovery from such a procedure takes around two months. Wolfsburg will monitor Paredes carefully and hope for a potentially swifter outcome given all his rehabilitation efforts have strengthened his foot. The conservative estimate, though, is that he will return to full fitness after Wolfsburg’s winter break in January. It means he could also be unavailable for selection for the national team’s January 18 friendly with Venezuela in Fort Lauderdale. “Unfortunately after 14 weeks of rehab, I have undergone surgery and will be sidelined for a bit longer this season,” Paredes wrote on Instagram. “I want to wish my team-mates and fans all the best for the remainder of the time. I can’t wait to return and get back to doing what I love most.” Paredes is continuing his recovery at home in Virginia.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,GM joins F1: A big win for storied U.S. motorsports brand chasing global success,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5947705/2024/11/25/general-motors-joins-f1-2026/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 21:17:36 GMT",GM has seen decades of success in racing — but largely on a domestic level. Racing in F1 could change that dramatically.,"Formula 1 The smile on Jim Campbell’s face shone brighter than the neon lights inside the Formula One paddock in Las Vegas. Though General Motors’ vice president for performance and motorsports wouldn’t confirm the impending good news for his Cadillac brand on Saturday night, Campbell’s unerasable grin revealed the lack of a poker face that would have made him go bust at one of the nearby casinos. Advertisement GM and Cadillac are on track to join F1 in a major way, with official confirmation on Monday that the manufacturer and business partner Dan Towriss have an agreement in principle with F1 to field the long-discussed 11th team on the grid in 2026. Not only will the Cadillac F1 Team join F1 with two cars if its application is finalized, but it will also create its own engine and become a works team by the end of the decade. That represents a massive new motorsports investment by GM, which has seen decades of success in racing — but largely on a domestic level. GM brands Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile and Buick have not only accounted for the most wins in NASCAR history (nearly 1,200 in the Cup Series), but no one else is particularly close. Chevrolet alone has won the NASCAR manufacturer’s championship a whopping 43 times; Ford is next with 17. Chevrolet has also won 13 Indianapolis 500s and has a history that dates back to the inaugural Indy 500. Arthur Chevrolet drove in that first 1911 race, then formed the car company with his two brothers later that year. Though GM has long participated in sports car racing with Cadillac and Corvette, which has nine class wins at Le Mans, it is regarded as a minor player in international motorsports despite being a powerhouse automaker around the world. That now stands to change. With apologies to the American-owned Haas F1 Team, which has little U.S. connection aside from Gene Haas himself, a GM/Cadillac team would become the flag-bearer for the United States on the international stage.  GO DEEPER Haas is 'home' in Miami, but just how American is F1’s only American team?  “As the pinnacle of motorsports, F1 demands boundary-pushing innovation and excellence,” GM president Mark Reuss said. “It’s an honor for General Motors and Cadillac to join the world’s premier racing series, and we’re committed to competing with passion and integrity to elevate the sport for race fans around the world. Advertisement “This is a global stage for us to demonstrate GM’s engineering expertise and technology leadership at an entirely new level.” Those words from Reuss might make NASCAR and its fans blanch, as GM’s association with motorsports includes a deep bond with stock car racing. But according to the company, GM manufactures vehicles in 37 different countries; no racing series on the planet comes close to reflecting a brand’s international impact as F1 does. That makes this a tremendous coup for GM, particularly since it one-ups American rival Ford in its presence on the F1 grid. Ford has already announced a partnership with Red Bull, in which it will build an engine beginning in 2026 — but not own the team itself. Meanwhile, Cadillac will be a works team that builds the car and engine itself. Factory teams such as Ferrari and Mercedes don’t have to rely on a supplier, as Haas does in purchasing its power units from Ferrari. Though there will certainly be growing pains, imagine if the effort is ultimately successful: An American manufacturer winning races or even competing for a championship in the F1 spotlight would do wonders for its global reputation — something not even Le Mans can match in today’s motorsports landscape. Simply put, this seems like the right opportunity at the right time for GM. American interest in F1, owned by Colorado-based Liberty Media, has exploded. There are three grands prix per year in the United States. Ratings and attendance have continued to climb, and corporate sponsors can’t open their wallets quickly enough. Conversely, a true stars-and-stripes presence in F1 can only help with the interest levels that could further elevate the relatively nascent American fan base. As Liberty president and CEO Greg Maffei put it: “With Formula 1’s continued growth plans in the U.S., we have always believed that welcoming an impressive U.S. brand like GM/Cadillac to the grid and GM as a future power unit supplier could bring additional value and interest to the sport.” GM will always have a chance to win more NASCAR championships and Indianapolis 500s with Chevrolet. But there’s no rocket ship to international appeal like F1, and now it appears GM is strapping in for the ride.

The plaintiffs, which include San Jose State player Brooke Slusser and suspended assistant coach Melissa Batie-Smoose, sued the Mountain West and its commissioner, Gloria Nevarez, on Nov. 13, alleging that the school and conference violated the U.S. Constitution and Title IX by allowing a transgender athlete to play for a women’s sports team. Advertisement Judge Kato Crews denied the request, writing that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate irreparable harm, in part by waiting until two weeks before the Nov. 27-30 tournament to seek the injunction. He noted that the Mountain West’s policy on transgender athletes has been in place since 2022 and that San Jose State opponents began forfeiting over the issue two months ago. “The Court finds their delay in filing this action and seeking emergency relief related to the MWC Tournament weakens their arguments regarding irreparable harm,” Crews wrote. Crews also wrote that the plaintiffs failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that a transgender athlete’s participation on a women’s sports team violates Title IX. “The movants’ Title IX theory raised in this case directly conflicts with Title IX’s prohibition on discrimination against trans individuals,” he wrote. Slusser, who transferred to San Jose State prior to the 2023 season, joined a federal lawsuit in September challenging the NCAA’s transgender policy and went public with assertions about her teammate’s gender identification. In the lawsuit, Slusser said the teammate, who was also her roommate, “was born male and identifies as a ‘transgender woman,’” and came out to her during a conversation in April. Slusser has since spoken with numerous media outlets about her experience with her teammate. The Athletic is not naming the athlete because the athlete has not publicly identified. The school has not publicly confirmed whether the athlete is transgender. Crews, in his decision Monday, wrote that “No Defendant disputed that SJSU rosters a trans woman volleyball player.” Since Slusser first went public, five schools — Southern Utah, Utah State, Boise State, Wyoming and Nevada — have forfeited matches against San Jose State since late September. Athletes from several of those schools are among the plaintiffs in the Mountain West suit. Advertisement The plaintiffs alleged that the Mountain West waited until after the San Jose State story broke in September to publish a policy stating a team that refuses to compete against a fellow member with an eligible transgender athlete will forfeit and be charged with a loss. In the lawsuit, the plaintiffs alleged the policy constituted a First Amendment violation that worked to suppress athletes’ ability to protest the alleged transgender athlete’s inclusion. However, the judge’s decision indicates the conference’s board approved it in 2022 and circulated it amongst the schools at that time. “The Court also finds the movants have failed to show a likelihood of success on their First Amendment claim involving the TPP,” Crews wrote. San Jose State said in a statement Monday that all its student-athletes are eligible to participate in their sports under NCAA and Mountain West Conference rules. “We are gratified that the Court rejected an eleventh-hour attempt to change those rules,” the statement said. “Our team looks forward to competing in the Mountain West volleyball tournament this week.” San Jose State is the No. 2 seed in the tournament and will play its first match Friday against the winner of Wednesday’s match between No. 3 Utah State and No. 6 Boise State, both of which forfeited against SJSU during the season.

According to the filing, a motion to dismiss hearing is scheduled for March 25 in federal court in the Northern District of California, located in San Jose, Calif. Advertisement Earlier this year, the Pac-12 lost 10 members to other power conferences. In September, the conference announced it was adding Boise State, Fresno State, Colorado State, San Diego State and Utah State from the Mountain West in 2026 to the conference as it rebuilds around Oregon State and Washington State. The departing schools will owe the conference exit fees of upward of $17 million each. The Pac-12 is also on the hook for more than $50 million in fees related to the scheduling deal struck between Oregon State, Washington State and the Mountain West last year. The Pac-12 filed an antitrust lawsuit in September, claiming that the so-called “Poaching Penalty” was “anticompetitive and unlawful” because it restricts offers the conference could make to Mountain West members. The Pac-12 also claims the penalties had nothing to do with the scheduling agreement, were forced upon Oregon State and Washington State under a tight deadline to put a 2024 football slate in place and were designed to prevent the Pac-12 from competing with the Mountain West. The Mountain West says Oregon State and Washington State agreed to the fees freely and raised no objection to them at the time the deal was being done. “As a preliminary matter, the Pac-12 has no antitrust standing: it fails to allege any harm to competition or to itself,” the Mountain West’s filing said. Oregon State and Washington State are taking advantage of an NCAA grace period and operating as a two-team league this season and next. To fill out a 12-game football schedule for this season, the schools struck a deal with the Mountain West to play what amounted to seven nonconference games with its teams. Fearing the Pac-12 schools might try to rebuild the conference by inviting some of the Mountain West’s members, the conference tried to protect itself with the poaching penalties. Advertisement Oregon State and Washington State could not come to an agreement for 2025 and a few weeks later the Pac-12 did invite Mountain West schools to join the reconfigured conference. The Pac-12 now contends the poaching penalties are illegal because they have no relation to the purpose of the contract, which was scheduling football games. The Pac-12 has also added Gonzaga to its rebuild but is in need of at least one more football school to get to the eight required for its champion to be eligible to qualify for a spot in the College Football Playoff. The Mountain West has subsequently used the incoming exit fees from the Pac-12 to sway UNLV and Air Force to remain in the conference. The Mountain West has also announced the additions of UTEP as a full, football-playing member and Grand Canyon, which does not play football. Also, Hawaii is moving from being football-only to full membership in 2026. (Photo: Icon Sportswire / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,10 things Blues fans should know about Jim Montgomery,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5947528/2024/11/25/jim-montgomery-bruins-blues-learnings/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 20:49:09 GMT","From players he loves to personality traits to stylistic preferences, here are takeaways on Montgomery from his time with the Bruins.","NHL Jim Montgomery felt at home in New England. He was a four-year player at the University of Maine. After being hired by the Boston Bruins, he settled into life in the Boston suburbs with his family. But he is going home now — literally. The Montgomerys maintained a St. Louis residence during their stop in Boston. He is familiar with the Affton Americans and the St. Louis Junior Blues. He excelled as an assistant to former head coach Craig Berube for two seasons. Advertisement “It seemed like everyone there liked him from what I heard,” said Bruins forward Trent Frederic, a St. Louis native. “It’s good for him. He’s got a house there. It makes it a lot easier on him. I know he’ll do a good job there. He’s an unbelievable coach.” Montgomery was in charge of the penalty kill as Berube’s assistant. Everything will be under his watch now, just as it was in Boston since 2022. What should Blues fans know about Montgomery that they don’t from his previous time with the team? Here are 10 quick takeaways from his run in Boston: Montgomery spent one season as a player with Ufa Salavat Yulayev in Russia. He picked up some Russian, including the naughty words. He enjoyed sharing his vocabulary with Buchnevich during the two seasons he spent in St. Louis as an assistant. Montgomery’s mastery of Russian swearing wasn’t, in all likelihood, the reason Buchnevich scored a career-high 76 points in 2021-22 with Montgomery at Berube’s side. But Montgomery got along with fellow Russians Vladimir Tarasenko (34 goals and 82 points that season) and Ivan Barbashev (26 and 60), too. Montgomery noted how all three mastered the offensive concepts the Blues installed, such as taking their time in the neutral zone to wait for reinforcements. Buchnevich has 13 points in 22 games this season. Maximizing his performance will be one of Montgomery’s primary responsibilities. Brandon Carlo was one of Montgomery’s blue-line charges in Boston. The 6-foot-5, 220-pound Carlo skates well enough to join the rush and retreat in case something goes sideways. Upon his arrival in Boston, Montgomery showed Carlo clips of the 6-foot-6, 228-pound Parayko as examples of how he thought he could play. “Especially because Monty coached him in St. Louis,” Carlo said. “So if needed to look back on some breakouts, I could go to (Parayko’s) film to learn from, in the beginning, what Monty wanted from me.” Parayko has been on the ice for 24 five-on-five goals against this year, per Natural Stat Trick, second-most on the team. Straightening out his game will also be atop Montgomery’s to-do list. GO DEEPER Jim Montgomery talks: Vision for Blues, whirlwind hiring process and his first task Bruce Cassidy, Montgomery’s predecessor in Boston, did not hold back on describing his players’ shortcomings publicly, as long as they had heard it from him privately first.  One of Montgomery’s priorities upon replacing Cassidy was to rebuild the fractures Cassidy had left. As such, he was almost always a glass-half-full evaluator when asked to comment on player performance. That made it jolting, on the other hand, when Montgomery benched David Pastrnak for an entire period this season. However, Montgomery described the benching as a coach’s decision and declined to elaborate beyond that. GO DEEPER ‘Yesterday was yesterday’: Pastrnak looks for answers after third-period benching Whether via Clear Sight Analytics, Sportlogiq or the Bruins’ internal measurements, Montgomery liked to look at the numbers to help guide his strategy. He encouraged his shooters, for example, to complete slot-lines passes to set up their teammates. The data shows how goalies find it far harder to stop pucks when they have to move laterally. This season, Montgomery wanted his power-play attackers to shoot from lower in the formation. According to the numbers, shots go in more often when they’re taken closer to the net. GO DEEPER Behind the Blues' abrupt coaching change: 'A difference-maker became available, and we reacted' Montgomery does not endorse a shot from the point with no traffic in front. That is an easy save for a goalie. It is a type of turnover. In that instance, Montgomery would want the defenseman to hold onto the puck and wait for forwards, preferably two of them, to get inside the dots. Then the defenseman would have the green light to fire. It is much harder for a goalie to stop a point shot through multiple screens. Advertisement Even when things were going well for his first two seasons, Montgomery reached for his blender’s power button when it came to his lines. He is an inveterate tinkerer, always searching for better results.  Montgomery gave the Bruins the green light to pursue the puck in the defensive zone. This applied to the penalty kill too. But he emphasized layers of net-front protection.  So while the Bruins were free to stretch out their D-zone coverage based on the situation, Montgomery wanted his players to hold their ground as a foundational element.  There were times Montgomery wanted to speak to his players between periods. But when he felt the time was right, Montgomery pulled Brad Marchand aside and instructed his captain to address the room.  Montgomery had his primary leadership group in Marchand, Pastrnak and Charlie McAvoy. He also incorporated Carlo, Charlie Coyle and Hampus Lindholm into a secondary tier. Let’s say a wing wins a puck battle on the left-side wall in the defensive zone. Montgomery would want the right-side defenseman to jump into the middle of the ice, present his stick and make himself available for a pass off the boards from the wing.  If the wing executes the pass, the Blues will have an instant four-man attack. It was Nov. 11. The Bruins were coming off a bad 3-2 overtime loss to the Ottawa Senators.  Before practice started, the players lined up in front of the benches at Warrior Ice Arena. Montgomery went to the other side. As Montgomery started skating from one end of the rink to the other, every player shot a puck at the coach. Montgomery made it just about halfway before Mason Lohrei’s puck struck the coach. “There’s different ways to get people to believe you’re in it together,” said Montgomery. “I always believe that humor/care is a better way to free a creative mind than work harder.”  GO DEEPER Rutherford: Armstrong is all-in to fix the Blues and add to his legacy, feelings be damned (Photo: Joel Auerbach / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Arsenal go into Tuesday’s match against Portuguese champions Sporting CP in 12th place in the league phase, two points off the top eight places that guarantee automatic qualification into the last 16. They have only won once in their last eight European away ties, the last coming against Sevilla in October last year. Advertisement Goals have been their biggest issue in that run as they are without one in any of their last four away matches as they struggle to create in either of last season’s knock-out ties with Porto and Bayern Munich or this year’s group stage visits to Atalanta and Inter. “It’s certainly something we have to improve,” Arteta said ahead of the trip to Portugal. “I think we have made the right steps and looking back with the way we played against Inter — which is a team that has been so dominant in their league, reached the final of the Champions League which they should have won. To play and dominate that game. “But the reality is that you have to make it happen and we didn’t. Making those steps is what we have to do next. Be ruthless, be efficient in the opposition box and do what we have to do to take the three points away from here.” Arteta reached his 250th game in charge of the club in Saturday’s 3-0 victory over Nottingham Forest, a result which took him past the win ratios (58.8 per cent) of both George Graham and Arsene Wenger at the same stage in their Arsenal careers. But in analysing his team’s recent struggles on the road in Europe he does not see a clear pattern. “Not all the games have been the same,” Arteta added. “It’s true that within those games there were games that were when we had already qualified. Something that is very true is that we have to improve those results and we have to find ways to understand what has been missing. “Sometimes it’s been performance sometimes it’s been other aspects. That’s the next step we have to make as a team.” Arsenal only returned to the Champions League last season after a seven-year hiatus. GO DEEPER Ethan Nwaneri, Martin Odegaard and plotting the best path for Arsenal's prodigious teenager For many of the players, as well as Arteta, it is only their 15th game at this level but the Arsenal manager does not buy into the idea that they are still searching for the right balance of being tight defensively while still carrying a threat in attack. “I wouldn’t say that this is the most important thing but the efficiency that we have shown inside the box at this level with the chances that we are normally able to generate in the Champions League level, is not at the level required to win consistently,” he tated. Advertisement “I always say the Champions League is about boxes, small margins and details. You have to get all of those right to win, especially away from home.” Arsenal lost to Sporting on penalties in the quarter-finals of the Europa League two seasons ago and Arteta believes both teams have improved since then. “It’s always a good exercise to see the team a few years back,” Arteta said. “I watched both games back to have understanding of what worked and what didn’t in order to prepare. It’s difficult to recognise the team two years later. “You tend to see and look at the game and other stuff in a different way but it was good. It feels like it’s been a lot longer in way. But here we are again. The good news is that we are in a different competition – a competition where we really want to be and be dominant.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Yusei Kikuchi helps the Angels, but he can't be their big offseason move: Law",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5947563/2024/11/25/yusei-kikuchi-angels-signing-analysis/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 20:35:19 GMT",The Angels need a lot of help to go from also-ran to contender. Kikuchi moves them in the right direction but they still need a lot more.,"MLB Yusei Kikuchi is exactly what the Angels need to be competitors, as long as they also sign three more starters and Juan Soto. And maybe that wouldn’t even be enough. Kikuchi is a start for the Halos, who return just one starter who made more than 20 starts or threw more than 120 innings last year. That starter was lefty Tyler Anderson, who was pretty bad in the first year of his three-year deal but was above-average by ERA and below-average by FIP in 2024. That’s a long way of saying they had zero reliable starters going into the offseason, defining reliable as someone likely to be average and at least pitch enough to qualify for the ERA title (162 IP). Never mind contention; the Angels were shaping up to be non-competitive. Advertisement Since the World Series ended, they’ve traded Griffin Canning (who just had his first full season in the majors in 2024, but had an ERA and FIP over 5) and added Kyle Hendricks (who just had his worst season and might be done). Their rotation, on paper, was one of the worst in the majors, whether we’re talking quality of work or just quantity of innings; their five most likely starters pre-Kikuchi threw a total of 590 innings in 2024, and about 30 percent of those were by the 35-year-old Anderson alone. GO DEEPER After signing Yusei Kikuchi, 5 things the Angels could do next That is a roundabout way of saying that Kikuchi can help the Angels even if he’s just an average starter because he’s produced 343 1/3 innings of roughly league-average performance over the past two seasons. He did pitch far, far better than that after Toronto traded him to Houston at the deadline this year, with a 2.70 ERA/3.07 FIP with the Astros, because he completely changed his pitch mix, more than doubling his use of his slider (17 percent to 37 percent), cutting back somewhat on the four-seamer (just under 50 percent to 42 percent), and mostly shelving his curveball (23 percent to just under 10 percent). Guess what his best pitch is? His slider is effective because it’s very hard, the fifth-hardest velocity among starters’ sliders last year, without a ton of break in either direction. His slider was worth plus-8 runs saved in 2023, and plus-7 in 2024, dropping only because he threw it less in total in the more recent year. He missed bats at a higher rate after the trade, and he allowed fewer balls in play, too. He might be a very different pitcher if the Angels do nothing other than tell him to maintain his post-trade pitch mix. The Angels went 63-99 and were outscored by 160 runs in 2024, so it’s going to take a lot more than adding Kikuchi (who, replacing Canning, might be worth two to three more wins by himself) and Jorge Soler (acquired for Canning, and who might be a two-win upgrade if they just DH him) to make them a .500 club. A healthy Mike Trout would do more good than either of these moves, although that’s obviously beyond their control. Advertisement If the intention is to contend, however, they need to do a lot more — sign another starter or preferably two, and add some more offense basically anywhere but catcher, shortstop, or left field. There is no reason on earth for the Angels to skip the Juan Soto sweepstakes, even if no one believes he’ll sign there. They should be in heavy on Max Fried and Jack Flaherty at the very least. Otherwise, the three-year deal for Kikuchi makes the team a marginally better contender for fourth place. (Photo: Thomas Shea / Imagn Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

O’Connell has been sidelined since suffering a broken thumb on his throwing hand against the Los Angeles Rams in Week 7. Pierce wouldn’t say definitively whether he’ll play against the Kansas City Chiefs on Friday. Advertisement What does Pierce need to see from O’Connell to get the go-ahead to play? “Just seeing him being able to grip the ball comfortably — hopefully there’s no pain there — and just being able to be efficient,” Pierce said Monday. “To put a player out there that’s hurting or injured still, that’s not in the benefit of the player or the team.” 🔴📽️ Live: Antonio Pierce addresses the media from the Intermountain Health Performance Center. https://t.co/l9QnXMxb9f — Las Vegas Raiders (@Raiders) November 25, 2024  Quarterback Gardner Minshew suffered a season-ending broken collarbone against the Denver Broncos on Sunday, so the path could be cleared for O’Connell to start for the rest of the regular season. The Raiders did not put in a waiver claim Monday for quarterback Daniel Jones, who was released by the New York Giants last week. Jones cleared waivers and will become an unrestricted free agent. O’Connell had replaced a benched Minshew against the Broncos in Week 5, and the plan was for him to be the starter the rest of the way — until he got hurt against the Rams. The 26-year-old out of Purdue is eager to get back on the field, but the coaching staff will be cautious on a short week. If he can’t play — and the Raiders don’t add outside help — they’ll start third-year quarterback Desmond Ridder on Black Friday against the Chiefs. “At the quarterback position, you’ve got to be smart,” Pierce said. “(O’Connell’s) future is much brighter looking ahead. He’s a young player. We’ve just got to be smart. We have a good relationship, Aidan and myself, and he speaks honestly with me, and I speak honestly with him.” GO DEEPER Raiders reach new low as dominance over Broncos is firmly a thing of the past It’s been a limited sample size for O’Connell this season. He’s played in four games, but started only two of them and has just 82 passing attempts. He’s completed 63.4 percent of those passes for 455 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. O’Connell started 10 games as a rookie last season, including all nine of Pierce’s games as interim head coach. Considering the circumstances — he was replacing quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo after former head coach Josh McDaniels and former offensive coordinator Mick Lombardi were fired — he was solid. He finished the season with a 62.1 completion percentage, 2,218 passing yards, 12 touchdowns and seven interceptions and posted a 5-5 record as the starter. While O’Connell entered this past offseason as the incumbent starter, the Raiders still signed Minshew to a two-year, $25 million deal in March and were interested in drafting a quarterback in April. They did not, however, which left them with a quarterback room led by Minshew and O’Connell. Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.
 Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox. The two quarterbacks were in a position battle throughout OTAs and training camp before Minshew emerged as the victor. Telesco, Pierce and former offensive coordinator Luke Getsy felt more comfortable with Minshew’s experience and mobility. It wound up being a disaster. In 10 games of action, Minshew committed 14 turnovers (tied for the most in the NFL) and was benched three times before he got injured last week. Advertisement Now, O’Connell could have a six-game run to show how much progress he’s made. Despite being only in his second season, he’ll already have his fourth offensive play caller in interim offensive coordinator Scott Turner. The Raiders (2-9) are in the midst of a seven-game losing streak and have been allergic to scoring points all season long. They’re averaging just 18.7 points per game (26th) and have only improved slightly to 19 points per game in Turner’s two games in charge. It’ll go a long way if O’Connell can make a difference. The Raiders will explore their options at quarterback this offseason regardless, but there’s still significance in O’Connell having the opportunity to show he deserves to be in the mix. “These younger guys are understanding that this is their opportunity the last six weeks of the season,” Pierce said. “You don’t know how this bad boy is going to go in the offseason. … What do the 2025 Raiders look like, and are you a part of that? … It’s important for these guys to put their best foot forward and, really, for all of our players and myself included (along with the coaching) staff, to show that we’re fighting and there’s no give and no tanking or any of that B.S. that’s being said.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,What we're hearing about the Rangers: Chris Drury's trade memo and a loud message to the room,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5947184/2024/11/25/rangers-kreider-trouba-trade-discussions/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 20:33:45 GMT",The Rangers are 12-6-1 but have a number of veterans underperforming to start the season.,"NHL NEW YORK — The New York Rangers are 12-6-1, which doesn’t seem so bad. But the last two games of their western Canada trip last week, a not-as-close-as-the-score-indicates 3-2 loss to the Calgary Flames and a not-close-at-all 6-2 loss to the Edmonton Oilers, have caused a ripple inside the organization. Advertisement League sources confirmed Monday a report from Elliotte Friedman that Rangers general manager Chris Drury has sent word to the NHL’s other 31 GMs that the Rangers are open to a trade. And, those sources said, captain Jacob Trouba and longest-tenured Ranger Chris Kreider were mentioned specifically by name in the leaguewide missive. Putting those two prominent Rangers on the trading block 19 games into the season signifies that Drury believes the team’s core needs a major adjustment. Even short of a trade, sending that information out to all the other NHL GMs guarantees that word will get out publicly, as it did in fairly short order. So if, as seems likely, this was a way of sending a message to the team and its veteran leadership, it still says that the Rangers are in a bit of disarray. As one director of player personnel put it: “Something must be wrong in that room.” That source and other executives and agents around the league were granted anonymity for this article to allow them to speak about their teams’ and agencies’ internal dealings with the Rangers, as was a source with the Rangers. Here’s what we’re hearing from them about the situation. • First off, it’s pretty clear that trading either Kreider or Trouba would be a difficult task right now. Trouba has a year left on his deal at an $8 million average annual value. Kreider has two years at $6.5 million. Both have 15-team no-trade clauses, too. Trouba has already stared this situation down, having been approached by Drury about a possible trade five months ago. The Rangers were hopeful that Trouba would be amenable to a move ahead of July 1, when he was to submit his 15-team no-trade list. But Trouba wasn’t willing to uproot his young son and his wife, Dr. Kelly Trouba, who still had a year to go on her residency at a New York City hospital. That may have caused some ill will between the team and its captain, who understands that after this season he’s almost certain to be moved to create salary-cap flexibility. Advertisement Kreider, who coincidentally will miss Monday’s game against the St. Louis Blues with an upper-body injury, hasn’t been in this situation in years. There was some talk of moving him approaching the 2019-20 trade deadline, but he instead signed a seven-year extension for a relatively team-friendly number. And he has outperformed that deal by quite a long way during Drury’s tenure as GM. His 136 goals since the start of 2021-22 are tied for ninth in the league. Neither player would welcome a move at the moment. That’s clear. And it’s hard to see how a team that might want a top-six wing or a middle-pair defenseman could fit either player onto their cap so early in the season and want to commit to either player beyond this season. • Now, to the message-sending, what appears to be the crux of Drury’s leaguewide blast message. The Rangers are pleased with the play of their young players, with Will Cuylle, Braden Schneider and Zac Jones earning bigger minutes this season than last. Kaapo Kakko and Filip Chytil may still qualify as young at 25 and 24, and they’re playing well, too, though Chytil was set to miss his fifth straight game with an upper-body injury on Monday. Alexis Lafrenière has also been continuing his good play from last season, having earned a seven-year, $7.45 million AAV extension. But the team’s veteran core, outside of Artemi Panarin and goalies Igor Shesterkin and Jonathan Quick, has not quite led the way. Kreider is second on the team with nine goals, but his line with Mika Zibanejad and Reilly Smith has been under 50 percent in generating scoring chances and goals. Vincent Trocheck, Drury’s big free-agent addition from the summer of 2022, has just 10 points in 19 games despite leading Rangers forwards in ice time. And Trouba is only one of the Rangers’ top-four defensemen who has struggled this season. Ryan Lindgren, a pending unrestricted free agent, hasn’t been his usual steady self since returning from a broken jaw and isn’t currently playing alongside Adam Fox, his longtime defense partner. K’Andre Miller, a pending restricted free agent, has just four points in 19 games despite moving into the top pair and getting some early power-play time. Fox is among the league leaders with 17 assists but hasn’t scored a goal. Advertisement When your veterans aren’t performing, there is little a GM can do. They are the ones with long-term deals and no-trade or no-move clauses, which limits how much management can alter the roster. Drury’s message may not be intended to find a trade partner at the moment, but it certainly should be received as a “no one is safe” threat from above. • Will it work? Trouba hasn’t exactly set the season on fire since his tumultuous week in late June, though he’s hardly been the biggest issue. Kreider, who could become just the sixth Ranger to play 900 games at the end of the season, hasn’t been under much heat from management or the coaching staff since his youthful days playing for John Tortorella, and that’s the way he likes to operate. How Kreider responds to this will be telling. He’s a quiet but respected person in the locker room and close with Zibanejad, another important Ranger with a long-term deal, a no-move clause and a disappointing start to this season. Monday also will be just the fifth game Kreider has missed since the start of the 2021-22 season, so we will see if his absence due to injury will be felt as well. It’s a gamble by Drury, as it was when he sent Barclay Goodrow out the door just before the Trouba drama in June. Goodrow’s contract, a six-year, $3.642 million AAV deal, signed by Drury as one of his first acts as GM, was a burden, but the way the Rangers handled Goodrow’s exit did not sit well with some teammates. Goodrow was informed by Drury that the Rangers were placing him on waivers 15 minutes before the waiver announcement. And the Sharks, run by former Drury adviser Mike Grier, were ready to scoop Goodrow up in what seemed to be a planned claim, with no asset going back to New York. So if any complacency has set in with this team, it would be a surprise, given the summer that just transpired. • And the leaguewide message naming specific players? One former GM told The Athletic on Monday that he usually reserved that tactic until just before he was going to place someone on waivers. “You’re just making one last effort to get something back,” he said. Neither Kreider nor Trouba have no-move clauses, so they can be placed on waivers. But would Drury try something that drastic in the middle of the season, with no obvious replacement for either player? That’s a stretch. This is another Cup-or-bust season for the Rangers, though. Perhaps nothing is off the table. Advertisement Drury still has to get Shesterkin’s contract done, as well as an extension for Cuylle, one of the team’s best forwards so far and coming off his entry-level deal at the end of the season. Kakko and Miller are RFAs. Lindgren and Quick are UFAs. The 2025 offseason was already going to bring change for the Rangers. If they can’t stop their middling play so far — despite the record, they are 2-6-0 against teams over .500 and rank in the bottom third of the league in most defensive metrics — the change may come sooner. We certainly learned that Monday.

So, at 11am on a Monday morning, The Athletic was weaving our way down a pub’s staircase, round the bar, past some less-than-salubrious toilets, into Underworld, a black-walled basement club where Hayes spent much of her youth dancing until 3am. “I remember many an evening we would come in here, and thankfully it still smells of fart and feet,” said Hayes, who’d been greeted with a ‘Welcome back Emma’ sign outside. “It was a big indie place for me back in the day and I definitely have not seen this place in the daylight so that’s refreshing.” Although the music blaring from the speakers remains the same, the agenda and vibe at this time in the morning were slightly different — not least the fact that tea, coffee and pastries were being served. With a table and mics set up where Hayes used to rock and roll, the head coach looked out to a bizarre mix of her mum, sisters, school friends, former and current colleagues, and the international media. Asked how she felt to be in the Underworld with those closest to her, every word captured on camera, navigating questions from coaching at Wembley to Donald Trump, from USWNT’s Thanksgiving plans to the homophobic abuse aimed at her former player Sam Kerr, from developing the national youth team strategy to Hayes’ top tourist tips, Hayes said simply: “F****** brilliant!” Hayes may be coaching in America but she has not changed, firmly shaped by her upbringing in north London. She credits her friends and family for keeping her humble. Those in the audience had shared her journey with her since she was a child, people who continue to run projects across the London borough at Camden Sports Development or youth leagues at Regent’s Park. Advertisement “My community is what I am and what I care about,” she said. “I’m so stoked to be here with people that have been massive in my life. My friends have never changed and I’m grateful for that. If you say otherwise, there’ll be about 50 of them lining up at the door for you… I’m kidding. “Are you?” one heckled. “I probably shouldn’t say this in a press conference,” said Hayes, “but one of my friends used to live up in Delancey Street and she lived in a big posh house, a nice five-storey, it was lovely, gorgeous. “I used to go up there and pretend, maybe one day, this would be a life for me. I used to come home with a little posh accent and my mum would say, ‘Your s*** still stinks'”. That was one way to keep your daughter grounded. When it comes to her tenure as the USWNT boss, Hayes is, in her words, “fresh out of the packet”, but she is already thinking about her legacy, explaining that unifying the US talent pool under a women’s football development strategy is “going to be the biggest piece” of what she leaves behind. She described herself as a “builder” who wants to lay foundations for the long term, and importantly she wants to devise a strategy for players and staff across all departments which is centred around a “female lens”. “Everything we create, the systems, frameworks, methodology, everything is done through a male lens. I seek to challenge that. If we value women and want to keep women in the workplace, we have to be creative because raising children is the hardest job in the world and your children need you too. But you’re entitled to be able to do that and have a job in football. We have to think through a female lens. That’s at the heart of everything.” Hayes said of her own accord: “I’m not going to answer any questions on men’s football. I know exactly where I am and what I want to do with my life. That’s in the women’s game, developing everything in and around that.” From meeting the press to pulling a pint, @emmahayes1 is a woman of the people! pic.twitter.com/MBlZNkheDA — U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team (@USWNT) November 25, 2024  On Saturday Hayes will be a visitor at what she called her “second home”, Wembley. The 48-year-old will have to go through a “weird moment” of humming the English and American anthems because she “loves them” both before coming up against former Chelsea players like her ex-captain Millie Bright. Hayes momentarily feared making the jump from club to national-team management as she was unsure how the change in rhythm would affect her. For around 25 years, she had driven to the training ground six or seven days a week. Advertisement “I worried about that for about four seconds,” she said. “Then I said, ‘OK, what are the benefits? “I get to get up and breathe, take Harry to school, go to the gym, create my schedule around those things, and not sacrifice the things that make me feel healthy.” She added: “I definitely didn’t feel healthy at the end of my time at Chelsea. I don’t want to say it’s pressure. I just think it’s the stress, the toll it took on me. Doing that during menopause, I realised, was even harder. “To get on top of all of these things, I feel like I’ve got my mojo back, my smile back and joy back. I didn’t realise how much I’d lost in that. I’m loving football more than ever.” (Top photo: U.S. Soccer/Getty Images/Brad Smith) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,USWNT goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher announces retirement from international soccer,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5947493/2024/11/25/uswnt-goalkeeper-alyssa-naeher-announces-retirement/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 20:00:04 GMT",The two-time World Cup winner and Olympic gold medalist announced the December camp will be her last.,"NWSL U.S. women’s national team goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher announced her retirement from international soccer Monday, ahead of the team’s two European friendlies against England and the Netherlands. She said the European matches will be her last. A 2019 World Cup winner and gold medalist at this summer’s Paris Olympics, she will continue playing for the Chicago Red Stars in the NWSL. She re-signed with Chicago in September to play through the 2025 season, which will be her 10th season with the club. Advertisement For the USWNT, however, it’s the end of a major goalkeeping era. Naeher’s career stands comfortably in the top three amongst other World Cup winners Briana Scurry and Hope Solo. “Every tear shed in the challenging times and disappointments made every smile and celebration in the moments of success that much more joyful,” Naeher wrote Monday in her announcement on social media. “This has been a special team to be a part of and I am beyond proud of what we have achieved both on and off the field.”     A post shared by Alyssa Naeher (@alyssanaeher)  Naeher made her debut a decade ago in December 2014, and after stints as the primary backup goalkeeper for the 2015 World Cup and 2016 Olympics, she took over the no. 1 spot following that quarterfinal exit. Ahead of what could be her two final games for the United States, she holds a record 88 wins, 14 draws and only six losses through 113 appearances. “Having the opportunity to be a part of the USWNT for the last 15 years has been the greatest honor,” she wrote. “When I began this journey, I never could have imagined where it would take me.” She earned her 100th cap earlier this year during the W Gold Cup and cemented her status not just as someone who could save penalty kicks, but convert them as well. In the W Gold Cup semifinal against Canada, she buried her attempt from the spot but also saved three of Canada’s attempts — marking her as the only USWNT goalkeeper to make three saves in a PK shootout. She’d repeat the same double later that spring, against Canada, during the SheBelieves Cup. At the Olympics this summer, she once again stepped up to help propel the USWNT to their gold medal victory, including a poster-worthy save against Brazil in the closing moments of the gold cup game at Parc des Princes. Off the field, she bonded with the forward line of Trinity Rodman, Sophia Smith and Mal Swanson (also known as “Triple Espresso”) who pulled her out of her shell. GO DEEPER USWNT on goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher: 'We’re making her a little more mushy gushy' “We’re making her a little more mushy gushy with us, which I think is nice,” Rodman said in France. “We’re opening up a side that I think has always been there, but it’s hidden a little bit.” (Top photo: Joe Robbins / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Penguins trade for Predators forward Philip Tomasino: Where he fits in Pittsburgh,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5947454/2024/11/25/penguins-trade-philip-tomasino-predators/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 19:59:06 GMT","Tomasino provides versatility at a bargain, so the move doesn't carry much risk.","NHL CRANBERRY TOWNSHIP, Pa. — Penguins general manager/president of hockey operations Kyle Dubas has made a second trade in as many weeks. Following a trade that sent Lars Eller to Washington on Nov. 12, the Penguins acquired forward Philip Tomasino from the Nashville Predators on Monday in return for a 2027 fourth-round pick, which they had attained in the Chad Ruhwedel trade last season. Advertisement Tomasino was Nashville’s first-round pick in the 2019 NHL Draft. Coincidentally, the Penguins sent their first-round pick in that draft — Samuel Poulin — back to AHL Wilkes-Barre to make room on the roster for Tomasino. The 23-year-old Tomasino has scored 23 goals in 159 NHL games. He’s another example of a young player with a strong pedigree but an unremarkable start in the NHL whom Dubas has taken a chance on. Dubas also acquired first-round draft picks Cody Glass and Jesse Puljujarvi on the cheap. Dubas’ Penguins are struggling mightily and are in last place in the Metropolitan Division. While Dubas isn’t in the habit of trading away draft picks, he deemed it worthy for a player with potential who can join his team immediately. The plan is for Tomasino to practice with the Penguins on Tuesday and likely play on Wednesday against the Vancouver Canucks. The 6-foot, 179-pound forward is a native of Mississauga, Ontario. He enjoyed a standout Ontario Hockey League career with Niagara and Oshawa. Say what you will about some of the moves Dubas has made during his 18 months as Penguins general manager. Some of the moves, notably contracts for Tristan Jarry and Ryan Graves, have been failures. He is, however, making wise decisions in terms of identifying young, talented players who could find a home in Pittsburgh. In this trade, he gave up only a fourth-round pick for more than two years from now, which seems very reasonable. Tomasino is making only $825,000 this season, so he fits under the salary cap. Because he can play any forward position, there aren’t too many places where Tomasino wouldn’t fit. I imagine he’ll slide into the Penguins’ bottom six, where offense has been difficult to find. Very few spots are off limits on the Penguins roster these days, so he’ll be allowed to shine in several roles. (Photo: Gregory Shamus / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Venue: Lāhainā Civic Center — Lāhainā, Hawaii
Time: Monday, 9 p.m. ET
TV: ESPNU
Streaming: Fubo (try for free) This game is an immediate signature test for both programs, though Auburn doesn’t quite need one after already toppling Houston earlier this month. Bruce Pearl’s squad is second in KenPom offensive rating and fifth in defense. The Tigers’ previous two head coaches, Jeff Lebo and Tony Barbee, combined for just two winning seasons and zero NCAA Tournament appearances in a decade of miserable basketball. Pearl now has the school ranked in the top 10 for the sixth time in his 11 campaigns. Advertisement Auburn’s Johni Broome, a fifth-year senior, has been dominant so far. He’s putting up 20 points, 11.3 rebounds and an SEC-best 3.3 blocks per game. He’s also a full 10 percentage points higher than his career-best field goal mark and is averaging his fewest turnovers despite a herculean 32 percent usage rate. Chaney Johnson has taken an inspiring, serpentine path to this moment, starting in Division II with Alabama-Huntsville. Averaging 25 minutes a night, he is a stat stuffer at 12.5 points, 7.3 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.3 blocks. Fellow seniors Denver Jones (11.3 points per game), Chad Baker-Mazara (10.5) and Miles Kelly (10.3) are all capable scorers, while freshman Tahaad Pettiford was wholly unafraid of big shots in the Houston win. This offense is well-balanced and deep. Iowa State comes into Monday’s tilt with the best-scoring defense in all of college basketball. Five Cyclones are averaging double-digit points, with starting center Dishon Jackson nearby at 9.3. The guards are good and well-traveled. Senior Curtis Jones had an inefficient first season in Ames after transferring from Buffalo but is putting up 15 points per game off the bench. Senior Keshon Gilbert has 21 assists to just six giveaways so far. And junior Tamin Lipsey, a hometown product, is an All-Big-12-level defender with 3-point range. The caveat, of course, is that Iowa State has yet to play a meaningful opponent — sorry, SWAC, Summit and Horizon League. They’re ranked this high for a reason, though — T.J. Otzelberger schemes up a menacing and disciplined defense, and three starters return from the team that earned a No. 2 seed in last season’s NCAA Tournament. But this Auburn matchup is the Cyclones’ chance to really assert themselves. This year’s Maui Invitational proceedings will also feel heavier after one of the deadliest and most destructive wildfires in American history ravaged Maui just 15 months ago. “I’m sensitive, and (we’re) still in the healing process,” said Luis Fuentes, an island resident speaking with Brendan Marks. He called the tournament “a little light at the end of a dark, whole yearlong tunnel.”  (Photo of Johni Broome: Alex Slitz / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Spurs confirmed in a statement on Monday that Vicario suffered the injury during Saturday’s 4-0 win at Manchester City. “Guglielmo will be assessed by our medical staff to determine when he can return to training,” the statement added. Vicario’s recovery is expected to take months following his surgery. Advertisement The 28-year-old was limping when walking through the mixed zone at the Etihad Stadium following Saturday’s game, but did play the full 90 minutes. He also received treatment on the pitch in the first half of the match following a collision with City winger Savinho, after which the Italian appeared to be holding his right ankle. “I played 60 minutes at the Etihad with a broken bone in my ankle, giving absolutely everything I had for the team,” Vicario posted on social media. “Unfortunately there was no way around this one… I needed surgery.” Vicario has been a Premier League ever-present for Tottenham since joining from Empoli for a fee of around €20million (£17.2m; $21.9m) last summer, featuring in all 38 matches last season and their 12 so far this term.     A post shared by Guglielmo Vicario (@guglielmovicario)  He also played in Spurs’ first two Europa League league phase matches this season, with Fraser Forster coming in for the other two. Vicario also started in his side’s Carabao Cup third-round win over Manchester City last month, with Forster having played in the second-win victory against Coventry City. This is potentially the worst possible injury Tottenham’s squad could have suffered and will have burst the mood after their stunning 4-0 victory over Manchester City at the Etihad on Sunday. Vicario was crucial to that victory with a series of impressive saves. Since he joined Spurs from Italian side Empoli in June 2023, the Italy international’s distribution has been crucial to the way Postecoglou wants his side to build up from the back. Vicario has the composure when under pressure from opposition strikers to wait until the perfect moment before playing a pass to a defender or one of the midfielders. The problem is Tottenham do not have a quality replacement for him. Forster has made three appearances in all competitions this season but does not have the same confidence when stepping off his line or with the ball at his feet. Tottenham also have two goalkeepers who have progressed through their academy but Alfie Whiteman, 26, and Brandon Austin, 25, have never made a senior appearance for them. Whiteman’s only previous experience was on loan in Sweden while Austin played five times in the MLS for Orlando City in 2021. Advertisement Postecoglou has no choice but to rely on Forster for a busy festive period and might have to adapt his tactics and play slightly deeper because relying on the 36-year-old to sweep up the huge space behind the defence’s high line feels incredibly risky. It is not an exaggeration to say that Vicario’s injury could have massive consequences for their season. (Photos: Paul Ellis/AFP via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"What to watch this week in NBA: Bucks-Heat, Thunder-Lakers and Black Friday Cup games",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5944305/2024/11/25/what-to-watch-nba-bucks-heat-thunder-lakers/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 19:36:04 GMT","The NBA Cup continues this week, including five games on national TV on Black Friday.","Sports Betting It’s the time of year for overindulgence and public declarations of thankfulness. We have much to be grateful for as an NBA audience. Nikola Jokić is back, returning Saturday with a masterful performance against the Los Angeles Lakers (34 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists). LaMelo Ball ate, then asked for seconds, in a 50-piece vs. the Milwaukee Bucks. And Franz Wagner is taking the leap before our eyes. Wagner has scored 30 or more in four of his last five games, complete with an icy game-winner on the road. Advertisement We will make a plate out of this week’s pro basketball schedule, with more in-season tournament play and a hearty 16 different teams on national broadcasts. This latest installment of the viewing guide breaks things down by servings of turkey (primary filling), stuffing (what completes the meal) and vegetables (the less glamorous stuff that’s nevertheless good for you). Here’s what to watch and why to watch it across the NBA this week, which features five games on national TV on Black Friday. You can stream the NBA on Fubo (try for free). For games Nov. 25-Dec. 1. * denotes NBA Cup game. Time: Tuesday, 7:30 p.m. ET
TV: TNT Turkey: Look at that. Maybe the Bucks aren’t a total disaster. After its nightmarish 2-8 start, Milwaukee enters the week at 8-9, which is somehow good for sixth in the Eastern Conference. The upswing includes four straight home wins, three of which came against teams with losing records. It’s hard to lose when Giannis Antetokounmpo plays out-of-his-mind basketball. He’s averaging 32.4 points per game so far, the highest mark of his 12-year NBA career, and he’s yet to shoot below 50 percent this season. Stuffing: Even with Sunday’s overtime triumph over the Dallas Mavericks, Miami hasn’t been the most thrilling watch at 7-7. The pace is slow, the offense is erratic, and Jimmy Butler famously saves his best stuff for April and May. But no amount of tryptophan excuses sleeping on this team against this particular opponent. The Heat have pestered these guys since their upset rout of the top-seeded Bucks squad in the 2020 playoffs. The Bucks took revenge the following postseason before Miami beat another top-seeded Bucks team in the 2023 playoffs. Bam Adebayo seems to embrace the challenge of guarding Antetokounmpo, and Tyler Herro grew up in Milwaukee. This matchup often summons the Heat’s best. Advertisement Vegetables: Both sides are admirably grinding through unsightly starts. Miami ranked 20th in defensive efficiency after its first eight games; that mark is up to fifth during its last five contests. Since joining the starting lineup, Haywood Highsmith is among the league leaders in deflected passes. Heat opponents are shooting the fewest free throws in the league. The Bucks, meanwhile, employ a fun bench that has helped spell Damian Lillard’s cold stretch. AJ Green has a bonkers 71.8 effective shooting percentage in expanded minutes this season. Gary Trent Jr. has hit 17 of his last 26 3-pointers. And Bobby Portis is highly combustible. If there were a rivalry trophy, it would be: The Bursting Bubble. That 2020 playoff upset formally announced this resilient iteration of the Butler-Adebayo Heat and created a demon for the Bucks to exorcise in their 2021 title run. Time: Tuesday, 10 p.m. ET
TV: TNT Turkey: Kevin Durant is expected to play Tuesday, after missing two weeks with a calf issue. LeBron James is still balling as he approaches his 40th birthday. Barring a setback to either supernova talent, this KD vs. LeBron matchup is enough to fill the plate and soak up all the gravy. Stuffing: Bradley Beal (calf) is also in line to return Tuesday. At full strength, this Phoenix team looked elite, standing at 9-2 before the stars’ recent injuries. When everyone is available, the Beal, Durant and Devin Booker trio makes for some of the silkiest jump-shooting in the sport. The Suns are 11th in offensive rating this season, even after their short-handed slump, and their clean orange tournament court will look like a perpetual heat check if the home side’s shots fall. For the visitors, Dalton Knecht is beginning to break out. He is shooting 45 percent from behind the arc. Just like Jared McCain, selected one pick before him, Knecht is looking like a mid-round revelation. His presence opens up even more space for Anthony Davis, who had a monstrous 29 points, 15 rebounds and three blocks in his last meeting with the Suns. Advertisement Vegetables: Assist-to-turnover ratio is the green bean casserole of basketball talk, but hey, Tyus Jones takes pristine care of Suns possessions. The veteran point guard is averaging almost seven dimes to just over one giveaway. These Lakers must have a timeshare at the end of the restricted area — they practically live at the foul line. No team has made or attempted more free throws this year, allowing Los Angeles to control the tempo and score efficiently. They also run the third-most post-up possessions in the league and are third in clutch shooting percentage. This offense is designed to churn through close games. If there were a rivalry trophy, it would be: Gail’s Goblet. As an expansion franchise in 1968, Phoenix snagged Los Angeles guard Gail Goodrich. He emerged as an All-Star in his first Suns season, then returned to the Lakers in 1970 — where he leveled up with four more All-Star appearances and won a ring in 1972. Time: Friday, 7:30 p.m. ET
TV: ESPN Turkey: No need to overthink this: it’s Anthony Edwards in prime time. Last season, the Timberwolves played on 10 total national broadcasts; they are scheduled for 25 this year. The powers that be acknowledge Edwards as nothing short of transfixing. His scoring averages and shooting percentages have gone up in each of his five NBA campaigns, a downright horrifying reality for all the teams except Minnesota. Edwards first turned our heads all the way around with his furious, acrobatic dunks. But he’s now added a swagger from the deep perimeter. He’s taking 11.1 3-pointers per game, exceeding the likes of Stephen Curry, Damian Lillard and Luka Dončić. Stuffing: Even sans Kawhi Leonard, the Clippers look like defensive stalwarts this season. They’re a searing headache for opposing teams. The Sacramento Kings had 29 points at halftime of Friday’s group stage game, and Golden State was held under triple-digits last Monday. Only the Warriors force opponents into worse 3-point shooting marks. LA comes into this week winners of five straight, three of which were without Norman Powell. Who saw a James Harden-led team ever getting up to fourth in defensive rating? Vegetables: The second units are interesting here. Reigning Sixth Man of the Year Naz Reid is taking almost eight 3-pointers per 36 minutes. Donte DiVincenzo has had an arduous start in Minnesota, but Nickeil Alexander-Walker is making up for some of that with career-best shooting. Advertisement Amir Coffey comes off the Clippers bench at 46.2 percent on catch-and-shoot 3s. Oh, and James Harden shoots a lot of free throws. He’s the Rembrandt of getting to the line. Some folks enjoy their vegetables. If there were a rivalry trophy, it would be: The Patrick Beverley Table of Vengeance. Before the Timberwolves celebrated their first conference finals in two decades, they turned all the way up for a play-in win over the Clippers. Time: Friday, 10 p.m. ET
TV: ESPN Turkey: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander should once again be in the MVP conversation. Remember that Clippers defense we all fear? Well, the Thunder powerhouse torched them earlier this month for 45 points and nine assists, adding five steals and two blocks with just one turnover. And yes, he did that without Chet Holmgren on the floor. Gilgeous-Alexander is also taking on new, more ambitious defensive responsibilities. Per Basketball Reference, he has played 59 percent of his minutes at the small forward position — and another 30 at the power forward-center spot. He has two or more blocks in five games. He’s a must-watch. Stuffing: Oklahoma City sorely misses Holmgren (hip) roaming the paint, but pro basketball heads have been hip to Isaiah Hartenstein’s craftiness for a couple of years now. The 7-foot center looked good in his Thunder debut, tallying 13 points, 14 rebounds and four blocks. He missed the beginning of this season with a hand injury, and his presence as a screener will further bolster the Thunder offense. Hartenstein was third in screen assist points in last year’s playoffs as a member of the New York Knicks, trailing only Rudy Gobert and Jokić. It may have been lost along the conveyor belt of Lakers storylines so far — Davis’ career-best start, James’ infinite vitality, Knecht’s rookie breakout and JJ Redick magnetizing the good vibes. But check out what Austin Reaves is up to. Reaves has career-best marks in minutes, points, steals, 3-pointers attempted and usage rate. Vegetables: Going to battle against this Thunder defense must feel like chasing your dog after chugging a gallon of mashed potatoes. OKC is relentless, leading the NBA in defensive rating. Alex Caruso has been hindered by a hip injury of his own, but if he’s available by Friday, he should be extra motivated to go against the team that gave him his first NBA opportunity. Caruso scores more points per game against the Lakers than any other opponent. Advertisement Cam Reddish looks good in Los Angeles right now, on an admittedly small sample size. He has the second-best defensive rating on the team, behind Davis, of course. And he’s in the top percentile in points per shot. It feels like a slight development but a potentially meaningful one for a starting lineup crammed with high-usage basketball celebrities. The Lakers have won five of their last six matchups vs. the Thunder. They also took the first six games against the franchise after its relocation from Seattle. Oklahoma City notched nine consecutive wins in the series from 2014-16. If there were a rivalry trophy, it would be: The Stardust-Prairie Dust Converter.  The Celtics (+500) are the current favorites to win the in-season tournament. Boston is 2-1 in the group stage, handing the Cavs their first loss of the season and emerging with a plus-14 point differential. The Warriors are second at +600 after a 3-0 start to the tourney. The Knicks are third at +700, weighted for their easier group opponents (Hornets, Nets, 76ers and the Paolo Banchero-less Magic, who are looking formidable in their own right). James Dolan in Vegas — what could go wrong? The Wolves and Rockets are tied for sixth at +1000 odds. Both are in West Group A, with Houston at 2-0 and a plus-49 point differential, while Minnesota is 1-1 with a minus-10 mark. Go figure. The Lakers are considerably lower on the list at +1400, despite coming in as the defending tournament champs and leading their West Group B at 2-0. Time: Wednesday, 10 p.m. ET
TV: ESPN Turkey: Some bouts don’t need gimmicks or weigh-in drama to sell the fight. These are the two winningest teams in the NBA’s better conference. Golden State is fourth in points per game and fifth in scoring defense. Oklahoma State has the best defensive rating in the league and an MVP candidate in Gilgeous-Alexander. Both teams play with top-10 pace and both sidelines are paced by elite basketball minds. This game should rock. Advertisement And with respect to Bridget Jones, turkey Curry sounds delicious right now. Stuffing: Andrew Wiggins is starting to round into 2022 NBA Finals form. He’s 47.7 percent from the field, tied for the best mark of his career. It’s hard to believe that Wiggins is still just 29 years old. His 11-year career has taken on several stages — No. 1 draft pick, heavily-criticized max-contract, playoff hero — but he seems finally settled in as a steadying force for the Warriors. Vegetables: To anyone in your life lazily complaining about defense in today’s NBA, tell them to tune in and watch these two. If you liked watching hand checks in the early 2000s, well, that’s probably never coming back. But both Golden State and Oklahoma City’s defenses are a delight to watch.

The longtime Utah head coach was asked Monday about his future leading the program in 2025 as the Utes (4-7, 1-7) prepare to wrap up a thoroughly disappointing season Friday on the road at Central Florida. Advertisement “I will obviously evaluate after the season’s over, see what the situation is, but my decision will be made based on what’s best for the program, not what’s best for me,” Whittingham said. “It’ll be completely determined on how I feel this program is best served going forward.” Utah defensive coordinator Morgan Scalley has been named coach-in-waiting since last November and will assume the head coach position whenever Whittingham decides to retire. He’s currently the second-longest tenured head coach in college football — tied with Oklahoma State’s Mike Gundy at 19 years — behind Iowa’s Kirk Ferentz (25 years). Last week, Whittingham said he is working with Scalley regarding the impending offensive coordinator hire. Utah’s veteran offensive coordinator Andy Ludwig resigned on Oct. 20 amidst the program’s season-long struggles on offense. For the first time since 2013, Utah will not be bowl-bound. No matter the outcome of Friday’s regular-season finale in Orlando, Fla., 2024 will be Utah’s third losing campaign in 20 years under Whittingham. The Utes were the preseason favorite to win the Big 12 Conference but are currently mired in the longest losing streak since 1986 having dropped seven straight after starting 4-0.

 Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox. Utah’s abysmal offensive numbers in 2024 have been driven largely by the bizarre set of injuries that beset the quarterback position. Utah will start its fifth-string quarterback, Luke Bottari, at UCF on Friday night after yet another season-ending injury to a Utah QB. True freshman Isaac Wilson left Utah’s 31-28 loss to Iowa State in the second half with a knee injury. Wilson is the latest Utah quarterback to be lost for the season after starter Cam Rising and backups Brandon Rose and Sam Huard suffered season-ending injuries throughout the fall. Asked Monday about the potential timing of his decision with the offensive coordinator search still ongoing and the transfer portal opening on Dec. 9, Whittingham said he didn’t have an exact timeline. Advertisement “Can’t tell you, for sure,” he said. “We’ll sit down and evaluate everything. I can tell you right now that Coach Scalley will be involved with decisions going forward. It’s only right he does that because he’s the coach-in-waiting and when that time comes, we need to make sure he’s had input on big decisions. It’ll be a team effort in that respect going forward as far as hiring and recruiting.” Whittingham, who turned 65 last week, said he “still has plenty of gas in the tank” but will not only take a hard look at the state of the program after the season ends but understands the perfect ending to a coaching career is rarely achieved. “To time it just right so you can go out at just the right time, there is a very, very small percentage of people who are able to do that,” he said. “So, again, I’m not saying, ‘Well, this was a bad year for me, so I’ve got to come back and have a better year.’ Everyone wants to have a better year next year regardless of who the coach is.” (Photo: Chris Gardner / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Coleman made a visit late in the process to see Colorado and then-new coach Deion Sanders.

There’s no reason to believe they’re done, either. So what's next?","MLB Believe it or not, the Los Angeles Angels just completed their most expensive deal of the past five winters. According to a league source, Yusei Kikuchi signed a three-year, $63 million contract — one that tops the $58 million given to closer Raisel Iglesias before the 2022 season. Angels GM Perry Minasian has had to deal with fluctuating payroll levels every season. Signing Kikuchi is far from a massive splash, but it signals that owner Arte Moreno was serious about upping payroll in 2025 and doing everything they can to compete. GO DEEPER Angels, Yusei Kikuchi agree to 3-year, $63 million deal Reasonable people can disagree as to whether all of this is smart. Many believed a full-scale rebuild was necessary in 2025. But that’s not how Moreno operates. And Minasian is likely very aware that he’ll need something in the ballpark of a 20-win improvement from a 63-win season to keep ownership happy with his job performance. Advertisement The Angels have been, by far, the most aggressive team this offseason. They’ve added Jorge Soler, Travis d’Arnaud, Kyle Hendricks and Kevin Newman, among others. And shed some members of their roster in the process. There’s no reason to believe they’re done, either. So what comes next? Here are five next steps the team could take. While the Angels need starter depth and quality starting pitching, making a deal here could address other, more pressing needs. The downside of trading Anderson is that his value is diminished. Yes, Anderson was an All-Star last year. But his production dipped quite a bit later in the season, and his expected stats were worse than his actual numbers — a red flag for any team looking into acquiring a 35-year-old whose fastball averages less than 88 miles per hour. Still, Anderson’s contract is not prohibitive even for more frugal teams. And with starting pitching at a premium, he could net the Angels something, anything, to make them more competitive in 2025. I know, gasp. The Angels trading away their top prospect. Let me be very clear: They absolutely should not do this. However, if the mandate is to win now, which it very clearly is, then this will be on the table. The Angels have all but made Zach Neto, Logan O’Hoppe and most of their young big-league talent untouchable on the trade market. But that doesn’t necessarily apply to Moore and other prospects still in the system. To be clear, the Angels would have to net a massive return for this deal to make sense. Think Garrett Crochet or Vladimir Guerrero Jr. And even in those scenarios, other players would likely be involved. But if the Angels are serious about making a credible run next season, they might need a star player. Moore is one of only a handful of names in this organization that could potentially make that happen. So it has to be considered. Estévez is one of the best free-agent relievers available, along with guys like Tanner Scott, Clay Holmes and Jeff Hoffman. But Estévez knows the Angels, seemingly enjoyed his time with the team and could create quite the back end with Ben Joyce next season. The Angels could absolutely still use another big starter like Corbin Burnes, Blake Snell or Max Fried. But their estimated payroll for 2025 is already at $190 million, according to FanGraphs. So unless they’re willing to really push the CBT threshold, it’s unlikely any of those pitchers end up in Anaheim. Advertisement Perhaps slightly cheaper options like Jack Flaherty, Sean Manea or Shane Bieber could be in their price range, but the upper echelon of the market feels unlikely. Having a dominant bullpen could mitigate a dearth of great starting pitching. And Estévez, despite giving up the grand slam that ended the Phillies’ season, truly established his career with the Angels. It sure feels like Minasian is determined to shake up this entire roster and reset the culture of this ballclub. The fate of Rendon on the 2025 Angels is not strictly up to the GM, however. This will inevitably be a decision for Moreno, who will be the one cutting $76 million worth of checks to Rendon over the next two years. It’s already been determined that Rendon will not have a starting job awaiting him in spring training. And it’s also been determined that he is unable to stay healthy for elongated periods or be productive when he is healthy. Of course, baseball is crazy. Maybe he will find a second wind in his age-35 season. But baseball is also about cold calculations, and there’s probably no one in the sport expecting that to happen. If this team is truly set on shaking up the culture and vibe to move on from their many failures, it stands to reason that they’ll consider moving on from Rendon. If they’re looking to add a third baseman, Alex Bregman is available, though his statistical decline from his peak in 2018-19 feels like a massive risk at a high price. Perhaps a player like Paul DeJong makes more sense and offers some defensive versatility on the infield. The Angels elected not to trade Taylor Ward at the deadline, back when it appeared they might be entering a full-scale rebuild. Now, his value is probably a little higher after a strong end to the season. Advertisement This deal only makes sense if a team overpays. Ward has two full years of team control remaining. He is a career 110 OPS+ hitter and a strong defensive player. Given the uncertainty of whether Jo Adell and Mickey Moniak can be effective everyday big leaguers, however, it’s debatable as to whether Ward is more valuable to them while actually on their roster. Soler is also one of the worst defensive outfielders in the game, so it should be a priority to keep his bat in the lineup as a DH. This offseason has been a lesson in completely rethinking the Angels’ path to being competitive, so everything has to be on the table, including this trade.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Vancouver Whitecaps part with head coach Vanni Sartini after MLS Cup playoffs first-round exit,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5947232/2024/11/25/vanni-sartini-whitecaps-next-coach/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 19:10:52 GMT",Sartini took over in 2021 and led the Canadian side to postseason appearances in three of the last four years.,"MLS The Vancouver Whitecaps has parted with head coach Vanni Sartini, the MLS team announced Monday. Sartini first took over the Canadian club as an interim coach during the 2021 season, replacing Marc Dos Santos, earning the job on a permanent basis after getting the team into the postseason. In total, Sartini led the Whitecaps to the MLS Cup playoffs in 2021, 2023, and 2024, falling in the first round of each instalment. Advertisement In a press release, Vancouver framed this as a mutual parting of ways. However, sporting director Axel Schuster seemed to position this as his own determination in a quote from the team’s official announcement. “I took my time with this decision, and it was not taken lightly,” Schuster wrote. “We have taken important steps each year and it is now the right time for someone else to lead this group on the pitch with fresh and new energy. We have started the process to find our next head coach as we look to take the next step and build a championship contender in MLS, as well as continental tournaments.” While three first-round exits in four seasons are not exactly a robust return, it is worth remembering the Whitecaps team that Sartini inherited. Vancouver made just one trip to the playoffs from 2016 through 2020, and looked likely to repeat that ineffectiveness before he took over the squad in 2021. The Whitecaps had also failed to win the Canadian Championship in the same five-year span, but Sartini led the team to triumphs in the domestic cup in 2022, 2023 and 2024.  Sartini also worked with a roster that was compiled on a relatively lean budget and with frequent squad turnover under Schuster’s operation. Vancouver remained competitive under the Italian thanks in large part to the attacking tandem of Ryan Gauld and Brian White, who joined the club in 2021 and became one of the league’s strongest forward partnerships. GO DEEPER Gauld, the Vancouver player compared to Messi: 'It's not great to have that follow you around' While this year’s squad ranked 12th in salary expenditure, the Whitecaps have been infamous for perceived low investment via transfer fees and updating the academy, particularly in the years following homegrown wing-back Alphonso Davies’ sale to Bayern Munich in January 2019 for an initial $13.5million with performance bonuses that may have risen up to $22m. Advertisement Under Sartini, the Whitecaps became one of MLS’s most watchable teams for neutral viewers. His system generated plenty of chances, though the Whitecaps fell from sixth in chances created per game in 2023 to 18th in 2024. It appears that Schuster and Kerfoot believed that this team had reached its ceiling under his guidance: a side that could consistently qualify for the playoffs and win the domestic cup, but struggle to truly square up against MLS’s top teams. Sartini became a frequent topic of discussion for MLS’s disciplinary committee. In November 2023, the league issued a six-game suspension after the coach made questionable comments about an officiating decision by referee Tim Ford. The Whitecaps’ match on Nov. 5 ended in controversy, as Ford blocked a Whitecaps player from picking up a loose ball on a corner kick, contributing to an LAFC counter-attack that ended in a goal that was eventually ruled out for offside. After the match, Sartini said of the officiating: “If they found (Ford) in False Creek then I’m going to be a suspect. I’m not saying that I would do it, I’m saying I’m the first suspect — it’s different.” Sartini was clear he was joking, but it did not land well. At other times in the press conference, Sartini called the referee’s performance “shameful,” “a disgrace,” and “f—ing horrible.” MLS eventually reduced his suspension by two games, and he coached his first match of the 2024 season on March 23. Vancouver now has one of three current MLS coaching vacancies, joining Atlanta United and the Philadelphia Union. (Top photo: Jeff Vinnick/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Can Anthony Richardson lead them there?","NFL The Indianapolis Colts are one game away from entering their Week 14 bye. The time away should help them refocus over the final stretch of what’s shaping up to be an eventful conclusion to the regular season. It’s not just that the Colts, despite losing four of their past five games, remain in the playoff hunt. It’s that the teams they’ll face down the stretch give them a realistic shot to earn their first postseason berth since 2020. Indianapolis’ final five games feature matchups against the Patriots, Broncos, Titans, Giants and Jaguars. Excluding Denver, which is 7-5, the other four opponents are a combined 10-35. In other words, these are very winnable games. Of course, the Colts still have their own issues to figure out if they hope to take advantage of their soft schedule. Quarterback Anthony Richardson has played better since returning from his benching, but the offensive line has struggled, running back Jonathan Taylor has become a non-factor, and too much is being asked of a middling defense that was bad to start the season but has made significant strides to give Indianapolis chances it keeps squandering. So, now I’ll turn it over to you. What’s on your mind amid yet another up-and-down Colts campaign?

If your brain is warped by your passion for college basketball, you’ll identify these as trademarks of Thanksgiving week. That’s right — it’s Maui Invitational season. Last year’s installment was an absolute banger. Purdue squeaked by Tennessee and the blistering shooting of Dalton Knecht, then beat Oso Ighodaro’s Marquette by three points in the title game. Zach Edey earned tournament MVP. Advertisement This year’s edition goes full-fledged right away on Monday night with Auburn vs. Iowa State. The proceedings will feel a bit heavier after one of the deadliest and most destructive wildfires in American history ravaged Maui just 15 months ago. “I’m sensitive, and (we’re) still in the healing process,” island resident Luis Fuentes told Brendan Marks.

You can stream college basketball on Fubo (try for free). Venue: T-Mobile Arena — Las Vegas
Time: Tuesday, 9 p.m. ET
TV: ESPN Here we go — the bluest of blues. Kansas and Duke are just two of the five programs with 2,000 victories. They’re third and fourth, respectively, in all-time winning percentage. And they’re both national title contenders this season. Consider this our first indulgence of the holiday week. The Blue Devils are 8-6 in the historic head-to-head series, but the Jayhawks have won four of the last five meetings. Kansas is the top-ranked team in the country, but Duke touts the higher KenPom rating through five games. These two sides combine for high-wattage star power and a national allure befitting Vegas Boulevard. Hunter Dickinson is enjoying a second consecutive season averaging at least 17 points and 10 rebounds with the Jayhawks. He’s also at a career high in blocks and career low in turnovers. While the Blue Devils roll with two dynamic freshman bigs, the fifth-year Dickinson is a steadying presence inside for Kansas. Encircling him are three bucket-getters from the transfer portal — Zeke Mayo (South Dakota State), AJ Storr (Wisconsin) and Rylan Griffen (Alabama). And freshman Flory Bidunga is doing wild things with his limited playing time, shooting 82.6 percent from the floor (!) to average more than eight points in less than 13 minutes per game. Advertisement Kansas point guard Dajuan Harris Jr. has a clean assist-to-turnover rate. And KJ Adams Jr. is the team’s fulcrum — coach Bill Self said his senior forward is “as valuable as any player we’ve ever had.” Adams has put up a 4.0 win share in each of his last two seasons, and he led the Big 12 in field goal percentage last year. Duke washed out the taste of that early Kentucky loss with an inspired road win over Arizona Friday night. Cooper Flagg scored 24 points — on 22 shots — and added six rebounds, three assists, two blocks and a steal. Teammates Kon Knueppel and Tyrese Proctor have a green light from behind the arc, as they’re both on pace to shoot the most 3s in a Duke season since Cam Reddish and RJ Barrett in 2018-19. Jon Scheyer’s group enters the game fifth in defensive rating, especially impressive given their two ranked nonconference opponents. Khaman Maluach, the 7-foot-2 South Sudanese freshman, will be primarily tasked with containing Dickinson down low. He’s ninth in the ACC in blocked shots and 13th in offensive rebounds. November college basketball doesn’t normally offer top-line coolness like this. It’s well worth the late tip-off time. Memorable Matchup: 1991 NCAA championship — the first of 32 straight title games called by Jim Nantz and the first of five natties for Mike Krzyzewski. The Blue Devils slayed its dragon in UNLV, then won it all behind Christian Laettner’s 18 points and 10 rebounds. Mark Randall also had 18 and 10 in the losing effort. Time: Monday, 9 p.m. ET
TV: ESPNU For real, how is this a first-round matchup in Maui? This is an immediate signature test for both programs, though Auburn doesn’t quite need one after already toppling Houston earlier this month. Bruce Pearl’s squad is second in KenPom offensive rating and fifth in defense. The Tigers’ previous two head coaches, Jeff Lebo and Tony Barbee, combined for just two winning seasons and zero NCAA Tournament appearances in a decade of miserable basketball. Pearl now has the school ranked in the top 10 for the sixth time in his 11 campaigns. Advertisement Auburn’s Johni Broome, a fifth-year senior, has been dominant so far. He’s putting up 20 points, 11.3 rebounds and an SEC-best 3.3 blocks per game. He’s also a full 10 percentage points higher than his career-best field goal mark and is averaging his fewest turnovers despite a herculean 32 percent usage rate. Chaney Johnson has taken an inspiring, serpentine path to this moment, starting in Division II with Alabama-Huntsville. Averaging 25 minutes a night, he is a stat stuffer at 12.5 points, 7.3 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.3 blocks. Fellow seniors Denver Jones (11.3 points per game), Chad Baker-Mazara (10.5) and Miles Kelly (10.3) are all capable scorers, while freshman Tahaad Pettiford was wholly unafraid of big shots in the Houston win. This offense is well-balanced and deep. Iowa State comes into Monday’s tilt with the best-scoring defense in all of college basketball. Five Cyclones are averaging double-digit points, with starting center Dishon Jackson nearby at 9.3. The guards are good and well-traveled. Senior Curtis Jones had an inefficient first season in Ames after transferring from Buffalo but is putting up 15 points per game off the bench. Senior Keshon Gilbert has 21 assists to just six giveaways so far. And junior Tamin Lipsey, a hometown product, is an All-Big-12-level defender with 3-point range. The caveat, of course, is that Iowa State has yet to play a meaningful opponent — sorry, SWAC, Summit and Horizon League. They’re ranked this high for a reason though — T.J. Otzelberger schemes up a menacing and disciplined defense, and three starters return from the team that earned a No. 2 seed in last season’s NCAA Tournament. But this Auburn matchup is the Cyclones’ chance to really assert themselves. Monday’s winner will expect to see UNC on Tuesday unless Dayton pulls a signature upset. Time: Monday, 2:30 p.m. ET
TV: ESPN2 The Tigers are off to a respectable 4-0 start, and they come to Hawaii with the 32nd-best KenPom rating. PJ Haggerty is a strong, athletic guard scoring 22.5 points per game, and he put up 21.2 last year with Tulsa. Advertisement But UConn is, well, UConn. Dan Hurley’s Huskies are the back-to-back defending champions. Alex Karaban seemingly cannot miss on the long ball, and Liam McNeeley projects as a late NBA lottery pick in The Athletic’s mock draft. McNeeley is nice on catch-and-shoot looks and is exhausting off-ball. Connecticut should take this one, advancing to face the winner of Colorado vs. Michigan State on Tuesday. Time: Monday, 5 p.m. ET
TV: ESPN2 Fourth-year Spartan Jaden Akins leads Tom Izzo’s MSU, while Colorado fields a pair of 14 point-per-game scorers in big men Andrej Jakimovski and Elijah Malone. The winner of this one will likely have to face the UConn buzzsaw in Tuesday’s next round. Time: Monday, 11:30 p.m. ET
TV: ESPN2 Dayton comes in at 5-0, seeking a second consecutive NCAA Tournament bid. Enoch Cheeks has almost doubled his scoring output from last year, and Malachi Smith is the Flyers’ resolute floor general. He had surgery on both ankles in the 2023 offseason, only to tear his meniscus seven minutes into the regular season. The senior is back and diming up his teammates. But it’s hard to see the Hubert Davis and the Tar Heels losing here. They are seventh in total scoring and ninth in College Basketball Reference’s simple rating system. Combined, RJ Davis, Elliot Cadeau and Seth Trimble are accounting for about 50 points a night, and that’s with Davis’ unsightly shooting start. All times Eastern. Though obviously not as established or branded as the Maui Invitational, this inaugural tourney gives us five ranked squads in an eight-team field, including No. 6 Houston and No. 9 Alabama. The programs have been sorted into “Power” and “Impact” bracket groups, with the seedings established by head-to-head record and point differential.

Downs immediately grabbed at his right shoulder and stayed down before eventually getting up and walking off the field. He reentered the game on the Colts’ next series, and played 29 of a possible 55 offensive snaps.   Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.
 Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.  Indianapolis could choose to be cautious with Downs since it only has one game left before its bye week. If Downs is held out against the Patriots, it would be a significant blow to the Colts’ offense. The second-year pro missed the first two games of the season due to a right high ankle sprain, but he still leads Indianapolis in targets (78), catches (53), first-down receptions (31) and receiving yards per game (59.4). Downs is also tied with fellow wideout Alec Pierce for the team-high in receiving touchdowns (four). Pierce got banged up as well in the second half of Sunday’s contest. He had his right ankle re-taped by trainers on the sideline, and walked gingerly in the locker room after the game. Despite his gait, Pierce is “good,” a league source told The Athletic, and there’s no reason to be overly concerned about his status moving forward. Pierce is averaging a league-high 23.3 yards per catch this season. NFL Network first reported the news of Downs’ shoulder injury.

Newcastle are ninth in the Premier League and can rise to sixth with a victory, which would be their third in a row in the top flight and fourth in succession in all competitions. Having Wilson available again is a huge positive for Howe, given that he offers an alternative to Alexander Isak, the first-choice centre-forward.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Angels trying another big move with Yusei Kikuchi signing. Plus, robot umps are nigh",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5947095/2024/11/25/yusei-kikuchi-angels-automated-strike-zone-the-windup/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 18:43:07 GMT","Welcome to The Windup, The Athletic's daily MLB newsletter.","MLB The Windup Newsletter ⚾ | This is The Athletic’s daily MLB newsletter. Sign up here to receive The Windup directly in your inbox. Yusei Kikuchi is the latest ingredient in whatever the Angels are cooking up in Anaheim. Plus: Ken on the Braves’ payroll situation, the Royals solved a big problem and the time for robot umpires is very nigh. I’m Levi Weaver, here with Ken Rosenthal. Welcome to The Windup! Say what you will about the Angels (and I certainly have), but they’re having the most interesting offseason in baseball so far. Early this morning, news broke that they’re signing LHP Yusei Kikuchi to a three-year deal worth $63 million. He was ranked No. 14 on our Free Agent Big Board. The 33-year-old was brilliant last year after being traded to the Astros, going 5-1 with a 2.70 ERA in 10 games down the stretch to help Houston clinch another division title. If that’s the pitcher the Angels are signing, it’s a big move. Advertisement But he had also been 4-9 with a 4.75 ERA in Toronto before the trade. 2021 (All-Star), 2022 (not great) and 2023 (very good) were also exercises in the margins. There’s always risk in signing pitchers, but I’ll give the Angels credit for this: They’re definitely trying something here. Consider these other moves from the Angels this offseason: The average age of these six acquisitions: 32.5 years old. But the Angels do have a core of young players, including Logan O’Hoppe (24), Nolan Schanuel (22) and Neto (23). There’s a world in which this offseason functions for Anaheim the way last year’s winter established some support beams around Bobby Witt Jr. and others. There’s also a world in which this breaks bad. But let’s see what else the Angels do. From my latest notes column: In years past, the Atlanta Braves might have offered Ramón Laureano a contract, even if it meant overpaying him by a million or two. But on Friday, the Braves parted with Laureano rather than offer him a one-year deal in arbitration — a move that, for a team already short on outfielders, came as somewhat of a surprise. Actually, the decision not to pay Laureano a projected salary in the $6 million range was consistent with how the Braves have operated all offseason. The team faces a considerable amount of uncertainty, from left-hander Max Fried and righty Charlie Morton possibly departing to righty Spencer Strider and right fielder Ronald Acuña Jr. starting the season on the injured list to setup man Joe Jiménez potentially missing the entire year. President of baseball operations Alex Anthopoulos is trying to save wherever he can. While the Braves’ cash payroll might end up higher than it was last season, the team might be inclined to stay under the luxury-tax threshold after exceeding it the past two years. The threshold for 2025 is $241 million. The Braves, according to Fangraphs, are currently at $217 million. Consider Anthopoulos’ moves thus far: Laureano, released by the Cleveland Guardians on May 25, hit 10 home runs and had an .832 OPS in 226 plate appearances after joining the Braves. After Acuña, the only outfielders on the Braves’ 40-man roster are Michael Harris II, Jared Kelenic, Eli White, Luke Williams and the newly signed Carlos D. Rodriguez — not exactly a stellar group. But the free-agent class is deep in outfielders who might offer comparable production to Laureano at a lower price. Advertisement The Braves’ preference is for a left-handed hitter. But if the better fit is right-handed, so be it. The market includes numerous options beyond the four outfielders expected to command the biggest contracts (Juan Soto, Anthony Santander, Teoscar Hernández and Jurickson Profar). With Acuña expected to return a month or two into the season, the Braves need not shop at the high end. Anthopoulos typically addresses his offseason needs quickly. He figures to be aggressive in the starting-pitching market and possibly the relief market, too. But with the outfielders, he need not rush. The secondary options likely will need to wait for Soto and Co. to come off the board. And given the number that are available, bargains should eventually emerge. More here. Someone check on Kirk Herbstreit. On Friday, a year and a half after that interaction, Jonathan India — along with outfielder Joey Wiemer — was traded to the Kansas City Royals for RHP Brady Singer. As Keith Law points out, the calculus is pretty easy to suss out: The Reds needed a starting pitcher, and they had run out of at-bats to give India. Problem solved, I suppose. But man, I really like this trade for the Royals, for one reason in particular.  Kansas City, as a team, got a .228 batting average (27th of 30 teams) and a .270 on-base percentage (30th) from their leadoff hitters last year. India hit .236/.353/.384 (.737 OPS) from the leadoff spot. That’s not a huge improvement in batting average, but that’s more than 80 points better in the OBP column. Why is that a big deal? Because — as you might recall — Bobby Witt Jr. hits second in the Royals’ lineup. Fifty-six of his 82 career home runs have been solo shots, including 23 of his 32 last year (and 12 of his last 13). That’s to say nothing of Witt’s 11 triples and 45 doubles (for what it’s worth, India also stole 13 bases last year, and hit 28 doubles and two triples). Advertisement Defensively, the 27-year-old India has only played second base, and incumbent Michael Massey’s .743 OPS was fourth-best on the team last year. Does one of them shift over to third base? Outfield? Kansas City will have to figure that out. But even as they authored a remarkable turnaround in 2024, the Royals lacked a table-setter ahead of Witt. India certainly seems to fit that bill. We’ve known this was on the horizon — this Evan Drellich article is from July 16 — but now we have a more firm date: MLB will test out its “ABS” (automated ball-strike) technology at select spring training parks in 2025. There have been a couple iterations of the system in the minor leagues. One had the umpires using it for every pitch, another gave teams two or three challenges per game. MLB teams will use the latter system in spring training. How it works: If a player believes that the umpire has missed a ball or strike call, they tap their head to signal a challenge. If they’re correct, the team maintains its challenge; if not, it loses it. For fans who view replay as a bothersome interruption: rest easy — while out-safe and other review calls are currently reviewed by a team of umpires looking at slow-motion video to determine the right call, ABS is pretty straightforward: Did the tracker have the ball in the zone or not? The entire process takes maybe 10 seconds. The big implication: If it goes well, there’s a chance that this system could find its way into regular-season MLB games as early as 2026. As expected, both Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani were unanimous MVPs. It’s Ohtani’s third award (his first in the NL) and Judge’s second. The non-tender deadline was last week. Our team has a list of seven intriguing players who are now free agents as a result. The Yankees are pursuing Juan Soto, obviously. But Brendan Kuty says there should be some limitations to their pursuit. Advertisement After a decade in the Giants org, Alyssa Nakken —  the first woman to coach on the field in a regular-season MLB game — is moving to a player development role with the Guardians. Jayson Stark answered a lot of your questions about this year’s Hall of Fame class. A handshake agreement with the Dodgers? Roki Sasaki’s agent says that’s not the case. 📫 Love The Windup?

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Formula 1 expands grid as General Motors to become the 11th team in 2026,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5947118/2024/11/25/formula-1-expands-grid-general-motors/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 18:40:03 GMT",F1 will have 11 teams and 22 drivers for the new regulations.,"Formula One announced Monday that “an agreement in principle” has been reached “with General Motors to support bringing GM/Cadillac” to the grid as the sport’s 11th team in 2026. “We’re excited to partner with General Motors in bringing a dynamic presence to Formula 1,” Dan Towriss, CEO of TWG Global’s motorsport business, said. “Together, we’re assembling a world-class team that will embody American innovation and deliver unforgettable moments to race fans around the world. We appreciate the FIA and FOM’s support of our application and their recognition of the value we can bring to the championship.’’ Advertisement “General Motors and Cadillac’s commitment to this project is an important and positive demonstration of the evolution of our sport,” said F1 president and CEO Stefano Domenicali. We look forward to seeing the progress and growth of this entry, certain of the full collaboration and support of all the parties involved.” This comes after news broke during the Las Vegas Grand Prix weekend that General Motors was nearing approval to join the grid in 2026. Andretti Global initially put forward the bid, which included GM building its power unit in 2028, but F1 rejected it. Still, the project continued. Andretti has undergone restructuring recently, with Michael Andretti leaving his operational role and Dan Towriss taking over. It seemed the grid may be open to welcoming GM, based on comments made during Thursday’s news conference. Mercedes’ Toto Wolff said, “We have an obligation, a statutory obligation as directors to present the standpoint that is the best for our company and for our employees, and we’ve done that so in the past. I think if a team can add to the championship, particularly if GM decides to come in as a team owner, that is a different story. And as long as it is creative, that means we’re growing the popularity of the sport, we’re growing the revenue of the sport, then no team will be ever against it. So I’m putting my hope in there.” A prominent American manufacturer with an extensive motorsports history joining the grid could bring fresh eyes to the sport, but it also means the prize money will be split up even more. This will be the first team to join the grid since Haas in 2016, and the sport has had 10 teams on the grid since 2017. F1 has said before that it was open to a GM works team. When it rejected Andretti’s big, F1 said it “would look differently on an application for the entry of a team into the 2028 championship with a GM power unit, either as a GM works team or as a GM customer team designing all allowable components in-house.” Advertisement However, GM will need another customer power unit. It planned to have its F1 engine ready in 2028, two years into the new regulations. New teams joining the grid must add something, which GM does by becoming an engine manufacturer. The plan is still for GM to enter through its Cadillac brand. According to F1’s press release, “Over the course of this year, they have achieved operational milestones and made clear their commitment to brand the eleventh team GM/Cadillac, and that GM will enter as an engine supplier at a later time.” There will still be Andretti involvement, though it remains to be seen how much. GM’s announcement includes the news that Mario Andretti, the last American F1 world champion, will be on the team’s board, serving as the director. “My first love was Formula 1, and now – 70 years later – the F1 paddock is still my happy place. I’m absolutely thrilled with Cadillac, Formula 1, Mark Walter, and Dan Towriss,” Andretti said in the announcement. “To still be involved at this stage of my life — I have to pinch myself to make sure I’m not dreaming.” According to GM’s press release, the other power player involved is TWG Global, which is a holding company that “owns and operates” Andretti Global. As for the Department of Justice’s investigation into F1’s Andretti rejection, what will happen remains to be seen. (Photo: Mario Tama/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Thanksgiving week is littered with ranked matchups and potential blue-blood clashes within the neutral-site tournaments taking place from the Bahamas to Hawaii and everywhere in between. The Maui Invitational, which features No. 2 UConn, No. 4 Auburn, No. 5 Iowa State and No. 12 North Carolina, among others, tips off Monday afternoon. In Las Vegas, Kansas and Duke clash Tuesday night, while the eight-team Player’s Era Festival tips off with No. 6 Houston, No. 9 Alabama, No. 20 Texas A&M and more in action. Here’s the third men’s basketball AP Top 25 of the 2024-25 season, along with C.J. Moore’s ballot and analysis of the new rankings. This week I moved out Creighton, St. John’s, Illinois and Michigan. Creighton was a team I was skeptical of in the preseason, and a 74-63 home loss to Nebraska over the weekend, combined with the fact they’re outside the top 25 at the three main computer rankings (KenPom, Bart Torvik and Evan Miya), was enough to give the Jays the boot. Illinois was a harder call, because the Illini lost to a top-10 team in Alabama, but I was close to knocking the Illini out last week, and they haven’t done anything to warrant staying in. Michigan was right on the cusp (No. 28 at KenPom, No. 29 at Torvik and No. 22 at Evan Miya), and it made sense to include Xavier in its place. The Musketeers own a win against Wake Forest, which beat Michigan. Advertisement St. John’s was the most difficult team to knock out this week because the Johnnies look like a Top 25 team, and their computer numbers are good. They also took a bad-luck loss against Baylor in the Bahamas, with Zuby Ejiofor missing two free throws to give Jeremy Roach a chance to win the game at the buzzer with a 3. But Sunday’s loss to Georgia made it tough to justify ranking St. John’s if I wasn’t going to rank Georgia. The Bulldogs are on the watch list, but their computer numbers aren’t great. The other two teams under consideration for removal were Texas Tech and Arizona. The Wildcats stay in for now because their losses aren’t bad — at Wisconsin and home loss to Duke — they’re still inside the top 25 at all three computer rankings and they pass the eye test of a Top 25 team. Texas Tech also has great computer numbers (21/19/14) and its one loss was by one to Saint Joseph’s on an uncharacteristic bad shooting night (4 of 20 from 3). Darrion Williams missed a great look at the buzzer that would have won it. Mississippi State, another new addition, is inside the top 25 at all three computers and now has two wins against high-majors (Utah and at SMU). Texas beat a hot Saint Joseph’s team, has solid computer numbers and has just the opening-night loss to Ohio State on a neutral floor. I’m still a little skeptical of the Longhorns, but they also took that loss without former Houston/Arkansas wing Tramon Mark, who made his debut last week in the Legends Classic and should help Texas on both ends. Ohio State, another team inside the top 25 at all three computer sites, also rejoins the rankings. That Texas win is starting to look better.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Alabama's Deontae Lawson out for the year: What the injury means for Crimson Tide,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5947046/2024/11/25/deontae-lawson-injury-alabama-football/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 18:18:32 GMT","Lawson, a junior and projected NFL prospect, likely has played his final game for Alabama.","NCAAF TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — Alabama linebacker and team captain Deontae Lawson left the Oklahoma game on Saturday with an apparent leg injury. On Monday, it was confirmed to be a season-ending injury by coach Kalen DeBoer, a critical setback for an Alabama defense that surrendered 260 rushing yards in a 24-3 loss to the Sooners. Advertisement “Amazing leader, I can see not what he means to us on the field but the love the players have for him,” DeBoer said. “I know we all feel for him. We appreciate everything he’s done. Obviously, you miss what he does on the field but what he brings to the locker room.” Lawson, a junior and projected NFL prospect, likely has played his final game for Alabama. He was a Butkus Award semifinalist with 76 tackles, four pass breakups and two sacks. He was named a permanent team captain before the season, and he was Alabama’s headset communication player on defense. “When you lose a guy (like Lawson) who is your steady-maker in the box, it’s a tough loss,” defensive coordinator Kane Wommack said. “Justin Jefferson stepped up in the second half and did a really good job. We’ve got some young guys trending in the right direction with Jeremiah Alexander, Justin Okoronkwo and Cayden Jones.” Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox.
 Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox. Lawson’s injury compounds another issue for this defense: pass rush. When healthy, Lawson and Jefferson were inside linebackers while Jihaad Campbell turned into a pure pass rusher on obvious pass downs. Now, Lawson’s injury will affect how Campbell is used. He leads the team with five sacks, and Alabama had only one sack against Oklahoma. Jefferson, a senior, replaced Lawson on Saturday and finished with six tackles. Jefferson has been constant in the rotation this year as a third linebacker and has 46 tackles and two sacks. He will assume the headset communication duties moving forward, as he did in Lawson’s place at Oklahoma and will start full-time alongside Campbell at inside linebacker. “Maybe a little different style, but Justin can run, he’s physical, team-first mindset,” DeBoer said. “He’s always ready whenever called upon. We’re all fans of him and want him to go out there and be great, we’re confident in him.” (Photo: Cliff Welch / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

On tap: three games on Thanksgiving Day, one on Friday, 11 on Sunday and one on Monday. The slate includes six divisional matchups, too — something to keep an eye on after Week 12’s handful of stunning divisional upsets. Advertisement Two juicy lines for Week 13: The Eagles and the Steelers are both underdogs heading into Week 13. As of writing, the Eagles’ Week 13 opponent, Baltimore, hasn’t played its Monday night game. Expect the lines to move depending on the Ravens’ performance in the “Harbaugh Bowl.” But right now, Monday afternoon, the Baltimore Ravens are 2.5-point favorites over the rolling Eagles, who on Sunday looked easily like the best team in the NFL outside of the Detroit Lions. They are 9-2 and riding a seven-game winning streak with a point differential of +97. However the odds shake out before Sunday’s game, the Jalen Hurts/Saquon Barkley vs. Lamar Jackson/Derrick Henry matchup is must-see holiday TV. Last week, we predicted the Steelers’ trap game against the Cleveland Browns. The 8-3 Steelers were humbled in a blizzard game against their division rivals that snapped a five-game winning streak. Their reward is yet another divisional clash on the road against the Cincinnati Bengals. The Bengals, who at 4-7 are several wins below playoff contention, are 2.5-point favorites. They are coming off a bye, will be at home and boast a quarterback in Joe Burrow, who is first in QBR and passing touchdowns, second in passing yards, and third in passer rating. Another “come again?” line on the Week 13 odds board is Seahawks–Jets, where Seattle is only favored over New York by 1.5 points. And that after they won a critical divisional matchup to take the tiebreak lead over the Arizona Cardinals in the crowded NFC West. The 3-8 Jets are coming off a bye week and have home-field advantage, but the vibes out of New York are bad. While Eagles at Ravens feels like it should be the game of the week, San Francisco 49ers at Buffalo Bills takes the Sunday night spot. Niners-Bills looks a lot less like a clash of titans than it did when the 2024-25 schedule was drawn up. While Brock Purdy is expected back for the matchup, the Niners are one of the more disappointing teams in the league so far this season. They’re over a touchdown underdog to the 9-2 Bills, who easily look like the best team in the AFC despite the Kansas City Chiefs’ better record. And the Bills are coming off a bye. And they’re at home. Yikes. Advertisement Thanksgiving Day kicks off with a divisional matchup between the best-in-the-league Detroit Lions vs. the cursed Chicago Bears. The Lions are favored by double digits at home. Other divisional games this week include the Cowboys (-4) vs. the New York Giants, Chiefs (-13) vs. Las Vegas Raiders, Houston Texans (-5.5) at Jacksonville Jaguars and Tampa Bay Buccaneers (-6) at Carolina Panthers. The biggest favorites of the week go to the Chiefs (-13), Lions (-10.5) and Bills (-7). But the rest of the games look competitive by an odds standard. The closest games of a field goal or shorter are Los Angeles Chargers (-1.5) at Atlanta Falcons, Seahawks (-1.5) at Jets, Bengals (-2.5) vs. Steelers, Indianapolis Colts (-2.5) at New England Patriots, Los Angeles Rams (-2.5) at New Orleans Saints, Ravens (-2.5) vs. Eagles and Green Bay Packers (-3) vs. Miami Dolphins.

In 2023, when F1 first raced down the Strip and poured over half a billion dollars into making the race happen, there was an inevitable novelty factor. An appeal to saying ‘I was there!’ for the first Las Vegas GP matched the curiosity over how a race through the middle of one the entertainment capitals of the world might play out. It bred a natural fear of missing out. Advertisement F1 knew it couldn’t lean on quite the same intrigue for its second visit to Las Vegas. It also couldn’t realistically expect to repeat the money-spinning success of year one, which generated $1.5 billion dollars for the local economy and $77 million in tax revenue, outstripping all expectations. But in return, it got a playbook crammed with knowledge of what did and did not work in the first year. Criticism from the drivers and teams over the scheduling and the demands placed on them to buy into the ‘spectacle’ of the Las Vegas GP could be dealt with, as could the complaints from fans who felt priced out by a premium approach to ticket sales. It resulted in a more toned-down affair for year two. Some of the popular parts of the 2023 race returned, ranging from Michael Buffer’s over-the-top driver introductions to maximizing the use of the Sphere with F1-themed graphics. But it also knew what to cut back and to change. The extravagant opening ceremony that drew criticism from some of the drivers — the most vocal being the reigning champion, Max Verstappen — for being too cheesy was scrapped and replaced with a simpler yet still spectacular pre-race show for the fans. “I feel like last year, F1, if anything, was trying a bit too hard to put on too much of a show,” said Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz, who finished the race in third place. “It got a bit too much away from Formula One and too much into Vegas style. “I feel like this year, we’ve just been just more normal, doing our own thing. And it’s been a success.” If the thrilling end to the 2023 race taught F1 anything, it was that it did not need to overhype its product. Its greatest asset will always be what is happening on the race track. On a simple but fun and high-speed layout, the drivers could put on a show with an open fight for the win that went down to the closing stages. Advertisement This year’s race was again entertaining. George Russell scored a dominant win, and the race went by without significant incidents or even a safety car period, yet there was plenty of on-track action behind. The scrapping back-and-forth between Verstappen, Lewis Hamilton, Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz made for an enthralling race, with all four looking most likely to trail home Russell at points. The confidence the officials running the Las Vegas GP took from year one over the racing product, influenced by things like the track layout and the selected tire compounds, was fully justified. The focus on racing was something the drivers appreciated for 2024. There were fewer off-track distractions and asks of them, making it feel like a far more ‘normal’ race weekend than Las Vegas did last year. There felt like less of a concerted effort to highlight the unique parts of the grand prix, instead letting them speak for themselves. A case of show, don’t tell. That’s not to say there wasn’t a very Vegas flavor about proceedings. Wandering through the paddock on Saturday night ahead of the race, you could still find an Elvis impersonator every few hundred yards, and the novelty ‘Welcome to Las Vegas’ signs were still dotted around. The reasoning for putting an ice rink on top of Paddock Club, where the VIPs would spend the race, was simply ‘because it’s Vegas!’ — if any race could do it, it was this one. Although the paddock wedding chapel was no more, guests could still tie the knot in Paddock Club if they wished. And there was still the undeniable impressive fact that F1 was back racing in Las Vegas. At no other event would Russell have run out of his hospitality unit yelling “Vegas baby!” following his victory, calling on his Mercedes team to cancel plans to fly out to Los Angeles after the race. Working and racing in the heart of such an iconic city is a novelty that won’t wear off soon. That is why year two in Las Vegas felt like a success. Not only was the sport able to speak for itself, but so was Las Vegas. As Sainz noted, there wasn’t a case of trying too hard. “The race is absolutely fantastic,” said Hamilton. “It’s such a great event. They’ve really, really done a mega job this year. So I can’t wait to come back next year.” It was always part of the plan from the Las Vegas GP bosses, particularly CEO Renee Wilm and chief commercial officer Emily Prazer. In the months leading up to the race, both highlighted a desire to focus more on community and the additive nature of F1 for those living and working in Las Vegas and Clark County. Efforts such as bringing hundreds of middle school children into the paddock on Wednesday for a community day or the free fan festival reflected the shift in approach. Advertisement F1 also wanted to make the Las Vegas GP more accessible by increasing the number of general admission tickets that were made available. F1 reported a three-day attendance from Thursday to Saturday of 306,000 people, which is down from the 315,000 reported last year, although that figure did include the Wednesday opening ceremony. Many grandstands were noticeably bare through the practice sessions, probably due to their relatively low importance and the bevy of alternative options for those in Las Vegas to stay entertained. Come the race, though, this had changed, and few free seats were visible when looking up from the grid ahead of lights out. F1 clearly loves Vegas, but does Vegas love F1 back? A lot of it depends on who you talk to. While there was widespread agreement from locals that F1 had reduced the level of disruption this year, some remain frustrated about the impact the running of the grand prix has on their day-to-day lives and work. Speaking with Uber drivers or some small business owners, not everyone is enamored with having F1 in town every November, even if those in charge of the race felt there had been a big improvement in public sentiment. But there was clear evidence of Las Vegas learning where it could improve from year one to year two. From larger aspects, like an improved communication plan with local stakeholders on works required to get the track ready, to more minor things, like offering more for those in the paddock to do, eat, and drink, it felt like a more mature grand prix. Like last year, some drivers and teams remained concerned about the race scheduling. The 10 p.m. PT start time aligns with primetime events in Las Vegas, but it still makes for a challenging weekend of knowing when to sleep or eat. Russell admitted he took a 45-minute nap ahead of qualifying because of how long the day dragged. This year felt a little easier as both FP2 and qualifying were also slated for 10 p.m. PT instead of midnight, but it remains difficult for everyone working on that time. The other challenge is where Las Vegas sits on the calendar, kicking off a triple-header to end the season with Qatar and Abu Dhabi. A regular point of paddock small talk was asking people how they were navigating the journey from Las Vegas to the Middle East and whether it would entail any time at home. It was bad enough having Las Vegas and Abu Dhabi on consecutive weekends last year, leading to many getting sick. Throwing Qatar in there as well only makes things more challenging. “(Holding the race) a couple of hours earlier, and not a back-to-back with Qatar, that’s what I would ask everyone as the next step,” said Sainz. “For the rest, (it’s a) great circuit to put on a good race, great for overtaking, challenging track. I wouldn’t change anything, just those two details. And I think everything will be better.” Advertisement F1 can take heart from its second running of the Las Vegas GP. Unlike year one, all went by smoothly on the track, and the added confidence and calmness about proceedings were evident. But importantly, the Las Vegas GP did not lose the elements that made it special. For year three, there’ll be excitement about going back to Sin City throughout the paddock without some of the trepidation some felt going back this past week, as well as a confidence that when feedback is given, improvements will be made. F1 learned this year that it did not need to double down on its own hype to make the Las Vegas GP special. All it had to do was do what it does best: go racing.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,College football Week 14 odds: Texas is favored by almost a touchdown at Texas A&M,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5946835/2024/11/25/college-football-week-14-odds-texas-texas-am-ohio-state-michigan/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 17:48:22 GMT","Rivalry week is upon us. The final week of the college football regular season has tons of big games, including Texas at Texas A&amp;M.","Sports Betting It’s the last week of the college football regular season, and the field of realistic contenders for the College Football Playoff has finally narrowed after a number of upsets on Saturday. This week’s headliner is Texas-Texas A&M, but there are several big games around the sport. The Longhorns are favored in College Station for the biggest game in this rivalry in a long time. Not only is this the first time these in-state rivals have met since 2011, but it’s also a play-in game for the SEC Championship Game, even after Texas A&M somehow lost at Auburn in four overtimes. The winner plays Georgia in Atlanta next week. Texas is favored by six points as of Monday morning. Advertisement In recent years, Ohio State-Michigan has been the biggest game of the regular season in college football, but not this year. The 6-5 Wolverines have disappeared from the national conversation, while Ohio State is the current favorite to win the national title. The Buckeyes have lost the last three meetings in this series but are favored by a whopping three touchdowns. Another massive rivalry that has lost some stakes this year is Alabama-Auburn. After losing at Oklahoma, which was shocking not only for the result but also for how it happened, with Alabama somehow only scoring three points, the Crimson Tide will need a slew of upsets to get into the CFP field. Meanwhile, 5-6 Auburn is fighting for bowl eligibility, even after that win against Texas A&M. Alabama is favored by double-digits at home. While some of the high-profile rivalries might lack a bit of juice this year, a sneaky rivalry game could be Notre Dame at USC. The Fighting Irish are seeking a home game in the CFP, while USC hopes to kick its rivals out of the field. The Trojans just beat one rival, UCLA, to reach bowl eligibility and enter this game as a touchdown underdog. If you’re looking for possible chaos in the final week to shake up the 12-team field, this is a good place to start. Elsewhere in the CFP race, Miami heads to 8-3 Syracuse as a 10.5-point favorite, and Tennessee is favored by 11.5 points at Vanderbilt. In a game that could be relevant in the CFP race if things get weird this week, Clemson is favored by 2.5 points against South Carolina in a top-20 matchup. Of course, it’s not all about the College Football Playoff race. A dozen teams are looking for a sixth win and bowl eligibility in the final week of the regular season. There are already 77 bowl-eligible teams. There is plenty of action to feast on this week. No teams in the AP Top 25 are on bye.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Celtics’ ‘cheat code’ Kristaps Porziņģis probable to make season debut vs. Clippers,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5946972/2024/11/25/boston-celtics-kristaps-porzingis-debut-clippers/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 17:37:51 GMT",Porziņģis missed 25 regular-season games and the majority of the playoffs last season with an injury.,"NBA The Boston Celtics are listing center Kristaps Porziņģis as probable to make his season debut against the Los Angeles Clippers in Boston on Monday, the team announced in its injury report. Porziņģis was ruled out for at least five months when he had surgery to repair a torn retinaculum and dislocated posterior tibialis tendon in his left ankle in June, shortly after the Celtics won their record-setting 18th NBA championship. The rare injury was a tear to the tissue that holds the ankle tendon in place, causing the tendon to become unstable. Advertisement Porziņģis missed most of the postseason due to a calf injury and returned for the beginning of the Finals, only to have this injury knock him out for Games 3 and 4. He played through the injury in Game 5 when the Celtics clinched the title, but required surgery soon after the series ended. The 29-year-old previously stated he could be out until Christmas, and the Celtics had mentioned timelines looking deeper into December, so a return on Nov. 25 is notably ahead of schedule. Porziņģis averaged 20.1 points last season — the third-most on the team behind star duo Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown — along with 7.2 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game through 57 regular-season contests. He also averaged a team-high 1.9 blocks. The Celtics started the season 14-3 and continue to be one of the top teams in the NBA without Porziņģis, but have struggled with the health of their center rotation lately. Porziņģis’ return will take pressure off 38-year-old Al Horford to carry the load at the starting center. With the 7-foot-2 center back in the fold, the Celtics can now bring out the lineup that led the team to a dominant regular season en route to a championship. “We’re a really good team right now. We (get) KP and it just makes us that much better on both ends of the floor,” Tatum said last week. “Our chemistry is there. It’s like having a cheat code.” As great as the Celtics have been without Porziņģis, he gives them a new set of solutions for opposing strategies. He ranked as one of the most efficient post players in years last season; switching against lineups with him just doesn’t have the same effect. And for teams that don’t switch, well, that still might be just what the Celtics want. When they can force a defense into scramble mode, they produce open three after open three. Advertisement Porziņģis should also help to shore up one of the Celtics’ early-season issues: rim protection. They ranked third last season in preventing shots at the rim, but have dipped to 12th in the same category over their first 17 games, all without Porziņģis. Opponents shot just 63.6 percent against the Celtics from within four feet of the basket last season (Boston ranked fifth) but have converted 68.2 percent of such attempts so far this season (Boston ranks 24th). The Celtics should still need time to adjust to Porziņģis since they play a different style with him, but Porziņģis should make the game easier for them at both ends of the court. — Jay King, Celtics beat writer (Photo: Maddie Meyer / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,The Seahawks are finally playing contender-level defense. When will the offense catch up?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5946086/2024/11/25/seahawks-offense-geno-smith-ryan-grubb/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 17:10:42 GMT","The Seahawks' urgency on defense is obvious, and it's the biggest reason for the team's surge. The offense needs to match that energy.","NFL Seattle quarterback Geno Smith used the phrase “championship-level football” to describe the team’s aspirations following the Seahawks’ 16-6 victory over the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday at Lumen Field. It’s a term that might have sounded ludicrous a few weeks ago when the Seahawks were in last place in the NFC West at 4-5 heading into their Week 10 bye, but it’s phrasing the team has never shied away from, and that will continue to be the case now that they control their fate at 6-5 atop the division with six games remaining. Advertisement Seattle’s defense still has room to grow, but it is trending in the right direction. Over the last three weeks, coach Mike Macdonald’s defense has played like a top-10 unit, allowing just 16.3 points per game since Week 9. The run defense has done a complete 180, inside linebacker Ernest Jones IV is commanding the middle with force, cornerback Devon Witherspoon is all over the place and defensive tackle Leonard Williams is leading the charge up front. After a Week 8 disaster against the Bills, Seattle’s defense made strides against the Rams and 49ers, then had its best game of the year on Sunday against Arizona. GO DEEPER Led by 'f---ing beast' Leonard Williams, Seahawks' D smothers Cardinals for NFC West lead Williams, the star of the show on Sunday, cited a meeting among the team’s leaders ahead of the 49ers game as the springboard for this turnaround. Williams said they came together and decided every remaining game is essentially a playoff contest. “That made it crunch time for us,” Williams said. “We just understood the urgency of getting the job done and taking it week by week.” 🚨 NEW #SeahawksMan2Man pod🚨 “Lights out”  Recapping Seattle’s win over AZ, the defense’s turnaround, Leo’s big day, offensive concerns + more!

To remain in first place, the offense has to match that energy. “When you’ve got a defense that plays the way they play, when they’re shutting down offenses the way they are at a high rate week after week, it’s going to give you a shot to win every single game,” Smith said. “We go out there and play clean and we manage the time of possession, do great on third down, finish in the red zone, give those guys a lead to play with, they’re going to be even better.” Advertisement Smith, Macdonald and offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb are believers in the notion of process over results. They’ll gladly take these last two results, of course, but they also know the offense’s contribution in the last couple of games doesn’t live up to that championship-level standard. The Seahawks haven’t scored more than 20 points since Week 7, which was also the last time they had an above-average game by EPA per play (all stats provided by TruMedia unless stated otherwise). Sunday’s win was another underwhelming output. Seattle’s offense had nine full drives and produced just 10 points. Smith had an efficient day, completing 22 of 31 passes for 254 yards with a touchdown toss to receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba in the second quarter. But Smith also threw his third red zone interception in as many games, and the run game was ineffective. Ken Walker III and Zach Charbonnet totaled 63 yards on 22 carries. Seattle’s running backs haven’t combined to reach 100 yards on the ground since Week 3. The Seahawks rank third in early down pass rate in neutral situations, according to RBSDM.com, which removes blowouts and the final two minutes of each half from the data. In other words, when the game is reasonably within reach for both teams, the Seahawks pass at one of the highest rates in the league, behind only the Bengals and Browns. On designed runs, Seattle ranks 31st in yards, 28th in EPA per play and 27th in success rate. The rushing attempts are few and far between, and the results on the runs they call don’t meet the team’s expectations. The run game has been a point of emphasis on both sides of the ball. The defense has turned a corner there. The offense is still trying to find itself. Two drives in the second half Sunday spoke to Seattle’s issues with approach and execution. After safety Coby Bryant put Seattle ahead by two scores with a pick six in the third quarter, the defense came back on the field and forced a punt after four plays. Seattle took over on its own 9-yard line, leading 13-3 with 4:56 left in the third quarter. The entire playbook was open at that point, but teams that say they want the run game and physicality to be at the core of their identity tend to use two-score leads in the second half as opportunities to impose their will. Advertisement The Seahawks came out in an empty formation and ran the same screen pass to Smith-Njigba that set up his touchdown. The Cardinals were prepared and batted the ball at the line of scrimmage. The play call “shocked” color analyst Mark Sanchez, who said, “based just on field position, the momentum in this building” and the way Seattle’s defense was playing, he would have come out running the ball. “Just pound the rock, man,” Sanchez said. “You’ve got to be able to get back to (Ken) Walker and get him the rock.” Seattle’s next play was a 4-yard pass to DK Metcalf, again out of an empty formation. Grubb mixed runs and passes throughout the rest of the drive, including a pair of shotgun carries on consecutive plays by Walker (3 yards) and Charbonnet (12 yards) that put the Seahawks in scoring position. But that drive ended when Smith scrambled out of the pocket and threw an interception on third-and-6 targeting Tyler Lockett in the end zone. Garrett Williams picks off Geno in the end zone! @AZCardinals ball ➡️ 📺: #AZvsSEA on FOX📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/6ftr2CGblq — NFL (@NFL) November 24, 2024  Smith leads the league with 12 interceptions and has thrown five in the last three games. Some of those turnovers have been more bad luck than poor decision-making, but Smith’s pick six against the Rams, his interception in the third quarter of a one-point game in Week 11 against the 49ers and Sunday’s throw to Lockett on Sunday were examples of the quarterback unnecessarily putting the ball in harm’s way. In his opening remarks after the game Sunday, Macdonald said he talked with Smith about making smart decisions and taking care of the ball in the red zone. Smith called the interception a “terrible” mistake and “something I’ve got to clean up.” GO DEEPER Geno Smith is taking the blame for the Seahawks, but is he actually a problem? The Cardinals went 76 yards and trimmed the deficit to 13-6, and Seattle began its next drive at the 19-yard line with 10:03 remaining. Before the first play, Sanchez said, “Now we’re going to see some runs.” Instead, Smith faked a handoff, checked the ball down to Walker and was nearly intercepted again after the ball ricocheted off the running back’s hands. Linebacker Kyzir White was inches away from setting Arizona up in the red zone. Smith moved the chains with completions of 4 and 7 yards to Walker and Smith-Njigba over the next two snaps, then Seattle went to the ground game and earned 7 yards on a pitch to Walker — only for it to be called back because of a holding penalty on receiver Jake Bobo. Advertisement To Seattle’s credit, the offense bled eight minutes on that drive and eventually found something in the run game once it crossed midfield. Smith even checked to a run on third-and-4 at the Arizona 44, and Charbonnet picked up 6 yards. Then the next three plays were runs to set up Jason Myers’ 50-yard field goal that iced the game. The Seahawks weren’t exactly running the Air Raid the entire second half, but one of the reasons Sanchez lamented their play calling on the final two drives is because he recognizes the high degree of difficulty when trying to put teams away through the air. The Seahawks know this as well, which is why they’ve spent most of the season expressing a desire for the run game to be their bread and butter on offense. It’s perhaps too late in the season to expect a complete philosophical shift, but with the defense hitting its stride, the offense just needs a credible run threat to play the complementary football Macdonald and his players keep talking about. Seattle has not run the ball well and has been among the worst in the league at it when it does. That must change if the team wants to be serious about treating the final six games like a playoff run. Finding balance on offense would accomplish many things, but the Seahawks stand to benefit in two key areas. First, they would be getting more out of Walker, the team’s most explosive offensive weapon. And the team would be lessening the burden on Smith and the passing game. Smith leads the league in passing yards, but he’s in the top 10 in interception rate and sack rate. As long as the defense and special teams are holding up their end of the bargain, the offense must do its part to meet the championship-level standard Macdonald has set for the entire team.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Jimmy Butler's production, and humor, are leading the Heat turnaround",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5946695/2024/11/25/jimmy-butler-tyler-herro-heat/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 17:07:49 GMT","Since returning from a four-game injury absence, Butler has been putting up huge numbers — and keeping things light with teammates.","NBA Fun and focus have been the pillars behind the Miami Heat’s turnaround in recent weeks. While adding wins absolutely helps that formula, the return of Jimmy Butler (both on and off the court) has been the most critical variable, as Miami’s leading man brings buckets and jokes for his teammates to enjoy. Staying connected has been important for the Heat, who have experienced an oddly transient and spotty schedule to begin the season. Earlier this month, the Heat had a six-game road trip, which marked their longest before December since 2017. Sunday was just the second time in the young season the Heat played consecutive home games. In fact, it was only the team’s second overall game in the last week. Advertisement Rest, rehabilitation and community outreach were Miami’s priorities during last week’s five-day layoff. Needed downtime to simply recharge and enjoy familiar surroundings while working to correct an awkward start to the season. Miami (7-7) started 3-5, struggled to close out games and faced an early injury bug as coach Erik Spoelstra sought sound lineup combinations to avoid sinking too low in the Eastern Conference standings. “I didn’t mind it,” Spoelstra said about the downtime before Sunday’s matchup against the visiting Dallas Mavericks. “The schedule is always going to be 41 on the road, 41 at home. I don’t really overthink that stuff. I really don’t waste any time on that. It was a little bit strange after that long road trip. And then, when we came back, we all thought your body was thinking you would have a day off. But then, we played immediately, so I wanted to see if we could take on the challenge and win that game without excuses. “After that, we all needed two days just to get from each other and recalibrate and get some practice time. It doesn’t guarantee you anything, but the work was productive. And now, we’re looking forward to just doing what we’re paid to do — compete in games.” Despite a four-game absence with ankle woes, Butler remains one of the NBA’s fiercest competitors and has simply played incredible basketball since returning to the Heat rotation. He’s averaging 31.5 points with a true shooting percentage of 75.4. The six-time All-Star has been filling every key gap. Rebounds? His 9.5 per game since returning trails only Bam Adebayo (12) for the team lead. Setting up teammates? Butler is dishing 5.5 dimes per game since returning. If you’re big into controlling pace and possessions, he’s been plenty fine at that too. The 35-year-old forward’s 29 free-throw attempts since coming back are his third-most in any two-game span over the last three seasons. Advertisement Last week, after registering more free throws than the Philadelphia 76ers, Butler said he enjoys attacking the basket because he believes it grants a timely break to everybody, including himself. On Sunday, though, there was a moment where Butler was on the receiving end of timely help as the Heat forced overtime in their eventual win over the Mavericks. “I hate to say, but Duncan Robinson made an incredible pass,” Butler quipped afterward. Although Butler may hate to admit his teammate deserves a compliment, that isn’t to say he and the Heat aren’t having fun as they enjoy returning to .500 and continue supporting one another through the season’s ebbs and flows … with timely assists or tongue-in-cheek humor. With just over a minute remaining in Sunday’s matchup, Butler drove past Naji Marshall to take on Dereck Lively II at the rim before flipping in a left-handed shot attempt over his head as Miami took a one-point lead. Since returning from his ankle injury, Butler is shooting 77 percent on 15.5 drive attempts per game. Tyler Herro, who leads Miami with 23.8 points per game this season, was jokingly tabbed by Butler as the “1B” to the latter’s “1A” in Miami’s scoring pecking order. He didn’t seem too impressed by his All-Star teammate’s clutch-time heroics, but good teammates help keep each other humble and focused on the moment, right? “That s— was lucky as hell,” Herro joked Sunday. Whether it’s easiest to credit timely luck, infectious fun or collective focus, the Heat have been enjoying their best basketball of the young season by trusting one another. After struggling to maintain big leads or to close out close games, Miami is sixth in second-half net rating (plus-7.2) since Nov. 10, illustrating signs of a team stringing together fuller performances and simply trusting the next player called to duty. Injuries remain variables, but Spoelstra will never lean on those excuses. A week ago, reserve guard and defensive specialist Dru Smith starred in his most extensive appearance of the season (10 points, six rebounds, three steals in 25 minutes). Now? He’s nursing a right knee bruise. Such absences are opportunities for other Heat role players to step up. On Sunday, Alec Burks played a season-high 30 minutes and tied his season-high in points (15, 4-of-8 shooting on 3s). This season, Miami is 4-1 when the 33-year-old guard plays at least 15 minutes. Advertisement “That unit just gave us a spark,” Spoelstra said of his bench unit. “Alec made some timely baskets. That’s what this guy does. … He also just gave us some real steady play.” Miami will always remain strong with trusting role players to thrive, but Butler’s presence and intensity are often what makes the ultimate difference for this iteration of Heat basketball. While Butler’s play can sometimes leave teammates and opponents in awe, Spoelstra credits his star forward’s sharp mind for always being prepared to contribute and lead Miami. “He has the highest percentile of processing speed when the ball is in his hands,” Spoelstra said of Butler. “That was there our first year [2019-20]. The uniqueness of how he does it is, he can bring this rugged, physicality, intensity — a toe-the-line intensity — and slow everything down in the moments of truth. That’s part of his genius.” ( Top photo: Rich Storry / Getty Images ) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Montgomery stepped in front of reporters wearing a Blues sweatshirt. “It was in the closet,” the former Blues assistant joked. “Once a Blue, always a Blue.” Advertisement Montgomery, who was announced as the Blues coach just five days after being fired by the Boston Bruins, started his interview by saying that the decision to return to St. Louis on a five-year contract was about people. “I’ve always believed that you align yourself with good people, and for me, with (Blues chairman) Tom Stillman and the ownership group, it starts right there,” Montgomery said. “I appreciate their confidence and their vision. “(General manager) Doug Armstrong, someone who was really important to my second chance, I think he’s elite at what he does — his vision, his plan for how the Blues are going to become a consistently elite team again. “The people under him from the hockey operation side of things.

The Hall of Famers in and around everywhere. “And the last thing — the people in this room. I’ve worked with over half of this lineup already, and I know how committed they are to playing the right way and the type of people they are. So this was a no-brainer to be able to come back home and be a Blue again.”  Montgomery and the players met at the team hotel Sunday night, and he said the excitement was tangible. “There was naturally a lot of smiles between us because of what we’ve been through before,” he said. “We’ve been through a lot of wars together already.” And now, together again, they’re about to engage in their biggest battle yet. Here are some of the highlights from Montgomery’s first media session with reporters Monday morning at MSG. (Note: questions and answers have been lightly edited for clarity). What has the last week been like? Crazy! Crazy! There’s no other word for it. A lot of emotions. I’m a firm believer that when one door closes, another one opens if you do the right thing. It’s about your relationships in life. Ultimately, when we’re all done and retired and we’re not fortunate enough and privileged enough to be in NHL buildings again, it’s the relationships that you have in your life. Advertisement What was it like getting the Blues’ call? It was very exciting, but I was in the mindset, when Army called, I thought this was a social call of like, “Hey, I’ve been there, keep your head up, take a breath, enjoy the family.” I got a lot of those text messages and calls. Once it turned to business, the engine and my blood started pumping. GO DEEPER Behind the Blues' abrupt coaching change: 'A difference-maker became available, and we reacted' What’s one thing Army said to lure you back? The best line that put his hooks into me was, “When something delicious falls on my plate, I eat.” I don’t know. I guess I was a T-bone that day. Did you consider waiting until the offseason to return? When you get a phone call and you hear Doug Armstrong’s vision and plan and how you’re a big part of it, it makes you feel like this is just the right place to go. Army, he’s very persuasive. What’s the investment like switching teams in a week? Those are the emotional swings I talk about that make it crazy. I received text messages from current Blues players when I was let go in Boston, and I’ve received text messages from Bruins players when I got the job here. That’s why I talk about why it’s a special game with the relationships you build with people. Is there an advantage to jumping back in so quickly? I think it helps because you don’t lose sight of the schedule, the energy, the importance of how you need to touch different players and different lines and talk to your leaders and captains. So all those things, it’s easily transferrable and you don’t get a chance to take a breath and get away from it. So I do think it’s an advantage. GO DEEPER Rutherford: Armstrong is all-in to fix the Blues and add to his legacy, feelings be damned What’s your first task as the new coach? I think the No. 1 thing is to reconnect with the guys that I worked with previously when I was fortunate enough to be a Blue, create new relationships with the others I haven’t worked with, but most importantly it’s about attitudes and intensity. The energy that we’re going to bring to the rink and the attitude that it’s a we thing here. Advertisement Does knowing a lot of the players give you a head start? I think it gives me a tremendous head start because there’s been hard talks, there’s been a lot of good memories. We did a lot of good things, and watching the growth of all these individuals. (Brayden) Schenn was an assistant, now he’s a captain. (Colton) Parayko and (Justin) Faulk — Faulk was not an assistant when I was here. Now Robby Thomas is wearing a letter. The relationships I have with (Jordan) Kyrou and (Pavel) Buchnevich, skilled guys who think the game at a high level, that compete. Those are things I’m looking forward to continuing. I know we’ve got a tremendous goaltender (Jordan Binnington) and a great young goalie (Joel Hofer) that I had the fortune of doing shootouts with when I was doing skill work at the end of practice. How do you balance coaching for today versus coaching for tomorrow? As a coach, you coach for today, but I’m also coaching for tomorrow, so there’s going to be a balance of: What do we need to do to be competitive right now without losing sight of the team? The team is always going to be first. The Blue Note is always going to be first. Our team identity and not letting a standard that we set slip from our structure standpoint. Also, there’s some players that need to play. Learning how to win in this league is part of that development. Whether I’m on the end of a one-year deal or have a five-year deal, it’s not going to change the way I do things with the process and the results. I expect that to drive success in this league. But when you have a five-year deal you can afford to be a little more patient at times. Could this be a playoff team this season? I’m a process-oriented coach, so in that process, there’s certain things that we’re going to do daily, and I like to be stuck in today. Worrying about what we’re going to be, I don’t know the ceiling yet so I can’t answer that definitively. I believe in this group. It’s not easy to make the playoffs in this league — half the teams miss it — but I do think in time this is a playoff-caliber team. That’s why I say I don’t know the ceiling. You ask the question, is this a playoff-caliber team? I don’t know it in its entirety. You can have the same 23 guys return, and it’s going to be a different year just because of expectations. So it’s lucky I’m coming in here with no expectations. But there is an expectation that we’re going to be a blue-collar team, that we’re going to work, and we’re going to have energy.

Throughout the season, we will bring you updates on the U.S. players plying their trade in various leagues around Europe. With a World Cup on home soil on the horizon and new national team boss Mauricio Pochettino monitoring from afar, we’re keeping tabs on how they perform every weekend. His defending champions are top of the league, remain competitive in Europe and have an attack as formidable as their defence is mean — Peter Bosz cannot have much to grumble about. But the PSV manager does have one thorny issue to resolve and, even if he is probably tired of talking about it already, it is not going away anytime soon. Advertisement Bosz is wedded to playing a lone centre-forward, so how do you make two go into one? Specifically, how do you give enough game time to a striker considered a club legend while also accommodating the Eredivisie’s best young forward in the team? Captain Luuk de Jong’s muscle strain at the weekend meant Pepi made successive starts this season for the first time. The 21-year-old duly followed his goal and assist from the 3-0 win over NAC Breda before the international break with a hat-trick in their 5-0 thrashing of Groningen. It puts Pepi on nine goals to date this term — he is joint-top scorer in the division alongside FC Twente’s Sem Steijn. But, while the latter has clocked nine goals from 11 starts for his fifth-placed team, Pepi has that many from just four starts. Other clubs across Europe are by now well aware of his prowess, and have taken note of his relative lack of opportunities. De Jong has five more starts than Pepi, and three fewer goals which would suggest that, at 34, his prolific powers are beginning to ebb. So how could Bosz perform a better balancing act between a club icon and what could be one in the making (if he stays in Eindhoven for long enough)? Could PSV go two up front, giving both men a chance to shine together? It appears not. Asked in his post-match press conference if it is an option, Bosz appeared to shut it down. “For years we have had a system that everyone thrives on and that is with one striker,” he said. When pressed further on whether Pepi’s remarkable form is making his selection task harder he was giving nothing away. ”No, I’m happy to have two good strikers,“ insisted Bosz. Almost as taciturn after the game was Pepi himself, who was grilled by ESPN on how it feels to be in and out of the team when playing so well — not least with three goals in his last four appearances for the USMNT under new manager Pochettino. “No matter when my name is called, I am going to be ready and I have been showing that,” he said. “I’m going to keep preparing and working hard. (Whether Pepi is picked) is not my decision. That’s the coach’s decision and it’s completely out of my control so I just focus on what I can control. Advertisement “I’ve said it before, mentally it can be difficult, but sometimes you get rewarded and get a couple of starts and all of a sudden everything changes a little bit.” Whether anything changes after his latest heroics remains to be seen. The team sheets for their next two games, Wednesday’s Champions League tie with Shakhtar Donetsk and Sunday’s top-vs-second clash with FC Utrecht, will be intriguing. But if there is a succession plan in the pipeline, Bosz needs to ensure Pepi enjoys more opportunities to thrive as he has in the last two league games. Morning 😘#PSVGRO pic.twitter.com/RpctZqvNAN — PSV (@PSV) November 24, 2024  “Right now, everything he touches turns to gold. I think it’s very nice for him.” PSV and Netherlands midfielder Guus Til, who also scored against Groningen, was another mightily impressed by the USMNT star’s hat-trick. One young American who is getting the game time his performances deserve in the Eredivisie is Aaronson. And no wonder, with the 21-year-old involved in yet another goal for Utrecht as the team hot on PSV’s heels won again on Sunday. Aaronson’s assist for Yoann Cathline in the 2-1 victory at NEC Nijmegen made it three goal contributions in three games. The loanee now boasts four goals and two assists in 10 starts so far this season. The New Jersey native has knuckled down in another loan spell away from parent club Eintracht Frankfurt (who intend on making him a first-team regular next term), and is thriving in Holland after a harder spell in a doomed relegation scrap with Vitesse Arnhem last term. Over 18 months since his previous consistent involvement at club level, Tyler Adams has logged consecutive starts for AFC Bournemouth — you’d be forgiven if you didn’t remember he plays there given how infrequently he has been fit to feature — on either side of the November window. After a 67-minute shift against Brentford on November 9, the midfielder remained in Andoni Iraola’s lineup for Saturday’s visit from fellow south coasters Brighton, exiting after 65 minutes with a tidy performance to show for his efforts.  Iraola likely won’t conflate correlation with causation as the Cherries suffered defeat in both of Adams’ recent starts. Each was decided by a single goal, after all. Adams showed some signs of rust on Brighton’s first goal on Saturday, as Danny Welbeck and former Leeds team-mate Georginio Rutter deftly passed around him in the build-up. On both goals, Adams made recovery runs to get back into defensive position, showing he should still have the pace to be impactful at this high of a level. Advertisement Now all that’s left is getting back that previously uncanny reading of sequences and more decisive defending when able. But sometimes, the most mundane of updates can provide the greatest comfort. Sometimes, just seeing a player make it through a pair of starts is its own kind of solace. Jeff Rueter Name: Tanner Tessmann
Club: Lyon
Position: Midfielder
Games: 10 Pochettino was very complimentary about Tessmann after his performance in the second CONCACAF Nations League quarter-final win over Jamaica last week. The USMNT boss said he hoped to see him get more starts for Lyon too, but Tessmann was back on the bench for the financially troubled French club and had to be content with a nine-minute cameo in the 1-1 draw with Reims. Name: Taylor Booth
Club: FC Utrecht
Position: Midfielder
Games: 8 Another young American trying to make a bright impression at Utrecht is Booth, who has not had as many starts as Aaronson but features regularly for Ron Jans’ side from the bench. Booth got onto the field again on Sunday and did well, creating a chance and looking bright on the ball. Name: Griffin Yow
Club: Westerlo
Position: Right wing
Games: 10
Goals: 1 The 22-year-old scored in his Belgian side’s 4-0 win against Kortrijk, and looks fully recovered from the knee complaint that ruled him out for four games earlier in the season. Westerlo are seventh in the league. Name: Gio Reyna
Club: Borussia Dortmund
Position: Attacking midfielder
Games: 2 The USMNT playmaker made his long-awaited return from injury for the Bundesliga side in their 4-0 win over Freiburg on Saturday at Signal Iduna Park. His 12 minutes off the bench were his first action for his club since August and manager Nuri Sahin was pleased. “Gio trained brilliantly this week,” he said in the post-game press conference. “It’s important to get training minutes and, if possible, as many minutes as possible into the legs.” The challenge for Reyna, once fully fit, is to convince Sahin he should be a regular starter — an objective that proved so difficult under previous manager Edin Terzic. (All times ET) The Champions League is back and Christian Pulisic and Yunus Musah will hope to have more impact than they did in their 0-0 draw with Juventus in Serie A on Saturday. The Rossoneri face Slovan Bratislava on Tuesday (12:45pm, Paramount +, USDN, Telemundo) and, fingers crossed, the USMNT pair will be in the mix to help the team get back to winning ways. Advertisement On the same day you can watch Haji Wright’s Coventry City take on Luca Koleosho’s Burnley (2:45pm, Paramount +) in the English Championship. On Wednesday, Brenden Aaronson and Leeds United will aim to maintain their promotion push from the same division when they take on Luton Town (2:45pm, Paramount+) . There is also the chance to see if Reyna can add to his minutes for Dortmund later that day when they face Dinamo Zagreb (3pm, CBSSN, Paramount+) in the Champions League. At the same time there’s an exciting tie at Villa Park as the U.S.-owned Premier League outfit Aston Villa host Weston McKennie and Tim Weah with Juventus in town (3pm, Paramount+).

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Cowboys Today: The dream of getting the No. 1 overall pick died in Landover,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5946663/2024/11/25/cowboys-today-nfl-draft-pick-win-commanders/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 16:31:13 GMT",The possibility of Travis Hunter in Dallas is likely gone as the Cowboys rediscover the art of creating turnovers Sunday vs. the Commanders.,"NFL LANDOVER, Md. — Sunday’s game puts you in a strange spot as a fan. At 3-7, you assume your team’s season is over, so a part of you wants as many losses as possible, leading to the highest possible draft pick. But then your fandom kicks in. Your team has a chance to win a game they entered as double-digit underdogs. Advertisement The Dallas Cowboys outlasted the Commanders in a wild finish Sunday at Washington. It ended Dallas’ five-game losing streak, its longest in the last nine years. But it also provided a significant blow to those who were hoping for a chance at the No. 1 overall pick. And by the looks of the rest of the schedule, it’s unlikely that the Cowboys will end up in the top 5 and maybe not the top 10. Cowboys, 4-7, remaining schedule:vs. Giants (2-9)vs. Bengals (4-7)@ Panthers (3-8)vs. Bucs (5-6)@ Eagles (9-2, resting starters…?)vs. Commanders (7-5, lost to Cowboys today) Could be a tough finish for #TeamTank — Saad Yousuf (@SaadYousuf126) November 25, 2024  According to Tankathon.com, if the season ended today, Dallas would have the 11th overall pick. Heading into Sunday’s game, the Cowboys had worked their way up to ninth, a game and a half back of No. 1 overall. They’re now two games back of the Jacksonville Jaguars, New York Giants and Las Vegas Raiders, who all seem committed to legitimately competing for No. 1 overall. Of the 10 teams currently ahead of the Cowboys, three are still remaining on Dallas’ schedule: Thursday vs. the Giants (currently picking second), Week 14 vs. the Cincinnati Bengals (10th) and Week 15 at the Carolina Panthers (fifth). If your goal was to land Colorado superstar CB/WR Travis Hunter, the dream died in Landover, Maryland. The mock draft studying probably needs to shift to more of the 10-to-20 range. — Machota The first half Sunday was, well, not fun to watch. It prompted Jon to post this on X: This is the worst half of football I've ever watched — Jon Machota (@jonmachota) November 24, 2024  That’s not to say the second half was great football, but it was entertaining. Here’s what we wrote after the game: Machota: The final five minutes were wild, chaotic and unpredictable Yousuf: One devastating spin move and KaVontae Turpin was gone  The Cowboys came into Sunday’s game as 10.5-point road underdogs, so it’s no surprise that the beat writers for both teams picked the Commanders in our Sunday edition of Cowboys Today. In my explanation for picking a 27-13 Washington win, I mentioned that the game being played away from AT&T Stadium at least gave Dallas a chance but without winning the turnover battle, it seemed “impossible” for the Cowboys to leave with a victory. Advertisement Well, the Cowboys won the game and the turnover battle. The Commanders came into the game with just five turnovers this season. The Cowboys intercepted rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels a couple of times and recovered a John Bates fumble. On the other side, Cooper Rush kept a clean sheet, the pass protection held up despite a patchwork offensive line and the only Cowboys turnover was Rico Dowdle’s first lost fumble of his career. 🥊 @donlwilson6🤲 @erickendricks6 📺: #DALvsWAS on FOX📲: Stream on NFL+ https://t.co/LvklCbYJ1e pic.twitter.com/nkFqWu2Ems — Dallas Cowboys (@dallascowboys) November 24, 2024  Of course, there were wacky things that happened, too, such as a blocked kick, missed kicks and a block punt. The Cowboys’ defense showed the ability that we had grown accustomed to seeing the past three seasons in Dallas under — ironically — Dan Quinn’s direction. It’s something that’s been sorely missed this season: Dallas only forced nine turnovers coming into Week 12, which placed the Cowboys in the bottom third of the league. They also were minus-11 in turnover margin, which was tied for second-worst in the league. Israel Mukuamu’s interception came on the final desperation heave for Washington, so we’ll put that aside, but Chauncey Golston’s second-quarter interception came on first down for Washington on the Dallas 28-yard line. Given the strange special teams showing Sunday, nothing was guaranteed but that likely took points off the board for the Commanders. Midway through the fourth quarter, the Cowboys kicked a field goal to go ahead 13-9. On the first play of the ensuing drive, Daniels completed a pass to Bates that got the Commanders near midfield. Donovan Wilson forced the fumble and Eric Kendricks recovered. Five plays later, the Cowboys scored a touchdown and extended their lead to 20-9. Advertisement Not only did the Cowboys notch turnovers in the game, they did so in big moments and made a direct impact on the scoreboard. That’s something Quinn’s defenses in Dallas were known for during his three seasons as defensive coordinator. That’s been missing this season. — Yousuf With five minutes left in the fourth quarter and the Cowboys leading 20-9, Rico Dowdle had 79 rushing yards. It seemed like there was a good chance that he was going to get the opportunity to carry the ball in the home stretch to burn clock and possibly cross 100 yards. With two kickoff returns for touchdowns, the offense only got the ball once the rest of the way. Dowdle got one more carry which went for seven yards. He finished the day with 86 yards on the ground. Although the Cowboys’ streak of games without a 100-yard rusher has hit 26 games (second-longest in the league), Dowdle’s performances this season, when he gets the proper opportunity, have been encouraging. He went for 87 yards in the Cowboys’ win in Pittsburgh. He had 75 yards in the loss in Atlanta, and 86 on Sunday. Dowdle’s longest run against the Commanders was nine yards, so his 4.5 yards per carry average isn’t skewed by a huge outlier. His performance was efficient. The fact he was able to do it with the Cowboys missing their starting left guard and right guard, and playing musical chairs at left tackle, makes it even more impressive. — Yousuf (Top photo of Eric Kendricks: Patrick Smith / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Ex-Jets general manager Mike Tannenbaum to lead search for team's next GM, head coach",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5946752/2024/11/25/mike-tannenbaum-jets-gm-search/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 16:16:28 GMT","The Jets have retained Tannenbaum's company, The 33rd Team, with former Vikings GM Rick Spielman set to work on the search as well.","NFL The last time New York Jets owner Woody Johnson ran a search for a new general manager and head coach, he hired two prominent former NFL GMs to consult and lead the way. Ten years later, Johnson is taking a similar tack. After firing GM Joe Douglas last week, Johnson is retaining The 33rd Team, a media and consulting firm run by former Jets general manager Mike Tannenbaum, for support in the Jets’ upcoming GM and head coach searches. Along with Tannenbaum, former Minnesota Vikings general manager Rick Spielman will help spearhead the search. Advertisement Tannenbaum worked for the Jets in various roles from 1997 to 2012, most prominently as the team’s general manager from 2006-12. His knowledge of the organization, as well as how Johnson thinks and what he’s looking for, likely factored into the decision to incorporate him into the process — though it is interesting that Johnson would lean on Tannenbaum to fill the same role that he also fired him from after the 2012 season. Spielman helped the Washington Commanders in their GM and head coach searches last year, which ended with Washington hiring Adam Peters as general manager and Dan Quinn as head coach — that pairing has delivered strong early returns. In 2015, Johnson hired former NFL general managers Charley Casserly and Ron Wolf to lead the charge, a search that ended with them hiring Mike Maccagnan as general manager. Maccagnan, notably, was Casserly’s No. 2 when Casserly was the general manager of the Houston Texans. Here’s what Casserly said about Johnson’s approach, via the “New York Post,” in 2015: “We didn’t make any decisions. These were clearly Woody’s decisions. I don’t want that taken the wrong way. Our job was to give advice when asked. That’s what you do in that position. Woody was outstanding. Woody gave us latitude to ask anything in interviews. He listened to everything we had to say. He encouraged us to give him exactly what we thought. He made the decisions and I think he chose two outstanding candidates. It’s notable that Rex Ryan has been floating his own candidacy for the Jets’ vacant head coaching position too, especially considering Tannenbaum hired him to coach the Jets in 2009. Tannebaum also hired Eric Mangini prior to Ryan’s tenure. Both former coaches now work as media analysts, Ryan for ESPN and Mangini for Fox Sports. Ryan has not coached in the NFL since 2016; Mangini hasn’t had a coaching role since 2015. Advertisement The Jets are believed to be planning to hire a general manager first — since the Douglas firing, longtime NFL executive Phil Savage has served as the interim GM. Robert Saleh was fired as head coach after a Week 5 loss to the Minnesota Vikings and replaced by defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich. Neither Savage nor Ulbrich are considered leading candidates for the full-time positions, though both could potentially garner interviews with the new search committee.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,College football national title odds: Ohio State has top spot among a clear top four teams,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5946761/2024/11/25/college-football-national-title-odds-ohio-state-georgia-oregon-texas/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 16:12:19 GMT",Week 13's chaos thinned the field and a clear top four teams have emerged in the odds. Ohio State is the favorite to win the national title.,"Sports Betting The more things change, the more the national title picture stays the same in 2024. After a dream-dashing Week 13 across the sport, the four schools jockeying atop the odds table all season have decisively separated themselves from everyone else. Ohio State’s dismantling of Indiana was the highest-profile contest of the week and boosted the Buckeyes from +320 to +275 on BetMGM, with Georgia slotting in next at +350 and then No. 1 Oregon at +400. Texas has bounced around the top four in futures odds all season and currently sits at +450. From there, there’s quite a gap. Advertisement 
Popular SEC long-odds picks Ole Miss and Alabama fell away thanks to upset losses, and Indiana’s shellacking in Columbus dispelled any notions of a Hollywood ending for the Hoosiers. The Crimson Tide remain on the board at +4000 (+750 last week) but with three losses, their only card to play with the committee is “remember when we pummeled Georgia in Week 5?” Indiana fell from +2500 to +5000, but expect those odds to lengthen. If not for so many high-profile losses around them, the Hoosiers were at risk of getting edged out of the College Football Playoff altogether. As it stands, a Big Ten team with one loss to Ohio State should be safe, even if the rest of their schedule is soft. Ole Miss went from +1100 to off the board, and Notre Dame took its slot ahead of Penn State, moving to +1400 after downing Army. The Fighting Irish have been dominant since their one loss and now have the shortest odds of anyone outside that clear top four. The Nittany Lions (+1800) have a favorable postseason path, as they likely won’t play in the conference championship game and are in line to host their first-round matchup after (barely) escaping Minnesota. Tennessee dodged the SEC culling with a win against UTEP, getting back to familiar territory at +2000. Miami remains on the fringe at +2500. There isn’t much faith SMU will get past the Canes in the ACC title game, with the Mustangs at +4000. Kansas has single-handedly rearranged the Big 12 picture in the last three weeks, grim-reapering its way through Iowa State, BYU and Colorado. The Buffaloes drew enough interest last week to reach +5000 to win the national title but plummeted to +20000 after the Jayhawks all but bounced them from the conference championship game. BYU’s two-week tumble sees the Cougars at +25000, tied with conference title hopeful Iowa State. Arizona State is now the betting favorite out of the conference with +8000 odds, but it’s still unclear where the Big 12 champ will be ranked when the dust settles. Currently, it looks like Boise State would receive the fourth bye with two more wins, including a Mountain West championship, but even that isn’t buying the Broncos any national title faith. Advertisement Not only were the Broncos leapfrogged by the Sun Devils, but their title odds also dipped from +10000 to +12500. They’re on track to play UNLV in the conference title game, and if someone were looking for an all-time glory play, the Rebels are the very last team on the board at +100000. A $10 bet on UNLV would net $10,000. There are 21 teams listed on the board at BetMGM after the number of plausible contenders shrunk as a result of Saturday’s chaotic results. But for now, the safe money is where it always has been: on the SEC and Big Ten powerhouses that have held the top spots nearly all season long.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"MLB trade scenarios: Bowden on Garrett Crochet, Cody Bellinger, Vladimir Guerrero Jr., more",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5946068/2024/11/25/mlb-trade-scenarios-rumors-crochet-arenado/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 16:06:21 GMT",Bowden tackles more than two dozen questions submitted by subscribers and shares the latest he's hearing about the trade market.,"MLB MLB trade season heated up over the weekend as the Royals traded right-hander Brady Singer to the Reds for second baseman Jonathan India and outfielder Joey Wiemer. I viewed it as a win-win trade for both teams. The Reds needed to add veteran bulk innings to their rotation. Enter Singer, who has pitched at least 150 innings in each of the past three seasons, including 179 2/3 last season while going 9-13 with a 3.71 ERA. He’s also a ground-ball pitcher, which works well in the small confines of Great American Ball Park. He’ll join a rotation of Hunter Greene, Nick Martinez, Nick Lodolo, Andrew Abbott, Rhett Lowder and Graham Ashcraft, giving Cincinnati the pitching depth it takes to win. The Reds could afford to trade India because Matt McLain, one of their best players, is expected to play second base full-time in 2025 after coming back from shoulder surgery. Advertisement From the Royals’ perspective, they needed a leadoff hitter, someone who could provide traffic for Bobby Witt Jr., Vinnie Pasquantino and Salvador Perez in the middle of the order. India has a career on-base percentage of .352. The Royals aren’t sure if he’ll play second base or somewhere else because he was overseas when the trade was made and they couldn’t immediately discuss it with him. However, if he ends up playing second base full-time, their incumbent, Michael Massey, has the ability to play all over the diamond and could even move to the outfield as well. Wiemer fits as a platoon-type player in center field and gives them much-needed outfield depth. Now that the trading season is here, I thought it was a good time to tackle more than two dozen of your trade questions and share some of what I’m hearing. Thanks as always to all the subscribers who asked questions. Note: Submitted questions have been edited for clarity and length. What would a strong Mets package for Garrett Crochet look like? Would Brett Baty, Luisangel Acuña, Blade Tidwell and Marco Vargas get it done? — Timothy W. I think the deal would have to look more like Acuña, Jett Williams and Drew Gilbert perhaps? I keep hearing that White Sox general manager Chris Getz is focused on position players, not pitching in return for Crochet. He could change his mind, but if he sticks with that approach, I think that trio would be close to getting a deal done. Three-team trade proposal: White Sox get: Justin Crawford, Mick Abel, Eduardo Tait, Tai Peete, Jonny Farmelo Phillies get: Garrett Crochet Mariners get: Alec Bohm — Andrew J. I like the concept of the deal, although I get the impression that the Phillies are more focused on acquiring an outfielder and a reliever than they are a starter. The White Sox are more focused on acquiring future middle-of-the-order bats. So this proposal doesn’t really fit what those teams are most actively looking to do. Bohm fits great with the Mariners though. Could the Red Sox land Crochet for a package led by Wilyer Abreu, perhaps with Jhostynxon “The Password” Garcia, Chase Meidroth, and/or Mikey Romero? If not, is there any package that doesn’t include (Boston’s) “big four” (prospects) that the White Sox would likely accept?  — David G. Based on what the White Sox are saying, I think a package of Casas, Abreu and Connor Wong probably gets close to landing Crochet. The Red Sox could then replace Abreu with prospect Roman Anthony in right field, replace Wong with Kyle Teel at catcher, move Devers to first base and sign either Alex Bregman or Willy Adames in free agency. Advertisement Can the Orioles pry Crochet away from the White Sox without giving up (one of their two top prospects), Coby Mayo or Samuel Basallo? Maybe a build package around outfielders Heston Kjerstad and Dylan Beavers and a young pitcher? — David B. There’s no way the Orioles are getting Crochet without including Mayo or Basallo as part of a package. Teams are lining up for Crochet and the White Sox aren’t trading him unless they land at least two everyday position players they can put in the middle of their lineup going forward. GO DEEPER Fifteen notable MLB players who could be traded this offseason The Red Sox trade Masataka Yoshida to the Diamondbacks for Jordan Montgomery. Who says no? — Jeff S. I like the Red Sox side of this trade proposal. I think pitching coach Andrew Bailey and their advanced pitching room could get Montgomery back to his form from 2021-23, a three-year stretch when he was consistently good. Yoshida is a below-average defender whose best role is as a designated hitter. After two MLB seasons, has a career slash line of .285/.343/.433, which is a good indication of his likely performance in the future. However, he has 10-15 home run power and if I’m Arizona, I’d prefer to re-sign Joc Pederson. Yoshida makes $18.6 million a year so he would be a savings of only about $4 million in 2025 compared to Montgomery, and I’d rather try to rebuild Montgomery’s career than take on Yoshida, who is signed at that amount through 2027. How likely is it the Braves go after Jordan Montgomery or maybe Zack Littell (from the Rays) if they can’t re-sign Max Fried, or do they roll with what they’ve got and hope one of Bryce Elder, Ian Anderson, AJ Smith-Shawver or Hurston Waldrep can hold down a spot in the rotation? — Jeremy P. The Braves are trying to re-sign both Fried and Charlie Morton and have also kicked the tires on several other free-agent starting pitchers who would rank ahead of Montgomery. They’re also high on their young starters, both in the majors and in the pipeline, and since they really don’t have a bad contract to offer in exchange for Montgomery, I don’t see a fit unless the Diamondbacks are willing to eat most of his contract, which I don’t think they’ll do (at least at this time). Could the Diamondbacks fill their hole at first base by trading Jordan Montgomery to the Cubs for Arizona native Cody Bellinger in a swap of bad contracts? — Zach R. I love this trade idea for the Diamondbacks. If the Cubs would make that deal, Arizona would call a press conference as quickly as possible! 🙂 The Diamondbacks are due to pay Montgomery $22.5 million in 2025 after he posted a 6.23 ERA over 21 starts and four relief appearances last season. He was so bad that he finished the year in the bullpen. Bellinger had a down year too, but he still managed to reach base at a 33 percent clip, hit 18 home runs and get 78 RBIs. He was worth 2.2 WAR; Montgomery was at -1.4 WAR. The Cubs are not trying to move Bellinger as they believe he will be better next season. However, that’s not going to stop them from listening to interested teams. Bellinger will make $27.5 million in 2025 and has a $25 million player option in 2026 with a $5 million buyout. He has a much better chance of bouncing back than Montgomery, so I can’t see the Cubs having interest in that swap of bad contracts. Advertisement With Matt Shaw looming in the minors, does it make sense for Chicago to package Nico Hoerner and Bellinger to the Braves? That would plug the two holes in the Braves’ roster while adding needed speed/athleticism to their lineup. By taking Bellinger’s contract, that would reduce the prospect package they’d need to send to Chicago. — Clayton P. The Braves are happy with Ozzie Albies at second base and Austin Riley at third base and Hoerner is not good enough defensively to play shortstop for Atlanta, so he isn’t a fit there. Bellinger would be an upgrade over Jarred Kelenic in left field, but the Braves have made it clear that any payroll room they have will be allocated to the starting rotation, not left field. In terms of Shaw, I really like his short, compact swing and he slashed .284/.379/.488 last season with 21 home runs and 31 stolen bases between Double A and Triple A, mostly playing third base. However, the Cubs’ decision to trade for Isaac Paredes at the deadline was an indication they either felt Shaw wasn’t ready or they planned to play him around the diamond wherever needed. (He can play second base, shortstop and third base.) Paredes is under team control through 2027. Two trade proposals (for your) review: The Angels trade Tyler Anderson and (a pitching prospect), Samuel Aldegheri or George Klassen, to the Cubs for Bellinger. Also, the Orioles re-sign Anthony Santander and then trade Heston Kjerstad and Colby Mayo to the White Sox for Crochet and reliever Steven Wilson. Thoughts? Love all your articles! — Greg D. I don’t think the Angels match up with the Cubs for a Bellinger trade. But I love your idea of the Orioles re-signing Santander and then offering Kjerstad and Mayo to the White Sox for Crochet and Wilson. Boom! Let’s see if the Orioles get it done! Is a Vladimir Guerrero Jr. trade happening? What could the Jays expect as a return? — Yossi R. The Blue Jays have been steadfast in telling me that they are not trading Guerrero this offseason, even if they can’t sign him long term. Opposing GMs have heard the same. If the Jays are not in contention at next year’s trade deadline and still haven’t extended him, then it’s conceivable they move him at that point. But for now, they believe they can contend in 2025 and would rather build around Guerrero than trade him. Trade proposal: Yankees trade George Lombard Jr., Will Warren and Oswald Peraza to the Blue Jays for Vlad Jr.? — Michael G. If they could, the Yankees would make that trade in a heartbeat. But if the Yankees actually proposed that deal to the Blue Jays, all they would hear is a dial tone. That type of offer doesn’t even get a response. Guerrero was worth 6.2 WAR last season, according to Baseball Reference. He slashed .323/.396/.544 with 30 home runs and 103 RBIs. If the Blue Jays decide to deal him between now and the trade deadline, I doubt it would be to the Yankees or a team in the AL East. However, if they did consider moving him to New York, then Jasson Domínguez would be the first of many names the Yankees would have to dangle to even start the conversation. Do you think the Cardinals realistically can/will move Nolan Arenado? — Chris S. Arenado is owed $32 million in 2025, $27 million in 2026 and $15 million in 2027. (The Rockies are on the hook for $5 million in both ’26 and ’27.) Age and decline have caught up with him. Over the past three seasons, his slugging percentage has dropped from .533 to .459 to .394 and his home run output has fallen from 30 to 26 to 16. He’s still a 2.5-WAR player and an elite defender at third base. He’s a future Hall of Famer. However, he’s entering his age-34 season and this isn’t 2022, when Arenado posted a league-leading 7.7 WAR. If the Cardinals are willing to eat a significant part of the contract, there’s a possibility they could move him, but it’s not a slam dunk. Arenado would be a difficult player to trade because of his remaining contract, his no-trade clause, and there are not a lot of teams that need a third baseman. Trade proposal: Cardinals trade Ryan Helsley, Victor Scott II, and Steven Matz (eating all but $5 million of his $12.5 million salary) to the Yankees for Jasson Domínguez. Who says no, and why? — Dennis K. That’s an interesting trade idea. I’d make it if I’m the Cardinals because they’re building for the long term and I think Domínguez will be the best player in this proposal in the long term. The Yankees would get one of the best closers in the sport (Helsley) and a speedy center fielder (Scott) who would fit nicely between Juan Soto (if they re-sign him) and Aaron Judge in the outfield. However, Domínguez is the Yankees’ best prospect and I wouldn’t trade him if they don’t re-sign Soto. So, if the Yankees don’t re-sign Soto, they say no. GO DEEPER Ranking Juan Soto's free-agent suitors: Which team will sign him? And for how much? Could the Dodgers land Devin Williams (from the Brewers) with a combination of Gavin Lux and Landon Knack? — Andre M. The Brewers need a shortstop to replace free agent Willy Adames, who is expected to sign elsewhere, but Brewers manager Pat Murphy told me last week that he thinks Joey Ortiz will be able to fill that void. Williams would give the Dodgers another elite high-leverage reliever and then they could sign Adames to replace Lux. So I like your trade idea for the Dodgers, Andre, but not so much from the Brewers’ perspective. Advertisement Trade proposal: Devin Williams and a prospect to the Phillies for Alec Bohm? — Cj N. The Phillies need an elite, right-handed, high-leverage closer and I think this deal makes a lot of sense for them, especially if they could turn around and sign either Alex Bregman or Willy Adames to replace Bohm at the hot corner. I don’t think Phillies prospect Aidan Miller will be ready to play third in the majors until at least 2026 or 2027. I’ve heard the rumors they could have interest in getting Arenado from the Cardinals and I do think playing at Citizens Bank Park would help him, but St. Louis would need to absorb a lot of his contract. I also like this trade from the Brewers’ perspective because Bohm would solve third base and replace Adames in their lineup, allowing Ortiz to play shortstop with Brice Turang remaining at second. How about Bohm to Seattle for Harry Ford? The Phillies could get J.T. Realmuto’s (eventual) replacement and Seattle would add a third baseman/first baseman to an infield desperately in need of quality pieces. — Andrew R. I like the idea of the Phillies looking to get younger and building for the future while they’re trying to win now. This is a creative proposal that I think could work for both sides. The Mariners need to upgrade both first base and third base and could use Bohm, who has two more years of team control, at whatever position is better for them. And, as you point out, the Phillies would get their long-term catcher; Ford should be ready in 2026 to replace Realmuto, who is a free agent after 2025. Smart idea, Andrew! The Mets and Mariners are frequent trade partners, and their needs line up well. So here’s a trade proposal: The Mariners get Jeff McNeil, Brett Baty, cash, and (maybe?) a top 20 prospect; the Mets get one of Bryan Woo or Bryce Miller. Who says no? — Samuel R. The Mariners say no because they would get the worst end of that trade. Seattle president of baseball operations Jerry Dipoto has made it clear he’s not trading any of his top five starting pitchers this offseason; instead, he’s going to try to figure out how to improve his offense through free agency or trading prospects. If I’m the Mets, I’d love to make this deal, but it’s just not realistic. Does Josh Naylor get traded this offseason? I say no because I don’t see an obvious path for the Guardians to replace his 30-home run, 100-RBI production. But he’ll be a free agent after 2025, and they tend to trade guys before they hit free agency. What do you think? — Michael J. Because the Guardians made it all the way to the ALCS last season, I think they’re going to try to run it back in 2025 with basically the same team and keep Naylor for the reason you mentioned. The Guardians want to improve their starting rotation and would like another corner bat. They want to add a power bat to the middle of their lineup rather than subtract from it. The Pirates need corner-outfield (help) and the Red Sox need pitching. Is Wilyer Abreu for Jared Jones straight up a fair trade? — Anonymous U. That would get a clear “no thank you” from the Pirates to the Red Sox. The Buccos have zero interest in trading Jones. They are building their franchise around Paul Skenes and Jones at the top of their rotation. Neither is available via trade. The difference in the trade value of Crochet and Jones is that the White Sox control Crochet for only two more years while the Pirates control Jones for five more years. Pirates trade Jones to the Orioles for Colton Cowser. Who says no? — Michael T. The Pirates say no. They’ve worked too hard to build the top of their starting rotation to trade from it. Would the Twins seriously consider trading Carlos Correa? — Kramer S. The Twins love Correa, including his leadership and what he brings to the culture of their clubhouse. However, their three best players — Correa, Royce Lewis and Byron Buxton — have been injury-prone. Correa has a no-trade clause and team president Derek Falvey has publicly indicated he won’t be dealt. But if they could trade Correa to get younger and lessen the health risk of their lineup, they would have to consider it. Advertisement It’s no surprise the Phillies are looking for an outfielder. In a scenario where Alex Bregman (doesn’t sign with the Astros), what are the chances they then trade Kyle Tucker to retool their roster? The Phillies could start with a package of something like Alec Bohm, Ranger Suárez and some prospect(s) to get a deal done. — Tom Y.  Tucker is the Astros’ best all-around player and although they haven’t been able to sign him to a long-term contract yet, they’ve made it clear to me they are not trading him — period, end of discussion. If they were to trade him, your proposed package would not be close to enough to land him. What would a return for Framber Valdez look like for the Astros? They are deep in starting pitching and have a better track record of producing a replacement starting pitcher than, say, one for Tucker in the outfielder, so if they trade one, to me Framber would make more sense. — Michael D. The Valdez market would have to wait until this year’s class of free-agent starters — led by Corbin Burnes, Roki Sasaki, Max Fried and Blake Snell — signs. Once that occurs, the teams that miss out might be willing to offer prospect packages for Valdez. But keep in mind, the Astros are trying to win now and have no interest in sacrificing that to build for the future — at least not in 2025. So I think it’s highly unlikely they will trade him. However, in concept, the return would be a package of two good prospects and one solid prospect. Do you think the Rangers will trade Jacob deGrom to reduce payroll? — Arthur K.  The Rangers believe deGrom will be back to a Cy Young Award-caliber level — and if that happens, keeping him gives them their best shot of winning another World Series. I don’t get the impression they need to reduce payroll. The Rangers have been active in trying to add a starting pitcher, multiple relievers and a left-handed hitter. Do Mike Yastrzemski or LaMonte Wade Jr. have any real trade value? — Jeff T. I don’t think either player has much trade value. Yastrzemski just agreed to a one-year $9.5 million contract to play regularly in right field for San Francisco, and most other teams view him more as a fourth-outfielder type. Wade is a solid platoon player and might fit with a team like the Yankees if they found someone to pair with him, but they wouldn’t give up much to land him. If you were running the Giants, what would you do with Camilo Doval? Electric and controllable (reliever who had an) off year in 2024. He’d be in demand, but is it selling too low? — Alex M. Trading players is in some ways like the stock market: With his trade value so low, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to sell now. I would put resources into figuring out how to get Doval back to his dominant form. Is he healthy? Can he be helped mechanically? Do they need to change his repertoire or his pitch sequencing? Fix him. Get him right. Then when he dominates again, revisit whether to trade him. Hi, Jim! I’m curious to hear your thoughts on Buster Posey and if/how he can facilitate meaningful change, specifically on the trade front. — Gregory A. With three World Series championships as a player, Posey knows what it takes to win it all. He’ll focus on building the Giants with starting pitching and defense first. He has the respect of players across the league, so he’ll be able to recruit free-agent bats. However, I think he’s a bit hamstrung in his first year of running baseball operations for the Giants, with limitations from above on their major-league payroll. It’s going to take time to turn around the Giants, but I believe Posey is the right hire to make them contenders again. It’s going to require some patience; there is not a quick fix, particularly in a strong NL West. It’s obviously World Series or bust for the Reds with the window of Elly De La Cruz. … Is there a free agent or trade target who would benefit the Reds (now and) in 2026 or 2027 as they attempt to win the NLCS (before possibly having to consider trading De La Cruz)? — Tim O. I think the Reds need to upgrade the middle of their lineup with a corner power bat. Anthony Santander would be the perfect free-agent signing for them right now. Advertisement What would it take for Seattle to get Luis Arraez (in a trade with the Padres)? — Kyle S. It would take trading one of these starting pitchers: Logan Gilbert, Bryce Miller or George Kirby. In other words, the Padres aren’t looking to move Arraez unless it makes their major-league team better for 2025.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Why the Vancouver Canucks' new first line is dominating right now,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5945903/2024/11/25/vancouver-canucks-pettersson-sherwood-debrusk/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 15:48:19 GMT","Jake DeBrusk, Elias Pettersson and Kiefer Sherwood are playing dominant hockey as a trio for the Canucks.","NHL What a difference a spirited win can make. The Vancouver Canucks appeared listless heading into this road trip but put in one of their most impressive and complete performances of the season in remarkably difficult circumstances Saturday night in Ottawa. Suddenly this East Coast swing feels more like a real opportunity than a gauntlet they will have to weather while desperately short-handed. As the Canucks prepare for a set of back-to-back road games in Boston and Pittsburgh this week, let’s open the notebook and discuss some key storylines that emerged from the nation’s capital in the wider context of what it all means for the balance of this season. GO DEEPER How Canucks overcame harsh Quinn Hughes ejection to flatten Senators: 3 takeaways It would be inaccurate to suggest the Canucks stumbled into their new top line of Jake DeBrusk, Kiefer Sherwood and Elias Pettersson. The day after they inked DeBrusk and Sherwood in unrestricted free agency, after all, we reported they envisioned the possibility of both players flanking Pettersson. That wasn’t exactly a big scoop in DeBrusk’s case — the Canucks felt a sense of obligation to bring in a credible top-six-calibre player to complement Pettersson given the quality of linemates he centred last season — but they were somewhat more reluctant to publicly set those sorts of high expectations for Sherwood at the time. Advertisement No one in the Vancouver market is questioning the notion that Sherwood can play in the top six, or on the top line, today. And even if the bounces have been significantly in his favour (including an on-ice shooting percentage north of 13 percent, which is unlikely to be sustained), the fact Sherwood leads all Canucks skaters in five-on-five points through the first six weeks of the campaign is incredible. However they drew it up on paper, what the Canucks have rolling on the ice at the top of their forward ranks at the moment is pretty exciting. The DeBrusk-Pettersson-Sherwood trio has been fun to watch and has completely dominated play. The numbers, frankly, are crooked and ridiculous. In just over 44 five-on-five minutes playing together as a line, DeBrusk, Pettersson and Sherwood have controlled 57 shot attempts while surrendering just 28 against (a 67.2 percent shot attempt percentage). The sample is small, but since they’ve been put together, the new-look Pettersson line is helping Vancouver control play at a super-elite rate. Controlling play is well and good, of course, but it’s insufficient on its own — especially for a top line. There has to be a bottom line, especially for a team that’s as short-handed as the Canucks have been. Vancouver’s new top line has been up to that task well, converting their territorial dominance into goals for (while limiting goals against) with incredible efficacy. So far Vancouver is winning the new-look Pettersson line’s minutes 6-1 on the scoreboard at five-on-five. A 6-1 goal differential isn’t likely to remain that favourably slanted as the sample expands, but there’s no reason the way Vancouver’s new first line is playing, attacking off the rush and stacking up heavy shifts whenever they’re on the ice at even strength, can’t be sustained. With Pettersson’s two-way game and offensive creativity seemingly clicking into gear of late, DeBrusk’s shot rate rebounding after a slow start to the season and Sherwood mixing it up and using his speed to complement the attack and digging pucks out of wall battles consistently, the line is looking very legitimate. Advertisement They’re not just playing good hockey, they’re playing dominant hockey. In fact, they’re playing at such a high level that, provided that they can maintain this level as a trio, the Canucks should strongly consider letting them cook for a spell and continue to deploy them at the top of the lineup — with a healthy dose of minutes with the Quinn Hughes–Filip Hronek pair — even as some of their star-level forwards return from their various absences over the next handful of days and weeks. Erik Brännström has been something of a revelation since the Canucks acquired him before the season as a cap throw-in to complete the Tucker Poolman trade, but as well as he’s performed, his role and minutes have only increased modestly over the past month and change. Despite the second pair’s pronounced struggles, Vancouver’s blue-line usage has been pretty static throughout this season. The signature top pair of Hughes and Hronek has started every game this season and tends to log roughly a 40 percent share of the blue-line ice time. Vancouver’s second pair of Carson Soucy and Tyler Myers has likewise been fixed all year, until this past Saturday, and has tended to hold down about a 30-35 percent share of the five-on-five ice time. That’s left a remainder in the 25 percent range for the third pair, most frequently composed of Brännström and Vincent Desharnais. We can look at this share of ice time over a 10-game rolling average and see just how few significant changes the Canucks have implemented on the blue line so far this season. It’s also worth noting most of the apparent peaks and values in blue-line deployment are shaped by various players leaving games early — Myers because of an early-season injury scare, Hughes because of a game misconduct for a hit from behind on Senators forward Josh Norris — as opposed to being shaped by coaching decisions.  Graph courtesy MoneyPuck When you graph it out, it’s abundantly clear that Brännström has had a lot of difficulty breaking into a larger role on Vancouver’s blue line. As well as he’s played and as much as Vancouver’s second pair has struggled, Canucks coaches have been hesitant to upset the apple cart or tweak their defence pecking order from a usage perspective. Advertisement On Saturday night in Ottawa, however, we finally saw some movement. Brännström opened the game on a pair with Myers and skated on Myers’ left side through his first three shifts before the Hughes misconduct. Soucy, meanwhile, opened the game on the third pair with Noah Juulsen and played a small handful of shifts with Juulsen before Hughes’ absence caused the club to pivot to Plan B. Without Hughes, Vancouver’s game plan went out the window. We didn’t get to see what Canucks coaches originally envisioned as a new evolution of the blue-line usage schemes. What we did see, however, is still notable. Hronek led all Canucks defenders in total ice time, but the game was so loaded with special teams play and Hronek was so heavily involved in that phase of the game that Brännström ended up logging top-pair minutes (second on the time at even strength behind only Soucy). And in those minutes, the Canucks didn’t surrender a goal against and outshot the Senators by a wide margin, even though Brännström’s second most common opponent among Senators forwards was Tim Stützle. As well as Brännström has performed, his performance comes with the caveat that his usage has been carefully prescribed in the matchup game. He’s faced top- and second-line competition at a well-below-average rate at even strength this season with his minutes concentrated toward the soft underbelly of opponent’s rosters. Brännström and Desharnais have been effective in this sheltered role, but it’s always fair to wonder how a third-pair defender, even one picking their teeth with softer competition, might fare as their role is scaled up and they spend more head-to-head ice time against top-of-the-lineup competition featuring the best attacking talent in the league. One game isn’t sufficient for Brännström to have answered those questions definitively. But while holding down a larger role in Ottawa on Saturday night, partly by design and partly by necessity, it worked. Brännström retained his effectiveness against tougher competition while locking down a larger share of Vancouver’s blue-line minutes. It was a very good start, one that should give the Canucks confidence to keep pushing to challenge Brännström with more ice time and more responsibility. We touched on this a bit in Saturday’s takeaways but wanted to elaborate further. Advertisement As the Canucks’ flat, disappointing homestand got away from them last week, you could see and feel the mounting frustration. In Rick Tocchet’s commentary, for example, his frustration was palpable, and it went well beyond the results. Until getting back on track somewhat with strong efforts against the New York Rangers last Tuesday and Senators on Saturday, the Canucks weren’t playing the “right way” consistently enough based on their internal standards. The NHL is a results-based business first and foremost, but this isn’t a results-based assessment. Despite Tocchet’s supportive public commentary after the Canucks’ narrow, unconvincing win over the Chicago Blackhawks last Saturday, for example, it was clearly a lackadaisical performance on the heels of the New York Islanders debacle a few days prior. It was a performance that added to a sense of internal dissatisfaction about the team’s inconsistent focus and form. In contrast, the Canucks rightly felt their fully engaged performance against the Rangers demonstrated the sort of structural adherence and effort level required to win, even though Vancouver dropped that contest in regulation. That effort against the Rangers was maintained against the Senators in really tough circumstances, and that’s something the Canucks will try to tap into as they look to hold the fort on the road this week. This team spent much of this season short of its full arsenal of weapons, a situation that will persist — even with some key players nearing a return to game action — for at least the duration of this trip. During that time, the Canucks need to play well enough and collect a sufficient number of points to remain squarely in the chase pack in the Pacific Division. The way the Canucks view it, if they can just stay in the mix with the best teams in the division over the next few weeks, they’ll have the ability to catch up and surpass their rivals when their star players return to the lineup. It’s a long season, there’s a lot of road to run and the Canucks are confident in the overall quality of this roster when it’s fully operational. Advertisement In the meantime, they need to keep picking up points on this road swing. And that’s only going to happen, in the team’s own estimation, if the Canucks can find their game and get back to playing the “right way,” as they did in Ottawa on Saturday night.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,It's Nikola Jokić's world again; scouting Rutgers' Ace Bailey; NBA Cup craziness,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5945397/2024/11/25/nikola-jokic-nba-cup-ace-bailey-rutgers/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 15:33:30 GMT","For a player who has done so many unprecedented things, the three-time MVP is having a season like no other.","NBA It was a meaningless play that didn’t result in a basket, and yet it was one of the plays of the year, a perfect symbolism of the audacious creativity, instant recognition and breathtaking skill that Nikola Jokić brings to the game of basketball. With three-tenths of a second left in the third quarter in Los Angeles, Jokić took an inbound pass near his basket, swung at it in a half-volleyball, half-water polo motion and sent the ball hurtling 75 feet toward the other hoop. He came shockingly close to pulling off an all-time great shot. The Lakers’ and Nuggets’ announcers had the same reaction — cackling at the ridiculousness of what they just saw. This was vintage Jokić: Processing in the half-instant of game time between Anthony Davis’ free throw going through the net and Denver inbounding that a) there were 0.3 seconds left; b) that any normal shot attempt would likely be disallowed because of that; c) that he could position his right hand in such a way to tap a high inbound pass toward the opposing basket; d) that he needed to set up on the left side of the court to give his shot a chance; and e) that he needed to signal to Peyton Watson to throw it above his right shoulder. Advertisement Also, note that before any of that happened, he grabbed the ball first to see if he could throw a surprise long pass as the inbounder before dropping it off for Watson. This is what Jokić does: Instantly process and figure out the right move on the court, then use his insane combination of size and skill to execute it. (My favorite Jokić story of this ilk: A league source told me that once, at a preseason meeting with league officials to review that season’s points of emphasis, the refs went over several new ways they would crack down on a certain element of trickery players were using. Jokić took it all in, then asked the officials “OK, what if I do [X]?” … and the dumbfounded officials responded that they couldn’t enforce that particular life hack. It took him seconds to figure out the new rules to the puzzle.) That Jokić’s full-court volleyball attempt came in the midst of a 50-17 run against a Lakers team his Nuggets seemingly take a perverse joy in torturing was icing on the cake. The Nuggets looked totally lost when the three-time MVP missed three games for personal reasons last week and instantly healed once he came back. Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: For the season, the Nuggets have a championship-caliber plus-13.6 net rating when Jokić is on the court … and a tanktacular minus-16.9 net rating when he’s off. (Actually, that’s an insult to tanking teams — even the Wizards are only minus-14.2.) That unfathomable 30.5-point difference between the Nuggets with and without Jokić has been an enduring feature of the last half-decade, even as the Nuggets have tried every trick in the book (staggering starters, drafting backup centers, signing backup centers, trading for different backup centers, quick kicks on third down, etc.) to stem the tide. Underlying that difference, of course, is the simple fact that Jokić is the best player in the league, and whomever the Nuggets sub for him isn’t. Aaron Gordon has missed time because of injury, and this season, the Nuggets have lost rookie DaRon Holmes II to injury, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope to free agency and about 50 percent of what Jamal Murray used to be to whatever, but it only seems to matter if Jokić isn’t out there orchestrating things. Advertisement We thought maybe he’d take half a step back this year after winning MVP three times in four seasons. He followed a long year by playing in the Olympics, and he turns 30 in February. Jokić, however, has come back better than ever. In fact, this season’s compendium of Jokić ridiculousness is so amazing that we don’t even have to put the usual “except Wilt Chamberlain, who accomplished the feat 14 times” disclaimer at the end of his accomplishments the way we do with most NBA records. Jokic is doing things that have never been done before … ever. The story of the greatest players in NBA history. In 100 riveting profiles, top basketball writers justify their selections and uncover the history of the NBA in the process. The story of the greatest plays in NBA history. Consider that he is averaging a triple-double, comfortably, and yet it’s probably the least impressive thing you could pull out of his season stat sheet. (Only two other players have done this, one of whom — Russell Westbrook — is currently in charge of derailing the non-Jokić minutes.) Consider that Jokić is contending for the lead league in assists from the center position (no center has ever led in assists per game, although Chamberlain led in total assists in 1967-68), with Jokić’s 11.2 trailing just Atlanta’s Trae Young at 11.7 and ranking miles ahead of the rest of the field. Consider that Jokić is leading the league in rebounding for the first time and might run away with it; his 13.9 a night average is more than a full board ahead of the Sacramento Kings’ Domantas Sabonis at 12.7. More amazingly for a player most renowned as a brilliant passer, consider that Jokić also has a chance to win the scoring title. That’s the least likely of these potential feats, I should say, as Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo is ahead of the pack at 32.4. Jokić’s 30.2 per game is barely fending off LaMelo Ball (30.2) and Davis (30.1) for second. Nonetheless, it feels utterly insane to look at the three paragraphs above and realize Jokić has a chance to win the triple crown, leading the league in points, rebounds and assists per game. This ain’t baseball, folks: Nobody has ever come close, to the point that nobody even talks about this. Yet Jokić is first or second in all three categories; no player in NBA history has finished a season in the top three in per-game averages for each. Advertisement Westbrook’s record for triple-doubles in a season is 42. Given that Jokić is averaging a triple-double rather comfortably and still has 67 games left, you have to think that one is in his sights as well. He already has seven, which places his campaign in the top 100 in NBA history even if he shut down his season on Nov. 24. And hey, remember when we said the Nuggets had no shooting? Jokić devised a cure for that problem: He became the shooter. He had shied away from 3-point attempts in past seasons but is launching a career high 4.0 per game; he’s also hitting a staggering 56.3 percent of them, even with that 75-foot volleyball tap attempt in L.A. counting against his percentage. He’d be leading the league in 3-point percentage if it weren’t for that shot. (Jokić actually has one other miss classified as a “heave” by Cleaning the Glass, meaning that he’s made 27 of the 46 3s where he had a semi-realistic chance of connecting.) The 3s haven’t even taken away anything from the rest of his game. He’s taking the same percentage of his shots inside 10 feet and has a career-high offensive rebound rate. His average shot distance is actually down this year. How?! It also won’t surprise you to learn the advanced metrics also see Jokić as balling out. His 33.2 PER thus far would set an NBA record. He’s missed 20 percent of the schedule and still leads the league in win shares. His 15.0 BPM (box plus/minus) would also be the highest ever recorded, breaking his own record set in 2021-22. (Jokić’s last four seasons are four of the top six marks in history in BPM.) Yes, it’s early, and a lot of water can go under the bridge, so I’ll slow my roll slightly. But Jokić is already threatening to make the MVP race a runaway. The best player of this decade is on track to have his best season ever, and it could be historic on several levels. Enjoy the show. (This section won’t necessarily profile the best prospect of the week. Just the one I’ve been watching.) I managed to see five likely lottery picks in one weekend between my stops at Duke-Arizona on Friday and Rutgers’ visit to Kennesaw State on Sunday. I’ve already written about Cooper Flagg, the likely top pick in June’s draft, so today, let’s talk about Bailey. He and teammate Dylan Harper are projected by most as the second and third picks in the upcoming draft. Advertisement In a 79-77 defeat to the Owls, Bailey had 17 points, including four made 3s, and flashed unusual defensive mobility for his size. Bailey looks to be a true 6-foot-9 (as opposed to a random civilian the college decided to list as 6-9) but has a slender frame reminiscent of Chris Bosh or Kevin Durant and doesn’t play with much physicality. Instead, he’s a skill forward, one who can shoot from deep, handle the ball and move on the perimeter on defense. Bailey hit a deep 3 in the game’s first minute and seemed like he might give the Owls a long night on catch-and-shoots. However, he had several looks that rimmed out and finished the night 4 of 10 from 3. Obviously, 40 percent from 3 on high volume is nothing to sneeze at, even if the looks at the NBA level will be harder than the fungoes he was getting on Sunday. Bailey’s shot trajectory is a bit lower than you’d prefer, but the mechanics are smooth, he has a high release point and he gets good elevation on his jumper when he shoots off the dribble. There can be little doubt in his ability to stretch the floor. Where teams will want to see more growth is in the other phases of his game. In particular, Bailey’s shooting skill can become a bit of a crutch that causes him to pass up higher-percentage opportunities. He knows he can always squeeze off his jumper, so that becomes the default. Bailey took 17 shots but only had two free-throw attempts Sunday, partly because he passed up some opportunities to put more pressure on the rim. He only had one shot attempt that could be called in the restricted area and made just 2 of 7 inside the arc. He can’t just become a guy who settles for tough 2s. Even his free throws came on a pull-up for a long 2, where the defender challenged too aggressively. He’ll get a few whistles on those with his length, but it’s a tough way to eat consistently. More often, Bailey ends up turning an initial advantage into a contested pull-up or fadeaway rather than trying to stride or finish at the rim. The other piece, however, is that Bailey needs to make better decisions on the move. In three games for Rutgers thus far he has 42 field goal attempts and one assist. That’s … not good. Advertisement To my point above: In the few instances where he did decide to make a decisive move to the cup, it usually was the wrong decision. Twice in the first half he missed wide open teammates under the basket, once doing it while also trucking a waiting defender for an offensive foul. If he’s going to be a go-to scorer, he must add more credible passing to the package. Bailey did a good job on the glass in Rutgers’ first two games, but the same can’t be said for Sunday. Kennesaw State raced out to a 19-point halftime lead partly by dominating the glass 27-12, and Bailey had zero boards in the first half. He finished with just one. Where he made more impact was as a help defender and secondary rim protector. He showed quick bounce in impacting shots in the paint, had a giant chase-down block in transition and at one point used his length to pick a dribbler as a help defender with almost comic ease. The draft isn’t until June, and Bailey will have plenty of chances to impress scouts in Big Ten play. Conversely, it’s not like there were many eyes on this game. What scouts will want to see is whether he can build around the basic package of length and jump shooting to flash a more rounded-out floor game. Bailey tempts with “a more athletic Rashard Lewis-type” possibilities and has a strong case as the second-best prospect behind Flagg. But in a draft this strong, he could still get knocked down the board a few rungs if his weaknesses are seen as too much of a drag on his game. GO DEEPER 2025 NBA mock draft: Cooper Flagg leads strong group. But is it a 'superclass'? We have a clinching! With just nine days and three game nights left until the NBA Cup’s quarterfinal field is set, Golden State is the first team to qualify. The Warriors are your West Group C champion after they beat New Orleans and Dallas beat Denver on Friday. Although in second place. Dallas is in great shape for the West wild card with two wins and a plus-41 point differential. If the Mavericks beat Memphis at home Dec. 3, they should be in good shape to advance. The Rockets are our next potential clincher. They can wrap up West Group A with a win at Minnesota on Tuesday. In Group B, the Lakers have never lost an NBA Cup game and are the only unbeaten in the group but cannot clinch unless they win both group games this week (Tuesday at Phoenix and Friday versus Oklahoma City). Should they drop one, things get complicated. Advertisement In the East, after just two games, we already know Group A will be decided by the Orlando-New York game Dec. 3. In Group B, another battle of unbeatens, between Milwaukee and Detroit on Dec. 3, is likely but not certain to decide the group; Miami losing either of its two Cup games this week would remove the ifs from that scenario. Finally, if you’re looking at MAXIMUM CHAOS scenarios, we’re guaranteed to have a one-loss champion in East Group C, and it seems likely to be decided on point differential. Any of four teams could win it. The key battle this week is Atlanta hosting Cleveland on Friday in an afternoon matinee. Clinched quarterfinal spot (1): Golden State
Still unbeaten (6): Orlando, New York, Milwaukee, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles Lakers
In the mix (12): Miami, Atlanta, Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Dallas, Portland, Minnesota, LA Clippers, Phoenix, San Antonio, Oklahoma City

Sheeran, 33, said he had been intending to greet Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp and was unaware Amorim was being interviewed at the time, when the UK broadcaster cut to the him mid-way through the United head coach’s pitch-side discussion. Advertisement The singer-songwriter is a sponsor and minority shareholder of his hometown club Ipswich and was celebrating the newly-promoted side’s 1-1 draw against United. He was criticised on social media following the incident but issued a statement to explain it had been an accident. “Apologies if I offended Amorim yesterday, didn’t actually realise he was being interviewed at the time, was popping to say hi and bye to Jamie,” Sheeran wrote on social media. “Obvz feel a bit of a b****** but life goes on. Great game tho, congrats to all involved x”. After overseeing a 1-1 draw during his debut match in charge, Amorim was giving his first post-match interview to the Premier League’s primary UK broadcaster Sky Sports as Manchester United head coach. The 39-year-old was asked by pundit Izzy Christiansen what had impressed him the most from his new players in training in the build up to Sunday’s fixture and what he wanted to take forward from the game. Amorim replied: “You start discovering things: Garnacho can hold the ball between lines. You can see that in the game because the game is always open. You try to find these things. Bruno Fernandes, he improved his game by playing near the ball, feeling the ball. He can give us sometimes the long pass. But you cannot put him there all the time, because he wants the long pass. He concluded: “We try to find things about the players. We will need a lot of time, a lot of time to work out these things.” As presenter Kelly Cates began to ask the next question, the camera panned out to Sheeran greeting Redknapp. “Ed Sheeran has joined us,” Cates said. “Ed, we’re just speaking to Ruben Amorim, who may not want to talk to an Ipswich fan.” “I don’t think he wants to speak to me. He doesn’t want to speak to me,” Sheeran said. Ed Sheeran crashed Ruben Amorim's first post-match interview  😂 pic.twitter.com/cTSMgyTE8w — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) November 24, 2024  Attempting to keep Sheeran’s appearance short and sweet, Cates said: “From an Ipswich point of view, it was almost perfect?” “I loved it, I love being back in the Premier League,” Sheeran replied. Redknapp then promised to speak to Sheeran later, who left the pitch-side desk and departed out of shot. Advertisement “Thanks very much Ed. Ruben, it’s an unpredictable when we’re pitch side,” Cates explained, before resuming the post-match interview. Sheeran was subsequently labelled “rude” and “disrespectful” on social media, and Sky also faced criticism following the incident.  Sheeran grew up in Suffolk and is a boyhood Ipswich fan. He has been the club’s front-of-shirt sponsor since the 2021-22 season, with the club in League One. This was welcomed by supporters, the club having previously been sponsored by gambling company Magical Vegas and former owner Marcus Evans. Ipswich have since enjoyed back-to-back promotions under Kieran McKenna and in May secured a return to the Premier League following a 22-year absence. Sheeran designed the club’s third kit for the 2021-22 campaign and appeared in this season’s promotional video for the third strip. In August, it was announced the four-time Grammy Award winner had bought a minority stake in the club, and he is regularly pictured at matches.     A post shared by Ed Sheeran (@teddysphotos)  “I have lived in Suffolk since I was three years old and, while I travel the world and sometimes feel like an outsider in big cities, Suffolk and Ipswich have always made me feel part of the community and protected,” Sheeran said this summer. TNT Sports featured an interview with Sheeran and Peter Crouch ahead of Ipswich’s opening match of the Premier League season against Liverpool, and he was pictured greeting the Sky Sports punditry team in the studio ahead of Sunday’s fixture against United. Ipswich have won just won of their opening 12 games and are among the favourites for relegation this season, but came from a goal down inside the opening two minutes to secure a 1-1 draw against United.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Penguins Today: Neither Sidney Crosby nor holiday lights can cure these blues,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5946511/2024/11/25/penguins-today-sidney-crosby-600th-goal/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 15:00:33 GMT",The Penguins' points percentage is third-worst in the NHL. Their goal differential is the worst. It's bleak.,"NHL Happy Thanksgiving Week — you’re forgiven if you’re not feeling too festive. What transpired at PPG Paints Arena over the weekend was the hockey equivalent of turkeys falling from the sky.  There’s no way to sugarcoat losses at home on consecutive nights by a combined score of 10-2. Even Sidney Crosby’s 600th goal — an achievement only Mario Lemieux has accomplished with the Penguins — wasn’t enough to brighten spirits. He scored it on Light Up Night, the annual event where people flock to downtown Pittsburgh to kick off the holiday season and party as surrounding buildings stay lit into the evening’s darkest hours. Speaking of dark, here’s where things are for the Penguins: Things are bleak. In honor of Crosby’s 600th goal, let’s go back to the night he scored his first: Oct. 8, 2005. Crosby made a sellout crowd wait to witness history that night. He scored his goal late in the second period. I was relieved. I had spent most of the first period scouring the event level’s musty hallways in Mellon Arena — desperately trying to chase down Christina Aguilera. The Penguins had flown her into Pittsburgh as a surprise to perform the national anthem. Advertisement The newspaper I worked for at the time staffed this game like a Stanley Cup Final, and nobody wanted to give up a seat in the makeshift press box and risk missing Crosby’s first goal. But one of the editors insisted somebody write about Aguilera’s unexpected appearance, and I was the only reporter who had previously interviewed her. It took about 10 minutes of my looking into empty rooms and around corners, but I finally tracked her down near a small, scarcely known room near a public men’s restroom at the old Igloo. As I approached to ask for an interview, one of her bodyguards intervened. I flashed my media credential, explained my situation, and poured it on by offering that I’d spoken with Aguilera once for a story about the late Mister Rogers. “Yeah, pal, she’s not talking to you,” the bodyguard said. “But nice try.” I could see Aguilera talking with a couple of people in the room. I tried to get in her sightline by leaning around the bodyguard while holding up my credential and loudly telling her I worked for one of her hometown newspapers. She smiled politely and waved, but then the bodyguard ended my quest. “So, you’ll be leaving now,” he said. Never did get that story, but I was back in the press box to see Crosby score his first goal.  A bright spot for the Penguins is the early-season success of their AHL affiliate, Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. A 6-3-1-0 run in the past 10 games has the AHL Penguins in second place in the Atlantic Division. The juggernaut Hershey Bears have a tight grip on first place, but they’ve also played five more games than Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. Joel Blomqvist was the Penguins’ best goalie in the NHL, so it’s probably no surprise that he surrendered only three goals in two starts since returning to the AHL. The Wilkes-Barre/Scranton roster is comprised of a nice mix, as is evident by the club’s scoring leaders. Veteran Emil Bemström is tops with 15 points in 14 games, while prospect Ville Koivunen is second at 11 points. Tristan Broz’s seven goals pace the club. Advertisement It’s been too long since Wilkes-Barre/Scranton has iced a Calder Cup contender. Kyle Dubas oversaw a competitive AHL franchise in Toronto. So far, Dubas’ greatest success with the Penguins has been doing something similar with Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. See, it’s not all gloom and doom! Before the Penguins, Pittsburgh had an NHL team called the Pirates. And it’s a good thing, too; if not for that precedent, the Penguins may never have wrestled their black and gold colors from the Boston Bruins. But that’s a story for another day. On this date in 1925, the Pirates played the Bruins in Boston. It was the Pirates’ first game, and they won, 2-1, with captain Lionel Conacher scoring the franchise’s first goal. His nickname was “L-Train” because, believe it or not, there was a time when hockey nicknames weren’t just surnames with a “y” or “er” attached to the end. As always, a stick tap to our friends over at PittsburghHockey.net for the historical information. • Here’s what Josh Yohe is hearing about Mike Sullivan’s situation. Sullivan’s status is the No. 1 topic among agitated Penguins fans, so Josh provides some insight — even if it might not please bloodthirsty fans. • Would the Vancouver Canucks make a good trade partner for the Penguins regarding Marcus Pettersson? Pettersson is having a rough season, but all of the Penguins defensemen are. A change of scenery probably will do him good, and it will be interesting to see how long Dubas holds onto Pettersson before the March 8 NHL trade deadline. With an abundance of veterans who would make sense to trade, holding onto the biggest chip until the deadline is a risk. (Photo: Justin Berl / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

I braved a crowded, touristy IMAX theater to see “Gladiator II” this weekend, and I couldn’t be happier that I did. Review coming in tomorrow’s Bounce! The Bucks are so back! I think … Have the Bucks figured it all out after an abysmal start? Are the Pacers frauds? Can anybody stop Franz Wagner? Entering Week 5 of the Stock Report, we’ve got the teams and players trending in the right and wrong directions: 📈 Bucks (8-9): Remember that one-point Bucks loss to Charlotte that Doc Rivers blamed solely on the refs (accountability!)? That’s the only thing keeping the Bucks from having won seven straight games. Instead, they’re at four straight wins and just about even on the season after starting 2-8. During this stretch, Giannis Antetokounmpo is averaging 33.4 points, 10.9 rebounds, and 7.9 assists and shooting 60.8 percent from the field. Advertisement 📉 Pacers (7-10): The Pacers are not in a good place. Remember that free-wheeling, historically high-powered offense from last season? Remember Tyrese Haliburton playing like a mutated X-Men version of Steve Nash? All of that has normalized in a bad way. The Pacers are 16th in offense this season and have lost five of their last seven, and Haliburton still doesn’t look recovered from the hamstring injury that derailed him last season.  📈 Clippers (11-7): Don’t look now, but the Clippers have become a defensive juggernaut. (Actually, I don’t know why I’m telling you not to look now. Clearly this is something I deem noteworthy and think you should look at.) Let’s try this again: Hey, look! The Clippers are a defensive juggernaut! Over the last five games, the Clippers have limited the Jazz to 105 points, Warriors to 99, Magic to 93, Kings to 88 and whatever’s left of the Sixers to 99. All wins. 📉 Pelicans (4-13): The Pelicans have been so bad (due to injury) in the first month of the season that I checked to see if they have their first-round pick in 2025. They do. The Pelicans are so injured, they signed Elfrid Payton before a game last week. He hadn’t played a game since April 2022. He started! They were 3-3 on Nov. 1. They’ve lost 10 of their last 11. Also, Zion Williamson’s PR team shouldn’t have let that video go out (more on him shortly). 📈 Franz Wagner, Magic: Not only are the Magic on a great run, winning eight of their last nine, but Wagner is sustaining a new level of dominance. Over these nine games (all without Paolo Banchero), the 23-year-old Wagner is averaging 28.3 points, seven assists and 6.3 rebounds. Most importantly? He’s shooting 47.7 percent from the field, 36.2 percent from three and 90.2 percent from the line. The 3-point shooting is the difference between him being guardable and him being a viable No. 2 on a serious team once Paolo is back. Advertisement 📉 Pistons (7-11): Remember how we celebrated the Pistons for being on the way up last week? Welp! That’s not so much the case anymore. After being on the verge of .500 (7-8) this late into the season for the first time since 2018, the Pistons lost three straight games to Chicago, Charlotte and Orlando. To add literal insult to injury, Detroit lost Cade Cunningham to a hip injury after he had a hard fall at the end of the Hornets loss. 📈 Spurs (9-8): I was a little skeptical about putting the Spurs into this going into Saturday night’s game, and then they rallied to beat the Warriors. Their other two wins this week were against the Thunder and Jazz. That’s a great run for a team missing Victor Wembanyama for two of those wins. San Antonio is now above .500 on the season and has the league’s eighth-best defense. Not the best week Zion Williamson ever had … 🏀 Williamson is not close to returning. He’s had multiple treatments on his hamstring and is expected to miss even more extended time, according to reports. Also … 👋 Zion and CAA are parting ways. Williamson does not have CAA listed as his representation anymore. Is he in danger of being waived?  🩼 Grant Williams is out for the season. The Hornets forward tore his ACL on Saturday night in the loss to the Bucks. How does Charlotte replace him? 📚 The Doc is here! Julius “Dr. J.” Erving comes in at 15th in the “The Basketball 100.” It releases tomorrow!  Pre-order the book here. 📺 Don’t miss this game tonight. Clippers (11-7) at Celtics (14-3), 7:30 p.m. ET on League Pass. The Clippers are rolling, but the Celtics will be a strong test of this defensive run. 📺 This game could be a lot of fun. Knicks (9-7) at Nuggets (9-6), 9 p.m. ET on League Pass. Karl-Anthony Towns against Nikola Jokić. Jalen Brunson against Jamal Murray. 📺 Stay up late for this one, East Coast. Thunder (12-4) at Kings (8-9), 10 p.m. ET on NBA TV or Fubo. Once “Monday Night Football” is decided, this will provide that sports high you’re still chasing. Jokić, VanVleet and Ball had moments I wanted to highlight three things this weekend that truly show just how fanciful and random the NBA can be. It involves an absurd shot, a wild overreaction and a rare losing performance. Let’s start with the shot, and, of course, it involves Nikola Jokić. The Nuggets superstar and three-time MVP (four-time, if you count NBA Finals MVP awards) is having another season that doesn’t make sense. We need to break down his season soon, but it might be the best we’ve ever seen from him. That’s saying something. In a game in which the Nuggets went on a 50-17 run after being down 10 to the Lakers, Jokić tried this at the end of the third quarter:  Jokić is maybe 80 feet away from the basket. He decides to volleyball spike the ball with 0.3 seconds on the clock. And he didn’t actually come close to making it … but he kinda did when you consider the shot he took. This might be the greatest miss ever. Speaking of misses, Houston guard Fred VanVleet will probably be missing some money or games (or both) after the Rockets’ 104-98 loss to Portland on Saturday. With 4.3 seconds left, VanVleet decided to voice his displeasure to the officiating crew. He got called for an offensive foul for shoving Toumani Camara on the inbound. Then, he told each ref how he felt, including coming within a few inches of his outstretched finger touching a ref.  And finally, LaMelo Ball put on a show against the Bucks on Saturday night with 50 points, 10 assists and five rebounds. Charlotte was plus-seven in the 40 minutes he played before losing 125-119. Ball did everything he could to lead the Hornets to a win, and historically, a 50-10-5 line almost always works for wins. We’ve seen 33 players in league history put up a 50-10-5 line. Ball joins Jokic, Wilt Chamberlain, Tiny Archibald and James Harden as the only players to lose with that line. My favorite role players through the first month We’re one month into the season, and everybody is always giving love to the league’s stars. But what about the unsung role players or the slightly sung role players? Here’s a starting five of my favorites so far this season (no All-Stars or rookies): Ty Jerome, Cleveland Cavaliers: He was one of my favorite guards in the 2019 draft class (24th pick out of Virginia). It took him a while to find his place. The Cavs are his fourth team in his six seasons, after signing him in 2023. The 27-year-old has gotten a chance in their rotation and is playing great ball in his role. Jerome is averaging 12.6 points and 3.8 assists in just 19.0 minutes. He’s also leading the league with a 73.6 true shooting percentage. Advertisement Norman Powell, LA Clippers: Powell is probably too good for this list, but I don’t care. I’m using this as an opportunity to get on my soapbox and suggest the coaches heavily consider him for the West All-Star reserves if he plays like this into January. Powell, 31, is averaging 23.3 points to lead the Clippers, and he’s doing it on a career-best 63.8 true shooting percentage, thanks to his 48.7 percent from 3-point range. Shaedon Sharpe, Portland Trail Blazers: If you’re someone who stays up for the West Coast games, then your life is better when Sharpe is healthy. He’s averaging a career-best 18.4 points per game, and his athleticism has to be seen to be believed — especially in a league full of freak athletes. Sharpe, 21, missed the first eight games but he’s been back for a minute. In his last five games, he’s averaging 24.6 points on 44.8 percent from the field and 39.5 percent from deep. Peyton Watson, Denver Nuggets: He was inexplicably left out of the playoff rotation back in May, but I love what Watson has done for Denver this season. Watson has been a defensive spark as the Nuggets are dealing with so many injuries. The 22-year-old has also made a lot of clutch defensive plays while having the best offensive season of his career (10.0 points, 56.7 true shooting percentage). Jakob Poeltl, Toronto Raptors: The Raptors center is having the best season of his career so far, with career highs in scoring (16.7) and rebounding (12.3). He’s shooting just under 60 percent from the field (59.7), which he’s done for seven seasons of his nine-year career. The Raptors can’t score without the 29-year-old Poeltl, and he keeps them competitive. 📫 Love The Bounce? Check out The Athletic’s other newsletters.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Canadiens weekly notebook: The search for a team identity takes a step back,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5946043/2024/11/25/canadiens-nhl-identity-slafkovsky-dach-heineman/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 14:33:08 GMT","Also in this week's notebook, the mental challenges facing Kirby Dach and Juraj Slafkovský, Emil Heineman playing a familiar role and more.","NHL The Montreal Canadiens were obviously disappointed with how they performed against the Vegas Golden Knights on Saturday. Giving up five goals in one period will do that to a team. But what drove home the disappointment was what coach Martin St. Louis said the morning of the game. He was talking about building an identity, a key component of this season for a young team, and the mere fact he was talking about it meant he felt his team was on the verge of something. Advertisement “For sure, when you bring pace on both sides of the ice, you make it harder on the other team,” St. Louis said Saturday morning. “And I think, as a young team, we’re trying to find an identity, and I think bringing that pace is a big part of our conversations.” We hear that word a lot, pace. But that word is not as simple as it sounds. It not only means skating fast, though that is a part of it. It is a multi-faceted concept of the game, as St. Louis later explained. “Yeah, there’s two types of pace, actually three when you think about it,” St. Louis said. “And I think it affects both (of the other ones), but to me, mental pace is huge. And the mental pace is you can’t start playing the game when the puck hits your stick, you’ve got to know what’s going to happen. Are you using your feet, which is another kind of pace, just foot pace? Or are you letting the puck do the work, which is puck pace? “So if you have mental pace, you’ll know what to do next, and that’s why I always talk about not necessarily where the puck is, it’s the other four guys. So, pace is everything, there’s different kinds of pace, and we talk about it all the time.” And though there are three different kinds of pace, mental pace is clearly the foundation of everything St. Louis is trying to build with the Canadiens. When his defensive zone hybrid system was questioned, he basically said if you don’t have the mental pace to execute, maybe the NHL is not for you. When talking about his team’s play in the offensive zone, St. Louis talks about offensive anticipation a lot. Again, mental pace. So to see the Canadiens make several mental errors that night when he felt they were verging on building an identity centred on mental pace had to be doubly disappointing. But getting a definition of what St. Louis feels his team’s identity will be once these growing pains are ironed out was interesting. And mental pace is, ultimately, centred on hockey IQ and having a strong hockey processor. Advertisement While St. Louis has always felt confident that hockey IQ can be taught, and while the Canadiens have worked very hard to provide their players with the resources necessary to improve their hockey IQ, there is a strong contingent of hockey people who feel it can’t be taught and have felt that way for a long time. Being smart, after all, is largely an innate trait, is it not? Having a brain that can take in a lot of information in a very short period of time and process it quickly to come up with the best decision is not something every player can do at the NHL level, no matter how talented they are. And if there was any doubt of that reality, his players went out and proved it that night by making a stream of mental errors. But really, more so than a lack of hockey IQ, what that game displayed was a lack of discipline and patience, which is normal on a young team. It can be weeded out with experiences like the game against Vegas, little reminders of what happens when you lose that discipline. Juraj Slafkovský and Kirby Dach were front and centre in making those undisciplined mental errors on Saturday, with a Dach turnover leading to the second Vegas goal and a Slafkovský turnover leading to the third. Perhaps it will be a lesson learned for each of them, but the reality is the fact each of them are fighting it right now was likely a contributing factor in those costly turnovers. When you’re not producing offensively and are as naturally talented as each of them is, the temptation to try plays that create offence can overwhelm the sense of responsibility St. Louis is trying to impart to his team. Saturday morning, Slafkovský talked about what he needed to do to be more effective in the offensive zone. We’ve often heard both him and St. Louis say he needs to be more direct offensively, but what does that mean? Advertisement “I’ve been saying this, but I’ve just got to move my feet and just be more straightforward in the O-zone, then it will be good. It’s not there yet,” Slafkovský said. If he’s been saying it, why isn’t he doing it? “I don’t know. I actually don’t know,” he said. “Last year I was moving them, but this year, I don’t know. Maybe I’m thinking too much about how I need to do this, this, this and this. Maybe I’m too much in my head that I’m going to dangle four guys or whatever.” For his part, St. Louis didn’t disagree with Slafkovský’s assessment, which means this is something he has communicated to his young project. “When I say direct with Slaf, it’s foot pace. He’s got to move his feet. He’s got to be direct with that,” St. Louis said Saturday morning. “Whatever happens next, I’m not worried about it, but I know a lot more good things are going to happen when — he’s a big boy — when he’s got foot pace. And it starts with him anticipating and moving his feet, and when he does that he brings heaviness to the game.” As for Dach, last week he made an admission, an important one at this point of his season. His pace is a major mitigating factor. “I don’t think I’m playing bad hockey at all, it’s just, I think I’m playing safe. I think (unconsciously), it is what it is after an injury like that,” Dach said after practice Wednesday. “So I’m trying to work my way out of it, get back to holding on to pucks and making plays and being able to produce.” Dach tried to make a play in his own zone against Vegas, but it was the wrong play at the wrong time at the wrong area of the ice. So much of what the Canadiens believe Dach can be is based on what he showed them at a young age two seasons ago. But until he can get past playing safe, until he gets back to playing with a certain controlled recklessness, with some nasty bite to his game, that high ceiling he showed two seasons ago will remain elusive. Advertisement St. Louis expressed confidence last week that he can get that version of Dach back again, that he simply needs to get Dach to take a wider view of the game again as opposed to viewing it through a “toilet paper roll.” When Dach plays with that wide view, St. Louis said, the result is “special.” That game against Vegas, that turnover off a no-look pass in his own end, was the epitome of toilet roll hockey. “I feel for Dacher, he missed a lot of time and it’s frustrating for him because we all know how good he can be,” St. Louis said after the game Saturday. “So I feel for Dacher. They want to help, and it’s a fine line between helping and hurting.” The “they” here refers to both Dach and Slafkovský. The question he was asked was about the two of them because they were so central to that loss, but also because they are so central to what the Canadiens are trying to build. And while Dach seems a bit lost in the wilderness right now, Slafkovský still seems to have some healthy perspective. When told Saturday morning that this was around the time of year he found his game last season, Slafkovský laughed. “But also last year at around this time I had like two points,” he said, “so I think I’m in a better place.” Last year on Nov. 25, Slafkovský in fact had six points, but his point is valid and healthy. As poorly as things are going for him, he’s seen worse and he got out of it. Back when the Canadiens traded Tyler Toffoli to the Calgary Flames for a first-round pick and Emil Heineman — the first step in the rebuild — Heineman was playing in the Swedish Hockey League for Leksands IF. And he was playing on their fourth line. Leksands GM Thomas Johansson told us at the time Heineman was not only on the fourth line, he was playing on the best fourth line in the SHL. Advertisement “He’s been a perfect fit for us. We have a fourth line, they’re finishing checks, they’re doing the hard forecheck for us. The work ethic on that line is so high, that’s why Emil is such a good fit with the other two guys playing with him,” Johansson said back then. “When he gets in position and he uses his shot, he has the ability to score. And this fourth line is pretty much the best fourth line in the whole SHL. Their advanced stats are fantastic, so they are the best fourth line in the whole league. “I checked on that line compared to the other fourth lines in the league, and they are always above 50 percent in expected goals even if they always have the faceoff in our end pretty much all the time.” This explains why Heineman has been so good in the fourth-line role he is filling in Montreal right now, because his role is essentially the same. “Me and the other winger, we would just go, and the more pucks we won back, the more energy we got to do it again,” Heineman said last week of his role on Leksands two years ago. “So yeah, pretty similar to now.” Heineman has the best shot attempt share percentage on the Canadiens at five-on-five, a testament to how much time his line, currently with Joel Armia and Lucas Condotta, spends in the offensive zone. His speed and physicality on the forecheck have been an integral part of his success, much like it was in Sweden when the Canadiens traded for him. “I don’t do it just to hit,” Heineman said. “It’s part of my game to win pucks, and I feel like we’ve been winning a lot of pucks up ice. We’ve got to keep it going.” The physicality and the forechecking would be great on their own, but what makes Heineman such an intriguing part of the Canadiens’ future is his shot, something he’s worked on diligently for years, spending entire summers in Sweden by himself shooting buckets of pucks every day. Advertisement A fun fact that came as a result of Heineman’s garbage time power-play goal in the thrid period Saturday: Among all NHL players with at least 15 minutes of ice time on the power play, Heineman leads the league in goals per 60 minutes on the power play with 7.65. It’s a small sample size because Heineman has just barely played more than 15 power-play minutes, but everything he has shown so far this season would suggest he will be a part of this rebuild and could be a player on this team when it is actually good. But he’s not thinking that far ahead. “I’m just trying to keep it day by day, actually,” he said. “That’s the main thing. I always check in mentally that you’re ready to go. Compete and battle. I don’t take it for granted and I just want to go out there and do my best.” Despite how the Canadiens season has gone so far, despite them being last in the Eastern Conference and second to last in the NHL, they are not out of the mix because so many teams have been so bad to start the season. Yes, there are seven teams between them and a playoff spot right now, and the seven points standing between them and the final playoff spot in the East is a wide gap, the Canadiens are not completely out of it. It would, however, take a remarkable run over the next three weeks to prevent them being out of it by Christmas. Why? Because Christmas marks the start of an almost impossible stretch of games for the Canadiens. As it does every year. The Canadiens play back to back in Florida and Tampa Bay on Dec. 28 and 29. Then they travel to Las Vegas to play on New Year’s Eve. Then they travel to Chicago to play Jan. 3 and, for some inexplicable reason, play the next night in Denver. So, the next stretch of games is vitally important for the Canadiens to build a decent cushion before their post-Christmas trip. As of right now, only five of their next 14 games are against teams currently in a playoff spot. Advertisement Last season, the Canadiens went 3-3-1 on their Christmas trip, and the year before they went 1-5-1. It’s typically a time of year when their season goes south, and the schedule this year is particularly bad. If the Canadiens want to be in the mix, the time is now to make a surge, because tough times are ahead.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Former Marlins GM Kim Ng spearheads new pro softball league: 'MLB for softball',https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5944861/2024/11/25/softball-league-kim-ng/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 14:30:23 GMT",The Athletes Unlimited Softball League (AUSL) will start play in June 2025 with four teams and a 30-game schedule.,"MLB For the first time since its founding in 2020, Athletes Unlimited (AU) is organizing a traditional team-based league meant to be “Major League Baseball for softball,” in the words of former Miami Marlins general manager Kim Ng, the senior advisor of the inaugural Athletes Unlimited Softball League (AUSL). Advertisement AU has annually hosted weeks-long competitions for pro women’s sports, including softball, basketball, volleyball and lacrosse, with no coaches or GMs involved. A player, as opposed to a team, would win the so-called championship for a given season based on an unorthodox points system, with all games held at one location. Softball is the first sport for which AU is implementing a team format. The AUSL, scheduled to start in June 2025, is set to facilitate a 30-game slate for each of its four teams. The sites of said games will vary across to-be-determined touring locations, meant to help inform the league’s leadership on which cities might be most receptive to supporting a professional softball team in the long term. Starting in 2026, the AUSL plans to station up to six teams in different cities. At least 30 AUSL games will be exclusively broadcasted on ESPN, ESPN2 or ESPNU. Softball icon Jennie Finch, an Olympic gold medalist, is one of four supporting advisors to Ng, whose tenure as Marlins GM from 2020 to 2023 made her the first female GM in North America’s big four sports leagues (MLB, NFL, NBA, NHL). Ng believes the establishment of a premier softball league has been long overdue. But perhaps there is no better time than now, given the momentum stirred in recent years by sports such as women’s college basketball and the WNBA. GET HYPE Y'ALL 🗣️ we are thrilled to introduce the first group of players to join the #AUSL ✍️ 👉 https://t.co/F5bUlvhV0D pic.twitter.com/UQIdaBtJWn — AUSL (@theAUSLofficial) November 22, 2024  “There are people every day saying, ‘On Saturday night, I was watching the WNBA game with my 10-year-old son.’ … Stuff we didn’t think would happen for quite some time has all of a sudden just become so much more mainstream,” Ng said. Ng hopes AUSL will serve as a training ground for the best softball players in the world ahead of the sport’s return at the 2028 Summer Olympics. Advertisement The group of coaches and GMs selected for the first season are prominent softball figures. Stacey Nuveman-Deniz, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, is one of the four coaches. The GMs include Lisa Fernandez, a three-time Olympic gold medalist, and Cat Osterman, a four-time National Pro Fastpitch champion, among others. And among the first nine players signed are Olympic silver medalists Carley Hoover and Dejah Mulipola. The four teams will construct their rosters via the AUSL Allocation Draft in early 2025 and a college draft in the spring, a significant shift from how AU’s leagues have previously functioned. Players with the most points on an individual leaderboard would be deemed captains and given the power to pick their teams on a weekly basis, with an individual being crowned as champion at the end of the season. This setup will not go away entirely. After a best-of-three championship series decides the AUSL champion, the AUSL All-Star Cup, formerly known as the AU Pro Softball Championship season, will take place over four weeks to determine an individual champion. Such a format was born of a player-centric mission sported by AU, which has no owners or investors and instead enables players to serve as direct shareholders. Ng said she probably should’ve taken more time off after stepping down from her GM role with the Marlins in October 2023. The AUSL, and what it might enable for the future of softball and other professional women’s sports, was just too important for her to pass up. “Being a woman who has fought for other women in sports, and now to have the opportunity to be someone on the inside fighting for women’s sports, that’s really cool,” said Ng, who joined AU this past summer to lead the AUSL.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Fantasy Football Week 12 recap: Can Christian McCaffrey turn it around? It doesn't look good,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5946399/2024/11/25/fantasy-football-week-12-recap/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 14:22:14 GMT","CMC's disappointing season continued Sunday, while Saquon Barkley has us asking whether he can break an all-time RB points record.","Fantasy Football This series answers numerous fantasy football questions following the Week 12 games. It features a variety of systems, many of which are covered in this primer article. Note: The advanced metrics outside of KC’s unique metrics are per TruMedia/PFF or Stathead, unless otherwise noted. Fantasy point totals are PPR. Roster percentages are per ESPN leagues. Unless otherwise noted, statistical rankings are through the Sunday night game. Advertisement McCaffrey’s 7.8 points versus Green Bay was the lowest total of his 49ers tenure, leaving his fantasy managers feeling somewhat like San Francisco linebacker Fred Warner, who said the loss to the Packers was “probably the worst I’ve been a part of.” The bad news for CMC’s fantasy managers is that this is his third game of a relative slump. McCaffrey ranks 20th in RB points per game since returning from injury in Week 10. Is this slump going to continue? GO DEEPER Fantasy football Week 12 takeaways: Kyler Murray is bubble gum; Tyreek Hill is a problem The 49ers offense will likely get Brock Purdy back in the lineup for Week 13, which should help right the ship. But McCaffrey’s fantasy managers will not like San Francisco’s remaining rush defense schedule. The 49ers have red-rated rush defense matchups in four of the next five games. Two of those difficult matchups are on the road, and one of the other games is a short-week Thursday night NFC West showdown with the Rams (never mind what just happened against MVP candidate Saquon Barkley — this is still a very good rush defense). Don’t misunderstand this analysis. I will never tell you to sit a healthy McCaffrey. But CMC has been an RB2 since returning, and the Niners schedule, combined with CMC’s recent scoring pace, suggests that’s the production level he will have for the rest of the season. Barkley racked up an incredible 46.2 points against the Rams on Sunday night. It marked only the ninth time since the 2020 season that a running back has posted 46 or more points in a game. He now leads the league in games with 32-plus points, which he’s had in two straight weeks. He and Derrick Henry are the only running backs to put up back-to-back performances of over 30 PPR points this season. Advertisement This incredible scoring largesse leads one to ask if Barkley can break LaDainian Tomlinson’s all-time record for RB fantasy points in a season. Tomlinson tallied 481.1 with the San Diego Chargers in a 16-game season in 2006. Barkley currently has 265.9 points, which means he needs to score at least 215.3 points in the Eagles’ remaining six games to break Tomlinson’s record. Some quick math shows that is a 35.9-point per-game pace, a figure Barkley has only surpassed once this year (Sunday night against the Rams). Evidence would suggest Barkley cannot break this record, but the Eagles have four green-rated rush defenses left in those six games. If Barkley can rack up a couple of 40-plus point games (a difficult but not impossible proposition), he still has a puncher’s chance at overtaking LT for the best RB season in fantasy football history. Sunday was great for fantasy managers who started DJ Moore, Caleb Williams or Keenan Allen. Each of them posted 23 or more points against a stout Minnesota defense. Allen scored a season-high 23.6 points, while Moore and Williams each had 26.9 points, the second-highest total for both players. Improved play for Chicago’s passing game is now a two-game trend following an offensive coordinator change, and Williams’ confidence is now reportedly through the roof. Can the upward trend continue? The schedule suggests it absolutely can. Let’s start with Moore, who has four green-rated cornerback matchups in the next five weeks. Allen’s schedule isn’t quite as favorable, but he does have three green-rated and zero red-rated matchups remaining. Williams faces the toughest challenge, as all of Chicago’s remaining foes have a red rating in vertical pass coverage. Add it up, and Allen and Moore deserve very strong WR3 or flex consideration from here on out, and they might move to WR2 status due to the matchups. The call is tougher on Williams due to the vertical pass coverage slate, but with the favorable matchups for Allen and Moore, and Williams’ rushing ability, he will likely be a low-end QB1 more often than not from here on out. Advertisement Wilson hit the ground running when he took over as the Steelers’ starting quarterback in Week 7. He posted 24.86 points against the Jets that week and then notched 18.1 points against Washington in his third game under center. It’s been downhill since then, with Wilson scoring a total of 20.1 points over the past two weeks. A regression might be taking place, but the rest-of-season schedule suggests Wilson should be able to produce some impactful games. He has four green-rated deep pass coverage matchups in his remaining games, which gives him more highly favorable matchups than any other quarterback outside of whoever replaces the injured Gardner Minshew II as the Raiders starter. Wilson may have the most passing fantasy scoring potential among quarterbacks for the rest of the fantasy season and should be considered for a starting role when looking for a high-ceiling player. Wilson’s top target, George Pickens, has twofold schedule assistance. He is Pittsburgh’s vertical receiving threat and thus can benefit from those favorable deep coverage matchups. Pickens also has five green-rated cornerback matchups over the rest of the fantasy regular season and playoffs. Combine those factors, and Pickens should be in every fantasy lineup every week from here on out. Last week, this series covered a slate of struggling running backs. Taylor was on that list after having posted only 7.0 points against the Jets (his lowest total since Week 5 of last year), but things got even worse in Week 12 when Taylor generated only 3.5 points against Detroit, putting him in a three-week slump in which Taylor ranks 35th in RB PPG (8.4). Fantasy managers may already have lowered expectations for Taylor, but now they might consider benching him. In the next three weeks, the Colts have road games against New England and Denver, with a bye between those contests. The Patriots and Broncos both rate in the top five in fantasy points allowed per game on designed rushing plays since Week 10, so Taylor pretty much could not ask for a more difficult stretch of opponents. It’s never a good idea to outright bench someone as central to a team’s rushing attack as Taylor. But if you are on a team with viable replacement options, it’s probably time to use them over Taylor until at least Week 16, when the Colts face a somewhat favorable matchup against Tennessee.

Kikuchi, The Athletic’s No. 14 ranked free agent this offseason, netted a deal exactly in line with Tim Britton’s contract projection. The deal, first reported by the New York Post, is the largest expenditure thus far during the Angels’ busy winter. Advertisement The 33-year-old Kikuchi was an All-Star in 2021 and made 32 starts in each of the past two seasons with a 105 ERA+, making him a slightly above-average pitcher. But he shined this season after a trade deadline deal sent him from the Toronto Blue Jays — where he had a 4.75 ERA — to the Houston Astros, where he posted a 2.70 ERA down the stretch. Kikuchi threw fewer curveballs and more sliders, a tweak that yielded results the Angels hope to see over full seasons. He figures to slot into the rotation spot created when the Angels non-tendered lefty Patrick Sandoval on Friday. The Angels, coming off the worst season in franchise history, have added $80 million in payroll by signing four free agents. In addition to Kikuchi, the Angels signed infielder Kevin Newman to a one-year deal with a club option for 2026 ($2.75 million), starting pitcher Kyle Hendricks to a one-year deal ($2.5 million base salary) and catcher Travis d’Arnaud to a two-year deal ($12 million). The payroll increases don’t stop there. The Angels have also swung trades to acquire infielder Scott Kingery and slugging outfielder Jorge Soler, who has two years and $26 million left on his contract. As things stand, Kikuchi would lead the Angels’ rotation, which projects to also feature Hendricks, right-hander Jose Soriano and lefties Tyler Anderson and Reid Detmers. Top prospect Caden Dana and prospect Sam Aldegheri also figure at some point to be part of the equation. The Angels, who won just 63 games last year, could next look to further upgrade their outfield and bullpen. (Photo: Tim Warner / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,2024-25 MLB Top 40 Free Agent Big Board: Welcome to the Juan Soto sweepstakes,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5891633/2024/11/25/2024-25-mlb-top-40-free-agmlb-top-40-free-agents-2024-big-boardent-big-board-welcome-to-the-juan-soto-sweepstakes/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 14:10:43 GMT","Analysis, best fits, and contract projections on a strong class that includes Corbin Burnes, Alex Bregman and, possibly, Roki Sasaki","MLB On the final night of the baseball season, when the World Series is decided and the schedule empties, it’s common to count the days down to next spring — to pitchers and catchers reporting, to the opening of the Grapefruit and Cactus leagues, to Opening Day. Or, you can count down the five days to the most fun part of the baseball calendar: the offseason. Advertisement Those five days are up: This here is your landing page for the 2024-25 MLB offseason. It’s The Athletic’s MLB Free Agent Big Board, comprised of our top 40 rankings (a composite of individual rankings by Jim Bowden, Tim Britton, Aaron Gleeman, Chad Jennings and Keith Law), stats breakdowns, contract projections, best fits and more. And whenever any player signs, check back here for instant analysis — how the fit works for the player and the team — all offseason long. This year’s class is of course highlighted at the top by Juan Soto, the kind of player Scott Boras, his agent, will call “generational” and actually not be exaggerating. But Soto isn’t alone. Teams looking for an ace can choose among Corbin Burnes and Max Fried and Blake Snell and maybe Roki Sasaki. Teams hunting power can shop for Pete Alonso and Anthony Santander and Teoscar Hernández. Teams wanting late-game certainty can look at Tanner Scott and Jeff Hoffman and Blake Treinen. And as much as you’ll hear about how everyone here shouldn’t make this much money, how spending in free agency never works, just check out the last two World Series champions. The Texas Rangers rode World Series MVP Corey Seager and Marcus Semien and Nathan Eovaldi to a title in 2023, and the Los Angeles Dodgers were lifted by World Series MVP Freddie Freeman and about-to-be-NL MVP Shohei Ohtani to a trophy in 2024. (No team signed more of our top 40 free agents last year than the Dodgers.) Winning in free agency often means winning next season. Some bookkeeping: The player’s listed age is how old he’ll be on June 30 of next season (and thus what age he’s considered for the full season), the stats are from the 2024 season, the WAR is from FanGraphs, the best fits are alphabetical and you can filter through by position or search by name. Yes, yes, you’ll be mad certain big spenders are listed as a fit for pretty much every free agent. We’re just being realistic here. Bookmark, star, Ctrl/Cmd+D depending on your preference, and check back in all winter. In the offseason, this page is always on. Last winter’s biggest free agents were Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto — the transcendent star and the talented pitcher who hit the open market at only 25. This year, Soto combines Ohtani’s all-world offense with Yamamoto’s youth; he’s the first star position player to hit free agency going into his age-26 season since Bryce Harper and Manny Machado six years ago. It's really not since Alex Rodriguez in 2001 that a free agent has hit the open market this young and this accomplished. And it helps that Soto is coming off the best season of his career and a remarkable postseason that showcased all he can do in the batter’s box. Only his teammate Aaron Judge has a higher on-base percentage over the last three seasons; Soto’s never had one that didn’t start with a four. Only six players have hit more than his 76 home runs over the last two years. The proposed deals will likely be similar to how Ohtani’s deal with Los Angeles was valued in present-day dollars, at 10 years and roughly $440 million. The question is less whether Soto reaches $500 million than whether he pushes it to $600 million. Traded to the Orioles last winter, Burnes delivered ace-level performance for his new team. He ranked third in the American League in innings, fourth in ERA and 10th in strikeouts. He should see his name on Cy Young ballots for the fifth straight season, and he’s the best pitcher on the open market. That said, Burnes’ once-brilliant strikeout rate has fallen in each of the last four years. When the right-hander won the Cy Young with Milwaukee in 2021, he struck out hitters 50 percent more often than the average pitcher. This past year, he struck out hitters two percent more often than the average pitcher. His trademark cutter doesn’t move with the same bite or generate as many swings-and-misses as it did when he was at his best. A team pursuing Burnes will have to balance that trend with the exceptional track record of success he’s built since 2019. If you want an ace in free agency, this is still the guy. Few Japanese pitchers have been as heralded as Sasaki, who has been coveted internationally since he was a high schooler. This is a pitcher whose fastball has been clocked in the triple digits and who, at 20, threw a 19-strikeout perfect game (and backed it up with eight perfect innings and 14 Ks the next time out). The right-hander did take a step back in 2024, compiling the highest ERA of his young career, which was still about 30 percent better than the league average in NPB. Sasaki’s overall track record over the last three seasons compares well to those of Yusei Kikuchi and Kodai Senga before they signed in the majors. The key difference is Sasaki is only entering his age-23 season, so a signing team gets the entirety of his prime. There’s a really good chance, in fact, that Sasaki ends up being the most efficient free agent to add this winter. Because he’s not yet 25, Sasaki, if posted, will follow the Shohei Ohtani model, signing a minor-league contract and working through the arbitration system in the majors before hitting real free agency at six years of service time. As such, there isn't a real bidding war here, with teams having to distinguish themselves in non-financial ways. Fried’s value isn't quite at its max, as it was following a Cy Young runner-up season in 2022. He missed chunks of time in 2023 with strains of his hamstring and forearm, and he wasn’t as consistently reliable in 2024, posting his highest ERA since 2019. Oh, that ERA was still 3.25, and even in the last two down years, Fried has been a top-10 left-handed starter in the sport. Over the last five, only Houston’s Framber Valdez has been as good a lefty as Fried. Fried’s strikeout rate was in line with that of Corbin Burnes, but the trendline isn’t a concern. This is how Fried has always worked, relying more on soft contact on the ground than swing-and-miss. That approach is often undervalued in free agency. So here we are again. Snell is back on the market, and while he isn’t coming off a Cy Young campaign this go-around, his value in free agency should be close to what it was last winter. Snell recovered from a brutal start to his time in San Francisco, likely influenced by his late signing, to turn in another ridiculous second half. Over the last two years, in games started from July 1 on, Snell’s team is 24-6 and he has pitched to a 1.29 ERA. You’ll live with the slow starts to the season and the occasional in-game inconsistency for those bottom-line results later in the year. The left-hander owns the sport’s second-best strikeout rate for a starter over the last five years, and when he's on, he possesses unhittable stuff. (See: August 2 at Cincinnati.) After his initial extension with Tampa Bay and last year’s foray into free agency, he’s now entering his age-32 season, which limits how long a deal may be. Adames leveled up in 2024, setting new career highs in homers (32), RBIs (112) and wins above replacement (4.8, according to FanGraphs). And the shortstop is hitting free agency going into his age-29 season, a year younger than many of his peers. The downside in 2024 came with the glove, where Adames was rated below average at short by defensive runs saved. (By outs above average, Adames went from second among shortstops in 2023 to 12th.) And a position switch, maybe sooner rather than later, will have to be baked into any long-term deal here. Bregman rebounded from a difficult start to the year to look basically like himself from mid-May on: an OPS around .850 with 25 homers in his last 108 games. There was one key difference from his past years, though: the collapse of his walk rate. After years spent in the teens, Bregman’s walk rate plummeted below seven percent. He attributed that earlier in the season to swinging too much, especially at borderline pitches, which led to weaker contact. He swung more than he had in any other full season in the major leagues, and he made more contact outside the strike zone than ever before. Whether that’s an aberration or a trend will color how you feel about giving an otherwise stalwart performer a deal for six or seven years and close to $200 million. Bregman remains one of the game’s best all-around players, even if he’s five years removed from his best season, when he hit 40-plus homers and finished second in the AL MVP race in 2019. A free agent is judged by a years-long track record and thousands of plate appearances — in Alonso’s case, more than 3,600 of them. And yet, a single one of them can be the most defining. When Alonso stepped to the plate in the ninth inning of Game 3 of the Wild Card Series, he hadn’t delivered an extra-base hit in two weeks. He had just five hits in his previous 40 at-bats. He looked like a chief culprit in a first-round postseason exit. And then he smashed one of the best pitches in baseball for a go-ahead three-run homer, reminding the league what his power can do and propelling the Mets on a ride all the way to the NLCS. Alonso finished the postseason with close to a 1.000 OPS, a big course correction from a pedestrian regular season. He’s a right-right first baseman on the wrong side of 30 who doesn’t do a whole lot beyond hit home runs — and even that he did less of in 2024. But he still does that one skill about as good as anyone in baseball, and he showed in October how meaningful it can be. At this time eight years ago, Cleveland was deciding whether to protect Santander from the Rule 5 draft. They ultimately left him exposed, and the Baltimore Orioles took him with the final Major League selection of the 2016 Rule 5 draft. Santander became an Orioles mainstay and hit a career-high 44 home runs this season. He also made his first All-Star Game. Having just turned 30, Santander is again available to any team, but the price tag has gone up considerably. He’s a switch hitter who offers reliable power without an astronomical strikeout rate, having slugged .476 over the past six seasons. He’s played a little bit of first base, but is otherwise limited to the outfield corners where he has a decent arm and below-average glove. For his sake, Flaherty hopes being a postseason Game 1 starter for a World Series champion translates better in this iteration of free agency than it did for Jordan Montgomery last year. Flaherty lived the pillow-contract dream in 2024: He signed a one-year deal with Detroit, pitched like an ace for four months, got traded to Los Angeles and pitched well enough to help anchor the rotation to a title. The peripherals are really where Flaherty shined. Among free-agent starters, he owns the best strikeout-to-walk ratio and the second-best strikeout rate (behind Blake Snell). Plus, he’s the only starter hitting free agency while still in his 20s — another perk of sticking to a one-year deal last winter. Unsatisfied with the lukewarm multi-year deals he was offered last winter, Hernández signed a one-year pact with the Dodgers and delivered one of the best seasons of his career. He won the Home Run Derby, came through with a couple clutch postseason knocks, came within an RBI of a 30/100 season, cut down his strikeouts and upped his walks and thus his on-base percentage. Hernández is never going to be confused with a contact hitter or an above-average defender in the corner outfield. But he’s not necessarily a liability with the glove, and his prodigious power helps mitigate his tendency to strike out. He may not be a star, but he's a useful middle-of-the-order presence for a championship club. Who among us hasn’t stepped into the backyard, grabbed a wiffle-ball bat and mimicked a favorite stance — Gary Sheffield’s waggle or Jeff Bagwell’s crouch or Tony Batista’s look-you-straight-in-the-eye set-up? Such was the spirit animating Manaea’s decision, four months into a moderately successful bounceback campaign, to just pitch like Chris Sale. Now, when you or I pretend to be Sheffield in the backyard, we don’t become a 500-homer hitter. When Manaea started throwing like Sale, well, he started performing an awful lot like the Cy Young candidate. From that point in late July forward, he led baseball in innings, with an ERA just over 3.00 and a top-10 strikeout rate among starters. He carried that into the postseason, with excellent starts against the Phillies and Dodgers before running out of gas in the final game of the NLCS. Manaea thus re-enters free agency in a far stronger position than each of the last two winters, when he signed two-year deals with opt-outs. He’s positioned himself as a potential No. 2 starter who should sign for at least three years. Injuries have plagued Eovaldi throughout his career, but when healthy, he has been a steady starting pitcher. He’s been noticeably better in his 30s than he was in his 20s. Over the past three seasons, Eovaldi averaged 25 starts with a 3.76 ERA. He doesn’t strike out a ton of batters, but he doesn’t walk a ton either (since 2022, Eovaldi ranks 21st in strikeout-to-walk ratio, in between Cy Young winners Corbin Burnes and Sandy Alcantara). He’s coming off another solid year with a 1.107 WHIP and 3.80 ERA across 29 starts, the third-most in his career. Contenders in need of a veteran presence — but not necessarily 180-plus innings — could see Eovaldi as a mid-rotation presence whose big-game experience looms large come October. His postseason track record is impeccable, and Evoaldi has already won championships with the Red Sox and Rangers. Many questioned the Astros at the trade deadline for giving up a valuable three-prospect package for Kikuchi, who, at the time, had a 4.75 ERA with the Blue Jays. With the Astros, though, Kikuchi threw fewer curveballs and more sliders, and he delivered a 2.70 ERA over the season’s final two months. His free agent value might depend on whether teams believe that late-season change had unlocked a higher level. Prior to the end of last season, Kikuchi had been more steady than sensational. He was an All-Star in 2021 but finished that season with a slightly below-average 93 ERA+, and he has an underwhelming 91 ERA+ for his career. The past two seasons, though, Kikuchi has an above-average 105 ERA+ while making 32 starts each year. He could offer dependability with, perhaps, some upside if he can maintain those late-season improvements. Our own Tim Britton gets a homer for nailing Kikuchi’s exact contract projection at three years and $63 million. As for the deal itself, it’s a logical midpoint between the inconsistent and often mediocre pitcher Kikuchi has been for most of his MLB career and the front-line starter he was after the trade to Houston. His landing with the Angels rather than a more traditional contender is the only surprise.  Christian Walker didn’t get regular playing time in the majors until age 28, but the late-blooming slugger has turned into one of MLB’s best all-around first basemen. He’s topped an .800 OPS and won a Gold Glove award in three straight seasons while averaging 32 homers per 150 games. One of baseball’s premier defenders, Walker led all NL first basemen with 14 Outs Above Average in 2024. He might be too old to secure a big long-term payday, but Walker should have a sizable short-term market and could be seen by some teams as an appealing alternative to Pete Alonso given the likely massive gap in price tag. September shoulder surgery came at the worst possible time for Kim, who was unavailable to the Padres in the playoffs and now has a big question mark attached to his free agency. He’s unlikely to be ready by Opening Day, and any loss of arm strength would put a dent in his value. At 29 years old, Kim is young enough to secure a multi-year deal as the second-best shortstop on the market behind Willy Adames. He’s an excellent fielder with a career .706 OPS that’s slightly above league average for the defense-driven position. He’s also proven to be a standout second baseman if a move is needed. It took more than a decade after he was baseball’s No. 1 prospect, but Profar finally had an All-Star season. Available for just $1 million last offseason thanks to a terrible 2023 campaign, Profar blew away his previous career highs in nearly every major category by combining elite-level hard-hit metrics with one of the league’s lowest strikeout rates. Still, most of the ex-shortstop’s defensive flexibility is long gone, and Profar still hasn’t produced an above-average OPS in consecutive years, so a sizable multi-year investment would carry a lot of risk — or at least require a lot of faith that this is his new normal. An All-Star in each of his first two Major League seasons, Torres has settled in as more of a good everyday player than a great one. He hasn’t been an All-Star since 2019, and since 2020 he ranks 12th among Major League second basemen in fWAR. He’s an above-average hitter (109 wRC+ the past five years) but has negative defensive metrics. However, a strong second half did give Torres a solid platform year heading into free agency. After struggling early in the season, Torres had a .780 OPS after the All-Star break and a .744 OPS in the playoffs. He was the Yankees’ leadoff hitter late in the season and proved himself as a capable table-setter. Torres might not be the superstar many expected, but at a position that’s relatively thin, plenty of teams could see him as a worthwhile upgrade. Tantalizing but extremely wild early in his career, Scott has emerged as one of the game’s top left-handed relievers by improving his walk rate from abysmal to merely run-of-the-mill bad. He was a first-time All-Star last season, despite walking 4.5 per nine innings, because his upper-90s fastball and high-80s slider are among the most overpowering combos in baseball. Scott has a 2.04 ERA with 188 strikeouts in 150 innings over the past two seasons while shutting down both lefties (.167) and righties (.194), making him a near-lock to secure the biggest payday of any reliever in this free-agent class, even if some teams are scared away by his erratic pre-2023 work. Bieber appeared to be back to his Cy Young-winning form by beginning the season with a 20-to-1 strikeout-to-walk ratio over 12 scoreless innings, but that came to a screeching halt with Tommy John surgery in mid-April. His rehab will likely stretch into next season, so Bieber might have to choose between a short-term deal driven by incentives or a longer-term deal for a discounted annual salary. Interested suitors will have to decide how much those two great April starts canceled out what had been a multi-year deadline in which Bieber’s strikeout rate plummeted from 41 percent in 2020 to 20 percent in 2023. At his healthiest, Bieber is one of baseball’s elite starters, but no one can be certain that version still exists. It was a very fruitful October for Buehler, who shined during the Dodgers’ title run to end his comeback from Tommy John surgery on a high note after mostly struggling in the regular season. Buehler had a career 3.02 ERA with 690 strikeouts in 630 innings before going under the knife for the second time in late 2022, so some teams could view this as a chance to lock in a front-line starter to a below-market long-term deal. But he’s also still young enough to opt for a one-year deal to fully recoup his value with an eye on a huge payday next offseason. Either way, any window to sign Buehler to a bargain-rate contract surely closed after his Game 5 heroics. Health issues and inconsistent playing time have dogged O’Neill for much of his career, but when healthy, he’s provided an intriguing mix of power, speed and defense. This past season was his first outside of the Cardinals organization, and O’Neill largely returned to form with the Red Sox. He hit 31 home runs and slugged .511, but he also played only 113 games as he went on the IL three times and the Red Sox regularly limited his workload in an effort to keep him healthy. At his best, O’Neill can be a valuable run producer, and he’s won two Gold Gloves in left field. His sprint speed was down the past two years — it used to be elite — but he still moves well for a power hitter. His strikeout rate was up this season, but so was his walk rate. He has been especially productive against lefties (.923 career OPS) and won’t turn 30 until late June. Starters who sign for one year generally fall into two different buckets: the back-end innings eaters, and the risk/reward arms where you hope to recapture the past. The Mets thought they were getting the latter with Severino, and instead he became a high-end version of the former. Utilizing a sinker for soft contact and early outs, Severino made 31 regular-season starts and threw 182 innings — or nearly as many as he’d compiled in his previous five seasons combined. He was a reliable mid-rotation starter for New York, consistently keeping the Mets in games and taking big starts in the postseason. With his health and innings re-established, Severino thinks there’s more in the tank, notably how to bring back an elevated strikeout rate. Hoffman was a bust until, quite suddenly, he wasn’t. Drafted ninth overall in 2014, Hoffman bounced through four organizations before, at age 30, signing a minor league deal with the Phillies in March of 2023. In the two years since, he’s been one of the best relievers in baseball with a 0.94 WHIP, 12 strikeouts per nine innings, and the 14th-best Win Probability Added. He’s coming off a career-best 10 saves, 2.17 ERA, and his first All-Star selection. Hoffman throws mostly fastballs and sliders, with a split finger for left-handed hitters, and despite his limited ninth-inning experience, he should be one of the most coveted relievers on the market. Hoffman’s never made more than $2.2 million a year. That’s about to change. Martinez has been so effective as a swingman since returning from Japan in 2022 that it seems inevitable he’ll get a well-paid chance at a full-time starting gig. He’s topped 100 innings with a sub-3.50 ERA in three straight seasons, making at least nine starts in each year. And while his 2.98 ERA as a multi-inning reliever is very good, his 3.62 ERA in 35 total starts is what should get Martinez paid enough to justify turning down his $12 million player option with the Reds for 2025. He received a surprising qualifying offer, which would guarantee him $21 million if accepted. Martinez isn’t without risk due to the limited track record, but he has the deep pitch mix of a starter and could have untapped upside. Of the 13 free agents to receive a qualifying offer, Martinez was the only player to accept the one-year, $21.05 million contract. He opted to return to the Reds despite reports of multi-year interest from other teams, choosing a bigger 2025 salary over a longer-term deal. It’s a good outcome for the Reds and a risk for Martinez at 34, but he’ll be a free agent next offseason without draft-pick compensation attached. Playing for his fifth team in five years, Pederson had his best season at 32 years old. Now, he’s back on the market for any contenders in need of a left-handed thump. Pederson lost a ton of speed and athleticism, and is now more of a beefed-up designated hitter than a corner outfielder, but he can always mash right-handed pitching and he’s improved his plate discipline, too. He’s one of the market’s best lefty bats, hitting .267 with an .870 OPS against righties over the past three seasons, but a lack of defensive value and platoon-worthy struggles against lefties shrink his potential options. Something similar to last winter’s one-year, $12.5 million deal makes the most sense. Acquired by the Yankees at the 2021 trade deadline, Holmes was little more than a middle-innings arm with a 5.57 career ERA. Keyword: was. He quickly blossomed into a legitimate closer, earning two All-Star nominations through his age-31 season. With a sinker/sweeper mix, Holmes had 74 saves and a 2.69 ERA in his three-plus seasons with the Yankees. He was an All-Star again in 2024, and although he lost the closer job late in the year, he returned to form in the playoffs and was crucial in getting the Yankees to the World Series. Interested teams could see him as a closer or as a veteran bridge to the ninth inning, either of which would be far more valuable than what the Yankees seemed to be getting a little more than three years ago. An All-Star closer with the Angels in 2023, Estévez was even better in 2024. His strikeout rate dipped, but his walk rate plummeted, and he did a far better job at limiting runs. The Phillies traded for him at the deadline, and he finished the campaign with  26 saves, a 2.45 ERA, and 0.91 WHIP with 8.2 strikeouts and 2.0 walks per nine. Estévez leans heavily on a 97-mph fastball and complements it with a slider and the occasional changeup. His strikeout rate has fluctuated over the years, and 2024 marked a significant improvement in his walk rate. He’s one of several free agent relievers who has experience as both a setup man and as a closer. For the first time in his career, Paul Goldschmidt was classified as a below-average hitter, after posting career-worst numbers across the board. Just two seasons removed from a 177 OPS+ MVP campaign, Goldschmidt had a 98 OPS+ over 154 games. At 37 years old, he can still hit the ball plenty hard, but his once-excellent strike-zone control has deteriorated, with his strikeout rate jumping and walk rate plummeting. That’s typically a very bad sign for a late-30s slugger, but the seven-time All-Star continued to feast on lefties and the Hall of Fame-caliber résumé should convince some contenders to pursue a bounce-back bet with a relatively modest one-year deal. After missing most of 2022 and all of 2023 with shoulder problems, Blake Treinen was back to his usual dominant self in 2024. Between the regular season and the Dodgers’ World Series playoff run, he posted a 1.98 ERA and 74-to-15 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 59 innings, overpowering hitters with his mid-90s sinker and a sweeper that can be close to unhittable. Treinen’s age and injury history will likely limit him to short-term deals, but contenders should be lining up to add him on a high-salary one- or even two-year deal. And they may have to get in line behind the Dodgers. Pivetta is a durable innings eater who can, at times, do more than just eat innings. His strikeout rate the past two years was fourth-best in the majors among pitchers with at least 250 innings, and his 4.09 ERA the past two seasons is comparable to that of Dylan Cease (4.00), Aaron Nola (4.01) and Joe Ryan (4.10). Granted, some of Pivetta’s productivity came out of the bullpen in the second half of 2023, but his best stretches have been impressive, even if they’ve been mixed with patches of vulnerability and inconsistency. At the very least, though, Pivetta has been available. When he missed most of April with a flexor strain, it was his first extended IL stint in the big leagues. He has otherwise been healthy and capable of 30-plus starts. That half season out of the bullpen in 2023 was strong , and he was able to move quickly back into the rotation late in the year. In his 20s, Yates was a fringe Major League reliever who’d gone undrafted out of college. In his 30s, he’s been a closer and two-time All-Star, and at 37, he’s coming off one of the best seasons of his career. Pushed into ninth-inning duty after José Leclerc struggled out of the gate, Yates finished with 33 saves and a career-best 1.17 ERA with the Rangers. He was an All-Star and finished behind only Cleveland’s Emmanuel Clase in Win Probability Added. Walks come with the territory, but so do strikeouts as Yates generates plenty of swing and miss without extreme velocity. He turns 38 in March, so there will be some age concern, but when healthy, Yates has been a reliable late-inning arm with plenty of ninth-inning experience. There’s nothing particularly flashy about Heaney, but he’s become a reliable back-end starter who’s good for 150-plus innings. That alone is valuable. Over his past two seasons with the Rangers, he averaged 30 starts and a 4.22 ERA. He strikes out roughly a batter an inning, and his walk rate normalized this past season after spiking in 2023. He’s a lefty, but he hasn’t had extreme left-right splits in recent years. At a time when even the World Series champs had to scramble for arms, Heaney’s value comes not in his top-of-the-rotation dominance, but in his bottom-of-the-rotation dependability. He spent the past two seasons with the Rangers, averaging 30 starts and a 4.22 ERA. Kepler’s decade-long stint with Minnesota ended with a whimper, as he sat out the Twins’ stretch run with a knee injury. He finished his 2024 season with a career-worst 91 OPS+ over 105 games, down from his 120 OPS+ in 2023. Still, Kepler remains a quality defensive right fielder, despite shedding speed. Teams will have to contend with the fact that Kepler has posted a below-average OPS in three of the past four seasons, and his once-strong plate discipline has abandoned him. His best fit is likely as a platoon bat, particularly as he has a .221/.292/.363 slash line against lefties, even as an everyday player. Minnesota has moved on, and it’s tough to imagine many contenders viewing him as more than a stop-gap option. But the mix of recent 25-homer power and a still-low strikeout rate remains somewhat enticing. A Nippon Professional Baseball right-hander, Sugano was originally posted after the 2020 season, but he didn’t land a contract and re-signed with the Yomiuri Giants. Entering his age-35 season, Sugano is once again testing the MLB market, coming off his best year since 2020. His ERA was 70 percent better than league average in Japan’s Central League, though over the two seasons prior, he was statistically a league-average arm. That track record aligns him with other NPB-turned-MLB starters like Kaz Ishii and Masato Yoshii — so a serviceable starter, but not a front-line pitcher. Sugano’s age will limit interest. The other concern will be his drop in strikeouts over the last several years. In 2024, he struck out batters less often than the league average in NPB, which features significantly fewer punchouts than in MLB. A team signing Sugano will be subjected to a posting fee, paying 20 percent of the first $25 million, 17.5 percent of the next $25 million, and 15 percent of anything over $50 million, making his contract prospects dicey. Matthew Boyd has a career 4.85 ERA and hasn’t started more than 15 games in a season since 2019, but his 11 late-season starts with the Guardians (including the playoffs) while returning from Tommy John surgery were awfully enticing. He had a 2.27 ERA with 60 strikeouts in 51 1/3 innings and was nearly all the way back to his peak fastball velocity at 91-93 mph. Boyd can miss bats with three pitches and, for two months at least, his previous homer issues weren’t a problem. He should be swimming in one-year offers and might be able to coax out a two-year deal. Much like the Mets as a whole, Quintana managed to turn around his 2024 season. A mid-May ERA of nearly 5.50 became a 3.21 ERA over his final 23 starts. In the postseason, he spun a pair of outings without an earned run in postseason clinchers in the Wild Card Series and NLDS. If you’re wondering just how Quintana was able to do that, you’d be justified. Simply put, he threw fewer pitchers in the strike zone than any other NL starter. He doesn’t generate swing-and-miss, and he didn’t stop walking hitters or giving up homers, either. But he generally stays off the barrel of the bat, though it’s worth noting that his FIP was in the mid-fours, suggesting a fair bit of luck was involved. Verdugo was a key piece of the 2020 trade that sent Mookie Betts to the Dodgers, and initially looked like the Red Sox’s new franchise right fielder. He certainly played the part in his first season, posting a 123 OPS+ with a 12th-place MVP finish. Verdugo’s offensive production has declined every year since, including an 83 OPS+ this past season with the Yankees. He remains a good defender in the outfield corners, and he doesn’t swing and miss or strike out much, but he also doesn’t barrel the ball very often. In the postseason, he was relegated to the Yankees’ No. 9 slot, and his left-right splits suggest he might fit best in a platoon. Scherzer spent parts of 2024 on the IL, first recovering from offseason back surgery, then shoulder fatigue and again with a strained hamstring. He’s made only one big league appearance since July 30, but he did pitch pretty well when active. In all, he made just nine starts in 2024, posting a 3.95 ERA. It marked the first full season since his debut in which he failed to make at least 23 starts (and only the second in which he failed to make at least 27). Though he turned 40 in July, Scherzer has indicated that he wants to pitch one more season, putting his Cooperstown bid on hold for the time being. His workload has meaningfully declined in recent years, and he’s surely not the 200-inning beast of his prime, but he remains Max Scherzer. We’ll soon find out what that means as he approaches his 41st birthday. While no longer the All-Star caliber 30-homer hitter he was with the Mets a half-decade ago, Conforto had a sneaky good 2024 — his best full season since 2019. A remarkable 17 of his 20 home runs came away from San Francisco’s Oracle Park, and his OPS was 220 points higher on the road (.852 vs. .632). Analytically, he made significant strides with his batted-ball data, hitting the ball harder more often, with a big jump in barrels. Conforto still stays disciplined in the strike zone and draws a fair amount of walks. He’s hitting lefties better than ever before, albeit in a still limited sample (95 at-bats). However, his outfield defense cratered in 2020 and has never really come back, so he straddles the line between a corner outfielder and a DH. • Bowden’s rankings published Oct. 24, prior to contract option decisions.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"NBA Rewind: Who's up (Bucks), who's down (Pacers) and the great East-West divide",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5936987/2024/11/25/nba-rewind-pacers-bucks-east-west/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 14:10:27 GMT","About a month into the season, the imbalance between conferences has never been wider. Plus, your latest NBA Cup-date.","NBA We are about a month into the 2024-25 NBA season, and so much has happened already. We’re seeing teams traverse the ebbs and flows of their expectations during lulls and high points. Players have stepped up in the absence of stars. There have been players we’d forgotten about getting signed just to help field a rotation. We’re already seeing teams fall apart right in front of our eyes. That massive gulf between the East and West? It’s still there! All of this, and a really fun second year of the NBA Cup, is happening so far. Advertisement Here’s your latest NBA Rewind! Teams like the Milwaukee Bucks and LA Clippers have been written off because of injuries or poor coaching (Doc Rivers, not Ty Lue) or just poor attention to detail. The Orlando Magic were briefly written off after Paolo Banchero went down. Now, we’re singing their praises while wondering what’s wrong with an Eastern Conference finalist and two teams now dealing with big injuries to major players. It’s the NBA Stock Report, extended addition! 📈 Milwaukee Bucks (8-9): Remember that one-point Bucks loss to Charlotte that Doc Rivers blamed solely on the refs because accountability is a myth? That’s the only thing keeping the Bucks from having won seven straight games. Instead, they’re at four straight wins and just about even on the season after starting 2-8. This is a big step forward for the Bucks, who have wins over Houston, Chicago and Indiana during this streak. Over the last seven games, the Bucks are ninth in offense and seventh in defense. The schedule doesn’t look like the toughest, but Milwaukee is still currently beating the teams in front of them. During this stretch, Giannis Antetokounmpo is averaging 33.4 points. 10.9 rebounds, 7.9 assists and shooting 60.8 percent from the field. GO DEEPER Antetokounmpo-Lillard combo finding its groove as 'vibes ... are high' after Bucks top Pacers 📉 Indiana Pacers (7-10): The Pacers are not in a good place. Remember that free-wheeling, historically high-powered offense from last season? It was the second-best offense in NBA history, only bested by last year’s Celtics. Remember Tyrese Haliburton playing like a mutated X-Men version of Steve Nash? He was averaging 23.8 points, 12.5 assists and just 2.5 turnovers with 49.7/40.3/86.8 shooting splits before his hamstring injury last season. All of that has normalized in a bad way. The Pacers are 16th in offense this season and have lost five of their last seven, and Haliburton still doesn’t look recovered from that hamstring injury. He’s currently averaging 15.8 points, 8.5 assists and 1.8 turnovers with putrid 37.8/30.7/83.3 shooting splits this season. Where have the Pacers gone? Advertisement 📈 LA Clippers (11-7): Don’t look now, but the Clippers have become a defensive juggernaut over the last week. Actually, I don’t know why I’m telling you not to look now. Clearly, this is something I deem noteworthy and think you should look at. Hey, look! The Clippers have become a defensive juggernaut over the last week! After a rough defensive road trip, the Clippers have limited the Jazz to 105 points, the Warriors to 99, the Magic to 93, the Kings to 88, and what’s left of the Sixers to 99. All wins. The Clippers put up an unbelievable 98.4 defensive rating during that five-game stretch. For a reference point, the Thunder have the best defensive rating on the season, giving up 102.7 points per 100 possessions. Ty Lue has this team fifth in the league in defensive rating for the season. 📉 New Orleans Pelicans (4-13): The Pelicans have been so bad, because of injuries, in the first month of the season that I checked to see if they have their first-round pick in 2025. They do, by the way. The Pelicans are so injured, they signed Elfrid Payton before a game last week. He hadn’t played a game since April 2022. He started for the Pelicans after they signed him. They were 3-3 on Nov. 1. They’ve lost 10 of 11. During these 11 games, their top six in minutes played are Brandon Boston Jr., Brandon Ingram, Jeremiah Robinson-Earl, Javonte Green, Yves Missi and Jaylen Nowell. As if it can’t get worse, Zion Williamson’s PR team can’t let that video go out. The internet has not been kind to it. 📈 Franz Wagner, Orlando Magic: Not only are the Magic on a great run, winning eight of their last nine, but Wagner has enjoyed a level of dominance we haven’t seen him sustain before. Over these nine games (all without Paolo Banchero), Wagner is averaging 28.3 points, seven assists and 6.3 rebounds. Most importantly? He’s shooting 47.7 percent from the field, 36.2 percent from 3 and 90.2 percent from the line. The 3-point shooting is the difference between him being guardable and him being a viable No. 2 on a serious team once Paolo is back. After shooting about league average his first two seasons, Wagner made just 28.1 percent of his 3-pointers last season. It was a massive and confusing regression. It didn’t deter the Magic from giving him a max contract extension this summer. Now, he’s showing that faith in him looks pretty good. GO DEEPER Hollinger: Franz Wagner is writing his All-Star origin story 📉 Detroit Pistons (7-11): Remember how we celebrated the Pistons for being on the way up last week? Welp! That’s not so much the case anymore. After being on the verge of .500 for the first time this late into the season since 2018, the Pistons lost three straight games to Chicago, Charlotte and Orlando. To add literal insult to injury, the Pistons lost Cade Cunningham to a hip injury after he had a hard fall at the end of the Hornets loss. Hopefully, it’s not serious and he’ll be back any game now. The Pistons are about league average defensively so far under J.B. Bickerstaff, but their offense has really come up short. It’s all relative, as it’s not anywhere close to approaching last season’s disaster, but the Pistons have to feel a little deflated here. 📈 San Antonio Spurs (9-8): I was a little skeptical about putting the Spurs into this going into Saturday night’s game, even though I really like what we’ve seen out of them recently. Then, they rallied to beat the Warriors. Their three wins this week are over the Thunder, Jazz and Warriors. That’s a great run for a team missing Victor Wembanyama for two of those wins. San Antonio is now above .500 on the season and has the league’s eighth-best defense. Rookie Stephon Castle looks really good and comfortable out there on both ends of the floor. The Harrison Barnes pickup has been tremendous for them. One month into the season, there is so much to marvel at and celebrate. We’re seeing unreal individual performances, historic starts, dramatic storylines and, unfortunately, so many injuries. We’ve even had a great start to the second inaugural NBA Cup (more below). One of the bigger stories I keep seeing other people talk about, hear from friends and colleagues about, and can’t take my eyes off of is the imbalance between the Eastern and Western conferences. It’s almost alarming how big the gulf is. Advertisement Any of my friends who have allegiances to Western Conference squads will often lament the tough start of their team or a bad stretch for their beloved franchise, only to then exclaim what their positioning would be in the East. For friends of mine who root for a team in the East, almost any alarming moment or slow start will eventually get tagged with, “At least it’s the East and we have plenty of time to recover.” It makes me wonder how Pelicans fans feel just 17 games into the season, when their 4-13 start looks like they should already begin doing some scouting of Duke and Rutgers games. Then, you have Philadelphia 76ers fans watching an incomprehensibly bad start (3-13), but they could very easily talk themselves into being right in the mix when they finally get healthy. Both the Sixers and the Pelicans have been decimated by injuries throughout their rotation. And yet, the Sixers know they can recover to make the top six in the East. The Pelicans hope they haven’t lost too much ground for just competing for a Play-In Tournament spot by April. The West is 44-25 against the East so far. Here are more facts about the two conferences: Eastern Conference Western Conference As you can see, we’re almost talking about the difference between the big leagues and the minor leagues when it comes to how disparate these team conferences are. We expect teams like Philadelphia, Milwaukee and Miami to get their acts together. Maybe the Pacers will, as well? What about the Hawks? Outside of reaching with Atlanta, things in the East are mostly set for which teams will be good and in the postseason. That’s not the case in the West. Let’s do a little thought exercise here. If the season ended today, we’d be shocked that the 2024-25 season didn’t even make it to Thanksgiving. Once we got past that massive abrupt stop to the season in this hypothetical, we are presented with the NBA deciding it’s only fair to eliminate conferences and go find the best 12 teams with an eight-team Play-In Tournament format. This is how that would look: 1. Cleveland Cavaliers | 17-1 2. Boston Celtics | 14-3 | 2.5 games back Advertisement 3. Golden State Warriors | 12-4 | 4 games back 4. Oklahoma City Thunder | 12-4 | 4 games back 5. Houston Rockets | 12-6 | 5 games back 6. Los Angeles Lakers | 10-6 | 6 games back 7. LA Clippers | 11-7 | 6 games back 8. Orlando Magic | 11-7| 6 games back 9. Denver Nuggets | 9-6 | 6.5 games back 10. Memphis Grizzlies | 10-7 | 6.5 games back 11. New York Knicks | 9-7 | 7 games back 12. Phoenix Suns | 9-7 | 7 games back ———— Play-In Tournament —————- 13. Dallas Mavericks | 9-8 | 7.5 games back 14. San Antonio Spurs | 9-8 | 7.5 games back 15. Minnesota Timberwolves | 8-8 | 8 games back 16. Miami Heat | 7-7 | 8 games back 17. Sacramento Kings | 8-8 | 8.5 games back 18. Milwaukee Bucks | 8-9 | 8.5 games back 19. Portland Trail Blazers | 7-10 | 9.5 games back 20. Atlanta Hawks | 7-10 | 9.5 games back The Pacers and Nets have the same record as the Hawks and Blazers, but they’d miss out on tiebreakers with the Blazers being 1-0 against Atlanta, the Nets being 0-1 against Atlanta, and the Hawks having a better conference record than the Pacers. We’ll pretend those are the tiebreakers in this dystopian, conference-elimination hypothetical. Maybe we’re getting too in the weeds on this now. The point is, the Blazers have a chance at the postseason in this scenario. So many East teams do not. Maybe things will start to even out over the next month or four. Who knows? This just feels like one of the most extreme chasms we’ve seen between the two conferences. People have been wondering which Western Conference squad will be moved East if the NBA eventually adds Seattle and Las Vegas in expansion. Eventually, someone is going to start poking around the idea that the NBA needs to eliminate conferences for playoff purposes. The league has always been resistant to that because of tradition and logistics. The West has to hate that. We’ve had four NBA Cup nights so far, and we’re using this space to update what each group in the East and West is looking like. That’s just in case you’re still a little confused by this relatively new ordeal. Reminder: Each group consists of five teams, and they will all play four games in group play. The winner of each group moves on to single-elimination for the NBA Cup, along with one wild card from each conference (based on record and point differential as the top two tiebreakers). Also, overtime periods do not count toward the point differential. We didn’t have those numbers accurately last week because of it, but it has been corrected. Advertisement Driver’s seat: Orlando Magic (2-0, plus-37), New York Knicks (2-0, plus-14) Lingering: Brooklyn Nets (1-2, minus-16) You’re basically out: Philadelphia 76ers (1-2, minus-9), Charlotte Hornets (0-2, minus-26) What’s happening with this group? The Hornets and 76ers are effectively out because of tiebreakers. This is likely all going to come down to the Knicks and Magic game on Dec. 3. Assuming the Knicks beat Charlotte and Orlando beats Brooklyn, they’ll both be 3-0 in group play when they face off on the Knicks’ orange court. The Magic have a big advantage for getting through as the wild card, if they lose that possibly 3-0 matchup against New York. That plus-37 point differential is big right now. The Knicks need to blow out the Hornets. Games this week: Knicks at Hornets on Friday | Magic at Nets on Friday Driver’s seat: Milwaukee Bucks (2-0, plus-26), Detroit Pistons (2-0, plus-4) Lingering: Miami Heat (1-1, plus-13) You’re basically out: Toronto Raptors (0-2, minus-18), Indiana (0-2, minus-25) What’s happening with this group? The Pistons were in the driver’s seat, and now we see the Bucks pull ahead of them because of point differential, after double-digit wins over the Raptors and Pacers to start their group play. If the Bucks beat the Heat on Tuesday and the Pistons beat the Pacers on Friday, then we’ll have a 3-0 showdown between Milwaukee and Detroit on Dec. 3. If the Heat beat the Bucks on Tuesday, then they get thrust into the mix for winning the group. Miami would need some help via Detroit losing its final two group games, since the Pistons beat them already. Indiana will not be the NBA Cup darlings again this season. Games this week: Bucks at Heat on Tuesday | Pistons at Pacers on Friday | Raptors at Heat on Friday Driver’s seat: Atlanta Hawks (2-1, minus-1), Boston Celtics (2-1, plus-14) Lingering: Cleveland Cavaliers (1-1, plus-15), Chicago Bulls (1-1, minus-4) You’re basically out: Washington Wizards (0-2, minus-24) What’s happening with this group? Despite having a better point differential, the Celtics are behind the Hawks because Atlanta beat Boston to tip off group play. However, both teams will be playing to advance in their final respective games on Friday. If the Hawks win, they win the group. If the Celtics win, they either win the group with an Atlanta loss or they could win the wild card if point differential helps them in that way. If the Cavs win over the Hawks, they need the Bulls to beat the Celtics. If the Bulls beat the Wizards and the Celtics, they need the Hawks to win against Cleveland and they get the group. The Wizards, as always, are already out. Advertisement Games this week: Bulls at Wizards on Tuesday | Cavs at Hawks on Friday | Celtics at Bulls on Friday Driver’s seat: Houston Rockets (2-0, plus-49) Lingering: LA Clippers (1-1, minus-5), Portland Trail Blazers (1-1, minus-14), Minnesota Timberwolves (1-1, minus-14) You’re basically out: Sacramento Kings (0-2, minus-16) What’s happening with this group? This one is pretty simple. If the Rockets beat Minnesota on Tuesday, they win West Group A outright. Nothing else matters after that. That means the Clippers and Blazers need to up their game to try to win the wild card. If the Wolves beat the Rockets and the Clippers on Friday, they’ll win the group as long as Portland loses one more game. The Clippers can win the group if they win out and the Rockets lose both of their remaining games. Same for Portland. Games this week: Rockets at Wolves on Tuesday | Clippers at Wolves on Friday | Kings at Blazers on Friday Driver’s seat: Los Angeles Lakers (2-0, plus-11) Lingering: Oklahoma City Thunder (1-1, plus-10), San Antonio Spurs (1-1, plus-1), Phoenix Suns (1-1, minus-8) You’re basically out: Utah Jazz (0-2, minus-14) What’s happening with this group? No offense to the Spurs and the Jazz, but the fate of this group will be decided by the Lakers this week when they play their two toughest group play opponents: Phoenix and OKC. The Lakers have never lost an In-Season Tournament/NBA Cup game. The Suns look very vulnerable right now, but the Thunder still look very formidable without Chet Holmgren. If the Thunder beat the Lakers on Friday, they’ll have a chance to win the group at home against Utah on Dec. 3. The Suns can win the group if they win out and OKC loses a second game. If the Spurs win out, they need the Lakers to lose two for them to win the group. Games this week: Spurs at Jazz on Tuesday | Lakers at Suns on Tuesday | Thunder at Lakers on Friday Advertisement Driver’s seat: Golden State Warriors (3-0, plus-12) Lingering: Dallas Mavericks (2-1, plus-41), Denver Nuggets (1-2, plus-2) You’re basically out: New Orleans Pelicans (1-1, minus-38), Memphis Grizzlies (0-2, minus-17) What’s happening with this group? The Warriors have already won the group! It doesn’t matter what happens in their game against Denver because they have a win over Dallas. Dallas is in great position to take the wild card thanks to its point differential. If the Mavs beat Memphis, they’ll probably snag the wild card. It depends on the Thunder, Spurs, and Lakers in their remaining games, as they have positive point differentials. The Pelicans could grab the wild card if they win their final two group play games by about 100 combined points.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"How Steve Cooper's time at Leicester came to an end: A disconnect between manager, squad and fans",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5944299/2024/11/25/steve-cooper-leicester-sacking/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 14:00:33 GMT","Leicester have not moved far from the position they were in last summer, when Cooper was appointed - they cannot make the same mistake again","EPL He knew what the brief was and that he had to get results in the next block of games after the November international break, but Steve Cooper did not see his sacking as Leicester City manager coming so soon. After Saturday’s 2-1 home defeat against Chelsea, the 44-year-old had conducted his usual post-match media commitments and entertained his opposite number, Enzo Maresca, and the visitors’ coaching staff, who also met with their previous club’s hierarchy for a reunion following the game, before travelling back to his family home in Wrexham, north Wales. Cooper stays in his flat in Nottinghamshire during the week when working, so this was respite time with his loved ones before planning commenced for Saturday’s trip to London to play Brentford. Advertisement Cooper was blissfully unaware that Leicester’s owner Aiyawatt ‘Khun Top’ Srivaddhanaprabha had not seen enough progress over the first 12 games of his reign and had decided a change of leadership was required, with avoiding relegation from the Premier League this season so critical. As always in these situations, it was director of football Jon Rudkin who delivered the news, to Cooper’s astonishment. But the choice of the club hierarchy to remove him so quickly has been questioned by some after 10 points from 12 games, which included matches against Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal, Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur. The manager was not the only one surprised by the club making the change so soon. The vast majority of the Leicester squad left almost immediately after the Chelsea game to board a flight to the Danish city of Copenhagen for their annual Christmas party. They were not due to return to training until Tuesday. The players have been travelling to Denmark’s capital at this time of year since 2015, during Leicester’s shock Premier League title-winning season, where they wear fancy dress during the first day’s festivities before partying again on the second night. It was unfortunate timing for photographs to emerge showing some, including Conor Coady and Harry Winks, partying in Copenhagen nightclub Museo as the news of Cooper’s sacking was announced. In the images, there is a sign being held up reading: ‘Enzo I miss you’. It is not known who produced the sign, but it was perhaps naive for the players not to know they may be photographed near it. The lingering connection between the players and Maresca, who left to join Chelsea last summer after leading Leicester back to the Premier League at the first attempt in his only season in charge, was a major problem for Cooper as he tried to teach a different brand of football to a group that had the Maresca way, a method they enjoyed, drilled into them last year. Many of the players, especially the ones who had embraced and profited the most from the former Manchester City assistant’s incredibly structured style of play, struggled to get to grips with his successor’s approach, which afforded them much more freedom and called for more personal responsibility in decision-making, especially in the final third. Players who were key to Maresca’s style, such as Jannik Vestergaard, Ricardo Pereira and even Winks, were left out of the side by the Welshman on occasions. Cooper struggled in particular to foster a relationship with Vestergaard. Advertisement Some players noticed a huge change from Maresca’s methods and did not take to Cooper’s, even growing frustrated at times. He was seen as a good guy by the players and they were supportive of what he was trying to do, especially Jamie Vardy, who took a deep interest in the tactics of Cooper’s approach, especially how Leicester pressed the opposition, but they just didn’t believe in his approach as much as they had Maresca’s. This raises questions about how it was decided Cooper was the best fit for the job at the end of the summer’s hiring process. There was no lack of effort from the players, as their ability to fight back in games, most notably when they came from two goals down at half-time to win 3-2 away against Southampton, showed, but there was still scepticism among some of them about their game plan in the Premier League. Still, both the squad and Cooper expected him to be given more time, but time was the issue for the club. It wasn’t just players that Cooper struggled to connect with at Leicester, but the supporters and even some staff, too. A section of the fanbase, still angry and demanding some accountability for Leicester’s previous decline that brought relegation at the end of the 2022-23 season, were not happy with the appointment. Even after the only home league win under Cooper, against Bournemouth on October 5, the manager, his staff and players were surprised that the stands emptied so quickly as they conducted their lap of honour. He was also shocked by the reaction of the away supporters to his team’s performance in a Carabao Cup at fourth-tier Walsall a couple of weeks earlier, where they sang “Cooper, sort it out”, “Premier League?, we’re having a laugh”, and “This is embarrassing” as the match ended goalless before Leicester won on penalties. Some fans, who also did not completely buy into Maresca’s style of play, struggled to see what the identity of the team was meant to be under Cooper and what the direction of travel was, despite the transitional period Leicester were in. Having felt they waited too long to make a managerial change in that relegation season two years ago, the club decided they were not going to make the same perceived mistake again. Brendan Rodgers, the man in charge then, had been backed like no one before at Leicester and they considered him an elite manager. He had delivered, most notably winning the club’s first FA Cup, but it was obvious during that 2022-23 campaign that there was only one direction of travel. Advertisement While Leicester had picked up 10 points from their first 10 games this season, no disgrace for a newly promoted side, the disconnect between manager, fans and players was evident. There was also a growing concern at board level at Cooper’s tendency to challenge Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) and the officiating of Leicester’s games, compounded by his post-match comments following the loss to Chelsea on Saturday when he was convinced his team should have had a second-half penalty for Wesley Fofana’s challenge on Stephy Mavididi. Having won their controversial PSR (profitability and sustainability rules) case against the Premier League relating to the 2022-23 season in September, Leicester did not want to rub too many of the authorities up the wrong way and Cooper was asked to tone his bullishness down — there might be bigger battles to fight later on. This was the overriding reason, according to sources at the club, who spoke anonymously to protect relationships, that Leicester have decided to act now, because of the incredible importance of retaining their Premier League status. Cooper may not have been first choice to replace Maresca when Leicester’s Championship-winning manager left to join Chelsea a year into what was meant to be a long-term project, but everyone wanted the appointment to work. Khun Top had run out of patience waiting for No 1 target Graham Potter, the former Brighton and Chelsea boss who they had long admired and tried to recruit previously, to commit. Others had also stalled at the chance to take over the task of re-establishing Leicester in the Premier League, particularly because of the looming prospect of a points deduction for a predicted PSR breach, a spectre that also hampered their efforts to strengthen the squad, meaning they missed out on main targets and recruited late in this summer’s window. Cooper met with the club on two occasions to discuss the role and his enthusiasm for the challenge convinced them he would be a good fit. Their commitment also led to them bringing in his backroom staff at some cost — especially a substantial buyout clause for chief analyst Steve Rands from Cooper’s previous employers, their East Midlands neighbours Nottingham Forest. Rands and assistant Alan Tate have now left the club with Cooper. They also backed him with a gross spend close to £80million ($100m at the current exchange rate) — nearly £50m net after the sale of midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, their player of the year for last season, to Chelsea. Cooper approached his new gig with gusto. After being sacked by Forest amid Premier League relegation worries last December, which hit him hard, he took time away from the game to reevaluate his career, spending time on managerial philosophy courses and looking at data on where he stood among the game’s modern coaches. He felt ready to return to the touchline when Leicester gave him the opportunity. Advertisement His appointment surprised many, including Leicester’s players, who had expected someone with a similar approach to Maresca to be brought in. It was the same with many of the supporters, who still saw Leicester as the club that had been challenging for European qualification three years running under Rodgers before that disastrous relegation campaign and considered them still an attractive proposition for a high-profile manager, however realistic that view actually was. Cooper was himself taken aback at the reaction of some Leicester fans to his connection to their local rivals Forest. The question was still lingering: was Cooper, though a good coach with recent experience of keeping a promoted team in the Premier League, the right fit for this particular club? In truth, it was a marriage that seemed doomed to fail from the outset. Leicester’s promotion last season, when the EFL — the league made up of the three divisions below the Premier League — was convinced they were breaching PSR and tried several times to impose sanctions, has left a bitter legacy. Their success in their legal case has compounded that feeling and brought even greater determination from both the Premier League and EFL to ensure Leicester conform to the game’s financial regulations, however badly and ambiguously they are written. Relegation straight back to the Championship next May would be a disaster for Leicester, with the EFL waiting to impose sanctions such as a business plan and points deductions for any breaches. The next step will be crucial. With the Potter ship seemingly having sailed, there are admirers of Ruud van Nistlerooy internally at King Power Stadium following his recent stint in interim charge at Manchester United and previous time as manager of Eindhoven-based Dutch side PSV. David Moyes is available after leaving West Ham at the end of last season, but seems an unlikely appointment. But with the pressure of Leicester’s situation, who would want to take the challenge? When the club sacked Rodgers in early April 2023, they found many of the targets they approached about taking over were not interested in the potential of sullying their CVs with Leicester’s looming relegation. They ended up appointing former Brentford and Aston Villa manager Dean Smith as a short-term fix more than a week later after exhausting other avenues, leaving him with little time to try to turn things around. Advertisement The club also have to file their accounts for the 2023-24 season by December 31, with the EFL predicting they will have breached financial rules. Leicester have not moved far from the position they were in during the summer, when a lengthy recruitment process led to them deciding that Cooper was the man they needed. They cannot afford to make the same mistake again. (Top photo: Michael Regan/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Such is life for the New York Giants. New season, same problems, though at least there’s no more wondering about Daniel Jones’ future. That’s been decided. Advertisement Still, the Giants are facing many of the same questions they faced last year — at quarterback certainly, but perhaps the biggest is regarding their leadership structure. As they are mired in a 2-9 season and amid a six-game losing streak, it’s more than fair to wonder: Are general manager Joe Schoen and coach Brian Daboll still the right people to be leading this franchise into the future? Should they be in charge of picking the team’s next starting quarterback? Last year around this time, an overwhelming majority of voters showed support for the Schoen-Daboll regime. When asked whether Daboll should return in 2024, 96.6 percent of responders voted “yes.” When asked the same question about Schoen, 95.3 percent of responders were in favor. And finally, when asked what level of confidence (scale of 1-5) fans had that the current regime could turn things around, more than 60 percent responded with a vote of 4 or 5. Maybe we’re wrong, but we don’t think it will be quite so one-sided this year. We’ll find out. Before you cast your votes, we just wanted to say thank you in advance for your participation.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Breaking down Winnipeg Jets a quarter of the way into 2024-25: What I think and what I know,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5944318/2024/11/25/jets-nhl-season-analysis-scheifele-power-play/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 13:40:56 GMT","How much of Winnipeg's start is for real, and what's realistic to ask of the Jets as their season faces its first major test?","NHL The second chapter of Winnipeg’s season is going to be a little more turbulent than the first. The six-game, 10-day road trip the Jets are on now was always going to be a challenge, but Dylan Samberg’s broken foot adds another layer of complication. It was unlikely Ville Heinola would be capable of top-four minutes in his first full NHL season even if he’d been healthy and gaining experience this whole time. It seems wishful to think Heinola is capable of filling the void Samberg leaves behind after two months of absence and two games of AHL action. The same applies to Logan Stanley, who is travelling with the team but hasn’t played since Nov. 9 due to a “mid-body” injury. Advertisement Fine, then. A little bit of adversity can be good for a team that’s won as many games as the Jets have early in the season. What should we expect? How much of Winnipeg’s start is for real, and what’s realistic to ask of the Jets as their season faces its first major test? To answer those questions, I thought it was time to take a different approach. Here’s what I think — and what I know — about the Jets a quarter of the way into 2024-25. Winnipeg is one of only six teams in NHL history to start a season with 17 wins in its first 20 games. Yes, they lost to Nashville in Game 21, but the Jets’ accomplishment deserves to be celebrated: Only five teams have ever started a season this well. Not “in the salary-cap era.” Not “post-expansion.” Ever. Most of those teams went on to remarkable accomplishments. The 2022-23 Boston Bruins set a record for most points in an NHL season (although they lost to Florida in the first round of the playoffs). The 2012-13 Chicago Blackhawks won their second Stanley Cup in four seasons and would go on to win their third Cup just two seasons later. The 2005-06 Ottawa Senators only went as far as the second round, which is certainly disappointing, but if you’re willing to go back nearly 100 years — because that’s what it takes to match an accomplishment so rare — the 1925-26 Senators went to the Cup Final, as did the 1929-30 Bruins. And that’s the whole list. The problem with comparing Winnipeg to teams throughout history is that the NHL has changed its shape, size and rules in striking ways over the last century. Those 1926 Senators played before the league allowed forward passes, for example, while the 1930 Bruins played before the league had sorted out its definition of offside. Whatever, you might say. Winning 17 out of 20 games is incredible no matter what the rules are at a moment in history. Sure, I might retort. But the NHL used to end tie games with actual ties, making any wins-based record easier to achieve since 2005-06 than before the shootout reigned supreme. Advertisement And then you’d talk about the salary cap, parity and Winnipeg’s overtime wins — they didn’t even need a shootout, you might say — and we could go back and forth. I just don’t think the best 20-game start to a season defines greatness. If the 1987-88 Edmonton Oilers or 1976-77 Montreal Canadiens didn’t do it, then it’s probably more an exciting piece of trivia than the definition of all-time excellence. What I hope, dear reader, is that you’ve arrived at this point of my argument thinking, “Do you know how ridiculous it is that you’re splitting hairs while comparing these league-leading Jets to the greatest dynasties in NHL history?” I do know that. My hope throughout all of this is that we can all appreciate a remarkable run without assuming it means more than I think it means. Nobody talks about the 2006 Senators anymore, but the 2025 Jets still have the opportunity to be a team you’ll never forget. I think the energy people spend tripping over themselves to define exactly what Winnipeg’s start means comes from people’s need to establish expectations. The Jets have accomplished X early this season, so we can likely get ourselves ready for Y down the stretch or in the playoffs. The problem with that approach is hockey is beautiful chaos. It balances moments of spectacular speed and skill with brutal physicality. Players grind and battle for large portions of the game, fighting for the few feet of space that allow skill to take over — and, even then, enough goals go in off of shin pads, through traffic, and as a direct result of the chaos that skill is often outshone by determination and by luck. Imagine treating force of will and sheer chance as equals in any other sport. It’s madness, but in hockey, we see some games won because teams are better, others because they worked harder and others still because the right player hit the wrong side of the post. A hockey season’s story gets written in real time but can only be understood afterward. If the Jets demonstrate resilience in the second half, avoiding some of the problems that have plagued them in recent seasons, and put together a playoff performance worthy of celebration, we will look back at this beginning as if it was always foundational to that success. If they falter, they were always an autumn darling at best. Advertisement Revisionist history is unfair but unavoidable in sports. In an effort to avoid that, here is what I know about the Jets: They have perhaps the best goaltender on the planet. Their power play (33.9 percent) is operating at greater efficiency than the best full-season power play of all time (Edmonton, 2022-23, 32.4 percent). A quick numbers paragraph: At five-on-five, they take the ninth-most shots and give up the 11th-most shots, balancing out to a slightly above average 50.9 percent. I’m not terribly concerned that they’ve turned that into a 46-34 lead in five-on-five goals. Connor Hellebuyck and Eric Comrie have provided some of the best goaltending in the league, yes, but their combined .931 at five-on-five isn’t any better than what Winnipeg has gotten for the past three years. Put another way, I don’t think it’s fair to expect Hellebuyck to regress toward league average; I expect Hellebuyck’s numbers to regress toward Hellebuyck’s average — which, as it turns out, is excellent. The Stanley Cup trumps all else, and I say this as a mathematically inclined person who understands that a playoff series is so fast and such a small sample size that puck luck plays an enormous role. The biggest glory of NHL hockey comes from the Cup. Legacies are defined by whether or not players have lifted the Cup. That reality isn’t changing. But you have to be able to enjoy the moments along the way — and Winnipeg has provided a ton of them. Gabriel Vilardi has been taking an awful lot of faceoffs lately: five against Florida on Tuesday, 16 against Pittsburgh on Friday, 14 against Nashville on Saturday. Scheifele, who is still averaging 16 faceoffs per night, took only two each against the Penguins and Predators. It seems reasonable to wonder if Scheifele is battling something right now, especially after Scott Arniel played coy in response to Mike McIntyre’s questions on the subject in Pittsburgh. “Gabe’s really good at faceoffs,” was how Arniel explained it in Pittsburgh, after a pause. He was right — Vilardi won 12 of 16 faceoffs against the Penguins and then eight of 14 in Nashville — but this is a curious development. Vilardi took 59 faceoffs last season. Advertisement To be clear: This is speculation. Scheifele scored a hat trick against Florida on Tuesday and his ice time hasn’t taken a notable dip. I just think it’s a situation to watch, given Scheifele’s importance to the Jets and his potential to play for Team Canada at the 4 Nations Face-Off in February. Scheifele, Kyle Connor and Vilardi were outscored at five-on-five last season and badly outshot, leading to legitimate questions about how they stacked up to other top lines in the NHL. When they were outscored 9-5 and outshot 79-58 through the first 10 games of this season, it seemed as though Winnipeg’s top line was headed for a humbling five-on-five scoreline. Arniel stuck by his stars and the results have been excellent. The trio has won the flow-of-play battle more often than not, outshooting opponents 74-67 and beating them 9-4 in real goals since the 10-game mark. They’ve gotten the puck out of their own zone more effectively and shown better execution at their blue line. Defensive effort has seldom been in question — even in tough outings like Winnipeg’s 5-0 loss in Florida. The Jets don’t need Connor, Scheifele and Vilardi to be threats for the Selke Trophy. They do need them to win their minutes. They’re doing that now while continuing to score on the power play, which vindicates Arniel’s confidence in them. Meanwhile, the Jets’ second and third lines are dominating on the scoresheet, with Adam Lowry’s and Vladislav Namestnikov’s lines combining for a 24-8 lead in goals. In some ways, Winnipeg’s top-line struggles gave Arniel the perfect opportunity to assert himself as head coach. He values his top line, believing in them to win their minutes on a consistent basis against the game’s top players. I have no doubt Connor, Scheifele and Vilardi are Plan A and I see the logic in it, given the consistency of Winnipeg’s other lines. But it’s not always perfect. Sometimes, there are stretches of poor puck management. Arniel hasn’t gone as far as to start a game with reorganized lines but hasn’t been afraid to mix things up mid-game when things aren’t working. I think there’s a balance to walk between demanding accountability from a team’s top players and making sure those top players have bought in on the big picture. A gentle “that wasn’t good enough, here’s a new look” at key moments — while also going back to the big guns and working alongside them in meetings, as Arniel has done — has been a solid approach. We’ve been through this already. The Jets’ power play has shown an ability to attack from all areas of the ice this season. They don’t reset to the same guy in the same spot every time; instead, players have options whether they’re at the top of the zone, below the goal line or on either flank. Winnipeg’s power-play puck retrievals have also been furiously effective this season. The speed at which the Jets attack loose pucks and get those pucks back onto attackers’ sticks has been a treat to watch. Advertisement The Jets are scoring on roughly one out of every four shots they take on the power play right now. Even the best power play in league history managed “only” a 19.7 percent shooting percentage over a full season. The Jets are cruising near 24 percent right now and let’s be real — they’re good, but cold streaks can happen at a moment’s notice. In one example Jets fans won’t hate too much, last year’s Toronto Maple Leafs went from the seventh-best regular-season power play to a horrible 4.8 percent efficiency against Boston in the playoffs. Special teams help win series, but Stanley Cup champions need to be great five-on-five teams, too. There are going to be tough stretches this season. Winnipeg’s current road trip was already going to be a challenge before Samberg broke his foot. The Jets will need to be able to absorb the tough times and stay in the fight. Their goaltending and power play are as good as it gets in the NHL. They’re also a strong five-on-five team, although not the league’s best. This variety of ways to win should help insulate the Jets when their power play goes cold or the bounces just aren’t going their way. The Panthers scored 45 five-on-five goals en route to their Stanley Cup last season, taking 1,130 minutes to do so. They added 15 on the power play in 140 minutes with the man advantage. Both goals they scored in their decisive Game 7 victory came at even strength, as did 17 out of 18 goals they scored in the Stanley Cup Final. This is an extremely anecdotal way of making a point that most readers will probably already understand. Still, it seems worth noting Winnipeg’s torrid start does leave room for improvement. NHL Edge data shows Winnipeg isn’t in the top half of teams in terms of offensive zone time at even strength. The Jets are also spending more time in their own zone this year than last. The Jets’ odds of a playoff spot are stratospheric. It’s still going to be a heck of a ride. (Top photo: James Carey Lauder / Imagn Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

De Bruyne is out of contract in the summer and had been planning to speak to the club about his options in recent weeks, but has not started a match since the Champions League meeting with Inter in September. Advertisement “I honestly don’t know,” he said when asked about a new contract. “I knew talks would happen but I unfortunately had the (injury) against Brentford and I put everything to the side, I thought I would be out for two or three days but I ended up being (out) for eight or nine weeks so for the moment I want to get better first and see how I am. “The rest will come, I am not too obsessed with it but there’s not a lot to say. I’m fine, I’m happy, I just want to play good football again and the future we’ll see. “I had a conversation already in the summer but then obviously I had the injury so I was not in the right frame of mind to speak about that, I really want to be back where I need to be on the pitch, be myself again. There’s no rush also so I’m comfortable with my situation, I just want to play football. I’m not really worried.” The 33-year-old revealed that he sustained a problem against Brentford on September 14 that he originally expected to keep him out only for two or three days, but ended up being unable to put any power in his shots. “Every time I would shoot the ball I would get a lot of pain,” he added. “I was trying to find methods to get my power back but it took a long time to get better and actually it only got better on Friday, I can’t explain it, I don’t know why, and now the last few days it’s been better.” City manager Pep Guardiola, who himself signed a new contract with the club this month, emphasised De Bruyne’s importance but said his decision on his future had to be in the best interests of the player and the team. “I don’t know. That is up to Kevin,” Guardiola said. “Whether that is the end of the next one, or the next one, or the next one. Like David Silva, he will decide when is best for him and the team. He will not want to be in the position where he can’t play every three days. When he’s available, he has to play.” City return to action with a Champions League tie against Feyenoord on Tuesday.

A video circulating on social media appears to show Keane telling the fan to “wait in the car park” in a heated exchange between the pair. Advertisement Sky are aware of the footage and are working with those who were on the ground to understand how the incident unfolded. The video shows collection of supporters gathered at the front of the West Stand at Portman Road, directly in front of the pitch-side Sky Sports broadcast desk and as Keane approached one supporter can be heard shouting: “You’re a better pundit than you are a manager”. Keane walked up close to the face of one fan and appeared to repeatedly tell him: “Wait in the car park”. “Wait in the car park and we’ll discuss it,” the former Manchester United midfielder said. “I can’t hear you. I’ll wait for you in the car park. Wait in the car park”. Keane was escorted away by a member of staff, while the supporter was told to “calm down”. Fellow Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp can then be heard saying: “Just leave it”. Ipswich have been approached for comment. The incident is not the first time Keane has been confronted by a supporter while working as a pundit. In June, Scott Law was found guilty of common assault after headbutting the former Republic of Ireland international during a match between Arsenal and Manchester United in September 2023. He was sentenced to a community order of 80 hours of unpaid work and handed a football banning order of at least three years. Sky subsequently provided extra security for pundits following the incident at the Emirates Stadium, judging the needs of each match on a game-by-game basis. Keane was part of the Sky Sports punditry team for Sunday’s 1-1 draw at Portman Road alongside Redknapp, Izzy Christiansen and Kelly Cates. The fixture saw him return to Ipswich, a club where he spent 18 months as manager between 2009 and 2011. Following Keane’s appointment, Ipswich were among the favourites for promotion ahead of the 2009-10 season, having previously led Sunderland to the Championship title. However, they failed to win a league match until the end of October and finished the season in 15th. Keane departed in January 2011 after winning 28 of his 81 matches in charge and has subsequently said it was a mistake to take the job, telling The Overlap in 2021 his biggest career regret was “probably going to Ipswich”. GO DEEPER How Keane was discovered in Cobh - the Titanic's last port of call Speaking at full time on Sunday, the 53-year-old said of Ipswich: “Gradually over the last month or two, they have got better. And that’s what you want from your team, that’s what United will want from the team over the next few months. “Can they get improvement from the team, and adapt to the demands, physically, mentally? And when you look at Ipswich today, tactically they looked decent, they looked like they can deal with the ball and their fitness levels looked pretty good. Put that in the mix and that’s a good place to start.” Advertisement United had led 1-0 inside two minutes at Portman Road through Marcus Rashford before Omari Hutchinson equalised with a deflected strike from the edge of the area, as Ruben Amorim had to settle with a point from his first game in charge. “No (there’s not enough players of consistent quality),” Keane said of United. “And that’s a big problem. In this team for the last year or two, it’s all about moments. We saw with the first goal you thought great start, bit of quality…  but then United just sat back. What are you waiting for? Ipswich are a team near the bottom. Go after them. “Do I believe this group of players have the ability to start getting United back to the top four, top five? Absolutely not. The evidence isn’t there. New manager, new bounce, it’s all very positive. But when the game starts it’s the same old stuff.” GO DEEPER Amorim's first Man Utd game: Emotion, ideas and 'too much thinking' (Top photo: Michael Regan/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Advertisement He missed the La Liga defeat at Real Sociedad four days later and was also sidelined for Saturday’s draw against Celta Vigo. The club initially diagnosed a grade 1 ankle sprain before putting a two to three week estimate on his recovery. Yamal is working his way back to full fitness but is yet to return to training with team-mates and won’t be part of the matchday squad on Tuesday night. GO DEEPER Barca briefing: Needless mistakes, Casado red card and Yamal's absence felt again Barcelona manager Hansi Flick said he was hopeful Yamal would be available to return for Saturday’s La Liga fixture against Las Palmas. Asked how much his team will miss the Spain international, Flick said: “His quality is very good. He controls the ball, creates space, gets away from the opposition… I hope this is the last game he misses. He’s better now. I think he’ll be an option on Saturday or he’ll be on the bench. We’ll see.” Prior to his injury Yamal, who only turned 17 in July, had featured in every game for the club this season. Inigo Martinez echoed Flick’s sentiment, adding: “We know his importance. He gives us a lot. hH pushes back the rival’s line, he generates a lot of fear… he is vital and important. But that doesn’t mean that whoever comes on won’t be up to the job. Anyone is capable. But Lamine is Lamine and we don’t have him. “But whoever comes in will give no less. It’s not because of him that we will win or lose. We focus on the players we have.” Barcelona are also expected to be without left-back Alejandro Balde for Tuesday’s Champions League fixture. Flick explained Balde missed the weekend’s draw with Celta Vigo due to a muscular injury and was unlikely to feature against Brest. “He had some muscular problems from a few days ago,” Flick said. “He didn’t play. He’s better today. He won’t be an option for tomorrow.’ Barcelona sit sixth in the Champions League league phase after three wins from their four games so far. Saturday’s draw and Real Madrid’s victory over Leganes on Sunday means Barcelona lead La Liga by four points with Carlo Ancelotti’s side having played one game fewer.

Salah, who has scored 223 goals in 367 games for Liverpool since arriving from Roma in 2017, could sign a pre-contract agreement with a club overseas from January 1. Advertisement “We are almost in December and I haven’t received any offers yet to stay in the club. I’m probably more out than in,” he told reporters following his match-winning double in Sunday’s 3-2 victory at Southampton. “You know I have been in the club for many years. There is no club like this. But in the end it is not in my hands. As I said before, it is December and I haven’t received anything yet about my future. “I love the fans. The fans love me. In the end it is not in my hands or the fans’ hands. Let’s wait and see.” Asked if he was disappointed that he hadn’t received an offer at this stage, he added: “Of course, yeah. I’m not going to retire soon so I’m just playing, focusing on the season and I’m trying to win the Premier League and hopefully the Champions League as well. I’m disappointed but we will see.” Senior Anfield sources insist that discussions with Salah’s representative Ramy Abbas have been positive and remain ongoing. It was a situation that sporting director Richard Hughes inherited following his appointment earlier this year with captain Virgil van Dijk and vice-captain Trent Alexander-Arnold also out of contract next summer. Salah’s age, his status as Liverpool’s highest paid player and the club’s need to plan for the future meant that a swift resolution was always unlikely. The 32-year-old has been heavily linked with a lucrative move to the Saudi Pro League in recent years. Liverpool turned down a £150million bid from Al-Ittihad in 2023 but Salah refused to be drawn on the ongoing interest from Saudi. “I don’t want to speak about that. I am focused with the team now,” he said. GO DEEPER ‘I'm more out than in’: What Salah's latest comments mean for his Liverpool future Salah’s preference is to remain at the highest level in Europe and he is showing no signs of slowing down. He has provided 12 goals and 10 assists in 18 appearances for Liverpool in all competitions this season. “I’m very professional. Everybody can see my work ethic,” he said. “I’m just trying to enjoy my football and I will play at the top level as long as possible. I’m just doing my best because this is who I am and I try to give it all for myself and for the club.

After the other international breaks we struggled against (Nottingham) Forest and Chelsea. I’m glad that we managed to win after being 2-1 down,” Salah added. “I’m just playing my game. trying to chill and relax and just play. The whole team has the chemistry now with the new manager.

Graham, 36, was ruled out in the fourth quarter after getting chipped on the elbow. After the Eagles’ dominant win, he told reporters he cried during a phone call with his wife and children but said he felt content. Advertisement “I know that the guys still need me, as far as just making sure that I’m watching them, telling them stuff, little stuff I see on the sideline. And man, I’m just (gonna) be the best leader I can be ’cause I’m committed. I’m all the way in, and we got something special here, man. We gotta keep building it. We ain’t done nothing yet,” Graham said. He added that although he hates to go out this way, he has no regrets. “I’m hoping we hold that trophy regardless in the end. And like I say, I’m gonna do my part as far as a captain. And the mission’s still the mission. And I’m still gonna be me. Still gonna have fun, still gonna talk my stuff. Like I say, people know me. I’m done. But they better know somebody coming right behind me.” Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said he “wasn’t ready” to comment on Graham’s status and took a more optimistic tone than the defensive lineman. “Love him,” Sirianni said. “One of my favorite guys I’ve ever been a part of, been able to coach. We’ll see where it is. Again, I’m not ready to talk about it yet. We’re holding out hope.” Graham has been with the Eagles since they selected him with the 13th pick of the 2010 NFL Draft. His strip-sack of Tom Brady in the final minutes of Super Bowl LII clinched the Eagles’ first championship and cemented Graham in Philadelphia sports history. GO DEEPER Eagles Esoterica: Brandon Graham remembers his sacks Before exiting against the Rams, Graham recorded one sack, three quarterback hits, two tackles for loss, a pass breakup and two tackles. Teammate Saquon Barkley, who was the star of Sunday’s win thanks to a career performance, heaped praise onto Graham after learning of his injury. “I’ve only been able to be his teammate for such a short period of time, but I felt like I’ve known him for my whole life. He’s the reason why this transition for me has been so easy — him along with all the other guys. It’s cool to have a vet like that, to be able to talk to him about anything. I remember OTAs, sitting in the sauna, and we were just talking about life and getting to know each other. The energy and the passion that he brings, not only to his team but to the city,” Barkley said. “He epitomizes what it means to be a Philadelphia Eagle.” (Photo: Gus Stark / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

It’s not finished.” Getty Images A late touchdown salvaged Cooper Kupp's stat line tonight, finishing with eight catches for 60 yards and a score.  Prior to his 27-yard touchdown catch with 1:07 remaining, Kupp had seven catches for 33 yards.  That's just 4.7 yards per reception.  Getty Images Without DeVonta Smith (hamstring) in the lineup, all eyes were on A.J. Brown and he showed up in a big way.

Getty Images When healthy this season, Puka Nacua has been utterly outstanding for the Rams. He finished tonight with nine catches for 117 yards, showing off his versatility both as a route runner and a playmaker after the catch. Since returning to the lineup in Week 8, he now has 100+ yards receiving in three of five games.

Barkley rushed for a career-high 255 yards on 26 carries and added two touchdowns, solidifying Philadelphia’s 37-20 win over the Rams on “Sunday Night Football.” Advertisement The Eagles (9-2) used a second-half burst, beginning with Barkley’s 70-yard touchdown run in the opening minutes of the half, to get ahead of the Rams with a two-score advantage. While Philadelphia and Los Angeles exchanged scores over the next couple of drives, the Eagles maintained their lead. The Rams (5-6) had a chance to cut into Philadelphia’s double-digit, third-quarter advantage but a missed field goal stymied a comeback effort. SAQUON BARKLEY IS UNREAL 💥 This run gives him 255 rushing yards, surpassing his previous single-game rushing high of 189 yards. 🎥 @NFL pic.twitter.com/pUvihtCfZE — The Athletic (@TheAthletic) November 25, 2024  Philadelphia gained momentum in the first half by recovering a first-quarter fumble and kicking two field goals. While trailing by one point early in the second quarter, Philadelphia retook the lead on an A.J. Brown touchdown reception to give the Eagles a 13-7 lead at the half. A TD run by Kyren Williams was the Rams’ lone scoring play in the first half. Barkley is in the MVP conversation. This matchup marks his seventh 100-yard game of the season. He totaled a career-high 302 yards from scrimmage. Barkley’s 70-yard touchdown run on the first play of the second half gave the Eagles a two-score lead the Rams never overcame. His 72-yard touchdown run set the final score. The running back’s impact on the success of this team is immense. It’s reached the level of the quarterbacks who’ve dominated the NFL’s MVP honors for the last 12 years. The last non-QB to win was Adrian Peterson in 2012. Barkley should at the very least be considered to break that streak. — Brooks Kubena, Eagles beat writer Like this if you love Saquon Barkley.RT this if you love Saquon Barkley.Reply that you love Saquon Barkley.@saquon | #FlyEaglesFly pic.twitter.com/0h0Whzyn49 — Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) November 25, 2024  It’s tough for a team to climb out of a hole of its own making, and the Rams dug themselves deep on Sunday night. They turned the ball over on their first possession (Williams’ fourth fumble of the year) and netted minus-6 (yes, minus-6) yards over four second-quarter drives. They also allowed a 70-yard touchdown from Barkley on the first play of the third quarter. Advertisement Missed tackles particularly in the second and third levels and another big Barkley game (302 total yards — 255 rushing, 47 receiving) were the story of the day for the defense. The Eagles had 407 yards of offense with about five minutes left in the fourth quarter. By the time the clock hit 2:44 in the fourth quarter, Barkley had notched another 72-yard rushing touchdown and the Rams had allowed 316 net rushing yards as the Eagles closed in on 500 yards of offense. — Jourdan Rodrigue, Rams senior writer  The Eagles’ defense has been dominant during their seven-game win streak. The Rams are just the latest team they’ve destroyed. After surrendering 8.8 yards per play on their first two drives on the field, the Eagles held the Rams to negative-six yards on their four possessions leading into halftime. The Eagles sacked Matthew Stafford five times. They forced four fumbles and recovered one. Defensive coordinator Vic Fangio is expertly at the controls of a talented unit that’s reaching maturation. Nakobe Dean is an effective blitzer. Cooper DeJean defended yet another third-down stop. Brandon Graham clobbered Stafford on a punt-forcing sack (though the veteran said after the game he’s done for the season due to a torn tricep. Coach Nick Sirianni said the team is holding out hope.). Isaiah Rodgers has showcased the depth of the secondary, replacing Darius Slay yet again after the starting cornerback exited the game with a concussion. — Kubena ISAIAH RODGERS 🤝 NAKOBE DEAN Yep, that ball is OURS! pic.twitter.com/aJHYbotT2J — Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) November 25, 2024  Sirianni is managing one of the hottest teams in the NFL. There were some sloppy moments on Sunday night. The Eagles were 0-for-2 on their first two red-zone opportunities. Three penalties thwarted their second try. Sirianni and offensive coordinator Kellen Moore weirdly called a fourth-down draw that gave the Rams a final Hail Mary just before the end of the first half. That’s all easily forgotten baggage. This team has the offensive talent and defensive dominance to apparently erase any error. Sirianni entered the season on the hot seat. At this point, it’s only opposing sections of box scores that are feeling the heat. — Kubena Advertisement For the offense, it was a complete inability to deal with the pressure Fangio sent to hassle Stafford. Even though they largely rushed with four, when they did send extra rushers they bowled back skill players in blocking roles. Against the Eagles’ typical defensive fronts the Rams devoted extra attention to dynamic defensive lineman Jalen Carter, but he still made his presence felt as the game continued and other rushers (such as Graham) easily won in multiple spots including around the right side against backup right tackle Warren McClendon. Even some of the movement the Rams created horizontally and vertically with their run-blocking strategy on their first touchdown drive was countered by Fangio and his aggressive defense as linebackers and defensive linemen adjusted to fill those spaces. Rams coach Sean McVay found himself in an all-too-familiar place against the veteran defensive coordinator: With a bottled-up run game and offense overall, and a quarterback hassled too often to sustain drives That Eagles fans overwhelmingly filled SoFi Stadium on a night the Rams as a franchise paid tribute to its Legends community only added to the embarrassing showing — a night where, for all the glitz of Prime Time, the Rams showed they can’t truly hang with the big boy teams this season. — Rodrigue (Photo: Ronald Martinez / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Led by the two designated players that joined their team this offseason, the Galaxy return to the conference final for the first time since 2014. Gabriel Pec scored twice, including the opener in the first minute of the game, and Joseph Paintsil added a pair of goals to lead LA to a 6-2 win over Minnesota United on Sunday night. Forward Dejan Joveljić added two goals, as well, in the win. IMMACULATE AURA AT THE DIGS ✨@JoveljicDejan bags a brace! pic.twitter.com/zF6PeW4v8U — LA Galaxy (@LAGalaxy) November 25, 2024  The Galaxy spent approximately $20 million on transfer fees for Pec and Paintsil this offseason as they looked to return as one of the MLS elite. LA finished in 13th place out of 14 teams in the West last season and missed the playoffs. The failures led to an overhaul in the front office — Will Kuntz was promoted to general manager last December — and a refresh on the field. Advertisement The results were immediate. In a postseason in which most of the top seeds have been eliminated, the Galaxy are the last of any of the top-three-seeded teams in either the Eastern or Western Conference to move on to their respective conference final. “Pleased with the performance. It’s a tricky game after 23 days since the last game,” Galaxy coach Greg Vanney said. “The guys were great. We gave them some time off and then tried to build up and find the right moment to be at our best tonight and we were pretty good. I’m really happy with these guys, I’m proud of them. Some really good attacks, obviously six goals is a lot. … I’m proud of these guys.”  (Courtesy of Jeff Rueter / The Athletic) The Galaxy gave the sellout crowd something to cheer about almost from the first whistle. After a quick turnover in midfield, Riqui Puig played a beautiful outside-of-the-foot curling pass out to Pec on the right wing, and the Brazilian did what he has done all season, beating his defender and scoring for a goal in the first 30 seconds. TURN THIS TV ON 🗣️ Gabriel Pec puts away our first within minutes of kickoff! pic.twitter.com/U5YrW9t9Eh — LA Galaxy (@LAGalaxy) November 24, 2024  Minnesota equalized in the sixth minute on a ridiculous goal by Kelvin Yeboah, who hit a screamer into the upper corner. The Galaxy reclaimed the lead in the 18th minute on a header from Joveljić off a cross from Marco Reus. Paintsil got his first of the night in the 37th minute to push the lead to 3-1. Minnesota United pulled one back before halftime on a penalty from Yeboah, who got a chance to retake after his first poorly-taken penalty was saved only for John McCarthy to be ruled to be off his line. The Galaxy took control in the second half, especially as the game opened up. Pec had a magical solo run from inside his own half in the 50th minute to make it 4-2. Minnesota’s Jefferson Díaz was shown a second yellow in the 82nd minute and that gave the dangerous Galaxy attack even more space to work. Advertisement Paintsil added a second in the 86th minute and Joveljić closed it off in the 89th minute. Only two teams in MLS scored more goals than the Galaxy this season — Lionel Messi’s Miami and Columbus — and the multi-faceted attack has continued to be deadly in the playoffs. The Galaxy have now scored 15 goals across just three games this postseason. Next up: the Seattle Sounders, which downed crosstown rival LAFC on Saturday night. The Galaxy finished the regular season 13-1-3 at home and will host the conference final, looking for their first trip back to MLS Cup since winning the championship a decade ago. “This is a tough team that is super resilient and they know how to win, the playoffs are their thing,” Vanney said of the Sounders. “They’re a really good defensive team, they’ve got some really good attacking players, as well. We know we’ve got our work cut out for us. We’ll celebrate a little bit tonight and think about the Sounders as we go.” (Photo: Kelvin Kuo / Imagn Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Raiders QB Gardner Minshew suffers season-ending collarbone injury vs. Broncos,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5945175/2024/11/24/raiders-gardner-minshew-collarbone-injury-out-for-season/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 01:44:50 GMT",Aidan O'Connell will be designated to return to practice from injured reserve and could play against the Chiefs on Black Friday.,"NFL Las Vegas Raiders starting quarterback Gardner Minshew will miss the remainder of the 2024 season after suffering a broken collarbone late in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s 29-19 loss to the Denver Broncos. Coach Antonio Pierce confirmed Minshew’s season-ending status Monday. Helped by team staffers, Minshew headed to the locker room on Vegas’ second-to-last drive of the game with just over three minutes to play. He initially remained down on the field grabbing his left shoulder after being sacked by Broncos defenders Cody Barton and Jonathan Cooper. Minshew finished an overall sporadic passing day completing 25-of-42 attempts for 230 yards, a touchdown and an interception. Advertisement Pierce previously said during his postgame press conference that the injury “doesn’t look good” as the team awaited further testing to determine the full severity. After suffering their seventh consecutive loss Sunday, attention now turns to the Kansas City Chiefs, as the AFC West rivals will meet for a Black Friday matchup on four days rest. Pierce suggested after the game that Aidan O’Connell (thumb) could be activated from injured reserve and play against the Chiefs. On Monday, the coach went further than that and said that O’Connell will be designated to return to practice from injured reserve and will participate in the team’s walkthrough on Tuesday.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Josh Jacobs scores 3 TDs as Packers run over 49ers: Key takeaways,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5944064/2024/11/24/49ers-packers-score-result-takeaways/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 01:24:22 GMT",Green Bay running back scores his first three-touchdown game since 2022 as the Packers pick up their sixth win in seven games.,"NFL By Matt Schneidman, Matt Barrows and Cale Clinton The Green Bay Packers dominated the ground game against the San Francisco 49ers in a 38-10 win at Lambeau Field. The Packers (8-3) head into a shortened Thanksgiving week winning six of their last seven games, while the 49ers (5-6) slip into last place in the NFC West. Advertisement Green Bay finished the afternoon with 169 rushing yards — 87 of which came in the first quarter. Josh Jacobs led the way, rushing for 106 yards on 26 carries and posting his third career three-touchdown game. Green Bay finished a perfect five-for-five in the red zone, with Jordan Love connecting with Tucker Kraft and Malik Heath on touchdown passes. Love finished the afternoon 13-for-23 for 163 yards and two touchdowns. Josh Jacobs with his third rushing TD of the day ‼️ 🎥 @NFL pic.twitter.com/7lIsd4bt0P — The Athletic (@TheAthletic) November 25, 2024  With Brock Purdy out this week with a shoulder injury, the 49ers started Brandon Allen, who hadn’t had a regular season pass attempt since Week 9 of the 2022 season. Allen looked overwhelmed by the Packers’ defense, fumbling twice and throwing an interception to Xavier McKinney. Allen finished the day 17-for-29 for 199 yards and a touchdown. The 49ers also continued a troubling trend of penalties — tying a season-high with nine. San Francisco has had nine penalties against them in three of the last four games. It’s fair to say the Packers’ two marquee free-agent signings have panned out quite nicely. Sunday proved that yet again. McKinney intercepted his seventh pass of the season, tied again for first in the NFL with Detroit Lions safety Kerby Joseph. That takeaway set up Jacobs’ second of three rushing touchdowns on the day — all three came of the 1-yard variety. Jacobs had his third game with over 100 rushing yards for Green Bay, once again proving the Packers didn’t misstep in swapping him with Aaron Jones back in March. Jacobs led the way for an offense that scored its most points since the 2023 season opener in Chicago. — Matt Schneidman, Packers beat writer Wide receiver Romeo Doubs’ status for the Thanksgiving night game against the Miami Dolphins is in doubt after he was quickly ruled out with a concussion in the third quarter on Sunday. Doubs suffered the concussion while falling in the end zone after drawing a defensive pass interference penalty. Advertisement The third-year receiver had three catches for a team-high 54 yards on a team-high six targets at the time of his injury. All three catches converted third downs earlier in the drive on which Doubs got hurt. The Packers finished the drive with a 1-yard Jacobs touchdown run set up by Doubs drawing the penalty. With a short turnaround before playing on Thursday night, the Packers may have to rely more on receivers Dontayvion Wicks and Bo Melton if Doubs doesn’t clear concussion protocol in time. — Schneidman For the third straight game, the 49ers failed to get their vaunted running game going and finished with a season-low 44 rushing yards. That they fell behind 17-0 was certainly a factor. So was the fact that they were missing left tackle Trent Williams. But the big, explosive runs that were part of their repertoire last season and even in the first half of the current season have been absent recently. McCaffrey’s longest run in each of the last three games: 13, 11 and 9 yards. McCaffrey did have a 23-yard catch and run in the fourth quarter, but he fumbled at the end of the play. San Francisco’s longest run on Sunday was a 16-yarder by Jordan Mason in the third quarter. Just a few weeks ago, Mason was the NFL’s third-leading rusher. But as was the case in recent weeks, he had only cameo appearances on Sunday. He came out of the game a snap after his long run and came back late in the game when the score was 38-10. — Matt Barrows, 49ers beat writer The aggressive, Wide 9 defense the 49ers use is an effective front — if a team has the right personnel. And it was clear the 49ers didn’t have the right personnel along their defensive line on Sunday. Nick Bosa was out with a hip/oblique injury. Jordan Elliott left in the first half with a suspected concussion. Javon Hargrave (triceps) has been missing for most of the season. The result was a Packers running game that ran the ball at will. The 49ers pride themselves on keeping opposing tailbacks under 100 rushing yards. Jacobs had 91 yards at halftime — and finished with over 100 yards and three touchdowns — as little-known defensive linemen like Sam Okuayinonu, Kalia Davis and Evan Anderson swatted at his ankles but had trouble bringing him down. Advertisement Per Fox Sports, their 10 missed tackles in the opening quarter wasn’t just a first-quarter season high for them but for every team in the league. Those missed tackles helped create a hole the deleted 49ers could not climb out of. The last running back to go over 100 against the 49ers was  Jones (108 yards) with the Packers in the divisional round of the 2023 playoffs. — Barrows (Photo: Patrick McDermott / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The Seahawks secured a sixth straight win over their division rival and snapped the Cardinals’ four-game win streak to move, at least for the moment, into the driver’s seat of the NFC West. Advertisement A 35-yard Cardinals field goal in the second quarter gave this defensive battle its first points following a scoreless first frame. Back-to-back punts continued the stalemate, and the Seahawks received a needed shot of adrenaline courtesy of a 46-yard Jaxon Smith-Njigba reception that set the wide receiver up for a 3-yard touchdown. Seattle’s surging momentum continued after halftime on Arizona’s first possession, an eight-play series capped by cornerback Coby Bryant turning a Kyler Murray overthrow into a 69-yard pick six on fourth-and-1. COBY BRYANT PICK-6 IN SEATTLE! 📺: #AZvsSEA on FOX📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/xVFRwEbk70 — NFL (@NFL) November 24, 2024  As both defenses attempted to tighten the reins inside a rainy Lumen Field, a Cardinals interception in the end zone and a subsequent 22-yard field goal kept Arizona hanging around early in the fourth. But, it was Seattle that came away with the timely stops to keep the Cards at bay. A 50-yard Seahawks field goal essentially salted away the game before a missed 47-yarder by Arizona with 15 seconds to play officially closed the door on the Cardinals GO DEEPER Russini’s what I’m hearing: The day the Jets fell apart and the Broncos rallied, Belichick best fits With the victory, and the Los Angeles Rams’ loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday night, the Seahawks have the lead in the NFC West via head-to-head tiebreaker over the Cardinals. The Cardinals came into this game ranked seventh in points per drive with an offense that had been in a groove, with Murray leading the way playing the best ball of his career. On Sunday, Mike Macdonald’s defense held them out of the end zone and Murray threw a pick six on top of being sacked five times. James Conner, one of the toughest running backs to tackle, had just 8 yards on seven carries. Seattle completely shut down everything Arizona wanted to do save for getting the ball to tight end Trey McBride (12 catches, 133 yards). The Seahawks’ much-maligned defense has turned a corner, which is why for the time being Macdonald’s team holds first place in the NFC West. — Michael-Shawn Dugar, Seahawks beat writer Advertisement The offensive line has not exactly been a strength for the Cardinals, but it’s been pretty good. Especially since it’s operated most of the season down two starters. That changed Sunday. Right tackle Jonah Williams returned after missing nine games because of a knee injury. It mattered little. The Cardinals struggled to find an offensive rhythm and never scored a touchdown. Conner had little running room. Murray had little time, getting sacked five times. Coming off perhaps the best game of his career in a Nov. 10 win over the Jets, Murray finished 24 of 37 for 285 yards, but he also threw a pick six that gave Seattle a 13-3 lead. Murray was hit hard on a scramble in the fourth quarter that left him grimacing in pain, but he returned for the Cardinals’ final drive. Arizona’s only offensive bright spot: McBride had a career-best 12 catches, which set a franchise record for receptions in a game by a tight end. — Doug Haller, Cardinals senior writer Arizona played well defensively. Garrett Williams intercepted a Geno Smith pass in the end zone, saving a touchdown. Overall, the Cardinals gave up only one offensive touchdown, which was set up by a 46-yard Seattle pass play. But trailing 13-6 in the fourth quarter, the Cardinals couldn’t get off the field and gave up a 50-yard field goal that pretty much put the game out of reach. Arizona, which had won four in a row, lost out on an opportunity to increase its NFC West lead. The Cardinals remain firmly in the hunt, but Sunday’s loss revealed their slim margin of error, a factor that likely will not change. — Haller This is type of game-wrecking performance that explains Seattle’s decision to trade a second-round pick for Leonard Williams then pay him like one of the best defensive tackles in the league. Williams had four QB hits, 2 1/2 sacks and an additional tackle for loss on a run play, almost single-handedly throwing Arizona’s offense out of whack. This was Williams’ best game as a Seahawk and it couldn’t have come at a better time. — Dugar (Photo: Rio Giancarlo / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Bo Nix efficient again as Broncos complete season sweep of Raiders: Key takeaways,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5944059/2024/11/24/broncos-raiders-score-result-takeaways/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 00:58:33 GMT",Sunday marked Nix's third consecutive game with multiple touchdowns and no interceptions.,"NFL By Nick Kosmider, Vic Tafur, Tashan Reed and Chris Licata The good times kept rolling for Bo Nix and the Denver Broncos on Sunday, securing a 29-19 win at Allegiant Stadium to improve to 7-5 and sweep their regular season series against the Las Vegas Raiders for the first time since 2014. After trailing 13-9 at the half, Denver’s No. 3-ranked defense clamped down late as the Broncos posted 20 second-half points, highlighted by a pair of toe-tapping touchdown catches by Courtland Sutton, which accounted for both Nix’s touchdown passes in an efficient performance. Sunday marked the rookie’s third consecutive game with multiple touchdowns and no interceptions. Advertisement Now 2-9, Las Vegas has lost seven straight and will travel to Kansas City to take on the 10-1 Chiefs on Black Friday. They may need to do so without starting quarterback Gardner Minshew, who exited due to a left shoulder injury on the Raiders’ second-to-last drive. He was replaced by Desmond Ridder — who was strip-sacked on his second snap — and coach Antonio Pierce later said Minshew’s left shoulder “doesn’t look good.” Gardner Minshew goes to the locker room with an injury. The Broncos get to Desmond Ridder and recover the fumble. pic.twitter.com/LJ3bBnvnpS — NFL on CBS 🏈 (@NFLonCBS) November 25, 2024  Sutton said this week that he “probably need a thesaurus” to accurately describe how excited he’s been to watch his rookie quarterback grow this season. “It just brings me joy to be able to be a part of it, be able to witness it and be part of his journey,” Sutton said of Nix. The veteran wide receiver has played a huge role in Nix’s development. During the past five games he has caught 36 passes for 467 yards and three touchdowns, including two in Sunday’s win. The Broncos began the day 1-of-6 on third down. They converted five of their next seven attempts, and Sutton was the target on four of those plays. The pair has developed a clear trust that not only has helped vault Nix firmly into the Rookie of the Year race, but also has Sutton on pace for his first 1,000-yard season since 2019. — Nick Kosmider, Broncos staff writer Nix to Sutton x2! The @Broncos extend their lead in Vegas. 📺: #DENvsLV on CBS/Paramount+📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/tF3ZT9MdwT — NFL (@NFL) November 24, 2024  It’s been a brutal year for Minshew, and that only continued against the Broncos. He was incredibly inaccurate and completed just 59.5 percent of his passes. He not only missed badly on several throws downfield, but he was also well off-target on a handful of check downs. Even when he had a clean pocket, Minshew had issues putting passes on the money. And, often times, he was the primary culprit when the Broncos did get pressure. He frequently held onto the ball too long and ran into pressure on multiple plays. He displayed a lack of feel, awareness and confidence. Advertisement The Raiders led 13-9 at halftime despite Minshew’s poor play, but he wound up swinging the game in the opposite direction in the third quarter. After the defense forced a quick three-and-out to start the period, Minshew threw a terrible interception that gave the Broncos excellent field position. They took advantage by scoring a touchdown and took a lead that they wouldn’t relinquish for the rest of the game. The defense and special teams unit gave the Raiders every opportunity to beat the Broncos, but Minshew’s performance kept them from taking advantage. He’s already been benched three times this season, and it’s getting difficult to identify good reasons why the Raiders shouldn’t sit him for a fourth time after this one. — Tashan Reed, Raiders senior writer When Bonitto stripped the ball from Ridder late in the fourth quarter, the play sealed Denver’s win and gave Bonitto his 10th sack of the season. He became the first Broncos player since Von Miller and Bradley Chubb in 2018 to record double-digit sacks in a season. The Broncos were slow to get their pass rush going Sunday, but Bonitto’s pressure of Minshew on a second-and-long play early in the third quarter led to an interception by safety Brandon Jones that helped swing the game for Denver. The Broncos, who entered the day with an NFL-leading 39 sacks, had five sacks Sunday, including back-to-back takedowns after the Raiders took over at their own 30-yard line, trailing by a touchdown, late in the third quarter. — Kosmider The Raiders finally found a running game Sunday — despite being without injured backs Alexander Mattison and Zamir White — but decided not to use it in a close game. Tenth-year veteran Ameer Abdullah and practice-squad call-up Sincere McCormick averaged almost five yards a carry, but only combined to carry the ball 13 times. The Raiders, instead, leaned on the arm of Minshew, and it was off-target as usual. Despite Minshew’s shakiness, the Raiders managed to score a season-high 13 points in the first half. Hey … baby steps. Even with a four-point halftime lead, they only ran the ball five times in the third quarter (for 25 yards). — Vic Tafur, Raiders senior writer Advertisement A second straight season of relative good health has aided the Broncos in their push toward playoff contention, but they are now dealing with a pair of concerning injuries. Zach Allen, who has been one of the top defensive linemen in the NFL this season, suffered a heel injury during practice Friday and was unable to play in Sunday’s game. It was the first game Allen has missed since signing with the Broncos as a free agent ahead of the 2023 season. He had played 90 percent of Denver’s defensive snaps entering Week 12 and was tied for second in the NFL with 52 quarterback pressures, according to TruMedia. It is not immediately clear whether the injury will keep Allen out past this week. The Broncos also lost starting cornerback Riley Moss to a knee injury in the second quarter Sunday. Moss was attempting to help make a tackle when his knee appeared to get hit by Raiders tight end Brock Bowers. Moss, a 2023 third-round pick out of Iowa, has been a revelation at the outside cornerback spot opposite Patrick Surtain this season. He was replaced in the game by veteran Levi Wallace. “Fortunately, it wasn’t really serious with Riley,” Broncos coach Sean Payton said after the game. “It’s an MCL. I’m not going to give any (other updates). We’ll see how next week is. There was some thought that maybe he could go back in, so we’ll see where it’s at.” — Kosmider (Photo: Ian Maule / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The hosts walked away with a hard-fought 1-0 win to advance to the Eastern Conference final. Orlando City will face the New York Red Bulls in Orlando next Saturday. Orlando City scored in the 39th after center forward Ramiro Enrique pounced on a deflected ball inside Atlanta United’s penalty area. Enrique’s lunging shot beat Atlanta goalkeeper Brad Guzan from close range. Atlanta had spells of possession and even carried much of the momentum early in the second half. RAMIRO WITH THE SLIDING FINISH 🛝 pic.twitter.com/9L7fNfoW7n — Orlando City SC (@OrlandoCitySC) November 24, 2024  However, injuries to both of Atlanta’s strikers were challenges that interim manager Rob Valentino had to navigate. Jamal Thiaré exited the match in the 43rd minute with an apparent leg injury. His replacement, Daniel Ríos, was forced off the pitch after a head injury at the start of the second half. Valentino again tinkered with his tactics, moving winger Saba Lobzhanidze to a false 9 role. The chances for Atlanta increased, but Orlando stood firm in their defensive formation. Atlanta ended the match without a single shot on target. Advertisement For Orlando, the opportunity to earn their first-ever MLS Cup berth is now on the line. They had never qualified for a conference final until Saturday. Óscar Pareja’s side have at times looked the part of a contender. Inconsistent play and underwhelming outing have also been a characteristic of this Orlando team. Against Atlanta, Orlando put in a brave performance, securing a 1-0 win when history was not on their side. Atlanta’s remarkable run as the ninth seed and play-in match winner ended by the narrowest of margins. Their elimination was preceded by what many considered to be the biggest upset in MLS playoff history. Atlanta knocked out Inter Miami and Lionel Messi, the top seed in the East and the current Supporters’ Shield winners. This is the second straight year that a play-in team has reached and lost a conference semifinal. “I told (the players) I’m grateful for their effort and their work. It was tremendous. We’re not gonna stop until the whistle goes. But that is something that I would always like if I’m a coach anywhere. That’s a bare minimum, like, that’s the minimum requirement for a team that I want to be associated with,” said Valentino. The loss to Orlando means that Valentino’s stint as head coach will likely end. He has been in the running for the full time position, according to club president and CEO Garth Lagerwey. But it was understood that Valentino would need to reach the MLS Cup final and potentially win it to earn the job. Atlanta’s offseason of change will accelerate, as Lagerwey must hire a new manager and sporting director. The 1-0 loss also marked the end of Dax McCarty’s MLS career. Over the summer, the 37-year-old announced that he would retire at the end of the season.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"No. 5 UCLA upsets No. 1 South Carolina, snapping Gamecocks' 43-game win streak",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5944873/2024/11/24/usc-ucla-womens-basketball-takeaways/,"Sun, 24 Nov 2024 23:30:55 GMT",It is the first victory over a top-ranked team in 20 tries for UCLA in program history.,"NCAAW LOS ANGELES — South Carolina didn’t just come into Sunday’s contest against UCLA as the defending national champions. The No. 1 Gamecocks entered the matchup versus the fifth-ranked Bruins with a whole host of streaks on the line. The No. 1 Gamecocks had won 43 games in a row dating back to the 2023 Final Four against Iowa, and they owned 33 straight on the road (third-longest in Division I history). They had completed two straight undefeated regular seasons, hadn’t trailed by double digits at the half since Dec. 21, 2021, to Stanford, and hadn’t trailed by 20-plus at halftime since March 30, 2019, to Baylor. Advertisement All of those streaks came to a sudden end in Los Angeles, as the No. 5 Bruins took a page out of South Carolina’s playbook. The home team put together a defensive performance that would have made Dawn Staley proud en route to a stunning 77-62 victory. It is the first victory over a top-ranked team in 20 tries for UCLA in program history. For the first time in program history, @UCLAWBB has beaten a No. 1 ranked team 🤩#B1GWBBall x #B1GStats pic.twitter.com/7aPQjP6aKg — Big Ten Women's Basketball (@B1Gwbball) November 24, 2024  The Bruins feature one of the few lineups in the country that isn’t overwhelmed by South Carolina’s size. UCLA started two big guards in the backcourt (Elina Aarnisalo and Kiki Rice) and three towers in the frontcourt (Lauren Betts, Angela Dugalić and Timea Gardiner), all at least 6-foot-3, and it was the Bruins’ length that made the difference on defense. The Gamecocks couldn’t find any passing or driving lanes and had to settle for more jumpers than usual. They were scoreless through the first 5:07, had 10 points in the first quarter, and only 22 at the half. South Carolina’s defense kept things close through the opening stretch, and the Gamecocks trailed 4-2 at the time of their first bucket. But that’s when the UCLA bench trio of Janiah Barker, Londynn Jones and Gabriela Jaquez broke the game open; Jaquez nailed a 3-pointer off a kickout from Rice, then Barker went nearly coast-to-coast for an and-one, and Jones hit 3s on back-to-back possessions, giving the Bruins a double-digit lead that they would only briefly relinquish. It’s usually South Carolina’s depth that overwhelms opponents, but the Bruins ran eight deep and did not experience any drop-off. That allowed them to apply consistent physicality and ball pressure. The depth also enabled UCLA to play with pace on offense; the Bruins’ movement in the half-court created openings against a usually-stout Gamecocks defense, especially from deep. Six Bruins scored at least eight points, with Jones leading the way off the bench thanks to five triples. Advertisement The Bruins took a 21-point lead into intermission and maintained that margin the rest of the way. The only minor run South Carolina made was due to hot shooting from Te-Hina Paopao, as none of the Gamecocks’ bigs could find their footing against Betts and Barker. Betts had four blocks, including two truly disrespectful rejections of Chloe Kitts. South Carolina only attempted ten layups, an unexpectedly low total for a team averaging 45.6 points in the paint. For the first time in 43 outings, the Gamecocks now go back to the drawing board. They’ll fall from the No. 1 ranking for the first time since the 2023-24 preseason poll.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Vikings beat Bears in OT as Jordan Addison has career day: Key takeaways,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5943990/2024/11/24/vikings-bears-score-result-takeaways/,"Sun, 24 Nov 2024 22:40:04 GMT","The Bears got the ball first in overtime but were forced to punt, giving Minnesota the chance to win with a field goal.","NFL By Alec Lewis, Kevin Fishbain, Adam Jahns and Amos Morale III John Parker Romo’s 29-yard field goal in overtime gave the Minnesota Vikings a 30-27 win over the Chicago Bears on Sunday. Romo’s kick capped a 10-play, 68-yard drive that featured big connections from Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold to T.J. Hockenson, Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison, who finished with a career-high 162 yards and a touchdown. Advertisement Chicago forced overtime behind a wild final minute in the fourth quarter, as the Bears scored a touchdown, converted a two-point conversion, and then recovered an onside kick. In the final seconds of regulation, quarterback Caleb Williams found DJ Moore for a 27-yard gain to set up Cairo Santos’ game-tying 48-yard field goal. The Bears got the ball first in overtime but were forced to punt, giving Minnesota a chance to win with a field goal. VIKINGS WIN IN OVERTIME pic.twitter.com/2KieGMIIbq — NFL (@NFL) November 24, 2024  Last week, Jefferson, the Vikings’ superstar wide receiver, was asked how he would defend himself. His reply? Shut him down, make the other Vikings receivers beat them. That’s the approach the Bears took Sunday afternoon at Soldier Field, and Vikings No. 2 receiver Addison torched them. The second-year receiver finished with his career-high yardage on eight catches. He also hauled in his fourth touchdown pass of the season. Jefferson, meanwhile, caught only one pass for 7 yards during regulation. Addison displayed his entire skill set with the Bears focused on Jefferson. He snatched a 45-yard pass with Bears cornerback Terell Smith draped all over his back. His touchdown grab was also a highly contested catch. In the second half, Darnold found Addison on a crossing route, and Addison tightroped his way down the sideline for a 69-yard gain. He supplied the same level of explosiveness, route-running and ball-tracking ability that Vikings fans have become accustomed to from Jefferson. — Alec Lewis, Vikings beat writer Darnold delivered when the Vikings needed him most. He completed all six of his attempts in overtime and found Hockenson for a game-sealing 29-yard pass down the field. Darnold had exited in the fourth quarter after getting rolled up on his ankle following a pass. Advertisement In overtime, he was also shaking his hand. The toughness was emblematic of his entire season; Darnold has been on the injury report for multiple weeks with knee and foot injuries. The outing was also pretty emblematic of his career. He threw for 330 yards and two touchdowns on 22-of-34 passing, stringing together his second straight impressive game. It’s not all perfect. Inaccuracies surfaced at times, and he threw the ball into harm’s way over the middle of the field. All in all, though, Darnold produced when the Vikings needed him to, which is a theme in Minnesota’s 9-2 season. — Lewis The Bears have to lead the league in heartbreaking losses this season. A week after losing to the Green Bay Packers on a blocked field goal as time expired, the Vikings won on Romo’s 29-yard field goal in overtime. They’ve lost five games in a row, starting with the Hail Mary loss against the Washington Commanders. The Bears defense couldn’t stop Darnold in overtime. He found Hockenson wide open for a 29-yard gain to set up Romo’s game-winner. It was a wild game for the Bears. Safety Tarvarius Moore recovered an onside kick. But the Vikings blocked Santos’ 48-yard field goal attempt in the second quarter, and returner DeAndre Carter also muffed a punt. Two pass-interference penalties were called on cornerback Jaylon Johnson against Jefferson. Add it all up and the Bears are only good enough to scare their division rivals right now. — Adam Jahns, Bears beat writer The talk all week was about how the rookie quarterback Williams would handle Brian Flores’ defense. He passed the test, including a 27-yard strike to help set up overtime. The series in overtime included Williams’ worst play — taking a 12-yard sack — but overall, this was a good sign of progress. Advertisement This season has quickly turned into Williams’ development and progress being the priority, with the playoffs virtually out of the picture. For the second week in a row, Bears fans can feel better about the future because of Williams. He got the ball out quickly. He made some big-time throws on third down. He seemed calm in the hectic pocket. And he protected the football. The Bears would prefer to see his positive performance come in wins, but in a season like this, they’ll take a game like he had Sunday. Williams finished 32-for-47 passing for 340 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions. — Kevin Fishbain, Bears beat writer (Photo: Luke Hales / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Cowboys shock Commanders after chaotic 41-point fourth quarter: Key takeaways,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5944044/2024/11/24/commanders-cowboys-score-result-takeaways/,"Sun, 24 Nov 2024 22:25:07 GMT",A missed PAT by Washington's Austin Seibert let the Cowboys off the hook for allowing an 86-yard TD with under 30 seconds left.,"NFL By Ben Standig, Jon Machota, Saad Yousuf and Chris Licata The Dallas Cowboys outlasted the Washington Commanders during a chaotic second half on Sunday, winning 34-26 at Northwest Stadium after entering as double-digit underdogs. What started as one of the season’s sloppiest games turned into a 41-point fourth-quarter sprint highlighted by a Madden-like 99-yard kickoff return touchdown by Dallas’ KaVontae Turpin and a stunning 86-yard touchdown by Washington’s Terry McLaurin with under 30 seconds to play. However, the comeback effort was undone by Austin Seibert’s second missed extra point attempt. Plagued by special teams blunders all day, the Commanders (7-5) lost their third straight game after opening the season 7-2. NO GOOD. 📺: #DALvsWAS on FOX📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/FDg7wGy8KF — NFL (@NFL) November 24, 2024  All three phases contributed mightily to this loss. What’s going wrong with the offense will garner the most attention. After 10 days of whispers about what, if anything, is poor, the Commanders’ shoddy performance loudly raises more questions. Though 26 points are often enough to win games, Washington only had nine points with under four minutes remaining. Advertisement If there is one thing we’ve learned, it is that limited talent requires good health and execution for success. With Jayden Daniels impressively running the show, that recipe had Washington setting efficiency records early in the season. Those were the days. Running back Brian Robinson Jr. was in and out the lineup after a first-quarter ankle injury, and right tackle Andrew Wylie and center Tyler Biadasz were checked for concussions. Those absences — Wylie was ruled out — alone don’t explain the offense converting 4-of-12 third-down attempts or Daniels rarely finding any rhythm in the passing game against a defense that gave up at least 27 points in five consecutive games. Daniels’ final numbers were boosted by production on Washington’s final two drives after the Cowboys took a 20-9 lead with 5:16 remaining, though the 86-yarder to McLaurin was an epic play. That he ran for 74 yards and did so confidently may quiet some of the injury talk since his Week 7 rib injury. Then again, his passing numbers are down over the last month and Daniels’ longest completion was a mere 20 yards before the long strike to McLaurin. Is this another example of regression in offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury’s offense? Has Daniels hit a rookie wall? Have defenses adjusted to a group that lacks speed and playmakers? Those are among the questions everyone in town will ask this week. — Ben Standig, Commanders senior writer COMMANDERS 86-YARD TOUCHDOWN WOW 📺: #DALvsWAS on FOX📱: https://t.co/waVpO909ge pic.twitter.com/apaNEKNCkh — NFL (@NFL) November 24, 2024  The first half might’ve been the worst half of football I’ve ever watched. There was a blocked field goal, a field goal that hit the upright, a fumble, a wild snap and a blocked punt. The final two quarters were a lot better, especially for the Cowboys. However, the second half started with a kickoff that fell short of the landing zone. That’s a first. Advertisement Daniels, the favorite for NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, didn’t look special for most of the day. The Cowboys’ defense did its part most of the day. Cornerback Josh Butler was the defensive player of the game. He was targeted often and absolutely held his own, recording three passes defended, a sack and a team-high 12 tackles. And then there was the wild Turpin kickoff return TD late in the fourth quarter. This Cowboys team still isn’t very good, but apparently still better than the Commanders. If you’re Team Tank, this wasn’t the result you wanted. But the coaches and players are thrilled to end a five-game losing streak and get a win over Dan Quinn and several former teammates. — Jon Machota, Cowboys staff writer KaVontae Turpin goes 99 yards for the TD 🔥 📺: #DALvsWAS on FOX📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/IiHNVZAnt5 — NFL (@NFL) November 24, 2024  The Commanders’ defense was at bend-but-don’t-break levels for much of the game. While it held the Cowboys to three points before halftime, Dallas scored three times after halftime. Credit Cooper Rush with solid work, though facing a negligible pass rush helped. The Commanders accounted for one late-game sack and two quarterback hits. CeeDee Lamb didn’t throttle a secondary that has allowed gobs of production to opposing No. 1 receivers. However, Lamb was a reliable outlet for Rush, catching 10-of-12 targets for 67 yards. Washington acquired cornerback Marshon Lattimore for such matchups, but the four-time Pro Bowler missed his third consecutive game with a hamstring injury that began before the trade deadline move with the Saints. The trade for a player under contract through 2026 had near and long-term justifications. Washington’s staff won’t rush Lattimore back, but the defense needs him on the field, even if only to prep for this playoff push. — Standig Advertisement The two areas of the Cowboys that were most decimated by injuries when the game began were the offensive line and the secondary. In the end, those spots proved to be two of the more encouraging parts of the Cowboys’ win, their first in a month and a half. Left guard Tyler Smith is one of the best players on the Cowboys’ offense, and he missed the game due to injury, as did future Hall of Fame right guard Zack Martin. TJ Bass and Brock Hoffman filled in admirably in their place, as Rush looked as comfortable as he has since sliding into the starting role this season. On the other side, the player of the game for the Cowboys on defense was Butler. With Trevon Diggs out and DaRon Bland holding down the other side, the Commanders tested Butler throughout the game and the undrafted cornerback continuously answered the bell. With the Cowboys unable to get Diggs and Bland on the field together this season, the other outside cornerback spot has been a problem for the Cowboys. They tried rookie Caelen Carson in that role, but he got picked on relentlessly by opposing quarterbacks and was a healthy scratch on Sunday. Butler gave the Cowboys the answer they were looking for, and another player to build upon at the position for the future. — Saad Yousuf, Cowboys beat writer Washington’s special teams were anything but for much of the game. Seibert, a standout much of the season, missed the previous two games with a hip injury. He botched two extra points and a field goal in the loss. Dallas’ second kick return for a touchdown actually gave Washington a chance to tie with a touchdown and a two-point conversion, but the first one, coming after the Commanders pulled to 20-17, was brutal. — Standig (Photo: Patrick Smith / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Carolina (3-8) hosts the Tampa Bay Buccaneers next week. Steve Spagnuolo, the Chiefs’ longtime defensive coordinator, has a dilemma: He can no longer blitz the opposing quarterback as a luxury. Instead, Spagnuolo once again had to blitz Young out of necessity because the Chiefs’ defensive line was not dominant in clear pass-rushing situations. The problem is that the Chiefs still didn’t do enough to rattle Carolina’s quarterback despite a number of blitzes in the second half. Advertisement The Panthers recognized Spagnuolo’s blitzes and Young was able to consistently get the ball out to one of his receivers in a one-on-one matchup. Either Young’s pass was completed or one of the Chiefs’ defensive backs — nickel defender Chamarri Conner or cornerbacks Nazeeh Johnson or Trent McDuffie — committed a pass interference penalty to continue the Panthers’ drive that tied the game with less than two minutes left. Entering Sunday’s game, the Chiefs tied for 27th in the league with just 19 sacks. The Chiefs exited Bank of America Stadium sacking Young only twice. — Nate Taylor, Chiefs beat writer GO DEEPER Russini’s what I’m hearing: The day the Jets fell apart and the Broncos rallied, Belichick best fits It’s time to give some credit to first-year coach Dave Canales for his creative play calling. Both Canales and Young took huge steps Sunday against the two-time, reigning Super Bowl champion Chiefs and the NFL’s fifth-ranked defense (based on yards allowed per game). Canales has already named the second-year signal caller as his starter for Week 13. Young had one of the best games of his young career, showing poise in the pocket and touch on his passes. His 262 passing yards were the second-most of his career, trailing only a 312-yard effort against Green Bay last season. — Joe Person, Panthers beat writer Just before the season began, the Chiefs signed tight end Noah Gray, a fourth-year tight end, to a three-year, $18 million extension. The deal signaled that Gray would be a target for Mahomes after Kelce, the future Hall of Fame tight end, retired, whether after this season or the next. Since then, Gray has become perhaps Mahomes’ most reliable pass catcher not named Kelce. Running routes alongside Kelce, Gray led the Chiefs against the Panthers with two touchdown receptions, another impressive performance following his two touchdown receptions the previous week against the Buffalo Bills. Including Sunday’s game, Gray has recorded 27 receptions on 30 targets for a career-high 315 yards and a career-high four touchdowns this season. — Taylor Noah Gray's second TD of the day! 📺: #KCvsCAR on CBS/Paramount+📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/enVkvB5nWM — NFL (@NFL) November 24, 2024  The Panthers’ defense had a couple of big stops in the fourth quarter, but ultimately couldn’t contain Mahomes with the game on the line. After forcing its first two punts of the game on back-to-back possessions, the Panthers let Mahomes get loose for a 33-yard scramble that set up Shrader’s game-winning field goal. The defense still has its warts. Jaycee Horn and Dane Jackson both had rough games in coverage. But they may have found their pass rush: The Panthers’ five sacks of Mahomes were a season high, with Jadeveon Clowney notching 1 1/2 of them. — Person (Photo: Grant Halverson/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Miami (5-6) never trailed in the AFC East matchup and led by as many as 31 in the second half. Three touchdown passes from Tagovailoa in the second quarter — the first to tight end Jonnu Smith and two more to running back De’Von Achane — contributed to Miami’s 24-0 lead at the break. Tagovailoa added another touchdown pass to Jaylen Waddle — who had a season-high 144 receiving yards — late in the third to extend the lead to 31-0. Advertisement Tagovailoa’s 317 passing yards and four touchdowns were both season bests. Miami’s defense — which collected four sacks and a pair of turnovers — held New England (3-9) scoreless until early in the fourth, when Drake Maye’s 38-yard touchdown pass to Austin Hooper on fourth-and-15 ended the shutout.

Their 1-3 stretch without their starting quarterback set back their postseason aspirations, but suddenly the Dolphins are surging at the right time. A win Thursday night would level them at .500 and keep their wild-card hopes intact. This run has come on the heels of a great return for Tagovailoa. After missing four games due to his latest concussion, Tagovailoa has been on a tear and had another huge game Sunday against the Patriots. He completed 29 of 40 passes for 317 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions. (And that was all produced while being pulled early in the fourth quarter.) In his five games since returning, Tagovailoa has thrown 11 touchdown passes and completed more than 70 percent of his passes in each of those five contests.

How about the defense, which had no answer for an explosive Dolphins offense. The Patriots were totally overwhelmed and another dud from them highlighted just how big of an issue that side of the ball is as the rebuild nears offseason No. 2. Everyone knows the Patriots need offensive reinforcements this offseason, but the scary part is that help is badly needed on defense, too. Advertisement The secondary struggled all afternoon, with cornerback Marcus Jones and safety Kyle Dugger being especially bad. The defensive line wasn’t any better and never flustered Tagovailoa. A performance like this is going to raise questions about defensive coordinator DeMarcus Covington. So far, Jerod Mayo has been pretty hands-off as a head coach, preferring a CEO-type role. But if the defense keeps playing like this, Mayo may have to intervene. — Graff Not that the Patriots needed yet another reminder, but Sunday’s game was such a glaring example of their holes on offense. The offensive line was totally overwhelmed — with none worse than left tackle Vederian Lowe, who committed four penalties in the first half alone. Maye was under constant pressure. Meanwhile, the receivers struggled to get open and Maye was never in a rhythm, leading to his worst game in the NFL. There wasn’t just one culprit for this disaster, though. Everyone and every unit had something to do with just how bad that performance was, from Mayo on down. The Patriots thought they were building toward something and improving as the season went on. Now there are all sorts of questions for Mayo and his team after such a terrible game. — Graff (Photo: Megan Briggs / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

On Sunday, Thitikul — one of the LPGA’s fastest-rising young talents — took home the CME Group Tour Championship’s historic winner’s check with a late come-from-behind victory. An eagle-birdie finish put the 21-year-old one shot ahead of Angel Yin with a tournament total of 22-under par for her fourth career LPGA win. Advertisement Yin and Thitikul came into Sunday’s final round tied at the top at 15-under par, but Yin’s steady flow of birdies and bogey-free performance gave her a two-shot lead after the par-3 16th hole. But Thitikul, who earlier this week won $1 million for the LPGA’s Aon Risk Reward Challenge (a season-long competition on the tour’s riskiest holes), launched herself back into the tournament with a gutsy late-round charge. On the par-5 17th, Thitikul reversed the course of the tournament with her approach shot. She reached the green in two and drained a mid-range eagle putt to tie Yin, who failed to get up-and-down for birdie to maintain a one-shot lead. Thitikul’s iron game prevailed again on 18, when she took an aggressive line over the water hazard running down the left side of the hole, and stuck her shot to six feet of the flag. Yin’s attempt to catch her opponent resulted in a two-putt par from 25 feet. Thitikul drained her birdie putt for the victory. EagleBirdie In the most dramatic fashion 🤩 Watch every shot from @Jeeno_atthaya's final two holes en route to her victory! pic.twitter.com/IaGIeHBhAA — LPGA (@LPGA) November 24, 2024  “I don’t know what happened to me on 17 and 18,” Thitikul said during the trophy ceremony on the 18th green of Tiburon Golf Club. “I make a birdie on 17, giving me a good chance. Having eagle — it’s more than I can ask for. Hitting really, really good second shot on 18 and hole the putt, it’s just like all the hard work that I’ve had paid off.” The 21-year-old from Ratchaburi, Thailand, has been on a steady path toward LPGA stardom since joining the tour in 2022. Thitikul won twice in her rookie year, at the JTBC Classic and the Walmart NW Arkansas Championship, both in sudden-death playoffs. She then won the 2023 Vare Trophy for the player with the season’s lowest scoring average and took home this year’s Dow Championship title with partner Ruoning Yin, who was the third member of her grouping on Sunday. The LPGA played the final round of the championship in threesomes to ensure the tournament ended within the NBC coverage window. Advertisement Asked about what she would do with her lucrative $4 million winner’s prize, Thitikul said, “Definitely spend it.” Thitikul now boasts $6.1 million in 2024 earnings. Nelly Korda, the world No. 1 and winner of seven tournaments this season on the LPGA, will end the year with $4.3 million in earnings. Korda finished the Tour Championship in a tie for fifth place with Narin An at 15 under for the week. “It’s not a life or death, so I just give my 100 percent,” Thitikul said of the tournament’s final stretch. “If I win, it’s gonna be really good, but if not, it’s one tournament that I gave it 100 percent that I have.” (Photo: Michael Reaves / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

GO DEEPER The Briefing: Southampton 2 Liverpool 3 - Salah to rescue... but what happened at the back? And was it a penalty? He said: “I think my overriding feeling at the minute is the frustration and disappointment that the goals we concede are so poor. The quality of goals we conceded were so bad. I asked the guys to play quickly and forward as much as we could and then it’s the wrong time to do that because Liverpool have so many players in our final third and have spent a while there. We need to take the sting out of the game and manage that.  Advertisement “That is on me because I’ve asked them to do that and I need to make it even clearer on when and where to do that.

We have such a young team on the pitch. We are a team that is learning and growing, and the only way they are going to learn is by having moments like that.

Week 12 was the ninth time this season the Lions (10-1) topped 20 points and the third time their defense held an opponent to less than 10 points. Detroit’s latest standout showing of complementary football was led by second-year running back Jahmyr Gibbs, who made team history. With 99 scrimmage yards, including 90 on the ground, and two touchdowns, Gibbs became the third Lion (Billy Sims, Barry Sanders) to record 1,000-plus scrimmage yards and 10-plus TDs in his first two seasons. Advertisement Lions defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn’s unit again proved why it’s one of the NFL’s best. It limited Indianapolis to two first-half field goals on the Colts’ only two red-zone trips, the first of which came after a dropped touchdown. A slew of penalties on both sides and miscues throughout the game, coupled with Detroit forcing four punts and a turnover on downs in the second half, stamped an all-around difficult day for the Colts (5-7) and quarterback Anthony Richardson, who played admirably in his second game back under center. This was a strange game. The Lions’ offense struggled more than we’re used to seeing. The offense was well below its points average of 33.6, settling for just 24. It had to grind for everything, and it often wasn’t pretty. But the unit got the job done again. The defense held the Colts to just six points — three after the opening drive of the game — but avoided some big plays that were dropped or called back because of penalties. The Lions will take that eight days a week, but there’s plenty to clean up from a game like this one. With the win, the Lions improve to 10-1. They’ve won nine in a row. Next up: the Chicago Bears on Thanksgiving. — Colton Pouncy, Lions beat writer Several Lions players suffered injuries. Wide receiver Kalif Raymond was ruled out with a foot injury. Offensive tackle Taylor Decker suffered knee and ankle injuries. Cornerback Carlton Davis III suffered a knee injury. Running back David Montgomery suffered a shoulder injury. Decker was able to return to action, while Montgomery and Davis remained on the sideline, perhaps ready to go back in if needed. But still, this feels like a weekly occurrence. Injuries are certainly piling up, and it feels like they are the only thing that can slow the Lions down right now. It’s worth monitoring the status of several players heading into back-to-back Thursday games. — Pouncy Advertisement Richardson picked up where he left off last week and looked like a player who was in control of the offense, though he didn’t get much help from his counterparts Sunday. The second-year pro still had his share of errant throws, but he was also playing behind an offensive line that featured three rookies and was constantly under siege. Richardson wasn’t sacked but was hit six times and pressured even more. Richardson finished 11-of-28 passing for 172 yards. His best throw came on a 39-yard deep shot to Alec Pierce in the second quarter that put Indianapolis in the red zone with a chance to take an early lead. However, tight end Drew Ogletree dropped a walk-in touchdown two plays later, and Indianapolis settled for a field goal. Indy’s offense never recovered and finished with a season-low six points. Richardson is now 4-4 as a starter this season as Indianapolis suffered its fourth loss in five games. — James Boyd, Colts beat writer The Colts committed 10 penalties for a total of 75 yards, with several penalties negating their big plays. Indianapolis had gains of 30, 21 and 19 yards called back after being flagged. Despite starting three rookie offensive linemen, it was star left guard Quenton Nelson who violated the rules the most. He was flagged for being an ineligible man downfield, illegal use of hands and a false start. Richardson was also penalized for intentional grounding in the fourth quarter. Indianapolis’ 10 penalties are a season high and the second-most it has had in a single game over the last five years. Richardson led the Colts with 10 carries for 61 yards as the Lions swallowed up running back Jonathan Taylor. The 2021 league rushing champ totaled just 11 carries for a season-low 35 yards and had just one carry for 14 yards in the second half. — Boyd (Photo: Grace Hollars / IndyStar / USA Today Network) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Fairbairn culminated the bumbling drive by missing the 28-yard field-goal attempt. The Texans somehow got the ball back, but Stroud pulled a Dan Orlovsky and ran out the back of the end zone for a safety to clinch the Titans’ win. Having lost three of their last four games, you have to wonder if the Texans can energize themselves for more than a potential AFC South title. — Larry Holder, NFL senior writer SAFETY DANCE 🙏@Titans defense continues to make big plays pic.twitter.com/lUltpoQJFN — NFL on CBS 🏈 (@NFLonCBS) November 24, 2024  What can you make of the Titans’ second-year quarterback? I don’t know. He amassed a 146.5 passer rating in the first half, but absorbed seven sacks in the first 30 minutes. It’s almost impossible to achieve one with the other. In the second half, he had a poor throw that resulted in a Jimmie Ward 65-yard interception return. Then midway through the fourth quarter, Levis hit an easy throw to Chig Okonkwo and the tight end eluded a seemingly missing Texans defense for a 70-yard TD connection. Levis entered the game with some of the league’s worst QB advanced metrics statistics and rates. I’m not sure Sunday will make Titans fans feel like Levis is the quarterback of the future after the 2025 season. But he got the job done well enough (278 yards, two TDs, one pick) to help Tennessee upset Houston. — Holder (Photo: Tim Warner / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The Buccaneers (5-6) snapped a four-game skid, while the Giants (2-9) extended their losing streak to six games and have yet to win a home game this season. Tampa Bay faced little resistance from New York’s defense, scoring 30 unanswered points to take a 23-0 halftime lead. All four of the Bucs’ touchdown drives spanned at least 70 yards. Mike Evans led the Bucs in receiving yards in his first game back from a hamstring injury.

DeVito took four sacks and nine hits, and on the Giants’ first trip into the red zone, rookie running back Tyrone Tracy lost a fumble on first-and-goal to commit the Giants’ seventh red-zone turnover of the season. “It ain’t the quarterback,” Giants wide receiver Malik Nabers said following the loss. “Same outcome when we had DJ at quarterback. Take a look. It ain’t the quarterback.” Malik Nabers: “I know I’m tired of losing” Says it’s not the quarterback pic.twitter.com/CA6tH0r87x — Charlotte Carroll (@charlottecrrll) November 24, 2024  When asked what the answer is, Nabers responded, “I don’t know what it is, but I know I’m tired of losing.” The Giants were shut out for three quarters before they finally got on the board with a Devin Singletary touchdown. It was a continuation of their performance all season as the team came into Sunday scoring a league-worst 15.6 points a game. New York was especially lifeless in the first half, tallying 45 yards with 39 coming from just two plays. The team didn’t target Nabers until after halftime, when DeVito went to him on the first three passes of the third quarter. Advertisement Tracy struggled as well, fumbling in the red zone when the Giants finally got a drive going. It was his third fumble in the last two games. DeVito finished 21-for-31 for 189 yards in his season debut. — Charlotte Carroll, New York Giants beat writer Mayfield toyed with the Giants, completing 24-of-30 passes for 294 yards. Mayfield added 29 yards on four carries, including a 10-yard scramble for a touchdown. Mayfield hurdled Giants cornerback Cor’Dale Flott at the goal line to reach the end zone. He then popped up and emphatically mocked DeVito’s touchdown celebration. Mayfield was all over the field. He alertly dove on a fumble deep in the red zone in the second quarter and was downfield lead-blocking on a 56-yard run by rookie running back Bucky Irving in the fourth quarter. Mayfield’s connection with Evans picked up where it left off, as they connected five times for 68 yards in Evans’ return from a hamstring injury. The win snapped a four-game losing steak for the Bucs, who have a chance to go on a run against a soft schedule to close the season. Tampa Bay plays just one team with a winning record (the Los Angeles Chargers) in its final six games and sits a game behind the Atlanta Falcons for the NFC South divisional lead. — Dan Duggan, New York Giants beat writer Kayvon Thibodeaux returned to action after missing the last five games with a broken hand. Complicating Thibodeaux’s return was that outside linebacker Azeez Ojulari exited early with a toe injury and did not return. The Giants’ pass-rush impact was limited and they didn’t record a sack. They’ve had just one in the past three games. — Carroll (Photo: Elsa / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Leverkusen returned to form this weekend with a 5-2 Bundesliga win over Heidenheim, but remain nine points behind leaders Bayern Munich. Advertisement But, asked what the chances of Wirtz staying at the club were, Carro insists that they are: “Very high and why shouldn’t they be high? As long as he has a contract here, as long as he feels comfortable here, as long as he knows that he can play top football here and has a top team and can celebrate successes, then he is happy.” Wirtz, who has seven goals in all competitions this season, and provided an assist in the win over Heidenheim, has two-and-a-half years left on a contract due to run until 2027. While widespread interest has been reported in the playmaker, including from England and Spain, Leverkusen value Wirtz, 21, in excess of €100m. Carro has also flatly denied reports that Alonso, the head coach who led Leverkusen to an unbeaten domestic double in 2023-24, already has an agreement to leave the club in the summer. “What I can definitely deny — one hundred percent — is that there are any guarantees or agreements that I have heard in the media. “The thoughts of all the players, coaches, coaching staff, and management of the club are in the here and now. We have enough to do on the pitch until the end of the year. It often annoys me that there is such speculation. I can admit that. “But the here and now is important, nobody is interested in next season at the moment and nothing has been finalized. He has a contract for now.” Like Wirtz, Alonso has also been the subject of intense interest. He was Bayern Munich’s first choice for their vacant manager position last summer and was a candidate to replace Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool. Instead, he opted to remain at Leverkusen, where — after signing a two-year extension in August 2023 — his contract runs until 2026.

Subscribe to The Athletic on an exclusive offer here. GO FURTHER Ipswich Town 1 Manchester United 1 – That opening goal, Onana’s importance, what Amorim has to do Getty Images And Manchester United defender Diogo Dalot, speaking to BBC Sport post-match, said: ""I think a draw is probably a fair result because we could have done better. We could have controlled much more of the game especially after conceding the goal.  ""We had the spaces but couldn't find the moment to do it. If we are controlled with the ball we can be closer to winning the game."" ""We just need to be ready (to work under new boss Ruben Amorim). For the standard of this club we have to get information really quick.  ""We have only been together with the international players for two or three days so you have to give credit to everyone. He has impacted straight away. The way he transmits ideas is really clear. We just need to put it into practice now."" Advertisement Getty Images Ipswich goalscorer Omari Hutchinson, speaking to BBC Sport, said: ""I thought we showed good character and had a lot of chances. Their keeper made a lot of saves so I thought we could come away with a 2-1 or 3-1 win, but it is a good point in the end. ""It is frustrating to concede so early, a silly goal to give away. But we showed great resilience."" Discussing his goal, he added: ""Very happy. It is my dream come true. I have been working hard for that moment."" Talking to BBC Sport after the game, Kieran McKenna discussed facing the club where he was once a player and coach.  He concluded: ""Everyone knows my history with the club. But today was about Ipswich, the players and the supporters having Manchester United come to the stadium for the first time in 22 years and representing themselves really well."" McKenna added on BBC Radio 5Live: ""We have been pretty consistent across the twelve games. Considering where we have come from to only lose five of the 12 games is pretty good. ""We could have picked up more points for sure, the four draws at home we feel like we could have feasibly won all of them, one of them definitely if the decisions had been right. ""We are there and thereabouts. The players are improving. The season is long and there's still a lot of work to do."" Speaking to BBC Sport post-match, new Manchester United coach Ruben Amorim said: ""We worked on (the early goal) but they have the talent to do it, and then it is all about the players. ""We don't have too many centre-backs so we have to adapt some players. I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well. He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future. ""(The Premier League) is a great environment, a great spectacle. But when the game starts it is like I am back in Portugal or the third division. I am so focused everything is the same.  ""You guys are so lucky to have the best league in the world. I am really happy to be here but today I don't feel much because I like to win games."" Getty Images Kieran McKenna was very measured in the way he spoke to Sky Sports after the match. ""It was a blow conceding the early goal but, as the half went on, we grew in the ascendancy,"" he said. ""We were the dominant team in the first half and deserved to be going in at least level. ""In the second half, Man United had more control and it was difficult. We had to defend with real discipline and I thought we did that well. We didn't give up too many big chances. ""It was a competitive game, we could've won but we could have lost. You take the point and the positives and move onto next week."" Getty Images Ipswich captain Sam Morsy, speaking to Sky Sports post-match, continued: ""We showed a mix of things and we are disappointed not to get the win.  ""(Hutchinson) has got that quality, loads of those (shots) go in in training. He will score loads this season. ""We have good momentum and are getting better and better. The big thing is we keep improving and that is the culture of the football club."" Advertisement Getty Images Perhaps the best indicator of the Ipswich performance is that their captain, Sam Morsy, was frustrated to only come away with a point. ""We're disappointed not to get the win with the chances (we had),"" he told Sky Sports.  ""Their goalkeeper's made a couple of fantastic saves from close range. We did well, we had to show our resilience at the end. ""It's a point in the right direction."" Getty Images In his Sky Sports interview, Amorim was fed the statistic that his team's running stats were the second worst they had been this season and he discussed that. ""If you see the first half, we were a little bit afraid. (Morsy) was always alone and we had to jump on him then Hutchinson was always in dead space, Jonny Evans should have been pressing that guy,"" said the United head coach.  ""But when we haven't had training, it's hard. We had to two days, so they are confused and they stayed where they were. We have to understand the data, to see the data and to understand what happened in the game.  ""First, they have to understand the game then we have to be so much better physically to cope with the high pressure and volume of high-speed running. We need time to work on these things."" Are Ipswich the best bad team ever in the Premier League?  Every time I watch them they are convincingly decent and yet they have nine points. Getty Images Speaking to Sky Sports after the match, Ruben Amorim admitted he isn't thrilled with how many media duties he has. He complained: ""This week I spoke more (to the media) than I did in four years at Sporting.  ""I just want to work with my players.  ""Nothing more."" You're Manchester United manager now, Ruben... get used to it! Ruben Amorim was once again very clear on implementing his style to avoid a repeat of the same problems.  He was asked if his players were confused because they are being told to play in a different way. ""That's the reason, that's really it,"" he told Sky Sports. ""We have two options; we try to just win games and don't risk anything and I guarantee at this stage next year we would have the same problems. ""We will have problems, the players will be confused sometimes but we have to address the new idea and try to be better for this stage next year."" Advertisement Ed Sheeran go away, Amorim is talking tactics here!! Getty Images A very honest opening appraisal from Ruben Amorim when he spoke to Sky Sports after the match. ""It's a tough league. My players were thinking too much during the game, you could feel it,"" he said. ""They were thinking not just about the ball but where they were supposed to be. That is hard. We had all the team together for just two days. ""We needed more physicality. It was a tough match, we lost some balls without pressure. When you start a game like this, you have to control the ball and control the tempo of the game. We cannot do it at the moment but they tried. ""I know it's hard to understand for some (of the players) but they want this."" The statistics don't make particularly good reading for the visitors with the home side recording their highest expected goals (xG) tally of the season. Getty Images As well he might. The Manchester United goalkeeper made five saves today, two of them particularly excellent. Getty Images After 81 seconds, United fans were back on top of the world.  But, at full time, a familiar feeling of frustration lingered. It was the third time they have failed to win in the Premier League after scoring inside the opening two minutes.  In October 1995, they drew 2-2 with Liverpool at Anfield and they were thrashed 6-1 by Tottenham at home in October 2020. Advertisement Premier League The Premier League table still makes very unpleasant reading for Manchester United fans. They finish the weekend one place higher than they started it, but they are still only 12th and losing ground on the teams fighting for the European places. As for Ipswich, they remain in the bottom three but only on goal difference. Today's point sees them climb above Crystal Palace into 18th. Getty Images They might not have won at home yet this season and they are still in the relegation zone, but that was a top performance from Ipswich. These games aren't going to be the ones that define their season and playing how they did today will likely be more than enough to take points from the teams around them. McKenna's men are still very much a work in progress but they will have a real chance of staying up this season.  Here's the anatomy of that opening goal under Ruben Amorim. At just one minute and 21 seconds in, it is Manchester United's earliest goal of the season so far."

George Russell (Mercedes) won the race from pole, while Lewis Hamilton completed a Mercedes one-two. Carlos Sainz rounded out the podium for Ferrari, with Norris (McLaren) sixth. Norris did at least claim a bonus point for the fastest lap, ensuring McLaren head to the penultimate round in Qatar with a 24-point lead over Ferrari in the constructors’ championship.   Subscribe to The Athletic on an exclusive offer here GO FURTHER Max Verstappen clinches fourth F1 championship as George Russell wins Las Vegas GP Getty Images So where does Max Verstappen go from here? Well, there is a record that he could equal next season if he has the hunger for it.  Verstappen is one of four drivers to earn four consecutive drivers’ titles with tonight’s result in Las Vegas — but there is one driver with five. That of course is Michael Schumacher at Ferrari. Over to you, Max and Red Bull. In the meantime, here is the list: Advertisement Getty Images I believe the term here should be ‘game recognises game’, with Fernando Alonso one of the first to congratulate Max Verstappen on his fourth successive world title. What does that mean regarding Formula One history? Here are your multiple world champions: Getty Images There is a fun moment in the paddock as Sky Sports’ presenters interview Max Verstappen, and McLaren team principal Zak Brown interrupts to congratulate him on live TV. As you do. Max gives him a hug, it’s all very cordial, and then he makes the point that it’s nice he’s been able to win it without needing the fastest car. Brown had made the point previously that Verstappen was the best driver driving the best car — but this second half of the season has added a bit more gloss to that impressive career Verstappen is building. Getty Images Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc have both been through most of their media duties, and you can cut the tension with a knife — even if the two Ferrari teammates are trying to wear a smile while they speak. In short, both have said they’ve agreed to not talk about their respective frustrations in public and leave it until they sit down together in private. So what’s the beef? Well in truth, we don’t know — but it certainly sounds like a misunderstanding over what the team is agreeing with the drivers in terms of strategy before a race, and what then takes place out on the track. I’m sure we haven’t heard the end of this one, and they still have a constructors’ championship to fight for over the remaining two rounds.  That picture of George Russell is not my favorite photo though. That is this, from one of my realizations over the course of this grand prix… It’s Pierre Gasly doing a quick reactions warm-up with a ball on the grid, just minutes before the formation lap.  Sadly, such routines don’t help when your car breaks after a few laps and you’re forced to retire after stunning the paddock by qualifying third. A case of what might have been for Alpine in Nevada. Getty Images It is Max Verstappen’s season, but maybe this is George Russell’s night? I’ll tell you what though — he doesn’t half take a brilliant photo. There have been some real corkers after his Las Vegas GP win.  📸 Clive Rose/Getty Images  Advertisement Formula 1 What does a world title look like? It’s looks like this.  Max Verstappen breaks the 400 points barrier for the season and he is now uncatchable at the top. Lando Norris still looks secure in second, and that might explain why Charles Leclerc has been in a grump for the evening.  There are some strong radio exchanges doing the rounds where in essence, the Monogasque driver feels the respect he has shown his Ferrari teammate Carlos Sainz, has not been reciprocated.  Things unraveling a little at Maranello ahead of Sainz’s winter departure then… Getty Images Mercedes chief Toto Wolff has just offered his congratulations to Max Verstappen: 💬 “The deserving champion. It was clear that he was one of the great ones before that already.  “Now a four-time world champion, he dominated in the first half of the year. Domination of the driver, domination of a car, and in the second half of the season, domination of a driver.  “Absolutely worthy four-time world champion.” Formula 1 Every point counts, and that fastest lap bonus from Lando Norris ensured McLaren holds onto 24 points of their constructors’ championship lead with two races (and a sprint) to go. Red Bull looks like it’s out of it now, although they could still mathematically pull it out of the bag.  So, all eyes on Ferrari and McLaren come Qatar — where there are also sprint race points on offer. Getty Images One thing you may have missed in all the late victories was Lando Norris’ bid to claim the point for tonight’s fastest lap. He picked that up, Oscar Piastri allowed him the room to pit for new tires and do it (1:34.876), and that was the McLaren salvage operation to protect their constructors’ championship position. Getty Images As for the rest of the field, here’s the final result. There were just the two retirements in the end: Advertisement Getty Images That was a fun race, hey? Here’s how the top 10 finished and how the drivers’ world title was won:  Getty Images Besides all the joy and excitement, you can also tell what this meant to George Russell. He loved that — and he may well love having Mercedes behind him in total come 2025 too… Getty Images Contrast Verstappen with George Russell, our race winner who looks like a man ready to bounce off the walls in Las Vegas: 💬 “I was planning on flying in a couple of hours, but I am definitely not getting on that flight — I’m going to enjoy this with all my team.  “Vegas is just a crazy, crazy place. To get pole, a dominant weekend, a one-two with Lewis as well — I was just waiting for something to happen, the last two I’ve had on pole have been crazy races with rain, red flags.  “But I’m so, so happy right now.” Getty Images Max Verstappen looked calm and collected, as well as happy, as he gave his initial reaction to his fourth world title: 💬 “It’s been a long season. We started off cruising, and we have to be proud of everyone. To stand here as a four-time world champion, I never thought it was possible. I’m relieved in a way, and very proud. “It was a very challenging season. I had to be calm and in a way, I still prefer last season. But this season taught me a lot of lessons and I’m very proud of how we handled it as a team.” Getty Images It’s been slow going, but the podium interviews are done, with a bonus chat from Max Verstappen — and now the drivers have made it onto the podium for the national anthems. Reaction on the way... Advertisement Getty Images In case you were wondering who flew the checkered flag as George Russell won the Las Vegas Grand Prix, and Max Verstappen won his fourth successive drivers’ championship. Yes, it was Sylvester Stallone.  Getty Images This is from F1 CEO, Stefano Domenicali: 💬 “I want to congratulate Max on an incredible season and his fourth world title. He is a true great of this sport and has so much more to look forward to in his impressive career.  “This season has been thrilling and 2025 looks set to be even closer. Congratulations Max and congratulations to all the team at Red Bull.” Getty Images The podium drivers have just got into a limousine. All three of them on the back seat. It looks cozy. Max Verstappen gets his own car too, given he’ll also join them on the podium as the world champion."
Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How George Russell took Las Vegas GP pole for Mercedes in F1 qualifying,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/live-blogs/f1-vegas-qualifying-live-updates-results-fp3-news/rU8R2orXiGmO/,"Sun, 24 Nov 2024 09:32:45 GMT","George Russell, the last driver to cross the line at the end of qualifying, took P1 ahead of Carlos Sainz and Pierre Gasly","George Russell put together a perfect final qualifying lap in his Mercedes to take pole position for Saturday's Las Vegas Grand Prix.  He pipped Carlos Sainz by less than a tenth, with Pierre Gasly following next in a stunning P3.  Max Verstappen, who can clinch his fourth straight drivers' championship this weekend, will start the race in fifth, one position ahead of his title rival Lando Norris in sixth.  Lights out for the grand prix is Saturday night at 10pm PST, which is 1am EST and 6am GMT.  Getty Images As the dust settles, here is the provisional grid in full for the Las Vegas Grand Prix on Saturday night — which of course, you will be able to follow in full live with us here at The Athletic: Bottas was 19th fastest but has a five-place grid penalty for tomorrow after taking his fourth energy store of the season, exceeding the limit allowed. There will also be a question mark over whether Franco Colapinto will make the race, following his high-speed crash and the damage done to his Williams. Advertisement Getty Images There will be the race to win the Las Vegas Grand Prix tomorrow, and then there will be the race to become world champion. Max Verstappen’s task to claim the title in Nevada is now a bit clearer following qualifying. He will start tomorrow P5, alongside his chief rival Lando Norris (P6) on the third row. If the pair finish the race in those same positions, Verstappen will be crowned champion — as he will if he holds a lead of at least 60 points over Norris leaving Las Vegas.  His current lead is 62 points. Getty Images Lewis Hamilton is cutting a figure who knows his future lies elsewhere, which we all already know given his impending winter swift to Ferrari.   But that Q3 today should have been much better than it finished.  Had Hamilton recreated his best Q2 time of 1:32.567 in Q3 — he really should have managed that given the improving grip — then he would be lining up P3 for tomorrow’s grand prix. Instead he locked up on his first shot, ran wide on his second, and finished bottom of the top-10 shootout. All while his Mercedes teammate claimed pole. No wonder he looked glum in the media pen afterwards. I’d share the quotes, but it really was his expression that said it all.  The shift in dynamic this season has been well represented by qualifying — but Las Vegas did not play ball.  Max Verstappen stuck his Red Bull on pole for the first seven races, Lando Norris had done so in six of the previous nine grands prix. But neither were that close to grabbing the front row this weekend. This is George Russell’s third pole position of the year, the fourth of his career and his first since the British Grand Prix in July. Yet his Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton, along with McLaren’s Oscar Piastri, both remain without a pole in 2024. Ferrari are the only team to avoid a Q1 exit this year, while Verstappen and — more impressively — RB’s Liam Lawson also have a blemish-free record heading into the final two race weekends.  Getty Images With qualifying completed in Las Vegas, let’s update the team head-to-head records — arguably the purest battle between two teammates all season.  Here’s how it looks at each team after 22 rounds (Vegas winner in bold): Getty Images We’ve had an update via Luke Smith from Williams on Franco Colapinto, following his heavy crash at the end of Q2: 💬 “During qualifying, Franco sustained a significant impact of over 50G, requiring a medical check up. An impact of this magnitude is obviously significant and severe, and he will need to be evaluated again tomorrow before we will know whether he is clear to race.  “Franco’s health is all that matters and we are glad he is otherwise OK. We will provide further updates when we can.” There will also need to be a car ready for him to race. Those repairs will be a serious undertaking for the Williams mechanics over the coming hours. GO FURTHER George Russell takes pole at the Las Vegas GP, Verstappen qualifies ahead of Norris Advertisement Getty Images How about Alpine’s form then? Pierre Gasly was on the podium alongside Esteban Ocon in the wet in Brazil. Now he’s turned in a stunning lap in the dry of Las Vegas to grab third on the grid for tomorrow. Here is the Frenchman’s reaction from the quali podium:  💬 “It’s unbelievable. Honestly, we didn’t think we’d be able to achieve a top three in quali. “It was an incredible lap, especially around this track. You are flirting with the walls right through the lap, a lot of adrenaline, a lot of excitement. “I knew crossing the line it was a good lap, but when they came up on the radio telling me we’re lining up third tomorrow… It’s just amazing.” It seems the first impressions on Rui Marques, F1’s new race director, are positive.  George Russell and Carlos Sainz say in the press conference that Marques responded quickly to feedback on track limits and making the pit exit line more visible after the drivers’ briefing. Sainz said: 💬 “I think the drivers’ briefing yesterday was one of the best that we’ve had for a long time.” Getty Images Carlos Sainz could well be the most underrated driver on the grid. Again, he delivers pace and even convinced himself for a moment of top spot. Here’s the Ferrari driver’s quali reaction:  💬 “That was a tough, tight quali. I was a bit closer to pole than what I was expecting. Actually, I thought I had pole and then George came very, very quick at the end. “We’re starting in a good position for tomorrow. We need to stay confident that tomorrow we could be fighting at the front even more than today.” Getty Images It wasn’t what George Russell was expecting, but maybe he should have — this Mercedes has been quick all weekend so far. Here he is, speaking from the qualifying podium: 💬 “It was incredible to be back on pole. We’ve been so quick all weekend and I just knew coming into that last Q3 lap, it was going to be the one that counts. “We had to change the front wing and there was a moment I thought we weren’t going to make the flag, but just so happy and we’ve got to do some deep dive to understand why it’s been so quick so far this weekend, because it was a real surprise.” Getty Images That was also an interesting qualifying in terms of the constructors’ championship.  McLaren may well lead that going into the final three rounds of the season, but it will be Ferrari that has P2 and P4 on the grid tomorrow — with McLaren and Red Bull looking at some degree of points losses already.  There has also been a lot of talk of the red team’s confidence in their potential race pace tomorrow.  Ferrari’s current deficit to McLaren is 36 points. Advertisement Getty Images A nice bit of added spice to the title picture on a weekend when Verstappen could be crowned champion, is that he will start alongside Lando Norris on the third row of the grid as they line up fifth and sixth.  I wonder how ‘elbows out’ it might get on the opening lap. Getty Images Sergio Perez stopped in the media pen following his Q1 exit for Red Bull. As you can imagine, he wasn’t best pleased with looking at a P16 start tomorrow: 💬 “We’ve been lacking a lot of pace through the qualifying, and that’s been the main issue really for us. In hindsight, we should have used two sets (of tires) given we were not so competitive in Q1.  “Tomorrow is going to be a very tricky one…I think we’ve got a fundamental issue at the moment with the car that is just not working for me. “Obviously it’s not ideal. You want to be up there, especially I know what I can do. But when you don’t have that grip underneath you, then it’s really hard and you’re prone to a lot of mistakes.”  Getty Images That’s the top-10 of the provisional grid sorted for tomorrow’s Las Vegas Grand Prix then. Here’s what it looks like: Max Verstappen got a good spot on track to go quick, but his best — 1:32.797 was only good enough for P5, behind both Ferraris. But perhaps crucially, it isn’t behind either McLaren. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri will start P6 and P8 respectively, sandwiching an impressive qualifying from Yuki Tsunoda. Getty Images Seriously, what a lap from Gasly to grab P3 on the grid for Alpine. The team is riding high after the Brazil double podium, but to repeat that kind of pace in dry conditions is a mighty result.  Advertisement Getty Images ⏰ 0:00 Sainz goes fastest with a 1:32.410, toppling a stunner from the Alpine of Pierre Gasly (1:32.664). But here comes George Russell! The Mercedes takes pole with 1:32.312. That is pole by less than 0.1s. ⏰ 0:00 The checkered flag is out! These current laps are the only ones left that will count. Russell remains the only driver into the 1:32s as it stands — but that will surely change… Getty Images ⏰ 01:59 Into the final two minutes, it’s Verstappen and then Russell who head out — with the other eight cars already on track. This is it, the final shootout for Vegas pole."

The Shamrock Series game at Yankee Stadium was dripping in history, with the Irish (10-1) and Black Knights (9-1) matching up as ranked foes for the first time since 1958. Big games between Notre Dame and Army at Yankee Stadium were regular events that captivated the country back in the 1940s. This one drew a sellout crowd to the Bronx, but it was no classic. Continue reading here. GO FURTHER Notre Dame routs Army to keep CFP hosting bid in focus: Inside Irish’s service-academy sweep Getty Images Jeremiyah Love, who had three touchdowns in tonight's game, was matter of fact about the win. “This win is just like every other win.” Love said.  Adon Shuler stressed the importance of eliminating the penalties and what it will do for Notre Dame if they reduce the mistakes. ""We eliminate the penalties and I don’t think any team can score on us,"" Shuler said. Advertisement Getty Images Tonight was the fifth game this season that Notre Dame did not have any turnovers.  Getty Images Army coach Jeff Monken was candid in his postgame remarks about how the game went.  ""They are really athletic and well coached,"" Monken said of Notre Dame. ""They out-classed us.” Getty Images If Army was going to have a shot against Notre Dame, Daily had to carry the heaviest weight. And defensive coordinator Al Golden gave the Black Knights quarterback little chance, as the Irish loaded up at the line of scrimmage and pounded Daily for all four quarters. More telling, Army called Daily runs four times on fourth down and failed to convert on the first three. The fourth was good, but it came with just 32 seconds remaining in the game. That amounts to a failure for the Black Knights, which were ranked No. 2 nationally in fourth down conversions (16 of 19). Army can’t win without short-yardage successes and its quarterback delivering. It got neither in Yankee Stadium. Unlike the Navy game last month, when Notre Dame played base defense against the Mids’ reimagined option offense, Army let Golden play bully ball by loading the box. With Army not posing a threat in the pass game, Notre Dame played eight-man and nine-man boxes much of the game. The Irish often put five defensive linemen on the field at once, or at least walked up linebackers outside of the defensive ends. That approach clogged up run lanes, which Army couldn’t clear with its offensive line. And that left Daily to take hit after hit after hit. Eighteen different Notre Dame players made at least two tackles, with Adon Shuler (8) and Jaiden Ausberry (7) leading the way. Getty Images Notre Dame probably didn’t need to win with much style against Army after losses by Indiana and Ole Miss earlier in the day softened up the field of at-large hopefuls. The Irish did so anyway, all but locking up a first-round home game if they can handle USC next weekend in Los Angeles. The Irish made short and efficient work of Jeff Monken’s squad. At halftime, Notre Dame had outgained Army 258-85. The Irish had 13 plays of 10-plus yards compared to one by the Black Knights, and that lone big chunk ended in a Daily lost fumble. And then Love went 68 yards for a touchdown on the first play of the second half, removing any remaining doubt for a game that contained little of it starting not long after kickoff. During its nine-game win streak, the Irish have outscored opponents by a combined score of 392-92. Notre Dame has emptied its bench in each of the past six games. Will the College Football Playoff selection committee notice? There’s no ignoring the losses by Indiana and Ole Miss on Saturday, but it’s less clear how Notre Dame now compares to Penn State. Both are one-loss teams. The Nittany Lions’ best win is an overtime victory at USC. Penn State escaped Saturday with a one-point win at Minnesota. And while both Notre Dame and Penn State would both be ticketed for home games in the CFP as it stands, the difference between the No. 6 seed and No. 7 seed could be the difference between drawing the ACC champion in the quarterfinals and the SEC champion in that same round. Getty Images This certainly won’t help the Black Knights’ case with the selection committee, but Army is still in the mix to be the highest ranked Group of 5 conference champion. With one remaining American Athletic Conference game next week at home against UTSA, Army has already locked up a spot in the conference title game against Tulane on Dec. 6. The site of that game is yet to be determined. Losing so decisively to Notre Dame is going to leave the Black Knights without much to sway the committee beyond the victory against Tulane they would need on their resume to be considered. If you think Indiana’s schedule is weak, well, go check out Army’s. Not great. Especially if No. 12 Boise State keeps on winning in the Mountain West. The Broncos got bogged down at Wyoming but survived 17-13 to remain unbeaten since a last-second loss at Oregon in Week 2. The Cadets had rarely trailed through their 9-0 start but looked totally overmatched against Notre Dame. Army came in allowing 4.7 yards per play. The Irish averaged 9.8. Advertisement Getty Images Notre Dame concludes its regular season next Saturday Nov. 30 against USC.  Getty Images Army hosts UTSA next Saturday before taking on Navy in the historic Army-Navy Game on Dec. 14. Getty Images Notre Dame did a lot of things right in Saturday's 49-14 win over Army, but the rushing attack truly led the way.  The Fighting Irish totaled 273 rushing yards and five touchdowns against the Black Knights, with three different tailbacks getting on the scoresheet. Jeremiyah Love led the way with 130 yards and two scores of his own while Jadarian Price (53 rush yards, two TDs) and Aneyas Williams (62 rush yards, one TD) also got in on the fun.  It marked the second-most rushing yards in a game for Notre Dame this season (362 rush yards versus Purdue, Sept. 14).  Getty Images After tonight's win, Notre Dame has the best FBS point differential (+301).  Getty Images Riley Leonard: 10-of-13 passes for 148 yards and two touchdowns.  Bryson Daily: 4-of-8 passes for 26 yards, 145 rushing yards for two rushing touchdowns.  Advertisement  Army's undefeated record might have come to an end against Notre Dame, but quarterback Bryson Daily delivered a valiant performance. Daily rushed 35 times for 129 yards and two touchdowns, leaving Yankee Stadium as the Black Knights' top offensive contributor. The senior quarterback has now registered 100+ rushing yards or more in eight of nine games this season, tying Mike Mayweather's program record which was set in 1990. He's also registered eight multi-touchdown games, a statistic Daily will now take into the American Athletic Conference (AAC) Championship game next weekend.   Getty Images A mismatch in every sense of the word as the Irish stage a defensive clinic against the option and let their game-breaking speed loose on the perimeter. Bottom line: Notre Dame will host a College Football Playoff game if it wins at USC next week. True freshman Aneyas Williams even got in on Notre Dame's fun at Yankee Stadium.  Williams extended the Fighting Irish's lead tonight over Army after racing into the end zone from 58 yards out. Williams entered the game with 112 rushing yards this season but now set a new career-high with his longest rush of the year.   Getty Images This is the longest winning streak for Notre Dame under coach Marcus Freeman (nine games).      Getty Images Notre Dame wins its ninth straight game tonight against Army. During the nine-game win streak, Notre Dame has out-scored the opposition 399-92. Advertisement Getty Images Q4 0:22 Army 14, Notre Dame 49  What a drive for Bryson Daily. He gets several third-down conversions and adds a fourth-down conversion at the end, eventually running into the end zone for the touchdown.  Daily gets his second touchdown of the game, despite Army suffering its first loss of the season.  Q4 0:32 Army 7, Notre Dame 49  Bryson Daily converts the first down with a two-yard run on fourth down. It isn't enough for the touchdown but enough to move the chains. Q4 0:37 Army 7, Notre Dame 49  It's fourth-and-goal with less than a minute to go. Army's going to lose this game but they have one last play to try and get a touchdown before the game's end."

Subscribe to The Athletic on an exclusive offer here. GO FURTHER Arsenal 3 Nottingham Forest 0 – Ethan Nwaneri’s first league goal and the Martin Odegaard effect  And Arteta was happy to hail the impact of Ethan Nwaneri, the academy product who came off the bench to score the third goal. He said: ""He is the second youngest (Premier League goalscorer) in our history. That's a story in itself.  ""He's brave. You see the reaction of fans and they were singing 'he's one of our own'. I think we have to put brick by brick and make sure the cement doesn't get dry. Hopefully we can build a beautiful thing with him."" Advertisement Getty Images We've heard from the Nottingham Forest manager and one of his players who both said they were not good enough to trouble Arsenal this afternoon and that was reflected in the fact they did not have a shot on target. It is the first time Forest have finished a Premier League match without a shot on target since April of last year, against Manchester City. Very, very rarely can you win a game of football without having a shot on target. Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, speaking to BBC Match of the Day post-game, said: ""I think we started really well. The sense I was getting in the last 48 hours after the international break, the boys coming together and were all at it. ""It was good to see the impact of the substitutes. Everyone has to feel important. It was a good afternoon."" Describing the impact of captain Martin Odegaard returning and the team putting in a good performance, the Spaniard added: ""It's not a coincidence. The team flows in a different way when he is playing."" Getty Images A landmark day for Mikel Arteta who was taking charge of his 250th Arsenal game, and a landmark day for the club who have now won 2,000 games in the English top flight. They are the second time to reach that milestone after Liverpool, who now have 2,068. Getty Images Nottingham Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo was not happy with his side's performance at the Emirates. ""They played well and we didn't play so well,"" he told BBC Sport. ""Arsenal were the better team. Second half we became more pressing but they killed us with the second and third goals. There's not much to say.  ""We have to improve because we did a lot of bad things - especially with the defending. Losing is always very painful.  ""We came up short."" Getty Images Bukayo Saka benefitted massively from having Odegaard nearby him on Arsenal's right-hand side, as he scored the game's first goal and assisted the second. It moves the 23-year-old onto 12 goal involvements for the season in the Premier League — only Mohamed Salah (14) has more. Advertisement Getty Images The Nottingham Forest players will be the first to know that they were some way off their best today, as highlighted by James Ward-Prowse's comments to Sky Sports after the match. ""On a day like this you need to be solid defensively and take your chances,"" he said. ""Ultimately it was not good enough and it was three relatively easy goals for them. ""We are going to have to improve our defensive structure."" Getty Images I find it astounding that, before his recent injury, there were portions of the Arsenal fanbase claiming that the team was better without Martin Odegaard. His performances today and against Chelsea before the international break showed why he is the essential cog in Mikel Arteta's machine — he was sublime. He attempted 67 passes in the match, completed 60 and created chances for his team-mates with six of them. A supreme showing from the 25-year-old. The Athletic's Jordan Campbell was on hand to deliver The Briefing from the Emirates — check it out at the link below. GO FURTHER Arsenal 3 Nottingham Forest 0 – Ethan Nwaneri’s first league goal and the Martin Odegaard effect Getty Images What a moment for young Ethan Nwaneri scoring his first Premier League goal. In making it 3-0 off the bench, he became Arsenal's second youngest goalscorer in the competition. The youngest? Cesc Fabregas, who was 134 days younger than Nwaneri when he scored against Blackburn in August 2004.  Perhaps surprisingly, the opening goal was the first Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard have combined for since February. Advertisement As you can see from the picture, pretty close. Right decision though, in the end. Getty Images Six games down and one to go in the Premier League today. A huge win for Wolves in west London, a battling point for Crystal Palace at Villa Park, a super win for 10-man Brighton at Bournemouth, and a disappointing draw for Everton against Brentford who were also down to 10. Getty Images Obviously, there have been a few international matches stretching the domestic calendar, but you might be surprised to note that today was Arsenal's first Premier League win since October 5. It also marked their first league clean sheet since September 15. Getty Images Nottingham Forest have been outclassed at Arsenal today. Matz Sels made some good saves to keep the score down to 1-0 in the first half, with Nuno Espirito Santo’s side unable to shackle the brilliance of Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard.  The Belgian keeper could have done little with any of the three goals, as Arsenal picked Forest apart with their crisp, urgent passing. The home side did everything with tempo and the visitors just could not keep up. Forest must take solace from the fact that this was their first Premier League away defeat of the season. They started the day level on points with their hosts. But that was not reflected on the pitch, where there was a gulf in class for long periods. Getty Images That's it! Arsenal win 3-0, inflicting Nottingham Forest's first away defeat of the season. Much deserved too. Advertisement Getty Images Ethan Nwaneri is even trusted to take corners.  A better strike from Gabriel at the far post and he might have had an assist too. 90+1' Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest Into the first minute of six added on. Arsenal fans, near-delirious with delight, sing 'Oh Ethan Nwaneri, he's one of our own'. What a feeling that must be for the teenager. 90' Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest Jota Silva slams a loose ball into the net at the back post after Chris Wood flicked a header across goal, with Forest fans finally given something to cheer about. Or are they? No. Jota Silva wags his finger at the linesman, but replays show he was well offside. There is a VAR check, but it's a potential red card check for a poor tackle from Callum Hudson-Odoi on William Saliba. The verdict: no goal, and play on."
Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Ruben Amorim live updates: Manchester United manager’s first press conference ahead of Ipswich game,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/live-blogs/ruben-amorim-live-updates-manchester-united-press-conference-today/6Kx2t7p2gFKf/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 14:56:45 GMT",Follow live coverage of Amorim's first press conference as Manchester United boss as he previews Sunday’s Premier League game against Ipswich,"Ruben Amorim faced the press for the first time as Manchester United head coach today after taking over from Erik ten Hag. The 39-year-old cut a confident figure as he smiled throughout his first pre-match press conference, being asked about Jose Mourinho, his playing style and his influence on the club's recruitment, among other things. On Sunday, he will take charge of his first Premier League match as his side face Ipswich Town away from home at 4:30pm GMT/11:30am ET — the match will be covered live on The Athletic. Subscribe to The Athletic on an exclusive offer here. With his first press conference under his belt, Ruben Amorim will now be turning his full attention towards Sunday afternoon's visit to Ipswich. It is in the primetime slot (4:30pm GMT/11:30am ET) and will be covered live here on The Athletic — here is the full Premier League schedule this weekend. Saturday Sunday Monday Advertisement With so much to ask Amorim in such a short time period, there were no questions on the injured players in the Manchester United squad. Although, it is worth staying tuned to The Athletic between now and Sunday for updates on the likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Lisandro Martinez and Harry Maguire who will all hope to play a role against Ipswich. One of Amorim's more interesting answers came after he was asked whether the United role is one of football's impossible jobs. The new man outlined each of the post-Ferguson managers (bar David Moyes) and what they brought to the club, before saying ""You have different coaches, the same results. We will try to do Ineos way, my way."" It's far too early to say whether Amorim will be a success at United. But you do get the sense he's not going to compromise on his ideals this season. Amorim cut a relaxed and confident figure in his first press conference.  The 39-year-old was asked multiple questions about his compatriot Jose Mourinho, but was keen to stress he is his own man. ""I am a different guy."" was one of his more repeated phrases. Fans will find it hard not to nod along as Amorim outlined his belief in the squad and the things needed to improve. United's new head coach brought up his age, and how it might help him relate to a new generation of players. He also brought up how his club need to improve their physicality and get better at tracking back. That's all from Ruben Amorim in his first press conference as Manchester United head coach. And we want to hear your thoughts. Let us know what you thought to Amorim's first meeting with the media by emailing us at livebloguk@theathletic.com. Amorim was very clear in his response when asked whether he will look to implement his playing style immediately at United. ""As a coach you have to choose one way or another, I choose always 100 percent our way. ""I choose to risk a bit. I believe so much in our way of playing, they will believe too. There is no second way. ""We will adapt some players because we don’t have a different profile. Maybe on Sunday you will see the starting 11 and not feel a lot of change but you will see it in the game and the positioning or where they receive the ball."" Advertisement Amorim was asked how important it is to rebuild the belief within a group of players who have gotten used to disappointment this season. ""That is for sure but it is normal when players don’t win games, you start to be suspicious of the way of playing. You can understand when they walk to the game or the warm up, you can understand if they are confident or not. ""I think they have to help them but they are ready to cope with the demands of games in the Premier League. You see sometimes they have a bad first half and then second half they will change, so they have to find that mindset."" Amorim's clear belief in his abilities comes through loud and clear, even if there is humility also. He acknowledges that changing formation midway through a season is a risk, but he is 100 per cent confident in his methods. The players may be similar on Sunday against Ipswich, but their positions will change, he says. Whether some of these players can adapt remains to be seen, but he is adamant they all want to get on the pitch anywhere right now — even as goalkeeper. I asked Amorim if the players are open to playing in different positions to the ones they played in under Ten Hag. ""They want to play. In this first moment, they just want to play, so it is easy. ""In the future, we will see. You can watch on TV but you have to train with them to see if they can play in different positions. Everyone wants to play now, if they have the opportunity to play as a goalkeeper, they will. They are open to change some positions. No manager has lasted three full seasons yet at United since Sir Alex Ferguson left, but Amorim feels two and a half years — the length of his contract — is enough to know if he's the right man for the job. ""I have two years and a half of contract. I think two years you can understand if I am the right manager to go in this process. ""We will need more time, if you look to the other clubs who are winning this league, they are doing this process for a long time. But they are winning, that's why they time to do their project. ""I understand we will need more than two and a half years, we have to win something, somewhere but in two years you can understand if you want to continue on this path or change. We'll see how long it will take."" A trickier question followed for Amorim, one hooked on his belief in the same group of players who 'got Ten Hag sacked'. ""It is belief, you have to believe and I believe in them. When I started this week, you can say one week three training (sessions) but they are open to different things.  ""The only thing I ask is hard work and you have to believe in the new idea and I felt that. Until they prove me wrong, I believe in the players."" Advertisement The old favourite 'impossible job' was then brought up before Amorim was asked what he views as his biggest challenge. ""I really don’t know the biggest challenge, I will found out during these months. ""You had here different types of coaches; the guys that won everything like Van Gaal and Mourinho, the new ones that knew the club inside out like Solskjaer then one of the best outside the top five leagues in Ten Hag. We have to improve as a club and acknowledge we need time, every coach needs time and we have to win games. ""You have different coaches, the same results. We will try to do our way, the INEOS way and my way."" Asked again if it was the impossible job, he said: ""No, of course not. I believe that. ""Call me naïve but I believe I am the right guy in the right moment. I could be wrong but the earth will still turn so I'm not worried about that. I truly believe I am the right guy."" United fans have been curious to know of the difference between Amorim being a head coach rather than a manager. The new United man is not thought to have the same level of input on player trading as his predecessors, and will share duties with Dan Ashworth, Jason Wilcox and others. However, don't think players will arrive at the club without his say so. That was clear from his answer to the last question, particularly where he said he has a ""great responsibility"" when choosing players. A key question on recruitment was the next one that Amorim faced. ""I think it has to be all together because if you are a coach coming here and already chose the players, you could be wrong because the club will be here for a long time and you as a coach, you don’t know that. ""We have to improve the process of recruitment; the data and the profile of the players we want. I have to have a strong position on that because I'm the coach. I think it is all together, but the final word should be the manager, not because it is your right but because it is your responsibility. ""I have to understand the league — that is important — and then when everything is aligned, everyone is on the same page, we can buy and sell players."" Amorim has repeated a couple of times how he feels he is the right man in the right moment for United. He acknowledges that unlike Jose Mourinho, his compatriot who he worked under during an internship at United, he does not arrive as a European champion — but he has a clear idea for how his team will play, even if that means some adaptation from players. Another question about Mourinho, this time on his start to life in England with his famous 'special one' press conference. ""First thing, not just on me but all the Portuguese coaches, he showed we can be the best in the world from a small country. But I am different from Mourinho.  ""You look at Mourinho and felt he could win everywhere, he was European champion and I am not. I'm a different guy in a different moment. Football nowadays is different and I think I am the right person for this moment, because I am a young guy, I understand the players. ""Mourinho at Chelsea, the young guys were like Lampard and nowadays is so much different."" Advertisement The new United head coach was asked where he can make some easy wins in improving the team from the one that has struggled this season. ""In simple things, I think, if you want to speak about the team and the way we play, I think we lose the ball too often, we have to be better at running back, I think that is clear for everyone and I think we have to be very good on the details. ""Sometimes we are hoping to change big things, but I think it is the small things. We have to improve on the small things. In the small things, I think I can help these players a lot."" Amorim was then asked if he had heard from Jose Mourinho after taking the job. ""He sent me a message, he told me that it's a lovely club, a big club with lovely people. In that he is correct, it still is. ""But a lot of things change, we are in a different building now, we are building a new one. I am a different guy and I hope to teach something to my players. ""The club is still big, it is still the best club in England and we want to win. That's all."" Asked about his ideas regarding playing style, Amorim gave a thoughtful response. ""It is not revolution. Football is not so different with five players at the back, three players at the back or four players at the back. ""I cannot see (it will be) evolution, we have to wait and see. But we will play a different type of football. We have our ideas. I'm not saying they're the best ideas but it is our way of seeing football. ""It's not revolution or evolution, it's change."""
MLB News,Kikuchi agrees to join Angels on 3-year deal (source),https://www.mlb.com/news/yusei-kikuchi-deal-with-angels,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 16:10:00 GMT",,"Rhett Bollinger ANAHEIM -- The Angels have been the most aggressive club in free agency this offseason and kept it up with their first big splash, agreeing to terms with lefty Yusei Kikuchi early Monday. The deal is the largest since Perry Minasian became general manager in 2020, as it’s a three-year, $63 million deal, a source told MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. The club has not confirmed the agreement, which was originally reported by MLB Network insider Jon Heyman. But it represents a solid upgrade to the rotation after the Angels also signed right-hander Kyle Hendricks to a one-year deal worth $2.5 million. Kikuchi immediately becomes an ace for the club and can help the Angels compete after their 99-loss campaign in ’24. The 33-year-old left-hander is coming off an intriguing season in which he put together one of the finest stretches of his Major League career following a midseason trade to the Astros. Kikuchi, who began his professional career with eight seasons in Nippon Professional Baseball, spent his first three Major League seasons with the Mariners before signing a three-year, $36 million contract with the Blue Jays ahead of the 2022 season. Between Seattle and Toronto, he pitched to a 4.72 ERA with a 1.38 WHIP. As with many previous Astros acquisitions, Kikuchi improved dramatically after his July 29 trade, making 10 starts down the stretch, posting a 2.70 ERA with a 0.93 WHIP and 76 strikeouts in 60 innings. Among the changes the Astros made to the veteran’s repertoire was a stronger reliance on his slider; by September, he was throwing 38.9% sliders compared to just 36.6% four-seam fastballs, increasing the effectiveness of both pitches. Kikuchi joins a rotation that includes lefty Tyler Anderson, right-handers José Soriano and Jack Kochanowicz and Hendricks. The fifth spot is up for grabs and the Angels have several internal candidates, such as Reid Detmers, Chase Silseth, Caden Dana and Sam Aldegheri. It’s been a busy offseason for the Angels, who also traded for slugger Jorge Soler and signed free agent catcher Travis d’Arnaud, utilityman Kevin Newman and Hendricks to bolster their depth. They also traded for infielder Scott Kingery and claimed infielder/outfielder Ryan Noda on waivers. Kukuchi’s signing is the largest for the club since they signed reliever Raisel Iglesias to a four-year, $58 million deal before the 2022 season. Kukuchi also represents the club’s first Japanese player since the departure of Shohei Ohtani to the Dodgers last offseason. The Angels still retain a large Japanese fanbase because of Ohtani’s six years with the club."
MLB News,One free agent who could make sense for every team,https://www.mlb.com/news/one-free-agent-for-every-mlb-team-2024-25,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 19:19:00 GMT",,"Mark Feinsand Thanksgiving is a time for families to gather around the dinner table, share old stories and, of course, argue about which players will wind up with which teams during this Hot Stove season. So while you’re cooking your turkey, mashing your potatoes and baking your chocolate pecan pie -- my personal specialty -- take a few minutes to prepare for the table talk that will surely fill dining rooms around the country. It’s time for our annual exercise in which we try to match up free agents with new teams. This list isn’t meant to serve as a prediction of what’s to come this winter, but rather a chance to try reading some tea leaves and connecting some dots. We call it “30 free agents for 30 teams.” We have only two rules: 1. Every player has to be from another team (no incumbents). 2. Each player can only be on the list once. That means that a number of notable free agents were not included, but don’t read into that in terms of their overall markets. Players such as Alex Bregman, Anthony Santander and Teoscar Hernández will find plenty of suitors despite not being listed below. Don’t @ me … unless you want that pie recipe, of course. MLB offseason signings and trades• Latest free-agent and trade rumors• Top 25 free agents | Every free agent, by position• Tracking every team's offseason moves• FA guides: Soto | Burnes | Alonso | Snell | Bregman | Fried | Santander• Offseason dates, rules & terms explained Without further ado, here’s the latest attempt at playing free-agent matchmaker. Blue Jays: Willy Adames, SSThe Blue Jays are looking at a number of free agents in an effort to upgrade the offense, but Adames may make the most sense. Toronto could shift him to third base next season, after which he could move back to shortstop if Bo Bichette departs as a free agent next winter. Orioles: Max Fried, LHPBaltimore finally found the ace it had been missing last season with the trade for Corbin Burnes, but he’s a free agent now, potentially leaving a huge hole atop the rotation. Should Burnes prove too expensive or simply sign elsewhere, Fried could be the perfect replacement. Rays: Kyle Higashioka, CRays catchers combined for a .563 OPS last season, the second-lowest mark in the AL. Ben Rortvedt will return in 2025, but Tampa Bay could use another catcher to pair with him. Higashioka -- who was teammates with Rortvedt on the 2023 Yankees -- would be an ideal fit. Red Sox: Corbin Burnes, RHPRemember that scenario in which the Orioles lose their ace to free agency? Boston could be the team to snipe Burnes from its division rival, as the Red Sox appear intent on bringing in a No. 1 starter this offseason. Yankees: Christian Walker, 1BThe Yankees’ .619 OPS from their first basemen in 2024 was the lowest in the AL, so figuring out an answer at the position will be on New York’s to-do list. Walker is the best all-around first baseman on the market, hitting 95 home runs since the start of 2022 while winning three straight Gold Glove Awards. Guardians: Michael Lorenzen, RHPThe potential loss of Shane Bieber and Matthew Boyd will leave Cleveland not only with holes to fill in the rotation, but also a veteran presence on the staff. Lorenzen pitched well for the Rangers (3.81 ERA in 101 2/3 innings) and even better for the Royals (1.57 ERA in 28 2/3 innings) following a midseason trade, though a hamstring injury kept him out for most of September. Royals: Jurickson Profar, OFKansas City made some impactful signings last winter (Seth Lugo and Michael Wacha, in particular) that helped the Royals return to the postseason for the first time since their 2015 World Series title run. But the outfield lacked production, ranking 14th in the AL in home runs and 13th in OPS as a unit. Profar is coming off a career year after helping pace a 93-win Padres team. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Tigers: Walker Buehler, RHPBuehler could be this year's Jack Flaherty, an ideal rebound project for pitching coach Chris Fetter, whose group has shown it can help pitchers get more velocity and chase. Buehler overlapped with Tigers director of pitching Gabe Ribas when Ribas was a coordinator in the Dodgers' system. If Detroit isn’t going to be active at the top of the free-agent pitching market, Buehler could be the best fit. Twins: Andrew Chafin, LHPMinnesota’s bullpen struggled from the left side in 2024, as its southpaws combined for a 5.31 ERA and .453 opponent slugging percentage -- both MLB highs. Caleb Thielbar is a free agent, leaving a thin group even thinner. Chafin had 70 strikeouts in 56 1/3 innings with the Tigers and Rangers last season, ranking near the top of the league in both chase percentage and whiff percentage. White Sox: Jose Quintana, LHPChicago figures to have a young rotation in 2025, especially if the team trades Garrett Crochet as expected. Bringing in a veteran to lead the group makes sense, so why not a former White Sox pitcher who threw four 200-inning seasons for the club and made his only All-Star team during that stretch? Angels: Blake Treinen, RHPThe Angels have already addressed their rotation concerns by signing Kyle Hendricks and have reportedly agreed to a deal with Yusei Kikuchi, so expect them to turn their focus to the bullpen in the coming weeks. It’s unclear whether the Angels will spend big for top closers like Tanner Scott or Carlos Estévez, but Treinen would be a strong veteran presence on a team looking to contend. Astros: Carlos Santana, 1BThe ageless wonder posted another strong season at age 38, as Santana hit 23 homers with 71 RBIs and a .749 OPS, racking up 14 outs above average while winning a Gold Glove Award. Houston ranked 13th in the AL in OPS at first base, and while the José Abreu experiment went badly, Santana would help stabilize the position without requiring a long-term commitment. Athletics: Patrick Corbin, LHPThe Athletics have a young pitching staff, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see them try to sign a veteran starter to help guide that group. Corbin went 31-63 with a 5.71 ERA in his final four seasons with Washington, so the 35-year-old will likely have to accept a one-year deal and try to prove he can still be an effective starter. Mariners: Hye-Seong Kim, 2BCole Young, the Mariners’ No. 2 prospect, performed well at Double-A last season but isn’t likely ready to take over the second-base job just yet. Kim, who turns 26 in January, has a .304/.364/.403 slash line over seven-plus years in the KBO, stealing at least 25 bases six times. Kim would add a contact hitter with speed who could help change the dynamic of the Mariners’ lineup, which ranked 14th in the AL in batting average (.224) and struck out more than any other club. Rangers: Sean Manaea, LHPWith Nathan Eovaldi opting out of his contract and Andrew Heaney also potentially leaving via free agency, the Rangers have a need for a frontline starter. Manaea had an excellent year with the Mets and opted out of his own deal, setting him up for a multiyear deal. Braves: Nathan Eovaldi, RHPMax Fried is likely headed elsewhere as a free agent, while Charlie Morton is no lock to return to the Braves. With Spencer Strider’s timetable for 2025 unclear, Atlanta could use another starter to join Chris Sale, Reynaldo López and Spencer Schwellenbach in the rotation, and Eovaldi’s experience and track record would make him a sound choice. Marlins: Gary Sánchez, CNick Fortes returns in 2025 after starting 99 games behind the plate, but Marlins catchers ranked last in the league with six home runs and a .528 OPS. Sánchez has hit double-digit home runs in every season of his career, and while he started only 27 games at catcher and 40 at DH for the Brewers in 2024, the Marlins could offer him more playing time as they seek more power in the lineup. Mets: Juan Soto, OFThe biggest threat to the Yankees’ hopes of re-signing Soto, the Mets appear to be all in when it comes to adding the four-time All-Star. Owner Steve Cohen has the ability to pay whatever he wants, and for a generational hitter such as Soto, it remains to be seen whether any price is too high for the Mets. Nationals: Pete Alonso, 1BWashington needs an influx of power after finishing 2024 with an NL-low 135 home runs. There is no bigger home run threat available this winter than Alonso, whose 226 home runs since he broke into the league in 2019 rank second in the Majors only behind Aaron Judge (232). Phillies: Tanner Scott, LHPThe Phillies face the loss of both Carlos Estévez and Jeff Hoffman, leaving them with a need for late-inning bullpen help. Scott is the best reliever available on this year’s market, so it wouldn’t be surprising if Philadelphia takes a run at him to bolster the back end of the bullpen. Brewers: Yoán Moncada, 3BAssuming that Willy Adames departs as a free agent, Joey Ortiz is likely to move to shortstop, creating a vacancy at third base. The free-agent options beyond Alex Bregman are mostly underwhelming, but Moncada -- who was limited by injuries to only 12 games in 2024 -- has shown the ability to produce and could be a great buy-low candidate. Cardinals: Clay Holmes, RHPThe Cardinals are likely to trade closer Ryan Helsley this winter, and Andrew Kittredge is a free agent, leaving some potential holes in the bullpen. Holmes was an All-Star in 2022 and 2024, and although he lost his closer job with the Yankees late in the season, the righty was a big part of New York’s run to the World Series. Cubs: Jack Flaherty, RHPChicago will look to upgrade its rotation this winter, and while top free agents such as Corbin Burnes and Max Fried aren’t completely out of the question, the likelihood is that the Cubs will be focused on the second tier of starters. Flaherty made the most of his one-year, $14 million deal in 2024, pitching well for the Tigers before helping the Dodgers win the World Series following a midseason trade. Pirates: José Leclerc, RHPDavid Bednar is likely to enter the season as the Pirates' closer, but the two-time All-Star struggled through a rough year in 2024. Pittsburgh will be in the market for a late-inning reliever to get the ball to Bednar, and adding one with closing history would offer protection if Bednar goes through another bad stretch. Reds: Michael Conforto, OFThe Reds will be looking for a corner-outfield upgrade who can help boost the lineup, and while Conforto won’t be confused with Juan Soto anytime soon, the 31-year-old hit 20 homers in 130 games last season. That would have been tied for second on the Reds in 2024, while Conforto’s 116 OPS+ -- which would have ranked second to Elly De La Cruz among Cincy regulars -- was his best since 2020. D-backs: Carlos Estévez, RHPArizona’s 4.41 bullpen ERA ranked 13th in the NL last season, and 10 pitchers registered at least one save. The D-backs suffered 26 blown saves in 2024, and for a team that missed the postseason after losing head-to-head tiebreakers with the Mets and Braves, one more win would have made a huge difference. Estévez made his first All-Star team in 2023 and had a superb season with the Angels and Phillies in 2024, making him one of the best relievers on the free-agent market. Dodgers: Blake Snell, LHPLos Angeles has several starters on its roster, but many of them come with health concerns, leading to the likelihood of a six-man rotation. Shohei Ohtani is coming back from Tommy John surgery (plus shoulder surgery on his non-throwing arm), and Dustin May will be returning from Tommy John and esophageal surgeries, while Tyler Glasnow has never thrown more than 134 innings -- which he did last season. Snell is one of the top pitchers on the market and has intrigued the Dodgers for a while, making it a strong potential match. Giants: Ha-Seong Kim, SSNew president of baseball operations Buster Posey said at the GM Meetings that adding a shortstop would be ideal for the Giants, who could then use Tyler Fitzgerald in a more versatile role. Kim has ties to manager Bob Melvin, who managed him in San Diego from 2022-23, while San Francisco outfielder Jung Hoo Lee is a close friend of Kim’s from their time as teammates in Korea. Padres: Roki Sasaki, RHPSasaki, the 23-year-old phenom from Japan, might be the most intriguing -- and sought-after -- free agent this winter. Because of his international amateur status, teams can only pay him from their international bonus pools, so this won’t become a bidding war like the one we saw last offseason for Yoshinobu Yamamoto. Sasaki will be pursued by many clubs, but his close friendship with Yu Darvish could give the Padres a leg up in this race. Rockies: Kirby Yates, RHPColorado will be counting on some young, inexperienced arms in its bullpen next season, but adding a proven veteran figures to be in the cards. Yates had a stellar season closing for the Rangers, and while he may look for a role with a contender as he enters his age-38 season, a team like the Rockies might try to bring him in to stabilize the back of the bullpen."
MLB News,This team is eyeing top infielder -- and how many elite starters?,https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-rumors-trades-and-signings,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 21:35:00 GMT",LATEST FREE AGENT & TRADE RUMORS,"MLB.com We're keeping track of all the latest free agent and trade rumors. Boston is showing ""strong interest"" in All-Star shortstop Willy Adames, per a report from USA Today's Bob Nightengale -- but that's not all. Along with pursuing Adames, who is coming off a career-best 32-homer, 112-RBI campaign for the Brewers, the Red Sox are in the market for multiple starting pitchers. Nightengale indicates that Boston wants to sign two pitchers from the star free-agent trio of Corbin Burnes, Blake Snell and Max Fried. More > The Phillies and White Sox have discussed potential trade packages for left-handed ace Garrett Crochet that include Phillies All-Star third baseman Alec Bohm and highly touted outfield prospect Justin Crawford, per a report from USA Today's Bob Nightengale. More > The Braves could look to add an outfielder in free agency after non-tendering Ramón Laureano last week, Ken Rosenthal reports for The Athletic (subscription required). According to Rosenthal, the Braves would prefer a left-handed hitting outfielder, because their only current lefty bats are Michael Harris II, Jarred Kelenic, Matt Olson and switch-hitter Ozzie Albies. But they would also be willing to pursue a right-handed hitter. Even though Atlanta's outfield depth is currently thin, Rosenthal writes that the Braves don't necessarily need to go after one of the top-of-the-market outfielders -- Juan Soto, Anthony Santander, Teoscar Hernández and Jurickson Profar -- because Ronald Acuña Jr. is expected to return from his torn ACL a month or two into the 2025 season. The next tier of left-handed-hitting free-agent outfielders that the Braves could pursue includes Michael Conforto, Ben Gamel, Jason Heyward, Travis Jankowski, Max Kepler, David Peralta, Mike Tauchman, Alex Verdugo and Jesse Winker. Right-handed-hitting free-agent outfielders include Mark Canha, Randal Grichuk, Austin Hays, Connor Joe, Manuel Margot, Andrew McCutchen, Tyler O'Neill, Tommy Pham and Michael A. Taylor. The veteran first basemen on the free-agent market could be in demand among teams looking for a more affordable option than Pete Alonso or Christian Walker. The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal reports (subscription required) that the Pirates, Mariners, D-backs and Tigers all could be looking to upgrade at first base, but not for the price tag that Alonso and Walker will likely command. The Nationals could also join that list, although they still might pursue Alonso or Walker. Rosenthal believes that means there could be plenty of demand for first basemen like Paul Goldschmidt, Carlos Santana, Anthony Rizzo, Josh Bell and Justin Turner. It's already known that Juan Soto has had in-person meetings with the Yankees, Mets, Red Sox and Blue Jays, plus he was expected to sit down with both the Phillies and Dodgers. Now, it's time for those teams to make their offers. According to ESPN's Buster Olney, clubs interested in signing Soto could begin extending specific offers in the coming week. That is obviously a significant step in the process, especially since MLB.com's Mark Feinsand has said that ""the feeling around the industry"" is that Soto's decision could be made before the annual Winter Meetings get underway on Dec. 9 in Dallas. The Tigers are interested in free-agent third baseman Alex Bregman, according to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman in an article for the New York Post. Heyman adds that the only club Bregman has played for in the Major Leagues, the Astros, have submitted a contract offer in an effort to re-sign the two-time All-Star, and that the Red Sox have ""inquired and could be a fit for Bregman if they move Rafael Devers to first."" If Bregman was to sign with Detroit, it would reunite him with his former manager in Houston, A.J. Hinch. Hinch was the manager when Bregman and the Astros won the franchise's first World Series title in 2017. With Garrett Crochet headlining the list of potential trade candidates this offseason, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reports in the New York Post that four clubs -- the Orioles, Red Sox, Dodgers and Phillies -- are showing the most interest in acquiring the White Sox left-hander. More > Dodgers right-hander Walker Buehler threw the final pitch of this season at Yankee Stadium, closing out Game 5 of the World Series in the Bronx. Might Yankee Stadium also be where Buehler throws his first pitch in 2025? MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi has been told that there is ""some mutual interest"" between Buehler and the Yankees, who are looking to augment their starting rotation this offseason. More > The Royals and Reds completed a trade Friday headlined by former college teammates, right-handed pitcher Brady Singer and second baseman Jonathan India, heading in opposite directions. The Reds bolster their rotation with Singer, who pitched to a 3.71 ERA over a career-high 179 2/3 innings this season. India, the 2021 National League Rookie of the Year, addresses one of Kansas City's top priorities for this offseason: adding more offense. The Royals also received 25-year-old outfielder Joey Wiemer, who hasn't hit much in his limited time in the big leagues but did record eight outs above average while playing for the Brewers in 2023. The Red Sox are definitely one of the teams vying for Juan Soto. However, will this year's No. 1 free agent actually end up with Boston? MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi said Friday that he will be ""surprised"" if that happens. If Soto does sign elsewhere, the Red Sox will have to pivot to some of the other big bats on the market, and Morosi considers Boston to be one of the top candidates to sign Teoscar Hernández. More > Roki Sasaki isn't the only marquee Japanese pitcher who is expected to make the jump to the Majors this offseason. The 35-year-old Tomoyuki Sugano doesn't possess Sasaki's top-notch velocity, but as a two-time winner of the Sawamura Award -- the Japanese equivalent to the Cy Young Award -- Sugano should have his fair share of suitors. MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi has identified two of them this week: the Angels and the Giants. More > During Friday's edition of Hot Stove, MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi mentioned four possible landing spots for Jack Flaherty this offseason: The Dodgers, Yankees, Padres and Angels. More > The demand is high, but the supply is low. That's the story for teams looking to sign a frontline starting pitcher in free agency this offseason. The best arms available are Corbin Burnes, Blake Snell and Max Fried. You could add Japanese right-hander Roki Sasaki to that group, but he hasn't yet been posted for MLB teams, so he's not officially a free agent at the moment. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. As for those other three pitchers, at least seven teams have been connected to them in recent reports. Dodgers: The reigning World Series champions are one of the teams that have met with Snell already but are also talking to Burnes and Fried, according to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required). They ""like Snell a lot,"" per MLB Network insider Jon Heyman. The Dodgers are considered among the favorites for Sasaki, but Heyman reported last week in the New York Post that L.A. will try to sign one of the Big Three even if they land the Japanese phenom. MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi sees the Dodgers as one of the two leading candidates for Burnes. Red Sox: Like the Dodgers, the Red Sox have met with Snell already but are keeping their options open with Burnes and Fried, Rosenthal reports. Orioles: With Burnes a free agent after spending 2024 with Baltimore, Orioles general manager Mike Elias said Friday that the team’s new ownership group has given him the flexibility to engage with the top starting pitchers on the free-agent market. Rosenthal hears the team is currently more focused on Snell and Fried, both of whom could have lower price tags than Burnes. Blue Jays: Rosenthal reports that Toronto is pursuing Burnes, Snell and Fried. Yankees: Heyman directly mentioned the Yankees' interest in Snell, but he added that New York's willingness to go after one of the top starters may be contingent on whether it can re-sign Juan Soto. Heyman said that if Soto doesn't come back to the Bronx, the Yankees ""will be more focused"" on these aces. But if Soto is back in pinstripes, Heyman thinks the Yankees won't spend the money necessary to get one of the top pitchers. Giants: Heyman said he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if Snell returns to San Francisco after the left-hander enjoyed his time there during the 2024 season. Mets: Another club that's focused on Soto, the Mets will also be looking to upgrade a rotation that could lose Sean Manaea, José Quintana and Luis Severino in free agency. Although outfielder/first baseman Cody Bellinger exercised his player option for 2025, it’s not a guarantee that he’ll be with the Cubs on Opening Day. According to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required), rival executives say that the Cubs want to trade the 29-year-old. More > Juan Soto's decision on where to sign this offseason is the most anticipated in baseball, and according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, ""the feeling around the industry"" is that the decision could be made before the annual Winter Meetings get underway in Dallas on Dec. 9. Soto reportedly has already met with the Blue Jays, Red Sox, Mets and incumbent Yankees. Yanks owner Hal Steinbrenner confirmed Wednesday that the club had a ""good meeting"" with Soto. Soto has a couple more meetings reportedly on tap. He is scheduled to meet with the Dodgers next. And according to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman, the Phillies plan to meet with Soto at some point, though nothing has been scheduled yet. Per Heyman, it's believed that no offers have been made to Soto yet. You can follow the latest rumblings on Soto here. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said Wednesday that Sasaki is expected to be part of the 2025 international amateur signing class, which means the Japanese right-hander likely won't sign with a club before Jan. 15. ""It looks like ... the signing will happen in the new pool period,"" Manfred said via The Athletic's Evan Drelich. More > Thirteen players were tendered a qualifying offer (a one-year, $21.05 million deal for 2025) this offseason, but Reds right-hander Nick Martinez was the only one who accepted prior to Tuesday's 4 p.m. ET deadline. The following 12 players rejected the qualifying offer and will remain free agents: Since the system was implemented in 2012, only 14 players to receive a QO have accepted it. You can read more about year's QO decisions here. The Orioles could be one of the big players on the free-agent market for starting pitchers in their first offseason under their new ownership group. General manager Mike Elias said Friday that the Orioles have ""engaged"" in conversations with high-end starting pitchers in free agency. ""We are looking at the whole menu, the whole spectrum and I credit the ownership change toward putting us in a position to do that,"" Elias said. The highest of the high-end starters on the open market is Corbin Burnes, and the Orioles would welcome his return to Baltimore, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan (subscription required). The Orioles also have been linked to left-handed ace Max Fried. Additionally, Baltimore is among a host of clubs interested in acquiring White Sox southpaw Garrett Crochet via trade. However, given all of the young talent they have traded in the past year, The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required) hears that the O's are more focused on the free-agent market right now. Yankees broadcaster Michael Kay said on his radio program on Monday that according to a source, Mets owner Steve Cohen is willing to beat any other club's offer to Juan Soto by $50 million. More > MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reports in an article for the New York Post that the Yankees met with superstar slugger Juan Soto in Southern California on Monday as they look to retain him after he helped lead them to the World Series. More > The Red Sox have reportedly made their pitch -- or at least an initial one -- to Juan Soto. They are also trying to convince the top starting pitchers on the market to come to Fenway, too. ESPN's Jeff Passan said during Friday's edition of the Baseball Bar-B-Cast podcast that the Red Sox are talking to Blake Snell and Max Fried. More > Willy Adames is drawing “broad” interest across the Majors, according to MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi. While Adames’ market includes teams that have an opening at shortstop, there are also a number of clubs eyeing him as a third baseman. More > With Max Fried and Charlie Morton both free agents, adding rotation help is a priority for the Braves this offseason. Nathan Eovaldi ranks near the top of Atlanta’s wish list (per a source), but he isn’t the only free-agent starter the team is said to be considering, as MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi hears the Braves also have interest in Walker Buehler. Returning from his second Tommy John surgery, Buehler struggled to the tune of a 5.38 ERA over 16 starts this past season. However, he finished the year on a high note, tossing 10 straight scoreless innings in the postseason and closing out the Dodgers’ title-clinching win over the Yankees in Game 5 of the World Series. Buehler, 30, was one of baseball’s top starters from 2018-21, recording a 2.82 ERA (146 ERA+) with 620 strikeouts and 137 walks in 564 innings. Atlanta could be an attractive landing spot for Buehler in more ways than one. The right-hander has ties to two nearby states, as he was born in Kentucky and attended Vanderbilt in Tennessee. Buehler also just watched the Braves have success with another reclamation project, Chris Sale. Atlanta acquired Sale from the Red Sox last offseason after several injury-plagued seasons. The lefty stayed healthy in 2024 and is the overwhelming favorite to win the National League Cy Young Award. In addition to their interest in Eovaldi and Buehler, the Braves have been linked to White Sox lefty Garrett Crochet on the trade market, though it's unclear if they have enough prospect capital to swing a trade. Fried is still a possibility, too, but paying top dollar for free agents is not part of president of baseball operations Alex Anthopoulos’ typical M.O. MLB Trade Rumors predicts Fried will sign a six-year, $156 million contract, compared to one year, $15 million for Buehler and two years, $44 million for Eovaldi."
MLB News,Could this team trade All-Star 3B to land Crochet? (report),https://www.mlb.com/news/garrett-crochet-rumors,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 15:55:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of the latest news and trade rumors surrounding Garrett Crochet. Nov. 25: Phils have had 'extensive talks' with White SoxThe Phillies and White Sox have discussed potential packages for Crochet that include All-Star third baseman Alec Bohm and highly touted outfield prospect Justin Crawford, per a report from USA Today's Bob Nightengale. Crawford is Philadelphia's No. 3 prospect, per MLB Pipeline, while Bohm is coming off his best season in the big leagues. The 28-year-old Bohm hit .295 with an .830 OPS in the first half on his way to his first career All-Star selection, but he put up just a .681 OPS following the break. The White Sox reportedly have some hesitation about that second-half dip, though Bohm has been a streaky hitter during his time in the big leagues. He's also had his troubles defensively, though he's coming off a much-improved showing at the hot corner in 2024. Nov. 22: These teams seem most interested in CrochetWith Crochet headlining the list of potential trade candidates this offseason, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman says four clubs -- the Orioles, Red Sox, Dodgers and Phillies -- are showing the most interest in acquiring the White Sox left-hander. Heyman wrote for the New York Post that the O's and Red Sox are in prime position to strike a deal based on the position-player talent that Chicago is likely seeking in return. Of course, there's still plenty of time for another team to enter the mix, with Heyman noting that others have also expressed interest. Nov. 13: These clubs could be involved in trade market for CrochetAlthough the White Sox didn't move Crochet prior to the Trade Deadline, there appears to be little doubt about their intentions for the left-hander this offseason. ""They're going to trade him this winter,"" a rival evaluator told ESPN's Buster Olney at the GM Meetings last week. ""It's not a matter of if; it's a question of when."" Olney shed some light on Crochet's potential market in an article for ESPN+ (subscription required) on Wednesday, noting that general manager Chris Getz is looking for ""a package of prospects constructed around at least one high-ceiling youngster to anchor the deal."" Chicago's preference is for that main piece to be a position player, but the team is open to a pitcher being the centerpiece, ""depending on the depth and quality of the prospects offered."" Based on conversations with industry sources, Olney names the Phillies, Padres, Yankees, Dodgers, Braves, Orioles, Red Sox and Mets as teams that could pursue a Crochet trade. Nov. 9: Mets showing interest in trading for Crochet (report)According to a report in the New York Post, the Mets are ""discussing"" Crochet, who is one of the most likely players to be traded this offseason. It would stand to reason given that three of New York's starters from 2024 -- Sean Manaea, Jose Quintana and Luis Severino -- are free agents. Though the Mets are certainly in position to spend big this offseason, Crochet would be considerably cheaper in his remaining arbitration years than spending toward the top of the free agent pitching market. Nov. 7: Crochet garnering trade interest from many clubs, but one stands outThe White Sox held on to Crochet through the 2024 Trade Deadline when they were receiving calls from many teams interested in acquiring the fireballing left-hander. Now, an even greater number of clubs are trying to maneuver a deal for Crochet, general manager Chris Getz said during this week's General Managers Meetings. Crochet entered this season with only 73 big league innings under his belt over parts of three seasons and a lengthy injury history. But from Opening Day on, he proved he could be an ace. Crochet received his first Major League start in that season opener and proceeded to strike out eight batters and allow one run over six innings. He eventually became a first-time All-Star and ended the season with 209 strikeouts in 146 innings. Given that big jump in innings, Crochet's workload was capped over the final few months of the season. He made it through the year without a stint on the injured list. What do the White Sox want in return for Crochet, who has two years of club control remaining? Getz has made it pretty clear. ""We need to improve our offense, it’s very clear,” he told reporters Tuesday. “With any trade or free agency, we are looking for ways to improve our offense."" One team that could be a match for Chicago in a Crochet trade is the Boston Red Sox. The Red Sox have six position players on MLB Pipeline's Top 100 Prospects list, including three in the top 10. They also have a few attractive pieces already at the big league level who are not yet eligible for arbitration. That group includes first baseman Triston Casas, catcher Connor Wong and Gold Glove outfielder Wilyer Abreu. With so much high-quality position-player depth, ""there’s a widespread sense that the Sox can trade for nearly anyone,"" according to The Boston Globe's Alex Speier (subscription required). MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi said Thursday from the GM Meetings that the Red Sox are ""the team I think a lot of people around here are looking at very carefully"" regarding a Crochet trade."
MLB News,Next year's Rookie of the Year winners will be ...,https://www.mlb.com/news/early-candidates-for-2025-rookie-of-the-year,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 01:00:00 GMT",,"Joe Trezza With Paul Skenes and Luis Gil taking home their leagues' respective 2024 Rookie of the Year Awards, it's time to turn our attention to 2025. On the latest edition of the MLB Pipeline Podcast, Jim Callis and Jonathan Mayo filled out their hypothetical ballots for the year ahead, selecting the players they believe could take home the hardware next season. In the 2022 version of this exercise, the experts correctly predicted Gunnar Henderson and Corbin Carroll, then the game's top two prospects, would take the honors the following year. But last year, in a mock draft format, Skenes wasn't selected until Round 4 and nobody tabbed Gil as a serious American League contender. More from MLB Pipeline:• Top 100 prospects | Stats | Video | Podcast | Complete coverage Here's how they picked this time around: NATIONAL LEAGUE 1. Mayo: Dylan Crews, OF (WSH No. 1/MLB No.1)The equation when we're contemplating these things is ability plus opportunity. He got called up. He has a place in the Nationals' outfield. He got a good amount of reps so he knows what he needs to work on. To me, Dylan Crews manning the outfield for the Nationals every day, is as good a choice as any in the National League. Callis: CrewsI concur. I also have Crews as my top National League choice ... until Roki Sasaki signs with the Dodgers, Padres or Mets. 2. Callis: Matt Shaw, INF (CHC No. 1/MLB No. 22)I don't think he'll make the Opening Day roster because the Cubs have a crowded roster of veterans. But he just kept getting better in his first pro season, and he played really well with Premier12. I think he can really, really hit and he's going to rise quickly. Mayo: Bubba Chandler, RHP (PIT No. 1/MLB No. 15)The Pirates are going to rinse and repeat. I don't think he'll be up on Opening Day, but the way he finished the year has me thinking he'll be pounding down that door early on from Triple-A Indianapolis, and he'll join Paul Skenes, Jared Jones and Mitch Keller in the Pirates rotation sometime around May. 3. Callis: Andrew Painter, RHP (PHI No. 2/MLB No. 32)I picked Andrew Painter over Dalton Rushing for my third spot. I think Andrew Painter is going to make a difference for the Phillies. I don’t think we’ll see him on the Opening Day roster. I think they’ll break him in. But he’s spectacular in shorter bursts than the other guys. Mayo: ShawEverything you said about Shaw holds true. He’s going to hit his way into that lineup and make a big impact in Chicago. AMERICAN LEAGUE 1. Callis: Coby Mayo, 3B/1B (BAL No. 1/MLB No. 8)He's going to need opportunity. The Orioles are going to have to make some decisions because they have more guys than position spots. But I do think Cody Mayo is going to hit 26 home runs as the American League Rookie of the Year. That's my prediction, 26 home runs. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Mayo: MayoI think they're going to need to find a way to get that bat in the lineup. There is no reason for him to be in Triple-A, and I'm taking the over on the home run total. 2. Mayo: Jackson Jobe, RHP (DET No. 1/MLB No. 5)I think he is ready to make a full-season impact on the Detroit Tigers' pitching staff, help them continue on after a surprisingly succesful year where they made the postseason in 2024. I think he becomes a mainstay in the rotation behind Tarik Skubal. Callis: Jasson Domínguez, OF (NYY No. 1/MLB No. 14)I think the Yankees will find a way to get him regular at-bats. He's been very impressive in short bursts here and there. He's still very young. 3. Callis: Jacob Wilson, SS (ATH No. 1/MLB No. 24)We saw him this year, he was banged up a little bit, so he didn't lose his rookie eligibility. We know he can hit, right? I don't know how much power there will be necessarily. But I'll assume he's going to hit .280 or higher. The guy hits everywhere he goes and plays a steady shortstop. I don't know why that made Jonathan chuckle. Mayo: WilsonI chuckled because you knew who my No. 3 guy was. You stole my pick."
MLB News,8 free agents who raised their stock after 1-year deals in '24,https://www.mlb.com/news/2024-2025-mlb-free-agents-coming-off-one-year-deals,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 03:16:26 GMT",,"Thomas Harrigan Juan Soto, Corbin Burnes, Willy Adames and Max Fried headline the list of players who are free agents for the first time this offseason. Also part of this class? An intriguing group of stars who are no strangers to the process, having navigated free agency just last year. MLB offseason signings and trades• Latest free-agent and trade rumors• Top 25 free agents | Every free agent, by position• Tracking every team's offseason moves• FA guides: Soto | Burnes | Alonso | Snell | Bregman | Fried | Santander• Offseason dates, rules & terms explained For various reasons, the eight players below signed one-year contracts (or multiyear deals with options that allowed them to hit the open market after 2024) following the 2023 campaign. All of them improved their stock this past season and now get a chance to test free agency again in search of a better outcome. Blake Snell, SP Why his stock was down last offseason: Snell had an incredible 2023 season for the Padres, winning Cy Young honors for the second time in his career after posting an MLB-best 2.25 ERA with 234 strikeouts. However, questions about the lefty’s consistency, control and durability, not to mention the Draft compensation tied to him after he rejected a qualifying offer, combined to depress his market. He remained unsigned for months until inking a two-year, $62 million deal (with an opt-out after 2024) with the Giants on March 19. Why his stock has improved: Concerns about Snell’s durability haven’t gone away after he made two trips to the injured list and threw only 104 innings in 2024. He also got off to a rough start after not having time to properly build up for the season. But Snell’s performance over his final 14 starts reaffirmed his stature as one of MLB’s best starters, as he posted a 1.23 ERA with a .123 opponents’ batting average. On the year, Snell placed in the 98th percentile in whiff rate and strikeout rate and the 99th percentile in hard-hit rate allowed, and he shaved 2.8 percentage points off his sky-high walk rate from 2023 (13.3%). Plus, he was ineligible to receive another qualifying offer this offseason, which means he isn’t tied to Draft compensation. You can read more about Snell’s improved free-agent case here. Teoscar Hernández, OF Why his stock was down last offseason: Hernández’s production regressed after he was traded from the Blue Jays to the Mariners prior to the 2023 season. Although he put up 26 homers with 93 RBIs, he also struck out 211 times and had a .741 OPS with a 108 OPS+ -- down from a 138 OPS+ across 2020-22. He landed with the Dodgers on a one-year, $23.5 million deal in January. Why his stock has improved: Going from pitcher-friendly T-Mobile Park to Dodger Stadium worked wonders for Hernández, whose numbers improved across the board. The right-handed slugger ended up slashing .272/.339/.501 (137 OPS+) with 33 homers and 99 RBIs over 154 games during the regular season and drove in 12 runs over 16 playoff games as Los Angeles won the World Series. Especially encouraging was the leap he made against breaking pitches -- he slugged .516 with 17 homers on those pitches in 2024, up from just eight homers and a .317 SLG in 2022-23. Jack Flaherty SP Why his stock was down last offseason: Flaherty showed ace potential in 2018-19 (3.01 ERA, 10.7 K/9), but he followed that up with a 4.42 ERA across 2020-23, missing significant time due to injury in that span. Flaherty managed to avoid the IL in 2023, but he put up a 4.99 ERA with a 1.58 WHIP and a 2.24 K/BB ratio over 144 1/3 innings between the Cardinals and Orioles. The right-hander signed a one-year, $14 million deal with the Tigers in December. Why his stock has improved: Perhaps no starting pitcher improved more from 2023 to 2024 than Flaherty, who notched a 3.17 ERA with 194 strikeouts and 38 walks (5.11 K/BB) over 162 innings between the Tigers and Dodgers. Year over year, Flaherty had the fifth-largest increase in strikeout rate (+7.1 points), the 10th-largest increase in whiff rate (+5.5 points) and the 10th-largest decrease in walk rate (+4.3 points) among qualifying pitchers. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Sean Manaea, SP Why his stock was down last offseason: After recording a career-high 4.96 ERA over 158 innings for the Padres in 2022, Manaea signed with the Giants as a free agent and spent 2023 pitching mostly as a bulk reliever in tandem with an opener. He threw 117 2/3 innings on the year and notched a 4.44 ERA, then opted out of the final year on his deal with San Francisco to test free agency again. The Mets signed the veteran southpaw to a two-year, $28 million deal with an opt-out after 2024. Why his stock has improved: Manaea was solid enough over his first 20 starts for New York, but he really took off after tweaking his arm slot to emulate Braves ace Chris Sale’s crossfire delivery in July. Manaea recorded a 3.09 ERA with 83 strikeouts and 18 walks over 75 2/3 innings in 12 regular-season starts after the change. He was key to New York's run to the NL Championship Series, with a 2.65 ERA in his first three postseason starts before running out of steam in NLCS Game 6. As expected, he opted out of his contract with the Mets and is back on the free-agent market for the third straight offseason. Luis Severino, SP Why his stock was down last offseason: Severino emerged as one of the game’s top young starters in 2017-18 (3.18 ERA, 10.5 K/9), but injuries ultimately derailed his career with the Yankees. Over his final five seasons with the team, he managed to pitch only 209 1/3 innings. On top of that, he struggled to the tune of a 6.65 ERA with 23 homers allowed over 89 1/3 innings (2.3 HR/9) in his last year before free agency. He left the Yankees to sign a one-year, $13 million deal with the crosstown Mets in December. Why his stock has improved: Although he didn’t quite recapture his peak form, Severino stayed healthy and made dramatic strides in the run-prevention department in 2024. The 30-year-old started 31 games -- his most since 2018 -- and recorded a 3.91 ERA with a 1.1 HR/9 over 182 innings. Severino’s new sweeper was one of the keys to his turnaround, holding hitters to a .139 average with a .238 SLG and inducing 60 strikeouts over 135 plate appearances. Jurickson Profar, OF Why his stock was down last offseason: Profar, who has gone from baseball’s top overall prospect to a journeyman outfielder, was MLB’s least valuable player (-1.6 WAR, per FanGraphs) in 2023. The veteran finished with nine homers and an 81 OPS+ in 125 games between the Rockies (who released him in August) and Padres before returning to San Diego on a one-year, $1 million deal in February. Why his stock has improved: Profar delivered the best season of his 11-year career in 2024, earning an All-Star starting nod and hitting .280 with 24 homers, 85 RBIs, an .839 OPS and 4.3 fWAR -- all career highs. His performance as San Diego’s starting left fielder was critical after the Padres traded superstar slugger Juan Soto to the Yankees to bolster their pitching staff in December. He logged 121 of his 158 starts batting first, second or third in the Padres' order. Joc Pederson, DH Why his stock was down last offseason: After registering 23 homers and a 146 OPS+ for the Giants in 2022, Pederson accepted the club’s qualifying offer to return to San Francisco for the following campaign. However, his second year in the Bay Area wasn’t nearly as impressive, as he produced 15 homers with a 112 OPS+. Given his defensive limitations and struggles against left-handed pitching, it’s not exactly a surprise that he didn’t have a robust market in free agency on the heels of that performance at the age of 31. Pederson joined the D-backs on a one-year, $12.5 million deal with a 2025 mutual option on Jan. 30. Why his stock has improved: Pederson not only rebounded with Arizona, he delivered one of the best years of his career with the bat, recording personal bests in batting average (.275), on-base percentage (.393) and OPS (.908) while slugging 23 homers in 449 plate appearances. Among hitters with at least 400 PAs in 2024, Pederson’s 151 wRC+ tied him with teammate Ketel Marte -- the third-place finisher in the NL MVP voting -- for 10th in MLB. He was worth 3.0 fWAR despite serving as a full-time DH and handling a strict platoon role that only allotted him 105 starts all year. Matthew Boyd, SP Why his stock was down last offseason: Boyd has been a serviceable back-end starter during his career, peaking in 2019 with 238 K’s, an 11.6 K/9 average and 3.2 fWAR for the Tigers. But after undergoing Tommy John surgery in 2023, the left-hander went unsigned as a free agent last offseason. He didn’t join a team until he signed a one-year deal with the Guardians this past June. Why his stock has improved: Boyd made his 2024 debut on Aug. 13 and gave Cleveland’s shorthanded starting staff a lift with a 2.72 ERA, 46 K’s and 13 BB’s in 39 2/3 innings over eight starts. He added a 0.77 ERA and 14 strikeouts across 11 2/3 innings in the postseason, helping the Guardians reach the AL Championship Series."
MLB News,Walker instills joy of reading in young Cardinals fans,https://www.mlb.com/news/jordan-walker-cardinals-give-back-to-community,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 19:00:55 GMT",,"John Denton This story was excerpted from John Denton’s Cardinals Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. In the days leading up to LifeWise STL’s early-April reading and math event with Cardinals slugger Jordan Walker and more than 50 area school kids, president and CEO Scott Walker wondered how intimidated and in awe the children would be upon seeing Walker in person. Within minutes of the event starting, the 22-year-old Cards right fielder had put LifeWise STL’s leadership team – and more importantly, the school children surrounding him – at ease with his megawatt smile and warm, welcoming persona. It is a memory that Scott Walker said will always stay with him from one of LifeWise STL’s most successful events of the year. “He is a tall young man, but he was amazing with the kids,” Scott Walker said of Jordan. “He was a natural with the kids with the way he related to them. Sometimes folks can be uncomfortable with 50 to 60 kids around them, but he got down at their level, was eye to eye with them and interacted in amazing ways. Like I said, he was a natural.” Walker, who made his MLB debut in 2023 and set a league record for players under 21 with hits in his first 12 games as a 20-year-old rookie, hails from a highly educated family that has always placed an importance on schooling. His father, Derek, holds degrees from Harvard and MIT, while mother, Katrina, graduated with honors from Harvard and Washington University in St. Louis. Following a stellar high school baseball career, Walker was headed to Duke University on a scholarship prior to being selected in the first round of the 2020 MLB Draft by the Cardinals. Walker told the kids in April and again in September, when approximately 200 high-achieving scholars were awarded a night at Busch Stadium to watch Walker play, that learning and growing have been keys to his success. “Walker’s Winners,” an event designed to motivate school-aged children from pre-K through 12th grade to set long-range reading and math goals, proved to be a highly effective catalyst. Those students read, on average, slightly more than 13 books thanks in part to the motivation provided by the program set up and orchestrated by LifeWise STL, Ready Readers, Cardinals Care and the Walker family. Most importantly, Scott Walker said, the push to continue reading helped scholars avoid the dreaded “summer slide,” a phenomenon where students fall back academically over the summer months while not sharpening their reading and math skills. On the September night when the group hit Busch Stadium for a game and free food, it was fittingly seated near Walker’s right-field position so the children could watch their mentor in action. “We were situated in a spot where when Jordan was out on the field, he was right there by us, and for the kids to see him live and in action, it was amazing for them,” Scott Walker said. “For a lot of these scholars, it was their first time going to a game. To be able to see a person in the gym with them at LifeWise and then see them in action at their professional setting, it was a great connection for them, and they were thrilled.” Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. With Thanksgiving coming on Thursday and the season of giving upon us, MLB.com wanted to highlight instances of Cardinals players like Jordan Walker giving their time to help others in need. Here is some of the admirable work the Cardinals have done in recent weeks and are planning this holiday season: • This past week, members of the Cardinals’ organization visited the new Cardinals-themed Family Room at the Ronald McDonald House to spread pre-holiday cheer. Team mascot Fredbird distributed memorabilia and interacted with families. • The Cardinals supported several veterans/military organizations, and on Nov. 11, team alumni Scott Terry and Lonnie Maclin visited and dined with the Missouri Veterans Endeavor (MOVE). • In addition to a grant in support of MOVE, grants either have been or will be provided to The Kaufmann Fund, Trees for Vets Program, Got Your Six Support Dogs, St. Louis Service Women’s Post 404, Armed Services YMCA, the Women Warriors Baby Shower and the Veteran Community Project to furnish tiny homes for veterans. Cardinals standout Brendan Donovan, someone whose life was profoundly shaped by his family’s commitment to military service, supported the Houses for Veterans’ event with his time and financial resources. • On Dec. 4, the Cardinals will kick off their annual holiday gift drive. Two days later, Cardinals alumni and front office personnel, led for years by president of baseball operations John Mozeliak, will ring Salvation Army bells in front of local businesses as part of the Red Kettle campaign for 2024. • The Cardinals, the St. Louis chapter of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America and the National Marrow Donor Program are in the midst of the annual Join4Joe blood stem cell donor drive, an annual blood stem cell donor drive to add individuals to the NMDP Registry. Growing the registry increases the chances of finding donor matches for patients awaiting a life-saving blood stem cell or bone marrow transplant. The campaign was organized to honor the legacy of Joe Strauss, a longtime Cardinals beat writer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch who passed away in December 2015 after a leukemia battle."
MLB News,"Talk about offseason buzz! Triple-A Salt Lake Bees unveil new logos, uniforms",https://www.mlb.com/news/angels-affiliate-salt-lake-bees-unveil-new-logos-and-uniforms,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 17:08:00 GMT",,"Benjamin Hill ""It's a refresh, not a rebrand. We would say it's an evolution, not a revolution."" That's how Ashley Havili, VP of marketing and merchandise for the Salt Lake Bees, describes her team's new logos and uniforms. The Triple-A Angels affiliate unveiled its refreshed look on Monday, checking off a key item on the offseason to-do list in advance of moving to new Daybreak Field in 2025. Today's Salt Lake Bees were established in the Pacific Coast League in 1994, playing as the bee-adjacent Buzz (1994-2000) and Stingers (2001-05) before adopting their current moniker in 2006. Utah is the Beehive State, and the Bees name has long been utilized by Salt Lake City's professional baseball team. The first iteration of the Bees debuted in 1915 and they, too, were members of the Pacific Coast League. ""We're moving to a new ballpark in the southwest quadrant of the [Salt Lake] Valley. With the move, do we completely go through a rebrand and come up with a new identity for the team? Or do we stay the Bees?"" said Havili. ""[The Bees] are one of Utah's most beloved and recognizable brands. Instead of pivoting and abandoning the brand equity that we've built, we decided to lean into it."" The Bees color palette remains predominantly black and gold, with the addition of an ""Angels red"" accent color that appears on the sleeve patch as well as the sleeve trim of a cream colored alternate uniform. A new custom primary script, black with yellow accents, is displayed on the home and black alternate jerseys. The primary logo, meanwhile, prominently features Bumble, the Bees mascot. ""Bumble is our most famous player, because it's Minor League Baseball,"" said Havili. ""There's so much transition with the players, they come and go. But Bumble is an icon for us. He's a little bit more serious of a bee now, like a killer bee, but he's really fun. He's going to be on our on-field hat, which will probably be one of our most popular."" The Bees' new look is packed with references to franchise history and Salt Lake City's baseball legacy. The interlocking SL ligature references is modeled after the look of the original Bees teams of the early 20th century, while also paying tribute to Salt Lake's '70s and '80s era Gulls and Trappers teams. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. The ""flat bee"" secondary mark, in which the bee's body is comprised of a hive and a baseball, is also a nod to the original Bees teams, while a logo featuring Bees script running diagonally through the state of Utah is modeled after a design used by the parent Angels from 1971-85. The new-look Bees will open their 2025 season on the road in El Paso on March 28, with the first game at Daybreak Field scheduled for April 8. ""This new brand will be infused throughout the new ballpark,"" said Havili. ""The Bees will live on."""
MLB News,Offers could start rolling in for Soto soon (report),https://www.mlb.com/news/juan-soto-rumors,"Sun, 24 Nov 2024 20:06:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of the latest news and rumors surrounding Juan Soto. Nov. 24: Offers expected soon for Soto (report)To this point, Soto's free agency has been about meeting with teams and hearing their general pitch -- but that could be about to change. The Soto sweepstakes is on the verge of heating up as clubs are expected to start extending actual offers in the coming week, according to a report from ESPN's Buster Olney. Soto has either had or is expected to have meetings with the Yankees, Mets, Red Sox, Blue Jays, Phillies and Dodgers. Nov. 20: Soto has 'good meeting' with YankeesThe Yankees met with Soto on Monday in California, and team owner Hal Steinbrenner confirmed Wednesday that it was a ""good meeting"" with ""very honest back-and-forth dialogue."" Steinbrenner said that Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, manager Aaron Boone, president Randy Levine, and special assistant to the GM Omar Minaya were all in attendance during Monday's meeting. But he didn't divulge any part of the team's pitch to Soto or say if any offers were made during the meeting. ""It's been a priority,"" Steinbrenner said about signing Soto. ""We wouldn't have gone out to the West Coast if it wasn't. ... We'll be in the mix. I'll leave it at that."" As of Wednesday, Soto has had in-person meetings with the Yankees, Mets, Red Sox and Blue Jays. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Tuesday that Soto will also meet with the Phillies at some point. Soto also plans to sit down with the Dodgers this week, according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. Steinbrenner said he has ""no idea"" if the Yankees will meet with Soto again or if he's confident that the club can re-sign the 26-year-old superstar. But he added, ""[W]e've got the ability to sign any player we want to sign."" Nov. 19: Phillies plan to meet with Soto (report)Yet another team has emerged as a potential suitor for Soto: the Philadelphia Phillies. According to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman, the Phils plan to meet with Soto at some point, though nothing has been scheduled yet. Soto reportedly has already met with the Blue Jays, Red Sox, Mets and incumbent Yankees and is scheduled to meet with the Dodgers next. Per Heyman, it's believed that no offers have been made to Soto yet. The Phillies already have one of the most complete rosters of any MLB team, but they are looking for ways to improve after failing to advance past the National League Division Series in 2024. Phillies ownership has shown a willingness to pay up for some of the top free agents on the market, with Bryce Harper, Trea Turner, Zack Wheeler, J.T. Realmuto, Aaron Nola, Nick Castellanos and Kyle Schwarber all signing lucrative deals with Philadelphia in free agency. Phillies managing partner and CEO John Middleton was candid in addressing Soto's market earlier this month, saying that he believes the outfielder wants to be in New York but adding that Philadelphia could get involved in the bidding anyway as a ""stalking horse."" Nov. 18: Cohen to best any Soto offer by $50 million (report)Yankees broadcaster Michael Kay said on his radio program on Monday that according to a source, Mets owner Steve Cohen is willing to beat any other club's offer to Soto by $50 million. ""I'll put it this way,"" Kay said. ""And I don't think this is something Yankees fans are going to want to hear. I don't think the Yankees are going to go [up to $700 million]. I don't. And then I've heard from somebody in baseball today that Cohen is willing to go $50 million over whatever anybody offers. So it looks like the Mets really want to get this guy."" Nov. 18: Dodgers expected to meet with Soto this weekSoto's decision on where to sign this offseason is the most anticipated in baseball, and according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, ""the feeling around the industry"" is that the decision could be made before the annual Winter Meetings get underway in Dallas on Dec. 9. Feinsand also writes that the Dodgers are expected to be the next team to meet with Soto, with plans to sit down with the superstar slugger sometime this week and perhaps as early as Tuesday. More > Nov. 18: Yanks meet with Soto (report)MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reports in an article for the New York Post that the Yankees met with superstar slugger Juan Soto in Southern California on Monday as they look to retain him after he helped lead them to the World Series. More > Nov 16: Blue Jays, Red Sox and Mets have met with Soto (reports)The Red Sox met with Soto and his representatives, including agent Scott Boras, in Southern California on Thursday night, according to a report from Sean McAdam of MassLive. It appears they aren't the only club that has chatted with the 26-year-old superstar. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Saturday morning that the Blue Jays, along with Boston, have made ""impressive in-person presentations"" to Soto. Heyman later added another team to the list, reporting that the Mets met with Soto on Saturday. He noted that ""all early signs suggest the meeting went extremely well,"" and that owner Steve Cohen and other ""high-ranking Mets officials"" made the trip. The Red Sox's meeting with Soto, which was of an introductory and informative nature, per McAdam, lasted for three hours and was deemed as “productive,” though neither money nor terms were discussed between the parties. Soto was reportedly “impressed” by Boston’s presentation, which included a video noting the franchise’s history of star players from the Dominican Republic, Soto’s native country. The Red Sox also detailed their plans for the future, highlighting a promising group of prospects who could potentially team up with Soto to help the club be successful in the years to come.

MLB News,Breaking down the Yusei Kikuchi deal from all sides,https://www.mlb.com/news/yusei-kikuchi-signing-with-angels-analysis,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 18:00:10 GMT",,"MLB.com We finally have our first major free agent deal of the offseason. After a slow first few weeks of free agency, news broke on Monday morning that the Angels had agreed to a three-year, $63 million contract with left-hander Yusei Kikuchi. (The club has not confirmed the deal.) The 33-year-old, who jumped from Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball to the Majors in 2019, is now entering his seventh MLB season. He pitched for the Mariners from 2019-21 (making his lone All-Star team in ‘21), then signed with the Blue Jays in 2022. Toronto dealt him at the 2024 Trade Deadline to Houston, where Kikuchi authored one of the best stretches of his career to help the Astros nail down the AL West title. Excluding right-hander Michael Wacha, who agreed to an extension with the Royals before officially becoming a free agent, Kikuchi is the first player from MLB.com senior national reporter Mark Feinsand’s top 25 free agents list to pick a team. Kikuchi ranked 20th on that list, and ninth among a stacked group of starting pitchers. He now joins the Angels, the busiest team of this young offseason. The Halos, looking to snap a 10-season playoff drought, already acquired slugger Jorge Soler in a trade with the Braves and inked catcher Travis d’Arnaud, infielder Kevin Newman and right-hander Kyle Hendricks to modest free-agent deals. But Kikuchi is their most significant acquisition to date. Kikuchi by the numbers 2024: 32 GS, 175.2 IP, 4.05 ERA (99 ERA+), 3.46 FIP, 3.5 fWARCareer: 154 GS, 809.2 IP, 4.57 ERA (91 ERA+), 4.53 FIP, 7.5 fWAR Here is a breakdown of this move from all angles, via MLB.com experts: What this means for the AngelsVia Angels beat writer Rhett Bollinger The Angels have been the most aggressive club in free agency this offseason and kept it up with their first big splash. The deal is the largest since Perry Minasian became general manager in 2020. Kikuchi represents a solid upgrade to the rotation after the Angels also signed Hendricks to a one-year deal worth $2.5 million. Kikuchi immediately becomes the club's best starting pitcher and can help the Angels compete after their 99-loss campaign in ‘24. Kikuchi joins a rotation that includes lefty Tyler Anderson, right-handers José Soriano and Jack Kochanowicz and Hendricks. The fifth spot is up for grabs and the Angels have several internal candidates, such as Reid Detmers, Chase Silseth, Caden Dana and Sam Aldegheri. MORE > What this means for the AstrosVia Astros beat writer Brian McTaggart The Astros were interested in a reunion and had made an offer to Kikuchi, whom they acquired in a July trade. He excelled after coming over from the Blue Jays, going 5-1 with a 2.70 ERA with 76 strikeouts in 60 innings in 10 starts after the Astros altered his pitch usage. The Astros’ rotation, anchored by Framber Valdez, Hunter Brown and Ronel Blanco, should still be a strength next year, but they still could use more depth. Kikuchi would have filled that void, but the Astros believed the price and years were too much for a mid-level starting pitcher like Kikuchi. Hot Stove implicationsVia senior national reporter Mark Feinsand The Angels were among the teams in the market for a starting pitcher, so the Kikuchi signing was no surprise. His signing takes one of the second-tier starters off the market, potentially setting the price range for some of the others in that group including Jack Flaherty, Sean Manaea and Nathan Eovaldi. Kikuchi is the first starting pitching domino to fall, but there are still plenty of pitchers out there for teams looking to upgrade their rotations. Diving deepVia analyst Mike Petriello Last year’s Angels rotation had the third-highest ERA in MLB, and 2025’s Angels rotation was, as of Sunday evening, projected to be the fourth-weakest in baseball. So yes, they desperately needed starting pitching – even if it’s not quite clear if this winter’s early-offseason strategy of signing lots of low-to-mid-level veterans with names you know is what’s going to get the team back from 99 losses to its first winning season since 2015. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Kikuchi likely becomes their Opening Day starter, which is both a reflection of how strong he was after being traded to the Astros last summer and how weak the incumbent Halos group was. The left-hander has always been a talented-yet-frustrating pitcher. At the time the Jays traded him south, he had a 4.72 career ERA, interspersing periods of quality with three different seasons with an ERA north of 5.00. But Kikuchi more than doubled his slider usage with Houston, mostly dumping his ineffective curveball, and saw his strikeout rate jump from 26% to 32%. That change, pairing the slider with a fastball that usually rates very well in pitch modeling metrics, might be real. But the drop in ERA from 4.75 (Toronto) to 2.70 (Houston) is at least in part fueled by his batting average on balls in play (BABIP) dropping by 100 points, an improvement that may be difficult to retain in front of a below-average Angels defense. Turning 34 in June, it’s probably unlikely that Kikuchi has unlocked some new level of consistency that we’ve never seen before. But if he’s merely raised his floor with the changes he made with Houston, he’ll instantly be the best starter the Angels have to offer, and for a commitment not past three years. That’s not nothing. Stat to knowVia MLB.com research staff 25.9%: That was the gap between Kikuchi’s strikeout rate (31.8%) and walk rate (5.9%) after joining the Astros, an improvement of more than 10 percentage points from his career K%-BB% at the time of the trade (15.3%). Of 69 qualifying pitchers from Aug. 1 through the end of the 2024 season, Kikuchi ranked fifth in MLB in that category, trailing only Blake Snell, Logan Gilbert, Zack Wheeler and AL Cy Young Award winner Tarik Skubal."
MLB News,Ortiz brings baseball greats together for annual golf charity,https://www.mlb.com/news/david-ortiz-hosts-annual-celebrity-golf-classic-2024,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 18:39:11 GMT",,"Ian Browne This story was excerpted from Ian Browne’s Red Sox Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. BOSTON -- As David Ortiz and his celebrity friends from the sports and pop culture worlds galivanted around Marco Island, Fla., at the 16th annual “Weekend with Papi” Celebrity Golf Classic, it was about far more than the glitz and the glamour. The mission was to raise money -- lots of it -- for kids in the Dominican Republic and New England in need of open heart surgery. Ortiz has been at this for over a decade-and-a-half and the impact of his foundation is bigger than anything he did on a baseball field. The golf tournament is where so much of the money gets made, between the golfing, the sponsorships and the on-line auction. “We raise money to save kid’s lives,” Ortiz said by phone on Friday. “As you know, all these life-saving surgeries that we have provided throughout the years have been amazing. We have been able to take care of more than 1,600 kids throughout the years and get their surgery done. We look forward to doing this every year. And the one thing that people should know also is that with $5,000, you can save a life.” A post shared by David Ortiz Children's Fund (@davidortizfund) Ortiz sees living proof all the time of what his foundation has accomplished. “Now that I live in the Dominican, I see people who are working in places where our foundation has been able to take care of their child. They come to me, thanking me. A lot of people, they don’t have the funds to be able to pay for this surgery. It’s been amazing,” said Ortiz. How did open heart surgeries for children become the focal point of Ortiz’s foundation? “I had a friend that basically showed up at my house, and he wanted me to give him five minutes, he wanted to show me something,” said Ortiz. “When we went to the hospital, they had this empty room with two kids and their surgery was done, but they were struggling. I remember one of these kids, he was my son’s age at the time. “All I thought about was me being that child’s parent and not having the opportunity or the money to be able to provide for his surgery. That was my motivation to begin, and you see what we’ve got going on 16 years later.” The goal at this year’s event was to raise $1,775,000 million. This year’s baseball attendees include Pedro Martinez, Johnny Damon, Gabe Kapler, Mookie Betts, Dustin Pedroia, Brock Holt, Jackie Bradley Jr., Kevin Youkilis, Terry Francona, Barry Larkin, Derek Jeter, Jim Rice and Alex Rodriguez among many others. There was basketball royalty on hand as Anthony Mackie and Anthony Anderson added even more of a buzz. A post shared by Terry Francona (@terryfrancona_reds) Aside from Ortiz himself, no baseball player committed more to the cause than the late Tim Wakefield, who died following complications from brain cancer in 2023. “Wake supported this foundation for so long that there is not a moment while we are doing it that we don't remember him or mention him or do something related to him,” said Ortiz."
MLB News,Breaking down Bregman's top suitors ... and each of their chances,https://www.mlb.com/news/alex-bregman-potential-fit-astros-tigers-or-phillies,"Sun, 24 Nov 2024 02:05:13 GMT",,"MLB.com Alex Bregman is the best third baseman available in free agency this year, and numerous clubs are expected to bid on the 30-year-old two-time World Series champion. In recent times, three teams in particular have been rumored to be interested in Bregman, with the most obvious being Houston, where he’s played his entire career. The other two are Detroit and Philadelphia. MLB.com beat writers debated the pros and cons for each: Why Bregman makes the most sense for… Astros: He’s arguably the Astros’ most popular player behind Jose Altuve when it comes to Houston’s run of success over the last decade. Plus, his wife is from Houston and he’s put down some roots in Texas. Bregman said at the end of the season he’d like to remain with the Astros, who took him with the No. 2 overall pick in the 2015 Draft out of LSU. The Astros, who have won seven of the past eight AL West titles and have been to the World Series four times since 2017, are still in a win-now mode, and winning is all Bregman has known. They made the ALCS in his first seven full seasons in the big leagues before falling short last season. Altuve practically pleaded with the Astros to keep Bregman in Houston when the season ended, and owner Jim Crane later admitted Altuve’s words carry meaning. -- Brian McTaggart Tigers: A look at Detroit’s roster and its season shows a team on the rise with young talent all over the field. Bregman is the veteran leader and proven winner that can help the Tigers take the next step, and the kind of impact right-handed bat to balance out what became a lefty-leaning lineup down the stretch and into the playoffs. His high-walk, lower-strikeout approach at the plate fits the Tigers’ mantra of dominating the strike zone, and his outstanding defense at third base can stabilize a position that has been a revolving door at Comerica Park since Nick Castellanos became an outfielder years ago. Oh, and he played for Tigers manager A.J. Hinch for four years in Houston, including with the 2017 World Series champions. -- Jason Beck Phillies: The Phillies are looking to shake up the roster following two disappointing finishes in the last two postseasons. President of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski hinted that trades are coming, and no tradeable player is probably more valuable than All-Star third baseman Alec Bohm. If the Phillies got a good enough return for Bohm, they would need to find a replacement. Who better than Bregman? -- Todd Zolecki What will each team’s best “pitch” be? Astros: Bregman will turn 31 at the start of next season, so a six- or seven-year contract extension means he’ll probably finish his career in Houston. Altuve’s extension prior to last season will keep him in Houston until he’s 39 years old, and Bregman could join him as an “Astro for life” if he re-signs with Houston. Altuve desperately wants to Bregman to return, and the two -- the only remaining position players who were on both of Houston’s championship teams -- could finish their careers in Houston as the faces of the golden era of baseball in Houston, the same way Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio were the faces of an Astros team that made the playoffs six times from 1997-2005 (1997-99, ‘01, ‘04-05). -- McTaggart Tigers: Bregman won playing for Hinch on a blossoming young team before. Why not run it back as the veteran on a team that’s ready to win? Leading another up-and-coming young team to glory would be a boon for his career résumé. Comerica Park doesn’t have the Crawford Boxes, but Spencer Torkelson and Matt Vierling have shown the past couple years that it can be a fair park for right-handed hitters, and a perfect place for Bregman to recapture the doubles numbers he posted early in his career. And Michigan is great for fishing in the summer. -- Beck Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Phillies: The Phils have been one of baseball’s best teams the past three years, and Phillies managing partner John Middleton wants a World Series trophy more than anything. And with stars like Bryce Harper, Trea Turner, Zack Wheeler, Aaron Nola and others signed for the next few seasons, they’re not going to stop trying anytime soon. -- Zolecki What’s the biggest hurdle that could stand in the way of Bregman signing?  Astros: Simply put, money. Crane isn’t a believer in signing free agents to lengthy deals, which is why the team has let players like George Springer, Gerrit Cole and Carlos Correa walk in years past. And the fact the Astros have continued to win at a high level even though so many key players have left in free agency proves it’s been a good strategy. Crane has never guaranteed more than five years to a free agent, and the biggest deal he’s given to any player is the $151 million Altuve received with his extension in 2018. The baseline for a Bregman deal may be the six-year, $151 million third baseman Matt Chapman -- also a Scott Boras client -- received from the Giants in September. Regardless, it will take a club-record deal to keep Bregman in Houston. -- McTaggart Tigers: While the on-field fit with Bregman is obvious, the financial fit is another matter. The Tigers have not been a team for bidding wars; even under the late owner Mike Ilitch, they were more active finding undervalued or overlooked free agents (Pudge Rodriguez, Magglio Ordonez, Kenny Rogers) than outbidding teams for highly-sought talent. There’s a ton of payroll space in Detroit, but the Tigers just got past one long-term deal that didn’t age well (Miguel Cabrera), and still have Javier Báez for three more years. President of baseball operations Scott Harris has been more attracted to shorter-term deals and long-term flexibility, both in Detroit and in his previous job as Giants general manager. He might have to weigh how much he wants to stretch a deal to get Bregman. -- Beck Phillies: The Phillies are almost certainly going to cross the third luxury tax threshold this year. They’d prefer not to push past the fourth, but it would be unavoidable if they signed Bregman. There is speculation that Bregman could be a $30 million a year player. The Athletics' Ken Rosenthal recently wrote that Bregman, however, could be pushing for a contract similar to Manny Machado’s 11-year, $350 million deal. If that’s the case, can the Phillies really afford three $300-million players in Harper, Turner and Bregman, plus Zack Wheeler, who is going to make $42 million this year? -- Zolecki"
MLB News,Where do Yankees stand in Soto pursuit?,https://www.mlb.com/news/yankees-rumors-latest-trades-and-signings,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 15:55:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of all the latest Yankees-related free agent and trade rumors right here. You can follow the latest Juan Soto rumors here. Nov. 25: What might a Soto contingency plan look like?The Yankees are one of four teams -- along with the Mets, Blue Jays and Red Sox -- that remain most likely to sign Juan Soto, per a report from USA Today's Bob Nightengale. But what if Soto signs elsewhere? That same report from Nightengale suggests that one potential pivot for the Yanks would still bring in quite the haul. That would include signing free-agent first baseman Christian Walker, along with either Willy Adames or Alex Bregman to play third base with Jazz Chisholm Jr. shifting to second -- but that's not all. New York could also then attempt to swing a trade with the Cubs for outfielder Cody Bellinger, plus use some of the money it would have given to Soto to make a push for an elite starter in Corbin Burnes, Blake Snell or Max Fried. Of course, all of that hinges on whether the Yanks bring back Soto -- something that is still very much in play. Nov. 22: 'Mutual interest' between Yanks, RHP Buehler (report)Dodgers right-hander Walker Buehler threw the final pitch of this season at Yankee Stadium, closing out Game 5 of the World Series in the Bronx. Might Yankee Stadium also be where Buehler throws his first pitch in 2025? MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi has been told that there is ""some mutual interest"" between Buehler and the Yankees, who are looking to augment their starting rotation this offseason. Buehler was largely ineffective during the '24 season as he made his way back from a second Tommy John surgery. But he showed flashes of his former All-Star self late in the season, capped by six scoreless innings across two outings during the Fall Classic -- a five-inning start in Game 3 and that one-inning appearance out of the bullpen in the finale. The 30-year-old is a former first-round Draft pick who is not too far removed from being one of the best pitchers in baseball. In 2021, Buehler finished fourth in the National League Cy Young voting after recording a 2.47 ERA with 212 strikeouts over 207 2/3 innings. Nov. 20: Steinbrenner: Yankees 'in the mix' for SotoThe Yankees met with Juan Soto on Monday in California, and team owner Hal Steinbrenner confirmed Wednesday that it was a ""good meeting"" with ""very honest back-and-forth dialogue."" Steinbrenner said that Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, manager Aaron Boone, president Randy Levine, and special assistant to the GM Omar Minaya were all in attendance during Monday's meeting. But he didn't divulge any part of the team's pitch to Soto or say if any offers were made during the meeting. ""It's been a priority,"" Steinbrenner said about signing Soto. ""We wouldn't have gone out to the West Coast if it wasn't. ... We'll be in the mix. I'll leave it at that."" As of Wednesday, Soto has had in-person meetings with the Yankees, Mets, Red Sox and Blue Jays. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Tuesday that Soto will also meet with the Phillies at some point. Soto also plans to sit down with the Dodgers this week, according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand.

But he added, ""[W]e've got the ability to sign any player we want to sign."" Nov. 18: Yanks meet with Soto (report)MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reports in an article for the New York Post that the Yankees met with superstar slugger Juan Soto in Southern California on Monday as they look to retain him after he helped lead them to the World Series. Heyman noted that owner Hal Steinbrenner led a delegation from New York that included general manager Brian Cashman and manager Aaron Boone. Per Heyman, the Yankees are said to be ""gung ho"" about getting a deal done with Soto, who has met with three other clubs so far -- the Blue Jays, Red Sox and Mets -- and is reportedly scheduled to meet with the Dodgers. Nov. 14: Yanks reportedly 'in on everyone' in free agencyAlthough the Yankees are going to make a strong effort to bring back Juan Soto, there’s a real chance the superstar outfielder will sign elsewhere, which means New York needs to have a backup plan in place. That backup plan appears to leave no limits. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Thursday in the New York Post that the Yankees are ""in on everyone."" One day earlier, during his live chat for Bleacher Report, Heyman was a little more specific on which non-Soto players the Yanks might target. Heyman said he sees the Yankees becoming more aggressive in the corner-infield market if they don’t land Soto. In that scenario, the Bronx Bombers could target Pete Alonso to play first base, or pursue Willy Adames or Alex Bregman to handle third base. Adames is a natural shortstop, but he is reportedly willing to move to another position for the right team/contract. The Yankees ended the season with Jazz Chisholm Jr. at the hot corner, but they could move Chisholm to second base to replace free agent Gleyber Torres. Heyman also thinks the Yanks would “look more seriously” at signing one of Corbin Burnes, Max Fried and Blake Snell to bolster their rotation and pursue switch-hitting slugger Anthony Santander to replace Soto in their outfield. Nov. 11: Yankees among teams with reported interest in WalkerRe-signing Juan Soto is the Yankees' top priority this offseason, but the club also has a hole at first base that it needs to fill after declining Anthony Rizzo's 2025 club option. The position was a weak spot for the Bronx Bombers in 2024, with Yankees first basemen posting the second-worst wRC+ (76) in MLB. Accordingly, the Yankees are among the teams planning to ""aggressively pursue"" free-agent Christian Walker, per a report from USA Today’s Bob Nightengale. They aren't alone, however, as Nightengale reports that at least five other teams are eyeing the right-handed slugger. The Bronx Bombers have also been connected to Alonso, but the longtime Mets first baseman seems like more of a backup plan in case the Yanks aren't able to re-sign Soto, given the exorbitant cost it would take to sign both players. With the age disparity between Alonso (29) and Walker (33), the latter should come with a much lower price tag, perhaps leaving room in the Yankees' budget to re-sign Soto and add Walker. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Walker doesn’t have quite the same power as Alonso, but he’s no slouch with the bat, having recorded 95 homers and an .813 OPS over the past three seasons. In that same time, Alonso has produced 120 homers and an .826 OPS. Walker, meanwhile, is a far better defender, winning three straight Gold Gloves and leading his position with +38 Outs Above Average since the beginning of 2022. Alonso has produced -17 OAA in that span. Nov. 8: Yanks set to meet with Soto soon (report)The Yankees have scheduled their own sitdown with Juan Soto as they get ready to make their pitch to re-sign their superstar slugger, according to a report from the New York Post on Friday. Yanks owner Hal Steinbrenner is expected to fly to California in about a week and a half to meet with Soto. The Mets are also reportedly visiting Soto next week, but per the Post's report, the Yankees have been assured that they will still be able to meet with Soto after that. The New York rivals are two of the favorites to land Soto, the marquee free agent on the market this winter. Soto had arguably the best season of his career in 2024 after the Yankees acquired him from the Padres in a blockbuster trade last December. The 26-year-old batted .288 with 41 home runs, 109 RBIs, 128 runs scored and a .989 OPS and led New York to the American League pennant. Nov. 7: Could Arenado be on the move? Are Yankees a fit?According to reports by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and USA TODAY, eight-time All-Star and 10-time Gold Glove Award-winning third baseman Nolan Arenado could be available in trade discussions if he's willing to waive his no-trade clause. The same goes for veteran starting pitchers Sonny Gray and Lance Lynn. Arenado, who will be entering his age-34 season in 2025, is coming off a year in which he produced the lowest offensive output in any full season (excluding the 2020 pandemic-shortened campaign) since his rookie year in 2013. He finished this past season with a .719 OPS and 16 home runs for St. Louis. Still, he's only two seasons removed from a third-place finish in NL MVP voting. Yankees announcer Michael Kay, on his ESPN Radio show on Thursday, suggested that Arenado would be a good fit at third base for New York as opposed to spending big money on free-agent first baseman Pete Alonso. Nov. 7: Yanks interested in numerous star FAs, 'aggressive' in bullpen marketThe No. 1 item on the Yankees' offseason to-do list remains re-signing Juan Soto. However, he is expected to take his time in making a decision, and the Yanks' roster has multiple areas of need. So while Soto remains the priority, New York has to look for options at other positions. According to MLB Network insiders Jon Heyman and Jon Paul Morosi, they are doing just that. Heyman wrote Wednesday in the New York Post that the Yankees have ""checked in"" on first baseman Pete Alonso and outfielder Anthony Santander, although both are viewed as ""backup plans"" in case Soto signs elsewhere. Although Soto's departure would leave a hole in the Yankees' outfield, Alonso would make sense as a secondary option since New York's first basemen recorded a 76 wRC+ this season, worst in the American League. Per Heyman, the Yankees have also expressed interest in the top starting pitchers in free agency, including Corbin Burnes, Blake Snell and Max Fried. Yet Heyman adds that it's ""uncertain"" if the Yankees will be able to afford both Soto and a bona fide ace to slot in next to Gerrit Cole. The prices won't be as high in the reliever market, and the Yankees have been ""among the most aggressive teams"" in searching for bullpen help during this week's General Managers Meetings, per Morosi. The Yankees have Luke Weaver returning for 2025, but they have a handful of impactful free-agent relievers: Clay Holmes, Jonathan Loáisiga, Tommy Kahnle and Tim Hill. Morosi mentions Tanner Scott, Jeff Hoffman and Carlos Estévez as possibilities for the Yanks if they don't re-sign some of those aforementioned arms. ""The New York Yankees fully realizing that even with Luke Weaver at the back end of the bullpen, they need to be active in the relief pitching market,"" Morosi said during Thursday's edition of Hot Stove. Yankees are among the most aggressive teams in speaking with reps for free-agent relievers at the GM Meetings. One reason: Three members of their World Series bullpen -- Clay Holmes, Tommy Kahnle, Tim Hill -- are free agents. @MLBNetwork Nov. 4: Cole staying with Yankees on existing dealGerrit Cole is staying with the Yankees. The Yankees' ace will remain in New York on the same four-year, $144 million deal he originally opted out of. Cole and the Yankees will continue to discuss options for a potential contract extension, according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. But for now, the Yankees have secured their ace through the 2028 season. The Yankees had a deadline of 5 p.m. ET on Monday to decide whether to void Cole's opt-out and prevent him from reaching free agency by adding a one-year extension worth $36 million to his pre-existing deal. Instead, the Yankees and Cole were able to negotiate an agreement that excludes that additional year, but still keeps Cole in New York for the same contract that he would have had if he hadn't opted out, while allowing for the possibility of an extension later. Oct. 31: Soto: 'Every team has the same opportunities' in free agencyJuan Soto has been a free agent for less than 24 hours, but a bunch of teams have already been in contact with him, according to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman. Heyman writes in the New York Post that eight teams checked in with Soto in the hours after he and the Yankees lost to the Dodgers in World Series Game 5 on Wednesday. By Thursday morning, the number of interested clubs was up to 11. The incumbent Yankees are likely to make a strong effort to bring him back, but while Soto said after New York’s season-ending loss that he was happy with the team and the city, he also made it clear he’s not giving the Bronx Bombers an edge over any other potential suitor. “I feel like every team has the same opportunities when I go into free agency,” Soto said. ""I don't want to say anyone has an advantage, because at the end of the day we're gonna look at what they have and how much they want me."" Oct. 31: Re-signing Soto atop Yankees’ offseason prioritiesThe good news for the Yankees is that they finished the 2024 season with the best record in the American League and earned their first trip to the World Series. The bad news is that they were outplayed by the Dodgers in the Fall Classic, which Los Angeles ended with a Game 5 win Wednesday. For the Yankees, any season that doesn’t end with a World Series title is deemed by many as a failure. How their offseason is judged will hinge largely on one action: re-signing Juan Soto. The 26-year-old was phenomenal with the Yankees after being acquired prior to this season in a trade with San Diego. He hit a career-high 41 home runs, led the American League with 128 runs and had a 178 OPS+, his best in a full season. “I’m really happy with the city, with the team, how these guys do,"" Soto said after the Yankees' season-ending loss. ""But at the end of the day, we’re going to look at every situation, every offer that we get, and then take a decision from that.” The Yankees will face fierce competition for Soto’s services, perhaps most of all from the crosstown Mets. Even if Soto returns, the Yankees’ lineup will have a different look in 2025 as infielder Gleyber Torres and outfielder Alex Verdugo are slated to become free agents. Anthony Rizzo, who posted a .637 OPS, carries a $17 million club option for next season. The Bronx Bombers will likely try to add another impact bat to take some of the pressure off of Soto and Aaron Judge, who carried the Yankees’ offense throughout the year. A host of Yanks relievers are set to be free agents, including Clay Holmes, Jonathan Loáisiga, Tommy Kahnle and Tim Hill. Cole could also opt out of his contract, but the Yankees can void that decision by adding a 10th year onto his contract for $36 million."
MLB News,"Why the India-Singer swap makes sense for both Reds, Royals",https://www.mlb.com/news/brady-singer-to-reds-jonathan-india-to-royals-trade-analysis,"Sat, 23 Nov 2024 18:38:47 GMT",Cincinnati acquires veteran RHP Singer in exchange for 2B India,"MLB.com The Reds and Royals combined for the biggest trade of the young offseason (so far) on Friday night, when Cincinnati acquired veteran righty Brady Singer in exchange for second baseman Jonathan India and outfielder Joey Wiemer. It was one of those rare deals that saw each team acquiring a proven big leaguer to address an area of need. TRADE DETAILSReds get: RHP Brady SingerRoyals get: 2B Jonathan India, OF Joey Wiemer Let's take a closer look at this exchange from all angles, via MLB.com experts: Why it makes sense for the RedsVia Reds beat writer Mark Sheldon Singer is not known for power stuff and his sinker -- the right-hander's primary pitch -- averaged just over 92 mph last season. He's a ground-ball pitcher and often induces lighter contact. That should serve him well going from pitcher-friendly Kauffman Stadium to hitter-friendly Great American Ball Park. In 32 starts and 179 2/3 innings for Kansas City last season, Singer was 9-13 with a 3.71 ERA and 3.1 bWAR. He had more starts and innings than anybody on Cincinnati's pitching staff in 2024. “Last year, we had 16 pitchers on our staff that started games, so just getting someone with some durability and some longevity that’s had quality in the big leagues that we feel can shore up the rotation,"" Reds president of baseball operations Nick Krall said. ""Those two guys have a chance to really add impact and length to our team.” The Reds’ rotation is expected to have All-Star Hunter Greene, Nick Martinez and Singer, plus Nick Lodolo, Andrew Abbott, Rhett Lowder, Carson Spiers and Graham Ashcraft in the mix for the remaining spots. More >> Why it makes sense for the RoyalsVia Royals beat writer Anne Rogers The Royals have always been fond of India, and he was identified as a potential trade target during this past season, general manager J.J. Picollo said on Friday night. When Wiemer’s name was introduced as part of the potential package, the Royals felt comfortable closing the deal. “Clearly, we were looking for a leadoff hitter,” Picollo said. “ ... We wanted to address on-base. We wanted somebody to provide consistency for us in that leadoff spot. And Jonathan’s going to do that. We were very happy to acquire him. And Joey Wiemer is another player that we’ve always thought very highly of, a highly touted prospect.” India, who will turn 28 on Dec. 15, was the National League’s Rookie of the Year in 2021 and has been a key piece of the Reds’ infield for the past four years. He has a career .253/.352/.412 slash line, and in 2024, when he wasn’t totally healthy despite playing 151 games, he posted a .749 OPS with 15 home runs and 28 doubles. Where India fits defensively is yet to be determined. He has only played second base in his MLB career, but he could have the ability to play third base and outfield. The Royals will discuss his fit, along with returning second baseman Michael Massey’s, throughout this offseason. More >> Hot Stove implicationsVia executive reporter Mark Feinsand With a relatively weak second-base free-agent market led by Gleyber Torres, the Royals jumped the trade market by acquiring India, who was among the best second basemen available on the trade market. Singer isn’t at the same level as some of the top starting pitchers in free agency, but he has had solid seasons in two of the past three years and he is under control for the next two seasons, giving the Reds a cost-controlled starter to bolster their rotation. Diving deepVia analyst Mike Petriello Singer and India were both first-round picks in the 2018 Draft, and each has had some success in the Majors, but neither has been an impact player so far. That’s likely to continue on their new clubs, as they’ll be more supporting players behind bigger stars. India’s entire game is essentially about having one elite skill, and that’s not chasing outside the zone -- and nobody in the Majors was better than him at that last season. While his below-average power (28th percentile hard-hit rate) is likely to look even weaker going from the Majors' best home run park to one of the worst, Kauffman Stadium is actually just as good of a right-handed-hitting park as Great American Ball Park. That is, in part, because it reduces strikeouts and has a huge outfield to cover, which might help India if he can just lace liners into the gaps. While he’s an average hitter overall (104 OPS+), that’s a big deal for a thin Kansas City lineup that probably had only three hitters (Bobby Witt Jr., Salvador Perez and Vinnie Pasquantino) who were even projected to be average. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Singer has been a somewhat similar average-to-slightly-below-average pitcher over his career, though he’s had big platoon splits both in terms of handedness (lefty batters have an OPS that is 103 points higher over his career) and location (he’s been 66 OPS points worse away from Kansas City). There’s a real concern that a pitcher who doesn’t really miss many bats or limit hard contact might give up more than a few extra homers in Cincinnati, though his ability to keep the ball on the ground (79th percentile in ground-ball rate) should help with that somewhat. If the Reds can teach him something to attack lefties, they may find some usage. If not, someone has to eat up the back-end innings."
MLB News,"Perdomo, meet Moise: Some D-backs wins come off the field",https://www.mlb.com/news/geraldo-perdomo-diamondbacks-making-a-difference-in-community,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 18:29:04 GMT",Shortstop's friendly gesture has great significance for young fan,"Steve Gilbert This story was excerpted from Steve Gilbert’s D-backs Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. How does one tell the story or measure the impact of the work the Diamondbacks organization does in the community? There are cold, hard numbers -- the D-backs are at around $93 million in charitable giving since their inaugural 1998 season and will cross the $100 million mark in 2025. But it's the stories about the lives that have been changed by all that giving that truly tell the tale. Take the example of a 10-year-old boy named Moise. Moise was a refugee from Uganda, who came to his first baseball game in 2024 as a guest of the Diamondbacks. Shortstop Geraldo Perdomo saw Moise sitting in the first row by the home on-deck circle next to Debbie Castaldo, the D-backs’ senior vice president of corporate and community impact, and just knew that Moise wasn't a typical fan. So Perdomo walked over and touched hands with Moise through the netting, introducing himself. ""He looks like me!"" Moise said to Castaldo. Perdomo visited with Moise after the game and invited him back to the ballpark for lunch the next week. After lunch, Perdomo took Moise onto the field to teach him how to play baseball. ""This little boy, who was dealing with a whole lot of very difficult things in that moment, found baseball and found a role model and found someone who looks like him that he could believe in,"" Castaldo said. ""Now he walks around wearing a Perdomo jersey and Perdomo T-shirts that we've given to him. “It's just who Perdomo is. He just has an absolute heart of gold, and he knows the impact he had on this little boy. And I think the little boy had an equally big impact on him."" Castaldo considers herself lucky to be working under an ownership group, led by managing general partner Ken Kendrick and team president/CEO Derrick Hall, that values having an impact in the community and is willing to put money and support behind it. And she deals with a clubhouse full of players and staff who are willing to help out where they can. There's right-hander Zac Gallen's passion to help the fight against hunger in Arizona, where an estimated one in six kids don't know where their next meal will come from. Gallen, whose nickname is ""The Milkman,"" teamed up with the Arizona Diamondbacks Foundation, St. Mary's Food Bank and Shamrock Farms through his Zac Gallen 23 Charitable Fund to raise money to provide milk and meals for food-insecure children. Gallen hosted events this year that raised $100,000 for St. Mary's. ""He's so smart and easy to work with,"" Castaldo said of Gallen. ""He really digs in and wants to see real dollars go to work to create solutions for a complex problem like hunger, especially with children."" Another one of the Diamondbacks’ marquee players, outfielder Corbin Carroll, is known around the organization for volunteering for community events. His CC7 Charitable Fund helps fund programs that support children’s programs and projects dedicated to empowering, celebrating and inspiring kids to reach for the stars. ""Corbin's passion for children who are underserved is really amazing,"" Castaldo said. ""His work with the D-backs Nike Jr. RBI Program with the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Valley is just one of the things he does. His donation of gear -- bats and gloves -- is so important because most of the kids don't have the best equipment to be able to compete with. “He just is a very unique player when it comes to his passion for meeting children and young adults all the way through high school. He takes the time to look them in the eye and talk to them. Just a few minutes with him might give them just a moment of lift that they need. He's very rare with his dedication."" Manager Torey Lovullo helps set the tone for all of it with his Torey Lovullo Kindness Champions program, which works with Ben's Bells, Positive Coaching Alliance and the Diamondbacks Foundation to reward K-12 students for kind behavior. Castaldo can list a number of other players who are involved in various projects, and she is thankful for their help. In the spirit of being thankful, the D-backs recently posted on Instagram a thank you to fans. For every interaction the post receives through Tuesday, the team will donate $5 to Arizona food banks.

MLB News,10 stars still due for their first MVP Award,https://www.mlb.com/news/players-who-still-havent-won-mvp-award,"Sun, 24 Nov 2024 02:03:46 GMT",,"Will Leitch Here’s an interesting quirk of this year’s MVP Awards: Both winners already had earned the honor in the past. That’s only the second time that’s happened since the Baseball Writers’ Association of America began voting in 1931; the other was in 1955, when Yogi Berra and Roy Campanella both won their third. While that’s great for Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani, that means a whole bunch of great players who have never won MVP are still searching. Those two are hogging the loot! As we turn the page on the 2024 MVP race, let’s take a look at the best active players who have never been named MVP but still have a chance to do so. These are guys who have come close, guys whose careers may feel a little incomplete without one. (We’re setting a minimum of five MLB seasons played here, although younger stars such as Gunnar Henderson, Julio Rodríguez and Bobby Witt Jr. obviously have future MVP hopes as well.) The best player never to win an MVP may be Derek Jeter, or possibly Tony Gwynn. But some of these 10 players, if they never get one, could stand right beside them. (Players below are listed in alphabetical order.) Yordan Alvarez, AstrosBest finish: 3rd (2022)He has always been held back a little by the fact that he’s primarily a DH, though, obviously, that didn’t stop Ohtani this year. On one hand, if Alvarez didn’t break through in 2022 -- when he had a 1.091 OPS and finished third -- it’s going to be hard for him to ever do so. On the other hand … he’s still only 27. Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Blue JaysBest finish: 2nd (2021)Guerrero would have won in 2021 had it been any season in which Ohtani wasn’t a dominant pitcher and a dominant hitter at the same time. But after a couple of years of Vlad Jr. falling short of the standard he set that season, he returned to his previous form in 2024. If this is who he is moving forward -- and he’s still only 25, remember -- he’ll definitely get himself one of these at some point. Francisco Lindor, MetsBest finish: 2nd (2024)Lindor was the beating heart of the 2024 Mets, whose fanbase, after some early tumult, now fully embraces him. And how could they not? His infectious spirit raises all clubhouse boats, and he’ll be the stabilizing force for a team that seems poised to add a whole bunch of talent around him. Shockingly, he hasn’t made an All-Star Game since 2019. How is that possible? Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Manny Machado, PadresBest finish: 2nd (2022)Machado is well on his way to a Hall of Fame career (500 homers and 3,000 hits are things that are on the table for him), but he is perhaps known more for excellent consistency than having one incredible, singular season. He’s still at an age (32) when he can have one, though. Being healthy -- which he wasn’t early in 2024 -- can only help. Ketel Marte, DiamondbacksBest finish: 3rd (2024)Forever underappreciated, Marte had the best year of his career right after having an outstanding 2023 postseason that led his team to the World Series. If Arizona continues to overachieve, he’ll be the reason why, and eventually, everyone will notice. José Ramírez, GuardiansBest finish: 2nd (2020)Let’s face it: Ramírez, rather than José Abreu, probably should have gotten the MVP in 2020. Alas, Ramírez remains the bridesmaid: He has now finished in the top 10 in seven of the past eight seasons. The Guardians would be absolutely lost without him. Corey Seager, RangersBest finish: 2nd (2023)He took a step backward in 2024, and while injuries were a part of that, it should be noted that he played in more games (123) than he did in 2023 (119), when he finished second in the AL race. Still, Seager is only 30, and don’t forget: His trophy case is already stacked, thanks to a Rookie of the Year win, three Silver Sluggers, an NLCS MVP, two World Series MVPs and two World Series rings. Juan Soto, free agentBest finish: 2nd (2021)We’ve all been saying “Soto is going to win an MVP any day now” for roughly a half-decade, and he still hasn’t done it. He still might be the next Ted Williams, so obviously one is coming, no matter which uniform he ends up wearing when it happens. Like Teddy Ballgame, I bet he ends up winning more than one, all told. Fernando Tatis Jr., PadresBest finish: 3rd (2021)In 2021, it looked like Tatis was going to win many MVPs. Now … it’s not so certain. But he has certainly rebounded from a rocky stretch post-suspension, and while his numbers aren’t back to where they were before, they are climbing in that direction. And he remains only 25. Kyle Tucker, AstrosBest finish: 5th (2023)Tucker only played 78 games in 2024, but had he been able to stay healthy and stretch out his actual numbers over a full season, he might have been at least an MVP finalist. The 27-year-old is entering his prime right now and, don’t forget, is a free agent after next season. The time for him to make the leap is almost certainly right now."
MLB News,Judge's star-studded All-Star Gala only part of Yanks' charitable efforts,https://www.mlb.com/news/aaron-judge-s-all-rise-foundation-hosts-all-star-gala,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 15:42:56 GMT",,"Bryan Hoch This story was excerpted from Bryan Hoch’s Yankees Beat newsletter.

Aaron Judge was in his second season as a full-time big leaguer when he stayed up late one night with his mother, Patty, outlining their plans to give back to the community with a soon-to-be-formed charity that would bear the Yankees star’s name. In some ways, the founding of Judge’s ALL RISE Foundation in 2018 boasts a similar origin story to Derek Jeter’s Turn 2 Foundation, the blueprints of which were sketched out over a pizza dinner in a hotel room during the shortstop’s rookie season. That night, Jeter and his father, Charles, took their inspiration from a charity belonging to Dave Winfield -- and so it goes. Perhaps not coincidentally, Judge said that his father, Wayne, happened to be a big Winfield fan. “To whom much is given, much is required,” Judge said on Thursday, when his foundation hosted its third annual All-Star Gala at Cipriani Wall Street in New York. “Getting a chance to be in this position and be on this platform, I’ve seen so many guys before me -- Jeter, [CC] Sabathia, all those guys had foundations and they always gave back. “It didn’t matter how many All-Star Games, MVPs, Cy Youngs, whatever they had. They always tried to give back. I think it was those guys laying the foundation, and my parents laying the foundation.” A BIG thank you to all who supported us this week both in person at the gala or by joining the silent auction from afar. Sharing some quick highlights from the evening with special guests from @mlb and  @yankees.  Plus we enjoyed killer entertainment from @bas!@mmeventgroup pic.twitter.com/eCgNV1vEHc Nearly 500 guests attended Judge’s most recent event, including manager Aaron Boone, Hall of Fame manager Joe Torre, teammates Gerrit Cole, Nestor Cortes, DJ LeMahieu, Carlos Rodón and Anthony Volpe, plus former Yankees Harrison Bader, Isiah Kiner-Falefa, Corey Kluber, Mike Tauchman and Tyler Wade. Judge said that his foundation aims to inspire children and youth to become responsible citizens and encourage them to reach unlimited possibilities. “Both my parents were educators, so I got a chance to be around them, how they treated their students,” Judge said. “It didn’t matter if they were the A student, the best one in the class they didn’t have to worry about, or the D student just scraping by and trying his best to pass the class. They treated everyone with respect, everyone equally. It was pretty cool to see.” Aaron Judge had some friends show up to his All Rise Foundation gala tonight 👀 pic.twitter.com/0o3ZjwgpVO Grants issued by the foundation provide opportunities to selected non-profit organizations in California’s San Joaquin County and Fresno County, and the Bronx, as Judge aims to give back to the area where he grew up, where he attended college and where he currently patrols the outfield, respectively. With the Thanksgiving holiday ahead, the Yankees' organization also held events. The club teamed with Legends Hospitality and SCAN-Harbor (Supportive Children’s Advocacy Network) to host a feast for several hundred local residents on Friday at the Rev. T.

MLB News,An all-time upset in Premier12 championship game,https://www.mlb.com/news/chinese-taipei-wins-first-gold-in-upset-of-japan,"Sun, 24 Nov 2024 16:32:25 GMT",,"Michael Clair TOKYO – “We are writing our own history story,” Chinese Taipei manager Hao-Jiu Tseng said after his team upset the United States earlier this week to keep its Premier12 gold medal hopes alive. When the U.S. then defeated Venezuela on Friday, it guaranteed that Chinese Taipei would get to play in Sunday’s final against host Japan. Even then, few believed that the team had a chance. It had never won a major international tournament at the senior level. It only advanced past the first round of the World Baseball Classic once -- in 2013 -- and were relegated to a qualifier it will host in February after finishing last in its group in 2023. It had never medaled in the Premier12, last collecting bronze in the Baseball World Cup -- this tournament’s predecessor --in 2001. The team’s best ever finish was a silver medal in the 1992 Olympics, an event held before all but three players on the roster were born. But “there’s an infinite possibility in life,” Tseng had added that day. “You don’t know if you’re going to make it unless you try.” Facing the powerful Samurai Japan team, which had won a remarkable 27 international games entering Sunday’s gold medal final in the Tokyo Dome, many assumed the game was already over, the gold medal already awarded. Japan's last loss came in 2019, when the United States beat them in the super-round of the Premier12. But that possibility, seemingly infinitesimally small, came true on Sunday. Chinese Taipei's players wrote their names into the history books with a stunning 4-0 victory, holding a Japanese team that had scored at least nine runs in each of its super-round games to just four hits. Only once did Japan even put a runner in scoring position. Japan's winning streak snapped, home fans stunned into silence, and the traveling away fans -- spread across the Tokyo Dome’s cavernous interior -- erupted with rapturous delight. This is perhaps the most remarkable upset in international baseball history. ""This event made history, and this is a meaningful moment for us all,"" Tseng said. ""The game against Team United States, against Team Japan. We made it through to be here. What we accomplished was so big."" CHINESE TAIPEI WINS ITS FIRST MAJOR INTERNATIONAL TOURNAMENT! A remarkable 4-0 upset of Samurai Japan whose 27-game winning streak is snapped. pic.twitter.com/A7KPZRbsSf The victory actually started with a decision Tseng made on Friday. Japan and Chinese Taipei were scheduled to face each other in the final game of the super-round, but with their spots in the gold medal game already clinched, each team rolled out modified lineups. In Chinese Taipei’s case, it opted to skip its announced starter -- D-backs No. 7 prospect Yu-Min Lin -- and save him for the final. The choice cost the team a $2,000 fine, something its manager didn't seem to mind. Lin made the choice seem obvious. Relying on his low-90s fastball and a darting changeup, the D-backs prospect pitched four innings, giving up just one infield single and striking out three. ""I really wanted to have a great battle against Japan in the final, that's why I made a big decision yesterday,"" Tseng said. ""I think [Lin] did a great job, and then all the pitching staff did what they had to do to be victorious. So, I'm happy about the decision.""

All of the game's scoring then came in the top of the fifth thanks to two giant home runs.

Hitting over .600 in the tournament, there was seemingly nothing Chinese Taipei's bellwether center fielder couldn't handle. After working the count full, Chen smashed a drive deep over the center field wall. The Taipei fans went wild, the Tokyo faithful silent and slumped in their seats. That would prove to be enough, as three relievers finished off the game, keeping Japan's powerful lineup flummoxed. ""This is really a dream come true for me, and, really, I cannot think of anything right now,"" Chen said after the game. ""I don't have a word, but we were able to prove ourselves to the world.

Many fans and writers had expressed dismay with manager Hirozaku Ibata's lineup construction, wondering why slugger Shogu Maki was pushed down to the sixth spot in the lineup. While that happened to work when he hit the game-winning grand slam against Venezuela two days prior, this time he was left on-deck, bat on his shoulder, when Ryoya Kurihara lined into the game-ending double play. Others will wonder why he left Togo in the game to face the red-hot Chen when the starter had already given up a home run, single and a walk before the dagger blast. “He’s the ace of the Yomiuri Giants,"" Ibata said after the game. ""He was also instrumental as a reliever in the World Baseball Classic. I determined that he could get out of that situation and I believed in him.” Despite the victory, Tseng still believes Japan is ahead of his ballclub, though. They have set the standard for which international baseball teams must be measured. ""To get closer to Team Japan, that's what we really wanted to do, but we actually got a win against them,"" Tseng said. ""That's so big. I think we got a little closer. But you know, this one win is not everything. I know they're a better team, so we need to make more effort, get even closer to the team in Japan, so that we can battle against them like that many more times to come."" Chinese Taipei will next play host to the World Baseball Classic qualifiers in February, looking to be one of the two teams among South Africa, Nicaragua and Spain that will advance to the main tournament in 2026. No matter what happens then, though, history was made. Chinese Taipei's victorious story has been written."
MLB News,New bench coach Chirinos highlights O's staff changes,https://www.mlb.com/news/orioles-announce-2025-major-league-coaching-staff,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 17:31:00 GMT",,"Jake Rill BALTIMORE -- The Orioles finalized their 2025 coaching staff on Monday, headlined by the decision to hire one of their former players as a first-time coach. Robinson Chirinos will serve as Baltimore’s bench coach under manager Brandon Hyde, returning to the organization where he played his final MLB season in 2022. The 40-year-old had an 11-year big league career as a catcher that began in ‘11, having also played for the Rays, Rangers, Astros, Mets and Cubs. The O’s have also promoted Cody Asche from offensive strategy coach to hitting coach, Sherman Johnson from upper-level Minor League hitting coordinator to assistant hitting coach/upper-level hitting coordinator and Buck Britton from Triple-A Norfolk manager to Major League coach. Tommy Joseph was hired to serve as assistant hitting coach after spending one year in that same role for the Mariners. Major League development coach Grant Anders, Major League field coordinator/catching instructor Tim Cossins, pitching coach Drew French, pitching strategy coach Ryan Klimek, third-base coach Tony Mansolino, assistant pitching coach Mitch Plassmeyer and first-base coach Anthony Sanders are all returning from last season’s staff. Chirinos has never previously served as a coach at any level, but the Orioles thought highly of the Punto Fijo, Venezuela, native when he played for the club. Hyde also believed that the former backstop had a future in coaching. That time has now come, with Chirinos returning to the place where he finished his playing career. He is taking the place of Fredi Gonzalez, who left the organization after five years on the big league staff (including three as bench coach). Another notable addition is Britton, who spent the past three seasons as Triple-A Norfolk manager. The 38-year-old -- who is the older brother of former Orioles closer Zack Britton -- began his coaching career as the hitting coach at Single-A Delmarva in 2017, then spent six years as a Minor League manager in the O’s organization. Congrats to my brother @BuckInHere on the promotion! https://t.co/Sn2I3nAVxn In 2023, Britton led Norfolk to both the International League title and the Triple-A National Championship, earning the honor of International League Manager of the Year. This will be his first coaching gig in the big leagues, where he’ll reunite with some of his former players, including shortstop Gunnar Henderson, infielder Jackson Holliday and more. Baltimore finalized its hirings on the hitting side, each of which had been previously reported earlier this month. The O’s had holes to fill following the departures of co-hitting coaches Matt Borgschulte and Ryan Fuller. Borgschulte is now the Twins’ hitting coach, while Fuller was hired to be the White Sox director of hitting. Asche, Joseph and Johnson will now work together to get the most out of Orioles hitters. It’s the first time the 34-year-old Asche will be a hitting coach after spending the past three years in various roles within the organization -- upper-level Minor League hitting coordinator in 2022, then offensive strategy coach in ‘23 and ‘24. The 33-year-old Joseph’s one season as Mariners assistant hitting coach marked his professional coaching debut. Johnson also doesn’t have a ton of experience, as the 34-year-old was hired by Baltimore to serve as the Triple-A Norfolk hitting coach in 2023. The Orioles will be looking to reach the postseason for a third straight year in 2025, after going 101-61 and winning the American League East in ‘23 and then finishing 91-71 to secure the top AL Wild Card berth in ‘24. They’ll aim for a deeper October run after going 0-5 in playoff games over the past two seasons.

MLB News,Braves Hall of Famer Rico Carty passes away at 85,https://www.mlb.com/news/rico-carty-passes-away,"Sun, 24 Nov 2024 19:04:55 GMT",,"Mark Bowman The Atlanta Braves mourn the passing of Braves Hall of Famer Rico Carty: pic.twitter.com/zdMPzCDk1u Rico Carty was popular enough to be elected to start an All-Star Game as a write-in candidate. Memories of Carty’s 1970 All-Star election and the batting title he won that same year were rekindled on Sunday, as the former outfielder passed away at the age of 85. Carty played for the Braves, Guardians, Cubs, Blue Jays, A’s and Rangers during a 15-year career. He finished second in balloting for the 1964 National League Rookie of the Year Award and won the NL batting title in 1970, when he hit .366 with 1.037 OPS. He spent much of that year in the Braves’ cleanup spot, where he batted directly behind Henry Aaron. Carty was inducted into the Braves Hall of Fame in 2023. Ricardo Adolfo Jacobo Carty was born on Sept. 1, 1939, in San Pedro de Macoris, Dominican Republic. He drew the attention of Major League scouts while playing for the D.R. in the 1959 Pan American Games in Chicago. Eight teams offered him a contract -- and he signed with each one. George Trautman, president of the Minor Leagues, awarded Carty to the Milwaukee Braves. After four seasons in the Minors, Carty debuted for the Braves by playing in two games at the end of the ’63 season and remained in the organization through the end of the ’72 season. The 147 wRC+ he produced from 1964-71 ranked tied for second among MLB left fielders (minimum 400 games) with Frank Howard, trailing only Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski (149). Carty missed a portion of the 1969 season because of a sore shoulder but proved productive enough to finish 13th in balloting for the NL MVP Award. Still, he wasn’t on the All-Star ballot the following year. Fans took care of the oversight. According to his biography on the Society for Baseball Research website, Carty received 552,382 votes as a write-in candidate, or 67,000 more than Pete Rose, who was on the ballot. The first write-in All-Star, Carty started alongside Aaron and Willie Mays in the NL’s starting outfield. We are saddened by the passing of 15-year MLB veteran Rico Carty.Carty spent 8 of his 15 years with the Braves. In his memorable 1970 season, Carty hit .366 to win the NL batting crown. It is still the highest mark in Braves modern-era franchise history.His popularity was so… pic.twitter.com/XPcyzBeo9Y Carty finished 10th in balloting for the 1970 NL MVP Award, but he fractured his left knee and suffered ligament damage when he collided with Matty Alou while playing in the Dominican Republic that December. A blood clot in the damaged leg erased Carty’s bid to return during the second half of the 1971 season. Carty, who had also missed the 1968 season with tuberculosis, battled multiple ailments again in 1972 and was traded to the Rangers after playing in just 86 games that season. Carty feuded with fans, umpires and teammates, including Aaron during a flight to Los Angeles during the 1967 season. A few punches were thrown during the altercation that began after Carty allegedly called Aaron a name he didn’t like. Still, while Carty feuded with Aaron, Eddie Mathews and other Braves figures, his time with the club was productive. His career-best 171 OPS+ from the 1970 season is tied with Ronald Acuña Jr. (2023) for the third-highest ever constructed by a Braves player over at least 130 games during the Atlanta era, which dates back to 1966. The only player ahead of them is Aaron (194 in 1971, 177 in '69). Carty is the only left fielder in Braves history to produce a 130 OPS+ or better in at least four seasons, reaching that mark on five different occasions."

To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. Today marks the start of the Padres' annual Holiday Giving Tour, as the team will spend the next several weeks supporting local organizations that give back to underserved communities in the area. It begins with a Turkey Distribution to 1,000 families, in which the Padres will distribute turkeys and other Thanksgiving items in conjunction with Northgate Market and the San Diego Food Bank. Among those on hand will be righty Jeremiah Estrada, broadcaster Mark Grant and CEO Erik Greupner. The Holiday Giving Tour continues throughout the month -- throughout San Diego and the Baja region. The Padres' legacy of giving back is one the organization has always taken seriously. And it's a legacy that beloved late owner Peter Seidler furthered immensely. Seidler would've turned 64 earlier this month. On his birthday, the team honored Seidler perfectly -- by supporting the cause that was so close to his heart. Seidler worked tirelessly to tackle homelessness in the community through various foundations, both tied to the Padres and otherwise. So, for Seidler's birthday on Nov. 7, the Padres front office employees put together care packages that they proceeded to distribute to a handful of homeless-focused charities in San Diego. ""We're trying to honor him today by supporting several local organizations that minister to the needs of the unhoused, which was a cause that was near and dear to Peter's heart,"" said Greupner, in a video the Padres posted honoring Seidler. ""He spent a lot of time and resources devoted to that. So we want to carry on his legacy and tradition -- not only this year but for the years to come, to continue to do the things that Peter did to help support the most vulnerable in our community."" Celebrating Peter’s birthday in the best way we can 💛With funding from the Padres Foundation, our front office employees spent the day assembling and delivering 1,000 care packages to unhoused San Diegans across our community. pic.twitter.com/SAMzx3RZ3a Seidler supported and spearheaded several organizations seeking solutions to homelessness and was on the city of San Diego’s leadership council for its homelessness reduction plan. He was named 2022 San Diegan of the Year by The San Diego Union-Tribune and he was honored with the 2023 Herb Klein Spirit of San Diego Award by the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce.

MLB offseason signings and trades• Latest free-agent and trade rumors• Top 25 free agents | Every free agent, by position• Tracking every team's offseason moves• FA guides: Soto | Burnes | Alonso | Snell | Bregman | Fried | Santander• Offseason dates, rules & terms explained While we have already explored the overall free-agent rankings and tiers this offseason, here’s a look at the top player at each position -- an All-Free-Agent Team, of sorts -- plus some other alternatives for every position. C: Kyle HigashiokaThe catching market is relatively thin this winter, with a number of players better suited for part-time play making up most of the group. Higashioka had the best year of his career in 2024, hitting 17 home runs with 45 RBIs in 84 games. Best of the rest: Danny Jansen, Gary Sánchez, Carson Kelly, Yasmani Grandal, Elias Díaz, James McCann 1B: Pete AlonsoChristian Walker might be the best all-around player at the position thanks to his defense -- he’s won three straight Gold Gloves -- but Alonso is four years younger and offers more power potential. For a club seeking an immediate influx of power into its lineup -- or a long-term solution at first -- Alonso gets the nod here. Best of the rest: Walker, Carlos Santana, Paul Goldschmidt, Justin Turner, Donovan Solano, Anthony Rizzo, Joey Gallo, Ty France, Josh Bell 2B: Gleyber TorresLike catcher, the second base market isn’t loaded this offseason. Torres didn’t have a great year -- he slashed .257/.330/.378 with 15 home runs in 154 games -- but he’s entering his age-28 season and has two All-Star appearances on his resumé. A change of scenery may help Torres find the form from earlier in his career. Best of the rest: Hye-Seong Kim, Nicky Lopez, Whit Merrifield, Jorge Polanco, Brandon Drury, Adam Frazier SS: Willy AdamesThere's no debate at shortstop, where Adames is the clear-cut No. 1 free agent at the position. The 29-year-old slashed .251/.331/.462 with 32 homers, 112 RBIs and 21 stolen bases last season, and while his Outs Above Average dipped to only one, he had a 26 OAA mark in 2022-23. Best of the rest: Ha-Seong Kim, Jose Iglesias, Paul DeJong, Amed Rosario, Nick Ahmed, Brandon Crawford 3B: Alex BregmanIf you’re looking for a stud at third base, this is a one-man class led by Bregman, who overcame a rocky start to 2024 to post excellent numbers -- 25 home runs, 62 RBIs and an .845 OPS -- over his final 108 games. Bregman’s 39.6 career bWAR ranks 27th among active players and is fourth among players 30 or younger. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Best of the rest: J.D. Davis, Yoán Moncada, Gio Urshela, Brian Anderson, Jace Peterson, Luis Urías LF: Jurickson ProfarThe top prospect in the game in 2013, Profar struggled to find consistency throughout the first decade of his career. That all changed in 2024, when he helped pace the Padres offense with a .280/.380/.459 slash line, 24 home runs and 85 RBIs, posting a career-best 4.3 fWAR. He made his first All-Star team after signing a one-year, $1 million deal last winter, but his big season should line him up for a far bigger contract. Best of the rest: Tyler O’Neill, Mark Canha, Michael Conforto, Alex Verdugo, Tommy Pham, Travis Jankowski, Jesse Winker, Adam Duvall, David Peralta CF: Harrison BaderBader isn’t going to wow anybody with his bat, having posted an 80 OPS+ over the past three seasons. But his glove in center more than makes up for that -- the 30-year-old remains one of the best defenders at the position, posting a double-digit Outs Above Average for the fifth time in his past six 162-game seasons. Best of the rest: Michael A. Taylor, Garrett Hampson, Aaron Hicks, Manuel Margot, Kiké Hernández RF: Juan SotoRight field may boast more notable players than any other position this offseason, and while Anthony Santander and Teoscar Hernández might have topped the list in some years, Soto is the No. 1 overall free agent available this winter. A generational talent, the 26-year-old Soto should land a contract to match in the coming weeks. Best of the rest: Santander, Hernández, Max Kepler, Jason Heyward, Randal Grichuk DH: Joc PedersonAmong a group of veteran names, Pederson stands out following a superb season that saw him hit 22 home runs with a .923 OPS in 407 plate appearances against right-handed pitching. Pederson fits best as half of a DH platoon, though he managed a .749 OPS in 42 plate appearances against lefties in 2024. Best of the rest: J.D. Martinez, Andrew McCutchen, Daniel Vogelbach, Eloy Jiménez, Matt Carpenter RH starting pitcher: Corbin BurnesWe’re not including Roki Sasaki because of his international amateur status, though his value is greater because of his age (23) and contractual limitations. Among the big league free agents, Burnes tops the list of starting pitchers thanks to his lengthy track record of excellence: He’s 52-31 with a 2.88 ERA and 816 2/3 innings pitched since the start of 2020, trailing only Aaron Nola and Zack Wheeler in the latter during that time. Best of the rest: Nathan Eovaldi, Jack Flaherty, Luis Severino, Nick Pivetta, Shane Bieber, Walker Buehler, Kyle Gibson, Justin Verlander, Max Scherzer, Charlie Morton LH starting pitcher: Blake SnellSnell occupied this space a year ago after winning his second Cy Young Award, and while his 2024 started out poorly following his late signing with the Giants, the lefty dominated during the second half. With no Draft-pick compensation attached and the need for frontline starters around the league, he should be able to find the long-term deal that evaded him last winter. Best of the rest: Max Fried, Yusei Kikuchi, Sean Manaea, Clayton Kershaw, Matthew Boyd, Andrew Heaney, Jose Quintana RH relief pitcher: Jeff HoffmanTwo straight excellent seasons (2.28 ERA, 184 ERA+) have Hoffman -- a first-time All-Star in 2024 -- among the top relievers available this winter. Hoffman ranked in the top 5 percent of the league in chase percentage, whiff percentage and strikeout percentage, numbers that should have him high on the radar of clubs seeking late-inning help. Best of the rest: Clay Holmes, Carlos Estévez, David Robertson, Kenley Jansen, Chris Martin, Shawn Armstrong, Blake Treinen, Dylan Floro, Kirby Yates, José Leclerc, Jakob Junis, Yimi García LH relief pitcher: Tanner ScottScott has been one of the best relievers in the game since the start of 2023, posting a 7.6 rWAR over 146 appearances. He had a 1.75 ERA with the Marlins and Padres last season, thriving in both closing and setup roles, and was a master of inducing soft contact, ranking in the 99th percentile or better in both hard-hit percentage and average exit velocity. Best of the rest: Aroldis Chapman, Danny Coulombe, Jalen Beeks, A.J. Minter, Will Smith, Andrew Chafin, Caleb Ferguson, Tim Hill"
MLB News,Burnes is the best in MLB at one thing -- and the worst at another,https://www.mlb.com/news/two-overlooked-extremes-of-corbin-burnes,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 16:40:00 GMT","Some good news, and some bad news, about one of the top FA pitchers","Mike Petriello Corbin Burnes is maybe the most interesting free-agent starting pitcher available (non-Roki Sasaki division), and it’s not hard to see why. Over the past four seasons, the four-time All-Star and 2021 Cy Young Award winner is second only to Zack Wheeler in Wins Above Replacement. That stretch culminated with an All-MLB First Team selection in his first -- and maybe only -- year with Baltimore. He’s also a perfect example of modern pitching enlightenment, which is to say “he had an 8.82 ERA in 2019 and then completely changed his pitch shapes and usage to become an ace.” We saw that ability to change within the context of 2024, as well, as his strikeout rate plummeted in-season -- raising some questions about what that would do to his market -- before he fixed his cutter, restored his sweeper and ended up finishing with one of the best months of his career. For all of his obvious skill, he can also be a pitcher of extremes, and that is what interests us today. As Burnes heads off to the market to make some team quite happy to have him, there’s something you might not have realized he led the Majors in -- and something he was dead last in, too. As we said: extremes. The good: No one makes batters look foolish more often For years, this was simply an eye test thing. But no more; along with the introduction of Statcast’s bat tracking metrics in 2024 came “swords,” which is a way to actually quantify the most awkward, uncomfortable swinging strikes. There’s plenty more on that here, including how they’re defined, but the short version is: If the bat crosses the front face of the plate, doesn’t come all the way back around, and is in the slowest 10% of swings for that player, it’s a sword. It’s putting a number to a stomachache, really. There are bad swings and then there are bad swings. It’s not what you want, if you’re a hitter. It’s perhaps more of an entertainment stat than an analytical one, except for the fact that when you look at the pitchers who got the most swords in 2024, you start to realize something. These are really good pitchers, and maybe there’s some value in identifying the pitchers who don’t just miss bats, but manage to do it in a way that makes the best hitters on the planet look that bad, that often. Most swords, 2024 That’s a list you want to be on, right? Put another way: 12% of Burnes’ swinging strikes were of the ‘sword’ variety, the most in the Majors, ahead of many of the same names but also top relievers like Griffin Jax (the only other pitcher north of 10%). So while Burnes didn’t have the most strikeouts or the most swinging strikes, what he did have was the most that made a batter look, well, awful. For all of the metrics that don’t match the eye test, this is one that’s very much intended to. In Burnes' case, he managed to do it on five different pitch types – and since you’re dying to see what it looks like to make hitters look that foolish, enjoy this compilation of our dozen favorites. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Or, perhaps, spare a thought for poor Zach DeLoach, who did it three times (on three different pitch types) in an 0-for-4 showing on Sept. 2. Does it matter, to make batters look bad, as opposed to just piling up whiffs? Maybe, maybe not. But it’s hard not to notice that after collecting 15 swords in July and August combined, Burnes captured 14 in September alone after fixing his repertoire. It was the second-most in a month of any pitcher all year. So that’s the great news. What’s the flip side here? The bad: He’s the absolute weakest at preventing runners from going wild. Burnes allowed 41 stolen bases last year, the most in the Majors, and the most in Baltimore history. There’s obvious necessary context in any historic numbers like that, given the 2023 rule changes that made stealing bases easier, but “allowed the most steals in the Majors in 2024” requires no such explanation. No one was easier to advance against. But there’s so much context required in evaluating steal attempts, like if the runner was fast, or the leads were good, or the catcher can or can’t throw. Thankfully, we can go beyond just “most steals allowed” and into some advanced Statcast metrics, which show, perhaps unsurprisingly, that Burnes allowed the most advances on the bases of anyone. Fewest base advances prevented vs. avg, pitchers, 2024 “Holding a runner on” means preventing them from advancing, and that’s what this is saying -- being minus-21 here means he allowed 24 more advances than the average pitcher, given his situations, and in return only got three more outs than the average pitcher would have. On the other hand, someone who was very good at this -- like Shota Imanaga of the Cubs -- was plus-8, meaning that Burnes was nearly 30 base advances weaker than the best of the best. That’s steals, sure. But it’s not all steals, either. To start with, on three different occasions, Burnes allowed a free base by trying a third pickoff throw and failing to get the runner, tied for the most in baseball. Those aren’t steals, but they are free bases given, which all count. So what’s behind all of this? There’s a lot of moving parts, so let’s break it down. Is it his catchers?Probably not. Baltimore catchers had a 20% caught stealing percentage, which is essentially average (the Majors had a 21% caught stealing rate) -- and that would have been nearly 24% with Burnes removed. Both Adley Rutschman (+1 CS above avg) and James McCann (+0) rated as average in the advanced Statcast metrics, which account for a runner’s speed and distance, and Burnes threw to them about evenly anyway. Were the other O’s pitchers poor at this?Not really. If all Baltimore pitchers were bad across the board, it might point to something beyond Burnes, but it’s not this, either. While Craig Kimbrel (-7 base advances prevented) was as poor at this as he usually is, the rest of the O’s pitchers rated from roughly average to actually pretty good, in Grayson Rodriguez’s case. It’s a Burnes-specific issue. Why was he poor?It’s mostly about big leads, and the willingness of runners to try. Consider this: When runners at first (in steal opportunities) take a lead off of Burnes, they get off to a 10.4 foot lead, which is relatively average. By the time he releases the pitch, they’re up to 15.5 feet off first, which is a fraction of a foot off of being the largest lead allowed in baseball. Take the difference -- 5.1 feet of distance gained while the pitcher is in motion -- and it’s essentially tied for the largest amount of lead distance gained. That’s a lot of ground covered, and bad situations for his catchers. You can really see it in action here, when Seiya Suzuki -- an outfielder with good but hardly elite speed -- stole in July. McCann had a good throw from his knees, with a strong 1.94 second pop time, but because Suzuki was 26 feet off of first when the ball was released, there was hardly anything the catcher could do about it. It was the same thing earlier in the year when William Contreras gained 19 feet during Burnes’s motion, and is 33 feet off first base by the time the ball comes out, giving Rutschman no prayer of throwing him out. (In the catcher version of this metric, Rutschman was given a mere 3% chance of catching the runner, meaning that while he had to eat the one stolen base allowed, he was barely dinged in Statcast’s metrics, because of the opportunity he was given.) The broadcast video, however, is not sufficient to show you what really happened. If we look at the Statcast 3D version, look at Contreras dancing behind Burnes. Look how far he gets without Burnes even looking -- and then stops, because you assume the pitcher must have noticed -- before taking off when he realized he was in the clear. It’s because of that knowledge -- that you can get big leads here -- that runners were simply more aggressive on Burnes compared to most pitchers. While it may not seem like a lot that potential base stealers made an attempt on 6% of the pitches they had an opportunity to do so, it was actually third-highest in baseball behind Nick Nastrini and Adam Ottavino, long known for his weakness here. Why did he get worse?It wasn’t always like this for Burnes. This is the key for any team looking to sign Burnes for next year, because he wasn’t that bad at this with Milwaukee. He was, at times, even good. In all of 2022 -- again, under the old rules -- he allowed only five stolen bases, and it wasn’t because Brewer catchers Omar Narváez and Victor Caratini were elite throwers; they rated as average, similar to Burnes’s 2024 Orioles backstops. It’s partially because runners were far more willing to test him; note that the attempt rate nearly tripled from 2023. It’s also because he was allowing more distance during his motion, an entire foot more than he was giving up in his last year with Milwaukee, and in a sport where inches means everything, that could be the difference. Of course, this might not matter as much as it seems, anyway; it's not like Burnes wasn't successful, and -21 bases prevented comes out to all of three runs of value lost, which is minimal. The question, then, remains open: Did the Orioles instruct him not to even worry about it, and focus on the batter at the plate? Or did Burnes suddenly get worse at a skill he seemed to possess previously? Whether this keeps up in 2025 will go a long way towards providing an answer."
MLB News,Breaking down the Rangers' biggest offseason questions,https://www.mlb.com/news/rangers-key-offseason-questions,"Sun, 24 Nov 2024 23:05:00 GMT",,"Kennedi Landry This story was excerpted from Kennedi Landry’s Rangers Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. ARLINGTON -- It’s been a relatively quiet offseason across the league so far, but especially for the Rangers, who have just made a few peripheral moves, including adding a trio of prospects to the 40-man roster to avoid the Rule 5 Draft. With just under three weeks until MLB’s annual Winter Meetings, let’s answer some questions. Obviously offense was a bit lacking this year. Have there been talks of a new approach they’re going to try or how they think they can break out of what happened last year? -- @CautiousRanger on X (formerly Twitter) Will the Rangers rebound offensively after the downward turn from ‘23 to ‘24? -- @DinoLord05 on XI grouped a couple of the offense-based questions together for obvious reasons. Looking to revamp the offense, the Rangers hired Justin Viele to replace former hitting coach Tim Hyers, who left to take the same position with his hometown Braves. We've also hired Justin Viele as our Major League Hitting Coach. pic.twitter.com/OJLaYmBoXO President of baseball operations Chris Young said at the GM Meetings that he felt like the club’s swing decisions and plate discipline were relatively good over the course of the year, but they are things that need to continue to be reinforced and valued going forward. The bigger issues team-wide were being on time for the fastball and making in-game adjustments, both of which will be a point of emphasis for Viele and bench coach Donnie Ecker going into 2025. “I think that we maybe got a little stubborn last year at times and really not doing some of the things that the opponent was giving us and taking what was being given to us,” Young explained. “I think there's always adjustments to make. The style that we had in 2023, the league adapted, and we came in with -- I think -- a similar mindset and approach. We were a little late to adjust, in my opinion. “We're very confident in Justin and Donnie working together to be able to help make that correction with our group,” Young said. As much as I don’t want it to happen, when do you think Bochy will retire? -- @HaydenHerring12 on XRangers manager Bruce Bochy’s contract goes through the 2025 season, but he’s shown no signs of wanting to hang it up once again. Associate manager Will Venable recently left to take the manager's position with the White Sox, perhaps signaling that Bochy could be extended even further. “I’m still hungry to get back,” Bochy said at the end of the season. “I'm disappointed, just like all of us, in how this season went. But that's why I got back in the game. That's what drives me. I've talked to the coaches and we're working out how to get this thing back to where we want to be. That's getting back to the postseason and winning the championship. “If that somehow starts to go away, believe me, I'll know it, but it's not there now. This is where I want to be. This is where I'm happy. It couldn't have worked out better. We've talked about my situation, believe me. Right now, I want to get this thing back to where we were last year, and that's back to the postseason.” Who do you think would be an ideal FA fit that we could sign for the rotation? -- @mrdadum on XIt’s hard to tell what the Rangers' budget will be in terms of free agents this offseason, but the rotation definitely needs a starting pitcher to fill the innings left behind by Nathan Eovaldi and Andrew Heaney. Obviously those two may be the best free agents for the club anyway. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Externally, it’s complicated. Guys like Walker Buehler and Jack Flaherty may have priced themselves out of Texas' range this postseason. A guy like Shane Bieber feels like the recent M.O. of older players coming off an injury. John Means can fall into that category, as well. Sean Manaea maybe could be the best fit. He posted a career-best 3.47 ERA in 181 2/3 innings with the Mets this season, and could slot in nicely around Jacob deGrom, Jon Gray, Cody Bradford and Tyler Mahle. Will Nathaniel Lowe be on the Opening Day roster? -- @mulderbatflip on BlueSkyI would almost definitely say yes. Crazier things have happened obviously, but Lowe won a Silver Slugger in 2022 and a Gold Glove in ‘23. He’s part of the core that led the Rangers to their first World Series championship in franchise history. He lacked a bit of power this season, slashing .265/.361/.401 while posting the lowest OPS of his entire Texas tenure. Despite what he’s set to make in arbitration this year -- a projected $9.9 million, per Cot’s Contracts -- it’s hard to imagine an internal upgrade on both sides and any external upgrade like Pete Alonso or Christian Walker would almost definitely cost much more than the Rangers would like to spend. “Nate's overall body of work was really solid,” Young said. “He had a good year. When you look at the total body of work, he got hurt in Spring Training and missed about a month there at the beginning of the season, and I think it led to a little bit of a slow start. I think there's a lot to look forward to with Nate.”"
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",An 'embarrassing' loss signals the end of San Francisco's season,https://sports.yahoo.com/49ers-lacked-offensive-pulse-without-their-system-qb-and-blowout-loss-to-green-bay-was-final-nail-in-niners-2024-season-071005429.html,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 07:10:05 GMT","The Niners have six games left, and all of them are ""must-win"" if they hope to make the playoffs. But hope does not align with reality. This team is done.","For the desperately optimistic San Francisco 49ers fans, there will be a path through this brutal remaining maze and into the playoffs. They’ll point to the exceedingly tight race for the NFC West crown, which could hang in the balance until the last week of the season. They’ll cross their fingers with injuries, hoping that three of their four best players — quarterback Brock Purdy, defensive end Nick Bosa and offensive tackle Trent Williams — will all come out of the tunnel next week and turn everything around against the Buffalo Bills (9-2). And they’ll definitely avoid thinking about how eerily similar this campaign has become to the 2020 season, when San Francisco was beset by health and identity issues following a Super Bowl loss the previous season, leading to a massively disappointing 6-10 record that inspired an eventual roster retooling. On that latter point, it’s hard to ignore the symmetry of that lost 2020 season. Those 49ers were 5-6 going into December, looking like a shadow of themselves, and hosting the Bills in a game that felt like it was the last best chance to salvage the season. San Francisco lost 34-24, in a game that was really never as close as that score suggested. At the conclusion of it, there was clarity that the season was over and the 49ers had a lot of work ahead. A week from now, the same could and likely will be said about the 2024 49ers, who don’t look anything like the team that came out of last season’s Super Bowl loss. You could pick any 10-minute increment inside Sunday’s atrocious 38-10 loss to the Green Bay Packers — the 49ers’ worst defeat under Shanahan since 2018 — and find alarming traits everywhere. A team that couldn’t dictate the run or find anything explosive throwing the football. A defensive front that got slapped in the ear by Packers running back Josh Jacobs on his first carry of the game and never seemed to recover. An overall lack of focus that led to nine penalties, several occurring at critical moments. And an overwhelming presentation of underwhelming football that suggests these 49ers will fail to recover, just like the last edition that lost in a Super Bowl the season before. “The whole game was [disappointing],” Shanahan said afterward. “To label just the biggest [disappointment], the first half, just the run defense was real disappointing. … Them being able to control that clock in the first half was one of the worst ones I’ve been a part of as far as a half.” Shanahan uttered some iteration of the word “embarrassed” multiple times in his postgame press conference, applying the label to the entire team, which seemed like the appropriate reaction to a loss that is half lesson and half warning. The lesson: The 49ers are as mortal as any other team that can’t survive without a marquee starting quarterback, elite edge rusher and tone-setting offensive tackle. When they’re wounded, they’re vulnerable, especially against top-tier NFC teams — which the Packers are. And the warning: Let this be the standard that ends all the talk about Shanahan being able to make it work with any quarterback in his scheme, particularly if it’s a one-game situation. It’s a fallacy that has been proven before, but also conveniently and repeatedly forgotten anytime someone dares to enter Purdy’s name into a conversation about the league’s best QBs. Yes, he’s had his ups and downs this season. But rarely has the offense looked so flat and seemingly intent on shooting itself in the foot. If anything, that Packers loss is a snapshot reminder of what life can be like when you don’t have a dependable quarterback running Shanahan’s offense. Certainly all the issues weren’t simply the absence of Purdy, but the inability to find any kind of fix over the course of the game surely had something to do with the quarterback spot. As it turns out, the system usually looks best when the quarterback who fits and masters that system is the one at the controls. That’s food for thought this offseason, when there will inevitably be conversations about the cost of Purdy’s contract extension versus his actual value to the franchise. Of course, that’s a conversation for a later time. For now, the focus is on what this loss means for the 49ers. With the Los Angeles Rams’ loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday night, the NFC West remains in the hands of the Seattle Seahawks and Arizona Cardinals — both sitting at 6-5 and simultaneously jockeying for who will win the division and who will try to qualify for the NFC’s last wild-card slot. At 5-6, the 49ers haven’t exactly been left in vapor when it comes to the postseason, but even if the math is still there for the taking, the spirit of what is reaching for it is problematic. Purdy was already having consistency issues before his latest throwing shoulder pain knocked him out of the game against the Packers. There’s no telling how big of an issue that’s going to be when (or if) he returns. Although it’s certainly suggestive that in a game the 49ers needed to win against Green Bay, his shoulder was a big enough concern to sideline him. The same goes for Bosa’s hip and Williams’ ankle. Both might be close to returning, but neither is guaranteed to be playing at their peak level — for a team that needs them to be playing at a high level right now. And if that wasn’t enough, two other key players, defensive tackle Jordan Elliott and offensive guard Aaron Banks both exited Sunday with concussion concerns. Now with the loss to the Packers, the intersection of these health issues comes heading into the cross-country-iest of cross-country road games: Sunday night’s prime-time tilt against a streaking Bills team. A franchise that will be well-rested, coming off a bye week, and stalking the AFC’s No. 1 playoff seed after beating the Kansas City Chiefs convincingly in Week 11. While that kind of win would usually enlist some fears of a letdown in the next game, the bye week and postseason seeding stakes for the Bills effectively guarantee that they’ll show up ready to rock. If we’re being honest about what the 49ers are facing from a schedule perspective, the time to win was against the Packers. That they weren’t able to win Sunday makes this game against the Bills and every one after it a pseudo playoff game. Basically, that’s where the 49ers are at. They’re in a single-elimination postseason tournament starting this week. And after the Bills, it’s the Chicago Bears (still working their own problems out but getting better), the Rams (who beat the 49ers in September), the Miami Dolphins (who are a handful with Tua Tagovailoa back under center), the Detroit Lions (Super Bowl favorites, winners of nine straight, and seeking revenge for the NFC title game loss), and finally, a road game against the Arizona Cardinals, who are no longer being pushed around. If we want to simmer down San Francisco’s problems, we don’t need to get into the injuries, focus and inconsistencies within games. We can look at just that uphill break — which is more like scaling Mt. Everest at this point — and it tells us everything we need to know. The 49ers' 2024 season is done. We just haven’t watched it play out yet."

Two key veteran members of the Philadelphia defense left the Eagles' 37-20 Sunday Night Football win — also known as The Saquon Barkley Show — with one of them saying he's done for the year. Also, the Las Vegas Raiders will need some help in their quarterback room after their starting QB was lost for the remainder of the season. Also on the NFL injury front — off the field — NBC Sports' Mike Tirico (torn Achillies) was in the Sunday Night Football broadcast booth and plans on finishing the season as usual, despite the injury. The 14-year veteran defensive end was having a great game against the Rams when he exited after having moved into third place on the Eagles' all-time sack list. After the game he said he'd been dealing with some tendonitis in his left triceps, and confirmed the tear. He'll miss the rest of the season — one that could be his last, after signing a one-year, $4 million contract this past offseason. He's one of just three players on the team, alongside tackle Lane Johnson and kicker Jake Elliott, who won Super Bowl LII at the end of the 2017 season. Also on the Eagles' defense, cornerback Darius Slay Jr. suffered a concussion and did not return to the game. The Raiders' signal caller suffered the injury in the fourth quarter of the team's 29-19 loss to the Broncos. He finishes the season with 2,013 passing yards and nine touchdown passes with 10 interceptions in 10 games played. Desmond Ridder finished the game in his place. The Raiders have a short week and take on the Chiefs on Black Friday, and could welcome back Aidan O'Connell — he's been on IR since October with a fractured thumb, and could be activated this week. As far as other potential options, rookie quarterback Carter Bradley is on the Raiders practice squad and outside of the organization, ex-Giants quarterback Daniel Jones, who was released on Friday and is a free agent, is ""excited for the next opportunity"" and said ""there's a lot of good football"" left in his future. A day after Raiders quarterback Gardner Minshew suffered a season-ending injury, his quarterback counterpart Aidan O'Connell is back at practice. The Raiders announced that O'Connell returned to practice Monday after missing four weeks with a fractured thumb. There's a chance he returns from injured reserve in time for Friday's game against the Kansas City Chiefs, but his status for the game remains unclear. The Raiders could be in the market for a quarterback either way. For all the latest on the Raiders quarterback situation, read here. Aaron Rodgers, at least for now, is still the New York Jets’ starting quarterback. Rodgers, despite the Jets’ struggles and his apparent injuries in recent weeks, will ""absolutely"" be the team’s starting quarterback on Sunday in their game against the Seattle Seahawks. Jets interim coach Jeff Ulbrich said Monday that Rodgers is the healthiest he’s been in the past month coming off their bye week, and the team isn’t yet considering shutting him down for the rest of the season. Ulbrich also denied knowing anything about reports that Rodgers has been resisting medical scans offered by the Jets. The NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported earlier this week that Rodgers didn’t want to “reveal the severity of his injuries out of fear of having to come off the field,” which is why he apparently has denied the medical scans. While Ulbrich didn’t say the report was inaccurate, he insisted he knew nothing about it. ""News to me,"" Ulbrich said, via ESPN's Rich Cimini.

The injury leaves the Raiders with just Desmond Ridder at quarterback. The Raiders placed Aidan O'Connell on injured reserve in October with a fractured thumb. O'Connell was reportedly given an initial timeline of 4-6 weeks to return, but could play Friday against the Chiefs if he's able to ramp up without issues. The Raiders announced on Monday that O'Connell had returned to practice. His status for Friday's game remains unclear. Minshew suffered his injury on the Raiders' penultimate drive with 2:57 remaining on the game clock and Denver leading, 26-19.

Ridder finished the game at quarterback. He fumbled on a sack on his second drop back. The Broncos recovered and converted the turnover into a field goal to extend their lead to two possessions with 1:56 remaining. The Raiders signed Ridder off the Falcons' practice squad in October when O'Connell injured his thumb. Depending on O'Connell's status, the Raiders may be in the market to sign another quarterback in the aftermath of Minshew's injury. Former Toledo and South Alabama quarterback Carter Bradley is on the Raiders' practice squad. He's never thrown an NFL pass. The Raiders dropped to 2-9 with Sunday's loss and further out of the playoff picture. Minshew's injury will instead impact the race for the No. 1 pick in the draft. The Raiders are tied with the Jaguars and Giants for the worst record in the NFL."

Hunter and the Tigers stunned No. 2 UConn 99-97 on Monday at the Lahaina Civic Center in Maui to open the iconic Feast Week tournament — which returned to Maui this week for the first time since deadly fires erupted on the island in 2023. That pushed the Tigers to a perfect 5-0 on the season and moved them into the semifinals, where they’ll take on either Colorado or Michigan State on Tuesday. The Huskies, who are coming off back-to-back national championship runs, have now lost their first game since Feb. 20. That ended a 17-game win streak. Memphis looked like it was going to pull off the win in regulation after jumping up by 13 points late in the second half. The Tigers had all the momentum, and UConn — despite entering halftime tied up 40-40 — appeared to be dead in the water. But suddenly, the Huskies rattled off an 18-5 run to end the second half. Ball capped that tear with a perfect 3-pointer from the wing with just more than a second left, too, which sent the game into overtime. Solo. Ball. pic.twitter.com/ujgqsZ2nCS — UConn Men's Basketball (@UConnMBB) November 25, 2024 UConn used that momentum and took the early jump in the extra period, too. Memphis, however, didn’t go away — and the Tigers took full advantage of a mistake from coach Dan Hurley. Memphis tied the game back up after a 3-pointer from Colby Rogers, and then Tigers guard P.J. Carter hit four straight free throws just a few seconds later after Liam McNeeley was called for an over-the-back foul on the other end. That foul set Hurley off and earned him a technical foul, which resulted in a seven-point swing. That was enough to keep Memphis ahead the rest of the way. Carter had all nine of his points in overtime, thanks to a 3-pointer before the technical and two free throws after, to keep the Tigers in the lead and eventually give them the win. UConn had one final look at the buzzer, but couldn’t get it to fall a second time. While Hurley's technical foul didn't directly cause the loss, it undoubtedly opened the door for the Tigers at the worst possible time. Hunter finished with 26 points on seven 3-pointers for the Tigers in the win. P.J. Haggerty added 22 points and five assists, and Colby Rogers finished with 19 points. They shot nearly 55% from both the field and behind the arc as a team, too. Tarris Reed led UConn with 22 points and 11 rebounds off the bench in the loss. Alex Karaban finished with 19 points, and McNeeley had 10 points and four rebounds. The Huskies, who entered the week as the favorite in the event, will now take on the loser of Colorado-Michigan State on Wednesday on the consolation side of the bracket. UConn was by far the favorite on its half of the bracket, which now clears a path for Hardaway and the Tigers to reach the title game on Wednesday. No. 4 Auburn, No. 5 Iowa State and No. 12 North Carolina are all on the other side of the bracket, however, so a championship in Hawaii before Thanksgiving won't be easy by any means. But regardless of what happens in the coming days, Memphis now has a marquee win under its belt. For a team that lost eight of its last 15 games and missed the NCAA tournament completely last season, a win over a top-5 team in the early days of the season is a huge accomplishment."

With two weeks left before the first iteration of the expanded field is set, that is not the case.","The College Football Playoff selection committee enters its final two weeks of deliberation with a host of consequential decisions thrust on the 13 members. (1) Who are the final at-large selections into the field? (2) Which teams receive a first-round game at home? (3) Which four conference champions receive a first-round bye? The first two are causing plenty of angst. But it is the third stress point that, perhaps, offers the most intriguing debate. The five highest-ranked conference champions earn a bid into the 12-team field, and the top four champions are seeded Nos. 1-4 and receive a bye into the quarterfinals. Many presumed that the champions of the four power leagues would annually get those first-round byes. The CFP selection committee’s last rankings paint a different picture. In its rankings released last week, Boise State (10-1) was ahead of all Big 12 teams, paving the way for the Broncos to receive the No. 4 seed and the first-round bye in a Group of Five-over-Power Four leap. Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark said such a decision would be the wrong one. “Based on where we sit today, I see no rationale for the Big 12’s champion not getting a first-round bye,” Yormark told Yahoo Sports. “The winner of our championship should receive a bye. I have a lot of trust in the selection committee and I’m sure they’ll see it that way. Just look at the data. The data doesn’t lie. From a strength-of-schedule standpoint, all four of our schools at the top of the standings are ranked ahead of Boise State.” At the center of the debate is a comparison not only of the individual teams but of the two leagues. The argument is fascinating in an era of college football where the power leagues continue to separate themselves from the five others: the Mountain West, Sun Belt, Conference USA, American and Mid-American. Yormark is loaded with Big 12 data points. His league has 42 wins over teams with a winning record. The Mountain West has 11 (five of those from Boise and UNLV). Nine Big 12 teams are bowl eligible. The Mountain West has five. Boise’s strength of schedule is ranked 81st, 12 spots behind the worst of the Big 12’s top four teams (Iowa State at 69). The two leagues have actually met on the field eight times this season. The Big 12 is 6-2 with an average margin of victory of more than three touchdowns. UNLV holds both of the Mountain West wins (at Houston and Kansas). “Arizona State defeated Wyoming by 41 points. BYU beat them by 20. Boise struggled against Wyoming in a four-point win,” Yormark said. “There is no rationale for us not getting the bye.” In an interview Monday with Yahoo Sports, Boise State coach Spencer Danielson isn’t looking that far ahead — a message he hammers home to his team. ""We still have two more games to even continue this conversation,” he said. ""That’s where I am with it. We’ve been playing playoff football since the Oregon game. I believe in our schedule. We’ve played well. We played well against Orgon. Are we suited for a bye? That’s up to the committee."" Seven of Boise State’s 10 wins have come by at least two scores, including a 21-point victory over a Washington State team that beat Texas Tech by three touchdowns in Week 2 of the season. But Boise State’s strongest arguments are, perhaps, its one loss and its best player. The Broncos led No. 1 Oregon for much of their game on Sept. 7, eventually losing on a last-second field goal. Boise State has the nation’s leading rusher, Heisman Trophy candidate Ashton Jeanty, who has run for nearly 600 yards more than the next best rusher. ""There have been multiple teams in the rankings that are no longer in the rankings because they got caught up in this stuff,” Danielson said. “It’s hard for me to lobby on things with two games left. You control what you can control."" Mountain West commissioner Gloria Nevarez declined comment aside from gesturing to similar data points for the Broncos, most notably that three-point loss in Eugene. The CFP selection committee meets again early this week before its rankings are revealed Tuesday night on ESPN. Over the weekend, the Big 12’s two highest-ranked teams, No. 14 BYU and No. 16 Colorado, lost. Boise State, ranked No. 12 last week, survived that scare from Wyoming. In the updated AP poll released Sunday, Arizona State was the highest-ranked Big 12 team at No. 14. Boise was No. 11. “What's going on right now isn't fair to the Big 12,” Kansas State coach Chris Klieman told reporters on Monday. “Other teams can lose in other leagues and it’s ‘That league is really good!’ We lose in this league and it’s ‘This league stinks!’ I don’t understand that. As a conference, we need to get together and figure some things out. For a bunch of teams to be 9-2 and we can’t get any (benefits) in the College Football Playoff, then we need to cancel one of these (conference) games and then go to eight games.” The decision from the selection committee related to the first-round bye is not insignificant. The fourth highest-ranked conference champion, the No. 4 seed in the bracket, gets an additional week to rest. The team would play the No. 5-12 seed winner in a bowl site quarterfinal matchup. The fifth highest-ranked conference champion, at least according to how the rankings project, is likely to be seeded No. 12. That means playing a first-round game at the No. 5 seed on the road. The No. 5 seed, for now, projects to be the Big Ten championship game loser, likely Oregon or Ohio State, the two top-ranked teams in the nation. Before any decision from the committee, though, the remaining schedules must be played out. Boise State hosts Oregon State (5-6) and then meets Colorado State or UNLV in the Mountain West championship game, played in Boise. The Big 12, meanwhile, is a lot less certain. Billed as having the most parity of any power league, the 16-team conference is certainly delivering. Nine teams remain eligible for the conference championship game, with four of them in the best position. BYU (9-2), Iowa State (9-2), Arizona State (9-2) and Colorado (8-3) are tied at 6-2 in the conference atop the standings. All four are favored to win their regular season finale, a result that would put Arizona State and Iowa State in the title game. “I said in July we have great depth and parity and I thought it would play out and it has,” Yormark said. “I said that the month of November would be magical and it has. It’s been made-for-TV viewing.” The debate over the CFP’s final first-round bye is an extension of a long-running tussle between the power leagues and those from the lower-resourced level of the Football Bowl Subdivision. The gaps between the two continue to grow, both from decisions made by power leaders and from the courts. The decisions have accelerated the concept of schools directly compensating athletes — a much more difficult endeavor for Group of Five programs. Their budgets are normally fractions of those schools in power conferences that reap more lucrative television contracts and generate more internal revenue through donations and ticket sales. In fact, the Group of Five is having its most difficulty winning games against the power leagues this season, according to data from ESPN. Group of Five programs - including independents UMass and UConn, as well as Oregon State and Washington State — are 8-87 against power teams. The winning percentage of .084 is believed to be the worst in modern history. The decision to incorporate a fifth conference champion into the field — assuring a Group of Five spot — is a subject that has drawn heated debate and scrutiny over the years from leaders of the power leagues. Craig Thompson, the former Mountain West commissioner, was part of a four-man working group that originally created the current 12-team format. He was the only representative from the G5 ranks. “What’s happening with Boise State possibly getting a bye is not surprising,” Thompson said in a recent interview with Yahoo Sports. “The Group of Five champion, if they have a big year, gets rewarded in the system.” The five auto-bids and the first-round byes were not designated to specific conferences to avoid the scrutiny of congressional lawmakers, who, in the past, skewered the old BCS concept for creating a caste system. This past spring, CFP leaders — the 10 conference commissioners and Notre Dame’s athletic director — re-evaluated the format when they agreed on a new six-year extension that begins with the 2026 playoff. They didn’t settle on a format, instead only agreeing to protections that guarantee (1) the five highest-ranked champions an automatic berth, (2) the field to be 12 or 14 teams in size and (3) Notre Dame to receive an at-large bid if it is ranked inside the top 12 or 14, depending on the field size. During discussions, debate raged over whether to keep the Group of Five’s access spot. Speaking to Yahoo Sports from her conference football media days in July, Nevarez said that power conference leaders “threatened” to remove the G5’s bid in the spring. But, “to their credit, it never came off the table.”"

The 15-time major winner announced on Monday afternoon that he will not be playing in the Hero World Challenge, his annual charitable tournament in the Bahamas. I am disappointed that I will not be able to compete this year at the Hero World Challenge, but always look forward to being tournament host and spending the week with @HeroMotoCorp. Excited to welcome our exemptions @JustinThomas34, @JDayGolf and @NickDunlap62 into the field. — Tiger Woods (@TigerWoods) November 25, 2024 “I am disappointed that I will not be able to compete this year at the Hero World Challenge,” Woods tweeted, “but always look forward to being tournament host and spending the week with @HeroMotoCorp.” Woods noted that Justin Thomas, Jason Day and Nick Dunlap — who earlier this year won a PGA Tour event as an amateur — would be joining the field. Woods only played in five events in 2024: the Genesis Invitational, from which he withdrew, and the four majors. He finished solo 60th at this year’s Masters, and missed the cut in all three of the succeeding majors. Woods hasn’t been seen swinging a golf club in months, and in September underwent another of the many procedures he’s had on his back. The microdecompression surgery was intended to relieve nerve pain, though there was no timetable given for recovery. “The surgery went smoothly, and I’m hopeful this will help alleviate the back spasms and pain I was experiencing throughout most of the 2024 season,” Woods said after the September surgery. “I look forward to tackling this rehab and preparing myself to get back to normal life activities, including golf.” This year marked the first time since 2020 that Woods played in all available majors in a season; he suffered a catastrophic car wreck in February 2021. He has continued to insist that he wants to play golf as long as he is able, despite the fact that there are growing calls for him to retire from some segments of the golf universe. Woods is helping to develop TGL, an indoor golf league scheduled to begin play in January. He is a member of one of the six four-man teams, but has not yet indicated whether he will play in the league."

Albert Breer shared some revealing details on Patriots Pregame Live.,"Breer details what motivated Robert Kraft's latest Hall of Fame snub originally appeared on NBC Sports Boston Robert Kraft is one of the most successful owners in NFL history. But he's still waiting to be given the league's highest honor. The New England Patriots owner will not be included in the 2025 class of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, ESPN's Don Van Natta reported Friday. Kraft was among the semifinalists under consideration in the ""contributor"" category for the 2025 class, but according to Van Natta, the nine-member subcommittee instead chose Ralph Hay, one of the NFL's initial co-founders who owned the Canton Bulldogs from 1918 to 1922. Why does Kraft continue to get passed over for the Hall of Fame despite an impressive resume that includes overseeing one of the greatest dynasties in professional sports that brought six Super Bowl titles to New England from 2001 to 2018? Sports Illustrated's Albert Breer joined Patriots Pregame Live on Sunday to offer more insight into the subcomittee's thought process. ""I think there are a couple of things at work here,"" Breer said, as seen in the video above. ""Number one, the Spygate/Deflategate thing is part of it with the committee. There's no question about that. They feel like if he is going to be celebrated for winning the Super Bowl championships, the six of them with Tom Brady and Bill Belichick, then he has to wear their warts too."" That's a somewhat reasonable gripe, as Kraft's Patriots were involved in a pair of fairly significant scandals during their dynasty. But the rest of Breer's reporting should make the Krafts' blood boil. ""I think the other factor is what we've all been talking about, which was the endless campaigning to get him in (to the Hall of Fame),"" Breer said. ""Now, my understanding is that Kraft's camp has dialed that back the last couple of years. And I think now based on the age of some of the guys in that committee, some of those guys are out of the business of football at this point -- they're sick of being told they're idiots. They're sick of being told they don't know what they're doing. ""So, what does that cause them to do? That's caused them to go the other way and show how much smarter they are than everybody else and put in Buddy Parker last year and put in Ralph Hay (this year)."" According to Breer, folks at the Hall of Fame also were upset that news of Kraft's snub was leaked to Van Natta. ""Along those lines, I don't think it helped that this got out the way that it did,"" Breer said. ""This is another factor I think going forward now. I heard a lot of people at the Hall of Fame were pissed off that this thing was leaked and got out through Don Van Natta and that the Hall wasn't allowed to make the announcement of Ralph Hay on its own. ""So, whether or not the Kraft camp was involved in that at all, it doesn't matter. It's another thing that kind of goes up on that ledger, and it's unfortunate, because I do think Kraft was very deserving."" It's one thing for the Hall of Fame subcommittee to deny Kraft entry because they don't think he's worthy. But this seems like more of a personal vendetta that has little to do with the Patriots owner's actual accomplishments and more to do with the subcommittee trying to make a point. That's an incredibly frustrating development for an NFL owner who clearly has a Hall of Fame resume but continues to be snubbed for reasons unrelated to what he's accomplished over the last 30 years."

Brown, 73, was asked about his future at his weekly news conference as the Tar Heels prepare for their regular-season finale against rival NC State. When asked directly if he intends to return in 2025, Brown said yes. Brown was asked about his intentions after telling reporters that's he's yet to discuss his future with athletic director Bubba Cunningham. ""You never talk to your athletic director until the year’s over,"" Brown said. Brown later expanded on his thoughts regarding retirement amid his second stint as North Carolina's head coach. ""I’m not gonna think about retiring. I’m not gonna talk about retiring,"" Brown said. … ""There will be a morning when I’ll get up and I’ll say, 'You know what, somebody else should be leading this team. They’re better than I am at this at this point.' Then I’ll go do something else."" Brown is in his sixth season at North Carolina since returning to Chapel Hill in 2019. The Tar Heels (6-5) won their first three games, but saw their season spiral following a 70-50 loss at home to James Madison in Week 4 that triggered speculation about Brown's job security Brown reportedly told his team in the locker following the loss that he was willing to step down if he couldn't fix the team's problems. A day later, Brown said he wouldn't resign. North Carolina followed up the loss to James Madison with three consecutive losses to start ACC play, including a defeat to rival Duke. The Tar Heels then won three straight against Virginia, Florida State and Wake Forest before a 41-21 loss to Boston College on Saturday. UNC had one of the program's best runs in Brown's first stint in Chapel Hill from 1988-97. The Tar Heels produced three 10-win seasons, including a 10-1 campaign that ended with a No. 6 ranking in the AP poll in 1997, Brown's last season before he left to become the head coach at Texas. Brown returned to North Carolina in 2019 after 16 seasons in Austin that included a national championship in 2005. Brown's produced some successes in his return, including a trip to the 2022 ACC championship game and the recruitment and development of quarterback Drake Maye. But North Carolina's failed to eclipse nine wins since his return and is still seeking its first ACC championship since 1980. North Carolina will host NC State in Saturday's regular-season finale.

And, with holiday tournaments already underway, expect plenty more in the coming days. Here’s everything you missed in Week 3 of the college basketball season, and the latest Associated Press men’s basketball poll. Baylor split this week, but just barely. It might be time to be concerned about the Bears. Baylor, after finding itself on the wrong end of a blowout 38-point loss to Gonzaga to start the season, fell to Tennessee, 77-62, in the Baha Mar Hoops championship game on Friday. The Vols opened the game on a 23-4 tear before cruising to the dominant win. Chaz Lanier had 25 points on seven 3-pointers for Tennessee all in the first half. Baylor only made that game thanks to a buzzer-beater from Jeremy Roach the night before. Roach stunned Rick Pitino and St. John’s with a wild shot in double overtime of the event to secure the win. BEARS WIN IT AT THE BUZZER IN DOUBLE OVERTIME!#SicEm | #CultureofJOY pic.twitter.com/nZR4HN7wVd — Baylor Men’s Basketball (@BaylorMBB) November 22, 2024 Pitino slammed officials after that game, calling the crew “highly unethical” after a late review. “I don’t know what to say. The referees didn’t do a very good job tonight,” he said, via CBS’ Kyle Boone. Regardless, St. John’s dropped out of the rankings completely this week. Baylor fell four spots to No. 17. There’s still time for Baylor to right the ship, and it’ll have plenty of opportunities to do so once Big 12 play gets going. There’s no disputing that Scott Drew has a talented roster at his disposal. But so far, something has been off. If the Bears can’t get back on track before conference play starts, and if they can’t at least hang with No. 2 UConn next week, it could be a long season for Baylor. Wisconsin might be the lone bright spot in the Big Ten right now. The Badgers, after their commanding win over Arizona earlier this month, rallied from 14 points down to beat Pittsburgh and win the Greenbrier Tip-Off on Sunday night. That moved them to a perfect 7-0 on the season, and jumped them up four spots to No. 15 in this week’s poll. Other than Indiana, which beat UNC Greensboro to stay undefeated, it was a rough week for the conference. Marquette flew past Purdue on Tuesday behind a triple-double from Kam Jones. It was just the third triple-double in program history, and the first since Dwyane Wade's in 2003. That moved the Golden Eagles up to No. 10, and dropped Purdue to No. 13 this week. Then, at the bottom of the rankings, both Illinois and Rutgers fell this past week, too. Rutgers slipped on Sunday night to Kennesaw State after star freshman Ace Bailey committed a bad turnover in the final seconds that could have set up a game-tying bucket. Instead, the Owls picked up their first-ever home win against a ranked program. Rutgers, which fell out of the rankings completely, was out-rebounded by 19. While the Illini recovered with a 47-win over Maryland Eastern Shore, they couldn’t hang with Alabama on Wednesday night. Grant Nelson dropped 23 points for the Crimson Tide, who led nearly the entire way while picking up the 100-87 win. That dropped Illinois from the rankings, too. It’s officially “Feast Week,” one of the best stretches of basketball in the entire season. A series of tournaments will take place across the United States and more this week around the Thanksgiving holiday, and at least a few of them promise to provide some incredible matchups later in the week. Let’s start with the Maui Invitational, which is back at the Lahaina Civic Center after deadly wildfires spread over the island in 2023. That tournament will kick off with a top-five battle between No. 4 Auburn and No. 5 Iowa State on Monday night, where the winner will take on either No. 12 North Carolina or Dayton. Two-time reigning national champion UConn leads the other side of the bracket with Memphis, Colorado and Michigan State. The championship game on Wednesday night should be great regardless of who makes it in. The Battle 4 Atlantis is in the Bahamas again, and both No. 24 Arizona and No. 3 Gonzaga lead the field. Gonzaga will have to get past West Virginia and then either Louisville or No. 14 Indiana to make the title game, while Arizona is with Oklahoma, Providence and Davidson on the other side of the bracket. The Wildcats fell seven spots this week in the poll after their 69-55 loss to Cooper Flagg and Duke on Friday. The third major tournament this week will take place in Las Vegas at the Players Era Festival. This event will start with group play on Tuesday and Wednesday to set up a championship game and consolation games on Saturday. While it’s not a traditional bracket, No. 6 Houston and No. 9 Alabama will play each other right away on Tuesday. Depending on how that shakes out, with Creighton and Texas A&M leading the other group, Saturday’s championship could be great. *neutral site game Monday, Nov. 25 No. 4 Auburn vs. No. 5 Iowa State | 9 p.m. ET | ESPNU* Tuesday, Nov. 26 No. 6 Houston vs. No. 9 Alabama | 8 p.m. ET* No. 1 Kansas vs. No. 11 Duke | 9 p.m. ET | ESPN* Maui Invitational Semifinals | 6 p.m., 11 p.m. ET | ESPN* Wednesday, Nov. 27 Maui Invitational Championship Game | 5 p.m. ET | ESPN* Thursday, Nov. 28 Battle 4 Atlantis Semifinals | 12 p.m., 5 p.m. ET | ESPN* Friday, Nov. 29 Battle 4 Atlantis Championship Game | 5:30 p.m. ET | ESPN* Saturday, Nov. 30 Players Era Festival Championship Game | 9:30 p.m. ET | TNT* The full Associated Press men’s basketball poll from Nov. 25, 2024. 1.

According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, the Baltimore Ravens and Minnesota Vikings are “two of the likeliest teams” to add Jones, who wants to sign with a playoff contender. Schefter adds that the results of Week 12 could have an impact on Jones' decision. Meanwhile, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reports that the San Francisco 49ers, with Brock Purdy dealing with a shoulder injury, “would make a lot of sense and could be very real,” while the Las Vegas Raiders “are said to like Jones as an organization.” Jones, the No. 6 overall pick in the 2019 draft, was released by the Giants on Friday after previously being demoted, seemingly to fourth string, with the Giants having no intention of playing him because of his $23 million injury guarantee. Jones requested and was granted his release, ending a tumultuous run as the Giants’ starting quarterback. In 69 starts, Jones had a record of 24-44-1 with 14,582 yards, 70 touchdowns, and 47 interceptions. The Giants made the playoffs just once during Jones’ tenure, and he helped lead them to a road win over the Minnesota Vikings before falling to Philadelphia in the Divisional Round in 2022. The Giants will start Tommy DeVito at quarterback on Sunday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, with Drew Lock serving as backup, and Tim Boyle likely up as the emergency third quarterback."

Nothing, that’s what. So let’s do it every week, right here. Today: What should the Commanders have done after scoring a miraculous late touchdown against Dallas? At the end of the third quarter, Dallas led Washington 10-9 on Sunday. With one minute left in the game, the score was Dallas 27, Washington 20 … so the scores were flying. And so was Washington’s Terry McLaurin, streaking downfield for an 86-yard touchdown to put the score at 27-26 with just 21 seconds remaining. COMMANDERS 86-YARD TOUCHDOWN WOW📺: #DALvsWAS on FOX📱: https://t.co/waVpO909ge pic.twitter.com/apaNEKNCkh — NFL (@NFL) November 24, 2024 All that was left to force overtime — or a win — was the decision: kick or go for it? The conventional wisdom is that when down one late in the game, you kick for the tie and overtime at home, and you go for the win on the road. Washington was at home, and after three rocky quarters, it had appeared to find some weaknesses in the Dallas defense, scoring on three separate occasions. This year, two-point conversions have been successful at just a 32.4% rate through the first half of this season, well down from the 48.7% from 2010-23, according to an AP study. Plus, coming into the day, Washington kicker Austin Seibert was a perfect 22-of-22 for extra points. Coming into the day. This is more of a gambler’s all-in mentality than an analytics-driven one, but Washington had Dallas on its heels with the touchdown, so why not go for it and try for the surprise win? Catching Dallas unprepared wouldn’t exactly be the most shocking outcome to this game, after all. Plus, Seibert’s season-long perfect extra point streak ended earlier in the day, when he missed a third-quarter attempt wide left. So why not put the ball in the hands of playmaker extraordinaire Jayden Daniels and see what happens? Washington head coach Dan Quinn opted to go for the extra point … and Seibert is now 22 of 24 on extra points. The kick again went wide left. And as if to add insult to injury, Dallas returned Seibert’s attempted onside kick for another touchdown. That made 41 total points scored in the fourth quarter … but it was the one that wasn’t that made all the difference. Washington has now lost three in a row and has dropped to the low side of the playoff bubble. This could be a crucial and costly loss, and one that very easily could have gone the other way. So, would you have kicked the safe extra point or gone for the two-point conversion and the checkmate? What’s your call?"

The Phoenix Suns stars are expected to return from injuries in time for Tuesday's nationally televised NBA Cup game against the Los Angeles Lakers. Head coach Mike Budenholzer said on Sunday that Durant and Beal had a ""good day"" in 5-on-5 practice and that they'd ""hopefully"" be able to play on Tuesday. ESPN's Shams Charania reported Monday that both plan to play in the game that will be televised on TNT. Durant has missed the Suns' last seven games with a calf strain. Beal has missed five consecutive games, also with a calf injury. The Suns are 1-6 since Durant's injury and have lost five straight games with both players absent from the lineup. The Suns got off to an 8-1 start prior to Durant's injury. They've since dropped to 9-7 in eighth place in the Western Conference. Durant, 36, remains one of the game's elite players when healthy. In nine games this season, Durant's averaged 27.6 points, 6.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 1.4 blocks while shooting 55.3% from the field and 42.9% from 3-point distance. Beal, 31, was also playing well prior to his injury. In nine games this season, he's averaged 17.8 points, four rebounds, 3.7 assists and 1.4 steals while shooting 47.5% from the field and 38.3% from 3-point distance. Both are critical to the Suns' hopes of competing in a stacked Western Conference this season. In Tuesday's game, the Suns will look to improve on a 1-1 record in NBA Cup play while the Lakers will seek to keep their perfect 2-0 Cup record intact in defense of their 2023 Cup title."

Still, we can’t afford to take a break from the waiver wire. Each week around here, we highlight the top potential waiver pickups who remain available in at least 50% of Yahoo fantasy football leagues. Add as needed. It’s winning time, people. Recommended FAB offer (assuming $100 budget): $7 Wilson passed for 270 yards and one score in a losing effort in that delightful snow globe game on Thursday night. Ideally, we wouldn’t be seeing quite so many snaps and carries for Justin Fields, but it’s obviously a smart and proper use of a talented player. Fields’ usage is hardly a deal-breaker for Russ. On Sunday, Wilson gets a date with a Bengals defense that allows the fourth-most fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks. Cincinnati has given up 19 passing touchdowns and 225.6 passing yards per game. If you’re simply looking for a streaming option with a reasonably high floor, Wilson is your guy. Cooper Rush was cooking on Sunday, in his way. He tossed a pair of TDs against Washington in an all-time weird win, finishing with 247 yards on his 32 attempts. Rush has now thrown for 601 yards over the past two weeks and he has a series of friendly matchups ahead: NYG, CIN, at CAR, TB. Drake Maye certainly didn’t play his cleanest game in Sunday’s loss (22-for-37, 4 sacks, INT); his team didn’t get on the scoreboard against Miami until the fourth quarter, trailing by 31. However, Maye’s dual-threat ability is well-established, and he’s been a steady-if-unspectacular fantasy contributor. He’s headed into a matchup with Indy, a defense allowing the eighth-most fantasy points to QBs. Derek Carr had produced consecutive games with 200-plus passing yards and multiple touchdowns ahead of his bye, and his team’s schedule down the stretch is full of opportunities (LAR, at NYG, WA). If you’re just looking for a tolerable floor and not a season-saver, he can help. Recommended FAB offer: $26 If circumstances forced you to drop Bigsby at some point over the past two weeks, no judgment. We get it. His team is coming off a bye and he was sidelined by an ankle issue in Week 11. This time of year, availability is a pretty big deal. Let’s just please recall what it looked like earlier this season when Bigsby was fully operational: Tank Bigsby runs so freaking hard. It’s so nice seeing him bounce back this season from such a tough rookie season. Dude has a ton of talent. pic.twitter.com/ndH6l4vIXU — Charles Robinson (@CharlesRobinson) October 6, 2024 Bigsby is averaging 5.5 YPC on the season and an outrageous 4.33 yards after contact per attempt, the best rate in the league. He’s forced 27 missed tackles on just 95 rush attempts per PFF. Basically, he’s been one of the league’s most dangerous and explosive runners this season, and it’s perfectly reasonable to expect a return to fantasy relevance after two weeks of rest. He looked healthy enough this weekend, at least to those of us with no medical training. Travis Etienne Jr. has been far less efficient than Bigsby this season, undeserving of featured status. The primary concern with Tank has been his minimal receiving role. When the Jaguars fall behind by multiple scores (as occasionally happens), Bigsby is returned to storage. But this team will close its season with a string of matchups in which the run should generally remain in play: HOU, at TEN, NYJ, at LV, TEN, at IND. On talent and ceiling, Bigsby deserves a roster spot in all formats. Recommended FAB offer: $8 McNichols has made four house calls this season, so he should be well known to fantasy managers at this stage, though mostly as a nuisance to Brian Robinson Jr. managers. He finished with a modest 22 yards on three carries on Sunday, but he could be headed for a significant uptick in workload in the upcoming matchup with Tennessee. The Commanders just lost both Robinson (ankle) and Austin Ekeler (concussion) to injuries, which could force McNichols into a beefier role in Week 13. It’s hardly a friendly spot — the Titans have only allowed one back to rush for 70 yards this year — so let’s not get too reckless with your remaining FAB unless the situation is dire. Recommended FAB offer: Let’s say $6 apiece We’re grouping these three together because the argument for each of them is essentially the same. It’s a trio of premium backups, all of them proven commodities. Any or all of these three could emerge as decisive players in fantasy if an injury created a path to significant touches. Mason was an unstoppable force over the first seven weeks of the season, Allgeier has a 1,000-yard campaign on the resume already, and Davis had that one magical week against the Jets (along with various other highlights). As we approach the money weeks in fantasy, we want our benches to be loaded with high-upside lottery tickets. All three of these backs certainly qualify. Recommended FAB offer: $4 Yup, he’s still in the league — he’s 31 years old, in his 10th NFL season and surprisingly relevant. Abdullah was the next-man-up for Vegas on Sunday with both Alexander Mattison (ankle) and Zamir White (quad) sidelined by injury, and he was plenty effective against an excellent Denver defense. He finished with 65 total yards on 13 touches with five receptions and an early highlight TD: Ameer Abdullah! What a catch for the @Raiders TD!📺: #DENvsLV on CBS/Paramount+📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/AvxOSvAMMV — NFL (@NFL) November 24, 2024 Abdullah’s fantasy appeal is of course tied to the availability of other backs, but Sunday’s performance offered confirmation that he can help us when reasonable volume flows his way. The matchup ahead is somewhat problematic (at KC), but it’s not as if the Broncos defense was a layup, either. Devin Singletary has clearly been leapfrogged by Tyrone Tracy Jr. in the backfield hierarchy for the Giants, but we should note that the rookie lost another fumble in a key situation on Sunday. Tracy wasn’t shelved after the ball security gaffe against the Bucs, but he did sit for a series, allowing Singletary to reach the end zone. If Tracy remains fumbly, Brian Daboll may feel compelled to do the usual coach-thing and dial back his touches. Roschon Johnson only handled three touches for the Bears in the overtime loss to Minnesota, but he continues to serve as a preferred option in goal-to-go situations. Sunday’s touchdown was his sixth of the year. Tyjae Spears (concussion) was unable to go in Week 12, but we should note that he’s played 35-45% of the offensive snaps when healthy this season. His team’s schedule in the closing weeks is awfully inviting: at WAS, JAC, CIN, at IND. Trey Benson, Blake Corum, Jaylen Wright and Braelon Allen are all highly stashable rookie understudy backs who would step into substantial workloads if the vets ahead of them were to miss time. All four deserve roster spots as what-if fliers in leagues with 12 or more teams. Recommended FAB offer: $8 Here’s another case in which fantasy managers understandably mass-dropped a player due to the fact that A) he was dinged and B) the six-team mega-bye hit. Coleman is nearing a return from his wrist injury, however, which means he is very much back on the fantasy radar. Coleman actually delivered the two best performances of his rookie season after Amari Cooper joined the team via trade, so let’s not fret too much about competition for targets. He’s been effective in contested situations and his passer-rating when targeted is a healthy 117.5. It’s no great surprise that he’s entered Josh Allen’s circle of trust. Buffalo has a series of potential shootouts ahead against the Niners, Rams and Lions, so we should be aggressive in finding ways to invest in this team’s offense. The Bills are averaging 29.1 points per week, the league’s third-highest total. We haven’t seen the last big game from Coleman, assuming good health. Recommended FAB offer: $6 Ertz ran the most routes among all Commanders pass-catchers on Sunday and saw the second-most targets (8), so we certainly aren’t worried about his role. The vet has also reached the end zone in back-to-back weeks. He’s been the most reliable secondary option for the Commanders this season behind Terry McLaurin, averaging nearly six targets per week. If you’ve been wandering the tight end wilderness, he’s a viable option with a bankable weekly role. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. DeMario Douglas produced his usual 5-for-62 line in Sunday’s loss, which was never considered a notable fantasy performance until modern science developed PPR scoring. Today, we’re enlightened enough to appreciate it. Douglas gets the Colts in the week ahead, so yet another 4-6 grabs are incoming. Marquez Valdes-Scantling has touched the ball five times in the last two games for the Saints, converting those opportunities into 196 yards and three scores. You should not need to be told that a zero-point week is definitely within the range of outcomes for MVS, but the man still clearly has big-play potential. Devaughn Vele is a gigantic slot receiver (6-foot-5, 210) who’s emerged as a reliable secondary option for Bo Nix and the Broncos. He’s coming off single-game highs in targets (9) and receiving yards (80). Denver has a home date with Cleveland ahead of their Week 14 bye. Adam Thielen passed the eye test in his return from injury on Sunday, catching three balls for 57 yards, drawing a key flag and generally looking like a useful weapon. Carolina is fielding a functional offense these days, so we no longer need to back away from this team in fantasy. Nick Westbrook-Ikhine has somehow managed to overcome his team’s regrettable quarterback situation, reaching the end zone six times over his last seven games. It’s one of the wildest achievements by any receiver this season, considering the fact that he’s only caught 17 passes on the year. We keep warning you that his scoring streak is unsustainable, yet it simply refuses to obey the normal rules. The Colts don't have a perfect one-for-one replacement for Josh Downs on the roster, but we can expect both Alec Pierce and Adonai Mitchell to see additional opportunities while the team's receptions leader is sidelined by injury. Pierce has been a downfield favorite for Anthony Richardson this season, averaging a league-high 23.3 yards per catch. Noah Gray has scored four touchdowns while catching eight passes over his last two games, which might be enough to make him a top-10 tight end on the season. (I’m afraid to look it up, because I don’t want to see where he ranks relative to Sam LaPorta.) Gray has actually run the fourth-most routes on the team this year, and it’s not like KC’s receiving room is overloaded with playmakers. We likely haven’t seen his last house call. There’s nothing Andy Reid loves half as much as drawing up opportunities for his weirdest players near the end zone. Hunter Henry has drawn 17 targets over the past two weeks, catching 11 for 107 yards. He’s not a scoring machine like Gray, but c’mon, that’s an impossible standard to meet. Recommended FAB offer: $1 No, this is not a great defense in the traditional sense, but the Cowboys delivered a huge point total against the Commanders on Sunday, in one of the more wild/intoxicated games in recent memory. Micah Parsons is back to being a game-wrecker and KaVontae Turpin is the most dangerous return specialist in the league. Dallas will host the spiraling, dysfunctional Giants on Thursday, so this D likely has another productive week ahead."

On Monday, Brian Daboll responded.","A number of high-profile Giants players did not hold back when it came to criticizing the team’s performance in Sunday’s 30-7 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. “We played soft and they beat the s--t out of us today,” Dexter Lawrence said. “Soft as f—k,” Malik Nabers said when asked to describe the loss. Veteran tackle Jermaine Eluemunor said he believed players were not giving 100 percent of their effort. Naturally, head coach Brian Daboll was asked about those comments coming out of the locker room during his media availability on Monday, and he explained that it’s easy to feel frustrated after such a poor showing. “Yeah, look, these guys put a lot of work into this, as does everybody involved,” Daboll said. “It’s certainly not something that we wanted yesterday. We work hard every week to not have that happen, and that was tough. So, there’s frustration that comes with it. Understandable. And we communicate. I think we have good leadership in our locker room. I think we communicate on a daily basis, but certainly a frustrating game, no question about it.” According to Daboll, the game tape proved that execution and play-calling, not effort, were to blame. “I thought our guys played hard when you go back and evaluated the tape,” Daboll said. “There were certain plays that you want back. We talked about some of the missed tackles that happened, offensively some of the negative plays, particularly in the first half. We had 17 plays, and that created some third-and-longs that we didn’t pick up. We didn’t control the time of possession, but the guys played hard, they played with effort. Just didn’t do enough."" “We didn’t play well enough,” he added later. “Some things, whether it’s execution stuff, call stuff, but we just didn’t get the job done. In terms of running to the football, giving effort at the line of scrimmage. Those didn’t stand out. What stood out was three sacks early on in the first half, 0-for-4 on third down, a variety of missed tackles that cause some big plays. And the missed tackles weren’t a lack of effort missed tackles. Give Tampa Bay credit. They did a good job and we didn’t do a good enough job.” Nabers’ comments were perhaps the most alarming, as he not only called the team “soft” but said the problems aren’t quarterback-related, noting the team had similar results when Daniel Jones was starting instead of Tommy DeVito. Nabers also called out the coaching staff for not getting him involved earlier in the game, as the talented first-round pick was not targeted in the first half. Daboll said he would keep the conversations he had with Nabers private, but again pointed to players rightfully feeling frustrated after the 23-point loss. “Yeah, [Nabers] and I talked last night, we talked this morning. He’s a very competitive individual,” Daboll said. “Again, you want to get the ball in his hands, and I’ve got to do a better job of getting the ball in his hands early. He’s a smart, young guy who’s very competitive. And again, when you lose like that, it’s a frustrating thing, but we have good communication, like we’ve always had.” Giants owner John Mara previously gave both Daboll and GM Joe Schoen a vote of confidence, saying both would be back next season. But Daboll was asked on Monday if he thinks he has lost the locker room, which is the No. 1 reason that head coaches are dismissed in today’s NFL. “I feel good about our communication, players with the coaches. Certainly not happy about the results, but I expect a lot from those guys and they should expect a lot from me,” said Daboll. “Again, there’s a good communication process, but when you lose like that, it’s a frustrating thing.”"

That tradition held this year, with Vancouver falling to LAFC in Round 1 after forcing a win-or-go-home Game 3. Sartini also led Vancouver to three straight Canadian Championships, beating the field of professional soccer teams across Canada. The tournament included the three Canadian MLS teams — Vancouver, Toronto FC and CF Montréal. The Whitecaps finished in eighth place this season after a 13-8-13 finish. Vancouver started the postseason well, demolishing the Portland Timbers 5-0 in the wild-card round. The win was especially impressive given that it was in Portland; despite being the higher seed, Vancouver was unable to host due to a stadium conflict, with the team's BC Place set to host a motocross event on that day. After Timbers head coach Phil Neville joked that the good luck meant that ""God is a Timbers fan,"" Sartini responded in kind after the game: ""God can be a Timbers fan but God doesn't exist for me.""

The series announced Monday that General Motors’ bid to add a team to the grid in two seasons had been approved. The FIA had previously approved the GM-backed effort, but F1 and its teams had not signed off. “General Motors and Cadillac’s commitment to this project is an important and positive demonstration of the evolution of our sport,"" F1 president and CEO Stefano Domenicali said in a statement. ""We look forward to seeing the progress and growth of this application, certain of the full collaboration and support of all the parties involved.” The announcement comes after Michael Andretti stepped back from the Andretti Global effort to join F1. With Andretti’s role now minimized and TWG Global CEO Dan Towriss leading the push, negotiations broke through recently as it became clear over the course of the Las Vegas Grand Prix weekend that an 11th team would be joining the grid. According to F1, the GM/Cadillac team will join in 2026 and it will use GM engines “at a later time.” That means the team will need to use engines from an existing engine supplier during its infancy. The GM team will mean two of the 11 teams in F1 will be American-owned starting in 2026, along with Haas F1. F1 now has three races in the United States after adding races in Miami and Las Vegas in recent years after the exploding popularity of the Netflix “Drive to Survive” series. Andretti, a longtime open-wheel racer who had a short stint in F1, had been pushing to field a team for years. However, he’d faced staunch resistance in F1 circles. Andretti’s entry had been approved by the FIA, F1’s governing body, in October of 2023, but was rejected by F1 in January. When that application was denied, F1 said that it didn’t believe the team would be competitive. Andretti had said that he felt like the rejection was part of a grudge against him.  But things changed over the course of 2024 as Towriss took on a bigger role with the push to join the grid and a U.S. Justice Department investigation into the team’s rejection as part of a potential antitrust violation. The fate of that investigation is unclear, though it reasons that it could be dropped now that the bid has been approved. The GM team's entry into F1 will come as the series introduces new car regulations after 2025. Other new manufacturers are joining the series in 2026, like Ford and Audi. Ford will power the Red Bull cars for four-time champion Max Verstappen, while Audi is taking over the Sauber team. Verstappen clinched that fourth straight title over the weekend in Las Vegas as he finished a spot ahead of McLaren's Lando Norris. There are two races to go in the 2024 F1 season as the series visits Qatar and Abu Dhabi over the next two weeks."

Murray, an All-Star in 2022, joined the Pelicans via trade from the Atlanta Hawks in the offseason. He suffered a fractured left hand in his debut with the Pelicans in New Orleans' opening-night win against the Chicago Bulls. He hasn't played since. Murray's is one of several injuries to key players that have derailed the Pelicans' season amid a 4-13 start. Zion Williamson, CJ McCollum, Herbert Jones, Trey Murphy III and Jose Alvarado have also missed extended time with injuries. McCollum is listed as probable and is projected to make his return from a 13-game absence with an adductor injury Monday night against the Indiana Pacers. Williamson, whose career has been plagued by injuries since being selected No. 1 out of Duke in 2019, has missed eight games with a hamstring injury and reportedly isn't close to a return to the court. Jones and Alvarado remain out of the lineup. Murphy played his first game Nov. 11 after recovering from a hamstring injury and has sat out the second night of back-to-backs. While the news of Williamson's lack of progress is disappointing in New Orleans, the projected return of Murray and McCollum to the lineup means that the Pelicans will have their starting backcourt intact for the first time since opening night. Murray, 28, averaged 22.5 points, 6.4 assists and 1.4 steals with the Hawks last season while sharing the backcourt with Trae Young. The Pelicans acquired Murray hoping he'd elevate a talented Pelicans roster that also features 2020 All-Star Brandon Ingram in a stacked Western Conference. The Pelicans have made the playoffs in two of the last three seasons but failed to advance out of the first round. Their 4-13 start instead has them in last place in the West."

The Terror Twins have arrived (Tari Eason and Amen Thompson) If you’ve been wondering why Amen Thompson and Tari Eason have been called the Terror Twins this season, this is why: pic.twitter.com/0eRAivM2Qx — ᵂᴵᴸᴸ (@BiasedHouston) November 23, 2024 Top category player: Jalen Williams Most fantasy points in Week 5: Giannis Antetokounmpo Note: I would add practically every player who is currently 40% to 50% rostered in Yahoo leagues, except for Mike Conley. ▶️ GNX - Kendrick Lamar The Lakers play five games over the next eight days, so check your waiver pool to see if Hachimura landed there after missing four games due to an ankle injury. He returned on Saturday and got fewer minutes than popular waiver wire pickup Dalton Knecht in a blowout loss to the Nuggets. However, Hachimura started and played 33 minutes a night when healthy, so I’d expect him to ease back into that role this week. Hachimura is not a must roster, but given LA’s schedule from Week 6 into Week 7, fantasy managers could use his points, 3s and rebounds. This, of course, assumes Knecht hasn’t passed him on the depth chart. I should’ve been more bullish on McConnell last week, but he continues to be a streamable asset with Andrew Nembhard out and Tyrese Haliburton struggling. McConnell delivers if you’re looking for assists or steals from the guard spot. Over his previous five contests, he’s averaging 12.2 points, 5.6 assists and 2.4 steals per game while shooting 57% from the field. He’s putting in work in just 20 minutes a night. For whatever reason, the Wizards put Bub Carrington on the bench in favor of Brogdon — a nine-year veteran despite being in the midst of a rebuild. Brogdon is a significant injury risk, but when he’s active, he’s also productive. In his last three games, he’s averaging an efficient 13 points, four rebounds and two assists across 24 minutes. This is a short-term play, as Washington is likely auditioning Brogdon (along with Kyle Kuzma) as a potential trade piece. The Wizards play four games, two of which are on lighter slates, so Brogdon has some streaming appeal in Week 6. OK, I might get got because the Hornets’ injury report is mad suspect, but Richards (ribs) was cleared for contact and has been participating in practice. He's already been ruled out for Monday, but one would assume he’s nearing a return to the lineup. Moussa Diabaté (17%) has been a reliable rebounder and shot blocker in Richards’ absence, but he doesn’t match Richards’ offensive output when he is healthy. For those who forgot, Richards averaged over 31 fantasy points per game before hitting the IL. Grant Williams (knee) is out for the season so we could see Richards back in action as soon as this week. If you pick Richards up now, he’ll automatically go into any open IL spot. The Hornets play four games this week, and I’m more confident about Richards suiting up than Mark Williams. The Suns have one of the best schedules in Week 6 after playing just two games in Week 5. O’Neale’s rostership dropped 10% since Sunday, but fantasy managers will want to use him with the Suns playing four games this week, including a Tuesday-Wednesday back-to-back where we likely see one of their stars rest. Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal (calves) are trending up for Tuesday. However, O’Neale will still factor in the rotation. He’s averaging 23 fantasy points per game this season and even though he’s an inefficient shooter, he hits 3s, rebounds well for his position and can generate stocks. He’s a guy I’ve picked up for this week only. No games on Thursday (Thanksgiving) Best streaming days: Tuesday (5 games) and Saturday (5 games) Teams who play on Tuesday and Saturday: Bucks, Jazz, Suns and Wizards Four games: Blazers, Clippers, Grizzlies, Hawks, Heat, Hornets, Jazz, Kings, Knicks, Lakers, Magic, Mavericks, Nets, Pacers, Pelicans, Pistons, Raptors, Thunder Three games: Bulls, Cavaliers, Celtics, Nuggets, Rockets, Spurs, Suns, Timberwolves, Warriors, Wizards Two Games: 76ers, Bucks Notable back-to-backs: The Jazz play Tuesday-Wednesday and Saturday-Sunday The Lakers and Heat play Tuesday-Wednesday and Sunday-Monday (Week 7) Notable Week 4 injuries Pistons G Cade Cunningham (sacroiliac joint sprain) is day-to-day Sixers C Joel Embiid (knee) is day-to-day Pelicans F Zion Williamson (hamstring) out indefinitely Blazers C Donovan Clingan (knee) is day-to-day Hornets F/C Grant Williams (knee) is out for the season Warriors G De’Anthony Melton (knee) is out for the season Latest injury reporting for all NBA teams NBA Injury Report - Monday, November 25 Cleveland Cavaliers: The play: Ty Jerome (20%) has been one of the most efficiently impactful bench players in the league through the first month of the season. His re-emergence is utterly shocking. He has the highest true-shooting percentage in the NBA and is sporting a 21% usage in a reserve role. Week 6 isn’t great scheduling-wise because the Cavs are off until Wednesday and play on bigger slates the entire week (Wed/Fri/Sun). However, if you can afford to pick him up, do it because he’s in the zone. Detroit Pistons: The play: Add Isaiah Stewart (21%) if you need a big man who can rebound and block shots efficiently. He’s been the Pistons’ best defensive player and he’s in a timeshare with Jalen Duren. Also, stash Ausar Thompson (46%). He logged a DNP-CD on Saturday but he'll get minutes in short order. He’s a menace defensively and his refined jump shot should help him stay on the floor once he gets back into the rotation. Los Angeles Clippers: The play: Clippers’ leading scorer Norman Powell (hamstring) is traveling with the team on their five-game road trip and while he didn’t suit up on Sunday, there’s a chance he could play at some point in Week 6. Until that occurs, Derrick Jones Jr. (12%) is worth streaming. Over his last four games with Powell out, DJJ averaged 12.5 points, four boards and 1.8 steals with 56/37/92 shooting splits. Portland Trail Blazers: The play: Donovan Clingan (knee) is out and Deandre Ayton (finger) is unlikely to play on Monday, which means that Robert Williams III (27%) is in for a (potentially) big game with no competition for center minutes. Williams rested on Sunday, so he looks like a great streaming option in points or 9-cat leagues. Sacramento Kings: The play: The Kings aren’t getting consistent play from Kevin Huerter or Keon Ellis, so if Malik Monk (29%) is available, now might be the time to scoop him up. His injury designation changed a couple of times on Sunday, but he’s getting closer to returning, and it wouldn’t surprise me to see him back in Week 6. He’s a bucket and will be a much-needed offense spark for the Kings and fantasy managers. Utah Jazz: The play: I love the Jazz schedule this week. The problem is that your streaming options aren’t ideal. Check to see if anyone panic-dropped Keyonte George and if not, Johnny Juzang and Jordan Clarkson are streamable guys because they play on all of the lighter slate days in Week 6."

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",The NBA’s premier pickpocket: Inside Dyson Daniels' ridiculous stats as the Hawks' stopper,https://sports.yahoo.com/the-nbas-premier-pickpocket-inside-dyson-daniels-ridiculous-stats-as-the-hawks-stopper-170959530.html,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 17:09:59 GMT",The Atlanta guard is producing one of the more disruptive individual defensive seasons in recent memory.,"The first time Dyson Daniels suited up for the Atlanta Hawks, it was a preseason game against the Indiana Pacers. The 21-year-old acquitted himself well, scoring 14 points on 5-for-8 shooting with three assists in 21 minutes and showing signs that his size, length and activity might make him an ideal complement for Trae Young — a transcendent playmaker with the ball in his hands but a frequent target on the other end of the floor. “We have a plan defensively as a team, what we want to take away,” Daniels told reporters after the preseason affair. “And every team’s different. [The Pacers] have so many good individual players, and a guy like [Pascal] Siakam, you want to take away his right hand. A guy like [Tyrese] Haliburton, you want to take away his step back.” The game-plan chatter and know-your-personnel specifics, though, only served to elide and obscure the secret truth pounding inside the Aussie’s heart: What Dyson Daniels wants to take away most, from every offensive player, is the ball. And if we’ve learned anything in the opening month of the 2024-25 NBA season, it’s this: He’s really, really good at doing it. If you’re one of the masochistic sickos who kept tabs on the chaos-racked Pelicans over the past few seasons — [waves at you warmly] — you already knew that the 6-foot-8 Daniels could sit down and guard. Chosen eighth overall in the 2022 NBA Draft out of the now-defunct G League Ignite incubator program, Daniels showed impressive flashes of havoc-wreaking in New Orleans, ranking near the top of the NBA in steals and deflections per minute last season. But with Herb Jones firmly ensconced as the top stopper in the starting lineup, with Brandon Ingram, CJ McCollum and Trey Murphy III all in line for starters’ minutes on the perimeter, and with the Pelicans looking to add another ball-handler and shot creator to one of the NBA’s worst crunch-time offenses, New Orleans shipped Daniels — along with veteran big men Larry Nance Jr. and Cody Zeller, and two future first-round picks — to Atlanta for Dejounte Murray. The Pels have yet to reap the hoped-for benefits of the deal; Murray hasn’t played since breaking his left hand on opening night. Atlanta, however, has seen the jewel of its return pay immediate dividends. Daniels has quickly cemented himself not only as a starter alongside Young in the backcourt for Quin Snyder’s revamped club, but as the NBA’s premier pickpocket: “The Great Barrier Thief” enters the Hawks’ Monday matchup with the Dallas Mavericks leading the NBA in steals and deflections. By, like, a lot. Daniels is averaging 3.2 steals per game, a full steal ahead of Oklahoma City’s Jalen Williams and Houston’s Tari Eason, putting him on pace to be just the eighth player since the NBA started tracking steals in 1973-74 to average three thefts a game — and the first to do it in 31 years. Daniels has logged an obscene 102 deflections in 15 games, which not only leads the league; it’s 37 more than the player in second place, De’Aaron Fox, who has played 138 more minutes than Daniels. The gap between first-place Daniels and second-place Fox is the same as the gap between Fox and 76ers forward Caleb Martin … in 99th. Daniels has secured a steal on 4.4% of opponents’ possessions and has blocked a shot on 2.7% of their offensive trips. According to Stathead, only three players had ever posted a steal rate above 4% and a block rate above 2% before this season: Scottie Pippen and Nate McMillan in 1994-95, and Tony Allen in 2010-11. (Daniels is one of three players doing it so far this season, alongside Eason and Thunder chaos agent Alex Caruso.) Watch Daniels defend, and it’s striking how he manages to be seemingly everywhere — he’s sixth among rotation players in distance covered on defense and 15th in average speed moving on defense, according to Second Spectrum — without sacrificing soundness in service of the splash play. He sticks to Job No. 1 for any defender, keeping the ball in front by using his quick feet to mirror his mark’s movements, and uses the core strength in that 6-foot-8 frame to absorb bumps from attackers while still maintaining his balance. He keeps himself in position to cut off their drives, contest their shots … and, if they expose the ball for even a blink of an eye, relieve them of the burden of handling it. PSYCHO BANDIT 🇦🇺 pic.twitter.com/iQmUy9ktEb — Atlanta Hawks (@ATLHawks) November 19, 2024 It rarely feels like he’s freelancing his way out of position, and yet, whenever the ball’s in play, he just apparates. Inbounds passes aren’t safe. Entry passes to the post and elbow aren’t safe. Skips to the corner aren’t safe. Crossovers aren’t safe, no matter how tight your handle is. Power dribbles in the paint aren’t safe, no matter how strong your hands are. Turning your back to him as you try to mouse-in-the-house his teammate on the block? Definitely not safe. Even dribble handoffs aren’t safe. Daniels will blow those up, staying connected to the ball-handler as he curls around the screen and forcing his way to the ball, like a blitzing linebacker knifing into the backfield. (He even talks about it like a football player: ""For me, you know, it's 'See ball, get ball.'”) And if you think you’ve blocked it up, been able to bump him off the play, turn the corner and get downhill to the basket? Think again: Daniels, still in pursuit like a heat-seeking horror movie villain, will close the game with his 6-foot-10.5-inch wingspan and poke the ball out from behind. Daniels is producing one of the more disruptive individual defensive seasons in recent memory, ranking in the 99th percentile in perimeter isolation defense, passing lane defense and defensive playmaking, according to The BBall Index’s game charting. And he’s doing it without having the luxury of taking less-threatening offensive assignments so that he can muck things up by playing free safety: Lining up next to Young, Daniels routinely guards the most dangerous threat an opponent has to offer — Jayson Tatum, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Stephen Curry, Jalen Brunson, De’Aaron Fox, Zach LaVine, et al. — and, as a result, has posted the highest average matchup difficulty in the NBA thus far, per The BBall Index. That marriage of degree of difficulty and possession-breaking production has sent Daniels’ stock skyrocketing in the Defensive Player of the Year race. It’s unlikely he’ll stick there, considering Atlanta ranks an underwhelming 20th in defensive efficiency overall, the award has long been dominated by centers, and Victor Wembanyama exists. (Seriously: Opponents are shooting 38.1% when Wemby’s the nearest defender. Ludicrous.) Even so: It’d be an honor just to be nominated — and something of an exciting rarity for a franchise that hasn’t landed a player on an All-Defensive team since Paul Millsap in 2016. There’s still plenty to figure out for Snyder and Co. on a Hawks team that enters Monday’s action at 7-10, comfortably enmeshed in their established home within the play-in tournament spots. Daniels, too, still has a long way to go — especially on the offensive end, where he’s shooting just 36% on jumpers for the season and has missed two-thirds of his total attempts over his last four games, with an assist-to-turnover ratio barely above 1-to-1. But while he remains a work in progress on the offensive end, and while his individual play hasn’t resulted in extinguish-every-star-you-encounter performances, he’s making an impact in the area where the Hawks have long needed it most: They allow nearly five fewer points-per-100 with Daniels on the floor than when he’s off it. Through the first month of the season, the difference between Atlanta defending at its customary bottom-five level and getting stops at a roughly league-average clip — a rate the Hawks haven’t managed since its surprise 2021 Eastern Conference finals run — has been the 21-year-old prowling the perimeter, making the theme from “Jaws” run through ball-handlers’ heads. Daniels began his tenure in Atlanta by emphasizing the importance of knowing your personnel; now, he’s become the kind of point-of-attack menace that offenses have to know, lest he wreck their entire game plan, one poke, swipe or swat at a time."
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games","Asked & Answered, Week 12: Has Bryce Young arrived?",https://sports.yahoo.com/asked--answered-week-12-has-bryce-young-arrived-160946598.html,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 16:09:46 GMT","Plus, it' official: Baker Mayfield is the coolest QB in the NFL.","Every week in the NFL season brings a host of new questions … and answers some old ones, too. Let’s run down what we learned in Week 12 … and what we’ll be wondering about in Week 13 and beyond. The NFL is a snap-judgment league, one where it’s easy to form impressions and hard to break them once formed. So it’ll take an awful lot of good play for Bryce Young to break the initial “bust” impression that formed around his career. Fortunately for Young, he’s quietly putting together some really, really strong performances. Sure, Carolina is still losing, but Young is finally starting to look comfortable in the job. This, for instance, might be his best throw as a pro: Dropped it in the bucket📺: CBS pic.twitter.com/jOPlgDYYpt — Carolina Panthers (@Panthers) November 24, 2024 And Sunday’s game — 263 yards, one touchdown — might be his most complete game as a pro, an accurate pocket-passing game that leans into his skills and size. Granted, that’s damning with pretty faint praise, but given that Young’s career was put out on the curb with the week’s trash earlier this season, it’s a pretty strong bounce-back. And against the two-time defending Super Bowl champions, no less. Carolina isn’t making the playoffs, but the Panthers might have just salvaged their dignity for this season, thanks to Young emerging as the player that Carolina prayed he was way back when. Analytics have reinvigorated the NFL game, giving us an infinite number of ways to assess and predict how any given player, team or coach will react in any given situation. They’re an essential weapon to craft a championship team. But analytics cannot possibly account for something like this: The Bucs fumbled and Baker Mayfield was the only one on the field who saw the rolling football 😅 pic.twitter.com/IEpFPc3ZUD — NFL on CBS 🏈 (@NFLonCBS) November 24, 2024 Or this, a quarterback making a block 40 yards down field: Watch Baker on the lead block 😭😭😭How can you not love Baker Mayfield?!📺: #TBvsNYG on CBS/Paramount+📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/wuCgzLl5kn — NFL (@NFL) November 24, 2024 Baker Mayfield throws himself into every play like he’s flinging himself off the back of Jet Ski. He’s a big reason why the Buccaneers remain on the edge of playoff contention despite catastrophic injury to key receivers. In an era where quarterbacks are becoming downright golf-like with their impassive, make-no-waves demeanor, Mayfield is a loud, brash throwback, the kind of quarterback who would be smoking a cigarette on the sidelines 50 years ago. We need more like him, and we’re getting a whole lot fewer. In retrospect, there’s no more infamous moment in the history of the “Hard Knocks” franchise than last season, when Giants owner John Mara expressed his trepidation at the idea of letting Saquon Barkley go to the Eagles. That’s Greek tragedy-level foreshadowing right there. Barkley has been absolutely spectacular this entire season; he dropped 302 yards of total offense and two touchdowns on the Rams’ heads Sunday night on national TV. At the same time, the Giants are an exercise in absolute front-office-driven futility, flailing with a poorly constructed roster and an indifferent lineup that even players are calling “soft.” The Barkley decision has blown up so badly that it’s not unreasonable to think that no NFL front office is going to ever want cameras inside the building again, just to guard against getting their pants yanked down in public like this. The NFC West is football’s most competitive division, the NFC North its toughest. But pound for pound, you can’t beat the NFC East for sheer entertainment value. (Please note that “entertaining football” does not necessarily equal “good football.”) Just think about what we’ve seen this year: an emerging star throwing a generational Hail Mary (Washington), a washed star rediscovering his game and inspiring his team (Philly), a total catastrophe lit by streaming sunlight (Dallas) and a train wreck right into a dumpster fire (New York). You’ve got two of the most ridiculous plays of the season coming out of this division: Jayden Daniels’ Hail Mary against Chicago a few weeks back, and Sunday’s KaVontae Turpin absurdity, a fumbled kick, an unnecessary spin and a house call: KaVontae Turpin goes 99 yards for the TD 🔥📺: #DALvsWAS on FOX📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/IiHNVZAnt5 — NFL (@NFL) November 24, 2024 This division is probably only going to put one team in the playoffs after all, but what a ridiculous ride it’s been so far. The Texans are, allegedly, the best team in the AFC South. The Texans, on Sunday, lost to the Titans, one of the worst teams in football, despite sacking Tennessee eight times and generally making life hell for Will Levis. How is this possible? Because the Texans, despite their gaudy-ish 7-5 record, have fattened up on a whole lot of bad teams and aren’t quite displaying the same trajectory that was expected of them after last season’s C.J. Stroud breakout. Between the underwhelming Texans, the embarrassing Titans and Jaguars, and the scattershot Colts, this is a division that doesn’t quite seem to know how to play four quarters of consistent football anywhere, at any point in the season. If this were the Premier League, we’d be relegating the lot of them to the Big Ten. But since we don’t do that sort of thing in America, we’ll schedule them for their usual Wild Card Weekend Saturday afternoon playoff slot. Any time you discuss the Miami Dolphins, you have to put the very real questions about Tua Tagovailoa’s future health off to the side, because if you start questioning whether he should be in the lineup, you need to start asking those questions about literally every player on the field. Here’s the truth, though: The Dolphins are a markedly better team with Tagovailoa behind center. Since his return from a four-week concussion-induced layoff, Tagovailoa has the Dolphins averaging better than 30 points a game. His accuracy and his ability to read the field are exceptional, and his short-yardage decisionmaking is crucial: Achane has another TD!📺: #NEvsMIA on CBS/Paramount+📱: https://t.co/waVpO909ge pic.twitter.com/H6ASnKUABz — NFL (@NFL) November 24, 2024 Tagovailoa doesn’t have the strongest arm in the league, but he might have the best touch, and so Mike McDaniel has used that skillset to design a short-ball offense that plays to Tagovailoa’s strengths. Miami’s 34-15 win over New England isn’t exactly a milestone victory given the state of the Patriots these days, but Tagovailoa’s numbers — four touchdowns, 317 yards passing — are an indicator of this team’s potential. The whole country will get a look at Tagovailoa on Thanksgiving against the Packers, and if Miami is able to escape with a win, the 5-6 Dolphins will be right back in the heart of the playoff mix in the AFC. McDaniel’s plan for the Dolphins offense is coming together, even if it took a little longer than expected to bring it to fruition."

Despite some of the gaudy efficiency numbers Los Angeles boasts when it has all its star skill-position players on the field together, there appeared to be some leaks in the warship. On paper, some of those cracks were problematic against a team featuring the Eagles' defensive personnel. The on-paper mismatches don’t always turn into on-field results. Unfortunately for the Rams, this one against a stifling Eagles defense played out precisely as the nightmare scenario forecasted. That stats may not perfectly show it, but the pressure brought on by the Eagles defense was an issue all night. Philadephia only blitzed on 11.9% of Stafford’s dropbacks and still forced him to consistently adjust in the pocket. Pressure has been the Achilles heel for this Rams' passing game, as Stafford has been one of the lowest-rated passers under pressure this season. When it mattered most, that reared its head in a big way. Stafford wasn’t “bad” in this game but he ended the night with five sacks and 4.8 yards per pass attempt. Entire drives cratered under waves of heat, as the Rams went 0-for-8 on third downs against the Eagles. The Rams offense is typically a threatening unit over the course of an entire game. For massive sections of this contest, if Stafford wasn’t making a hero throw or Puka Nacua didn’t make a freaky play, this offense would be stuck in the mud when the game was even remotely close. Stafford and the Rams offense will ultimately be fine. You won’t find another defense on the remaining schedule that can remotely dismantle a team like Philadelphia's. However, this pressure issue is a matchup note to consider every week and will be what limits the team's ceiling. For the Eagles, their stop unit is certified as for-real as it gets. A defense like this, paired with an obnoxiously special running game and a passing game with an elite wide receiver, is the recipe for a Super Bowl run. Early in the season, there were doubts about whether Philadelphia could be that type of squad. It isn't the same group as the September Eagles. The arrival of the defense as a top-of-the-league unit changed everything. This is a new team; a complete battleship that can sink any other craft in the sea. When Bucky Irving has the ball in his hands, I have to check myself not to get too crazy with my enthusiasm for his future. He’s an exhilarating runner — the type of player who makes you want to assign some irresponsible praise and comparisons. Irving is a smooth mover who is a handful for opponents to bring down in space. He knifes through open holes in the blocking scheme and then really gets cooking. Once he’s on the second level, the first defender rarely brings Irving down. He’s one of the most impressive pure runners league-wide in 2024. He gained 98 yards after contact against the Giants, per Next Gen Stats. The Bucs were coming off their bye this week and it’s always critical to note any personnel changes in those moments. It could be a fluke, but Irving saw a significant bump in his passing-game usage in Week 12. Liam Coen used the running backs in the passing game a ton during the absence of Chris Godwin and Mike Evans. With the latter back in action, some of the backs ceded receiving work, but not Irving. The rookie back ran more routes than Rachaad White and earned six targets, tied with Evans for second on the team behind Sterling Shepard. White has been such a quality receiver; it would be a stunner if he’s phased out. However, Irving has proven to be so electric that this team should try to get the ball in his hands by any means necessary. The 2023 Bucs offense featured one of the worst running games in the NFL. They’re a top-10 rushing team based on EPA and success rate this season. That isn’t all due to Bucky Irving, but his vision and explosiveness played a big role in that leap. The rookie has been a true revelation this year. If you can rush and rattle C.J. Stroud, you can beat the Texans. The Titans are not a great or complete football team, but their defensive line is a fantastic unit, especially on the interior. They were not an ideal matchup for Houston. It’s gone under-discussed because of their record and the focus on the struggles of the offense amid Will Levis’ wild, turnover-filled season, but this Titans defense is good. The fact that they beat the best team in their division on a day when Levis — who admittedly threw some haymakers on Sunday — took eight sacks, tossed a pick-six and lost a fumble, is a testament to that side of the football. The Titans pressured Stroud on a whopping 40% of his dropbacks, per Next Gen Stats. He averaged 4.1 yards per attempt on 11 passes and threw one of his two picks. It’s the same story every week. Not only did Jeffery Simmons and T'Vondre Sweat get in Stroud’s face all afternoon, they dominated the line of scrimmage against the run. Joe Mixon averaged a measly 1.8 yards per carry and was frustrated early on in the game. Much of the discussion coming out of this game will center around more rounds of “What’s wrong with the Texans?” Enough already; the Texans are what they have been for months now. We should be talking about the painfully underrated Titans defense in the wake of their big Week 12 upset. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. At one point this season, Josh Jacobs made his way into The People’s Panic meter segment on The Yahoo Fantasy Forecast. The production hadn’t been there on a weekly basis. Certain sections of the fantasy football community even called him washed during his Week 1 debut with Green Bay. What a bunch of certified non-ball-knowers. Tell me you aren’t watching the games without telling me you aren’t watching the games. Perhaps it’s better expressed by saying you simply don’t know what you’re watching. What a shame for those folks, because they’ve missed a really enjoyable product all season. The Packers running game has been great all season and Jacobs, in particular, has played great football. At times this year, the fantasy stats just didn’t live up to the tape, as Jacobs didn’t clear 16 points until Week 7. Sometimes solving that divide requires a deep dive to uncover the reasoning behind it. This is not one of those moments. Jacobs only found the end zone once between Weeks 1 to 7, as the Packers offense lived in several different identities due to Jordan Love’s health and Jacobs himself had a run of bad luck. The universe is now in the middle of healing. Jacobs has found the end-zone a whopping seven times in their last five games, including three scores against the 49ers on Sunday. Now, he looks like one of the best backs in fantasy football. Funny how that works. The fun could only now just be getting started for Jacobs, if the last two weeks are any indication. Since coming back from their bye, the Packers have leaned heavily into the run game and particularly the type of gap-scheme runs that Jacobs thrives under. For all the fun players in the Green Bay passing game, Matt LaFleur has built the game plans around what makes Jacobs tick the last two weeks. My guess as to why the Packers let go of the beloved and still effective Aaron Jones to sign Jacobs in the offseason was the latter’s ability to thrive in multiple and varied run schemes. We’ve seen that come to play in the last month, and LaFleur isn’t about to let up on the run-game hammer. We might look back at DK Metcalf’s injury this season as the moment everything changed for Jaxon Smith-Njigba. At times, it takes a bit of chaos to shake up a coaching staff and force them to reimagine usage. What JSN showed Mike MacDonald and Ryan Grubb during those couple of games seems to have opened the door to new heights for the 2023 first-rounder. Smith-Njigba once again led the team in target share with 25% against the Cardinals. He only averaged 1.9 air yards per target but that’s not the important result. What matters much more than the air yards is how those looks were designed. JSN was targeted as the primary read on quick-hitting passes on the back of routes where other wide receivers helped clear out space. That’s the type of purposeful usage that signals the new prestige this wideout holds in the minds of this coaching staff. JSN repaid the coaches’ faith in those designed plays. The talented receiver averaged 11 yards after the catch per reception and 67% of his catches have resulted in a first down or touchdown. Geno Smith completed 20 of 24 passes under 10 air yards in Week 12, per Next Gen Stats, for 207 yards. This was a great way to attack a Cardinals defense that pressured Seattle with some success and plays some funky coverage looks on the back end. But that plan doesn’t succeed without Smith-Njigba. Smith is a great starting quarterback but his aggression can get the best of him when he’s exclusively hunting big plays. Having these designed layups in place helps settle Smith, and JSN being so excellent with the ball in his hands incentivizes the quarterback to take those throws. Despite some advanced stats painting a pretty negative play on JSN's rookie year and the start of 2024, film showed he was fine as a rookie and fine early this season. Well, since Seattle has removed some of the artificial limitations on his deployment, he's been much more than fine the last few weeks. Right now, he looks like the Seahawks’ most important skill-position option on offense and an answer to much of what ails other players on the unit. The only reason I don’t care about these debates is that almost no one participating in the exercise is going to bring anything new to the table. Most people who don’t think Saqoun Barkley is one of the most valuable players to his individual team have dug their heels in and are ready to cling to long-held dogma. However, discussing the impact of Barkley on this Eagles team and the value he provides is endlessly fascinating. The Eagles cultivate such a great rushing ecosystem for any running back to work. We’ve seen multiple different backs have career-best years in Philly alongside Jalen Hurts and behind this offensive line the last three seasons. Even backup Kenneth Gainwell had some productive touches on Sunday Night Football. The current-era Eagles have never employed a running back like Saquon Barkley, who can take over a game and launch this ecosystem into the stratosphere. There are so many plays where a typical running back would go down for a short gain that Barkley turns into an explosive. He makes the team right when the scheme is wrong. I just don’t know how we’re still having the same conversations about running back value when we’ve seen an elite back like this weaponize an already great rushing attack. He’s not even the only one doing it; look at 2022-2023 Christian McCaffrey in San Francisco and Derrick Henry in Baltimore. Week 12 was the first time Barkley cleared 200 yards from scrimmage since his second year in the NFL (2019). He smashed that number and cleared 300 yards. His 44.2 half-PPR fantasy points are the most by a running back this season thus far. Would he have this statistical success level back in New York or a similarly poor environment? Of course not. But can we please stop acting like this is exclusively a running back reality? Former draft busts at quarterbacks resurrect their careers when they get paired with sharp play-callers and quality skill-position players. Wide receivers suffer in the box score on bad offense with subpar passers. Running back statistics are not unique in this regard. Saquon Barkley MVP debates are probably worthless for several reasons, not to mention that non-December discussions about the award don’t actually matter. However, there is no denying his arrival in Philly will go down as one of the most impactful developments of the 2024 NFL season. Elite running backs like him still have the cache to lift the ceiling of their offenses. As a football collective, we are slow to let go of our priors. That’s not always a bad thing. The NFL is such a small sample-size game that a couple of outlier performances can cause massive overreactions to variables that might be nothing but noise. Other times, it causes us to be far too late to believe the new reality the games are begging us to accept. We are so well beyond that moment for the San Francisco 49ers, who at no point have looked like the team we expected them to be this season. The Week 12 version of the 49ers was nothing short of a zombie team. When the 49ers suffered multiple injuries in the offseason, had their first-round pick get shot in August and had to navigate multiple contract holdouts deep into training camp with two of their superstar players, it just felt like this wasn’t going to be their year. Well, it is absolutely not their year. They don’t have enough good players on offense and the defense isn’t the type of unit to carry a squad. Throw the names out, and just look at the current play. Nothing we’ve seen from Deebo Samuel Sr. or Christian McCaffrey when they’ve been available looks like their peak versions. The wide receiver room is being led by a good, useful player in Jauan Jennings but he doesn’t create big plays on his own. I don’t care what any per-route stat tells you; he doesn’t come close to providing the same elite play Brandon Aiyuk brought to the X-receiver position last season. The 2024 San Francisco 49ers have been living on the edge all year. There’s nothing like a quarterback injury to give you that final push across the cliff. The moment Brock Purdy was ruled out Friday evening, it was over for this team. Given how Kyle Shanahan and co. handled certain injuries this year, I don’t believe a word of hope coming out of that building that Purdy’s shoulder injury is not a multi-week issue. Perhaps the theoretical version of the 49ers could survive a few games with Brandon Allen under center. It’s past time we accept that interpretation of this team died before the season even kicked off. Week 12 gave us all the proof we needed. The Panthers lost to the defending champs on a closing-seconds field goal after a two-minute drill that featured a back-breaking Patrick Mahomes scramble. What do you want from them? Add Carolina to a long list of qualifying teams for that honor. Beyond the loss, there are many positive takeaways from Carolina’s performance off their bye week. No development is more critical than Bryce Young’s play, which I thought was excellent against Kansas City. The two biggest issues that haunted Young as a rookie: plays were dead if he faced additional pressure, and he never threatened defenses down the field. His 2023 teammates didn’t help him in either area but Young’s own play wasn’t good enough. He reversed course on both issues in Week 12. The Chiefs blitzed Young on 40% of his dropbacks, per Next Gen Stats, showing little respect for the Panthers' passing game. He made them pay. Young completed 11 of 14 attempts against the blitz and averaged a beefy 9.6 yards per attempt. He never wilted in the face of the Chiefs rush and was quick to diagnose coverages. Young was also more aggressive pushing the ball downfield than we’re used to seeing from the Panthers passer. He averaged 8.1 air yards per attempt and posted a career-high completion percentage over expected of +14.0% on throws of 10-plus air yards, per Next Gen Stats. Young attacked all three areas of the field with confidence. dave canales called a hell of a game todayand bryce young hit every blade of grass pic.twitter.com/pVC8qh0LLa — Josh Norris (@JoshNorris) November 24, 2024 This Week 12 output from Young is not a fluke. He’s quietly played solid football since returning from his stint on the bench and,' most importantly, you can map game-by-game improvement each week. It feels like Young has a strong command and understanding of Dave Canales’ offense. The Panthers' run game is fantastic behind an underrated offensive line and the pass-catchers are significantly better than the league-worst 2023 crew. Young finally has the type of environment around him to succeed and his own play is growing every week. We’ll see if he ever plays up to a first-overall-quarterback ceiling but he looks to have established himself as a starter in the league. When the Cowboys-Commanders game was 10-9 midway through the fourth quarter, the Kliff Kingsbury slump and Jayden Daniels fantasy-panic headlines were ready to write themselves. This game broke open in an extremely strange fashion from that point on to end in a 34-26 final score. Perhaps that sequence will quiet the criticism of Kingsbury. However, if that does become the talking point, I think that’s misplaced and just a convenient narrative based on Kingsbury’s history in Arizona. Over the previous two weeks, I didn’t see anything conceptually or play-sequencing-related that would lead me to raise an eyebrow at the offensive coordinator. This is still a unit that’s trying to push the right buttons; they just ran into two of the best defenses in the NFL in the Steelers and Eagles. Also, those two have just the right type of schemes to limit a scrambling quarterback like Daniels, who might not even be 100% healthy. While it was tempting to write this in as an obvious bounce-back spot, given that Dallas lives at the other end of the defensive rankings, it wasn’t quite that simple. While the Cowboys defense has been porous for most of the year, their pass rush has improved in recent weeks with Micah Parsons back in the mix. No. 11 is that kind of unit-defining game-wrecker. His presence proved to be a difference in this matchup. Daniels was a disaster when under pressure in Week 12, taking four sacks, completing just one of his nine pass attempts and throwing both of his interceptions. He was excellent when he was kept clean, mostly in the fourth quarter. As we’re discussing the Commanders’ recent slide, we need to remember not only Daniels’ rib injury from about a month ago but also the talent level of this offense. This was rightly panned as a roster that could lead to the first overall pick in 2025. The team is, and their leading power players are, much better than advertised but there are still significant holes. The offensive line has played above expectations and the scheme has helped elevate some spots but the tackles can still be overwhelmed in tough matchups. Throw out production. Outside of Terry McLaurin, no other wide receiver or tight end truly scares opposing defenses. Kingsbury and Daniels are still working around a hampered offense. We’ll continue to monitor this Washington offense which has outkicked expectations, no matter what happens during the rest of the season. Kingsbury is a popular punching bag, but I don’t think he will be a problem for this team down the stretch. I’m sure readers and listeners will demand much discussion over Justin Jefferson this week, but I’m not going to be able to muster much concern on the subject. Despite scoring as the WR3 this year, it has been a slightly slower fantasy campaign than the overall numbers would suggest. Jefferson’s been a steady-eddy type of producer more than a week-winner, and he has only scored one touchdown since we flipped the calendar to October. Week 12 was the bottoming-out moment with just two catches for 27 yards. There are a few reasons I don’t care too much about it. For starters, the Bears have been more vulnerable to secondary pass-catchers than primaries. So, while we never expect Jefferson to turn in a stat line like this, it’s not totally out of nowhere. The fact that guys like Jordan Addison and T.J. Hockenson dominated this game is important signal. Too often this season, there’s been a missing second pitch in Minnesota’s passing attack. Addison hasn’t popped up for many productive games and Hockenson hasn’t been available. Addison’s 162-yard outing in Week 12 marks the first time he’s cleared 80 yards in a game. Hockenson’s 84% route participation is the highest since he returned from his ACL recovery. Even Aaron Jones had his best rushing output in months. Having other threats look dangerous in this offense is a good thing for the entire unit and can help Jefferson get lighter matchups in the future. It was clear just from the broadcast angle that the Bears were dedicating extra attention to Jefferson, which isn’t unusual. I’d venture to guess that when Josh Oliver was the starting tight end and Addison was consistently quiet, teams were even more ready to double Jefferson. They weren’t scared of other pass-catchers. Perhaps they now think twice about selling out to solely stop Jefferson."

He retired after the 1979 season.,"Rico Carty, who won the 1970 NL batting title when he hit a major league-best .366 for the Atlanta Braves, has died. He was 85. Major League Baseball, the players’ association and the Braves paid tribute to Carty on social media on Sunday. A family friend told Listín Diario, a newspaper in Carty’s native Dominican Republic, that he died in an Atlanta hospital. “Carty was one of the first groundbreaking Latino stars in the major leagues, and he established himself as a hero to millions in his native Dominican Republic, his hometown of San Pedro de Macoris, and the city of Atlanta, where he was a beloved fan favorite,” the players' association said in its statement. The Braves said Carty left an indelible mark on the organization. “While his on-field accomplishments will never be forgotten, his unforgettable smile and generous nature will be sorely missed,” the team said in its statement. Carty made his big league debut with the Braves in September 1963. He batted .330 with 22 homers and 88 RBIs in his first full season in 1964, finishing second to Dick Allen in voting for NL Rookie of the Year. The Braves moved from Milwaukee to Atlanta after the 1965 season, and Carty got the franchise's first hit in its new home on April 12, 1966, against Pittsburgh. Carty had his best year in 1970, batting .366 with 25 homers and a career-best 101 RBIs. He started the All-Star Game after he was elected as a write-in candidate, joining Willie Mays and Hank Aaron in the NL outfield. Carty batted .299 with 204 homers and 890 RBIs over 15 years in the majors, also playing for Cleveland, Toronto, Oakland, Texas and the Chicago Cubs. He retired after the 1979 season."

Jacobs was credited with a season-high 14 missed tackles through three quarters, and his fantasy day would’ve been even bigger if not for resting the final 11 minutes of the blowout. Jacobs benefitted from game script and Brandon Allen starting for a depleted 49ers’ team missing Brock Purdy, Trent Williams, Nick Bosa, Charvarius Ward and others. Regardless, Jacobs was a beast while becoming the first GB RB since 1999 to run for 100+ yards and score three touchdowns in Lambeau Field. Jacobs easily finished as fantasy’s RB2 this week. Jordan Love threw a second TD in garbage time late, but volume remained low for consecutive weeks. Love has averaged just 20.0 passes over the last two games, hurting the fantasy values of all Green Bay pass-catchers. The Packers had by far the league’s lowest neutral pass rate over the previous month before Sunday’s run-heavy game, so volume could remain an issue on a team with numerous targets. Christian McCaffrey managed just 31 rushing yards and lost a fumble, as San Francisco couldn’t run outside while missing its star left tackle. CMC is getting just 3.5 YPC over three games since returning, as we’ve yet to see last year’s version. Allen, who was playing with a splint on a broken finger on his non-throwing hand, was a huge downgrade. It’s odd Joshua Dobbs didn’t start over a compromised Allen, but neither option is appealing. The 49ers entered with a disappointing record but were second in the league in yards per play (6.4) and yards per game (398.9), but they need a healthy Purdy to return to help fantasy managers down the stretch. • The 49ers were underdogs for the first time in 37 games, and their 10 missed tackles in the first quarter were the most in the NFL this season. • Christian Watson dropped a sure 49-yard touchdown late in the first half. • Saquon Barkley erupted for a career-high 255 rushing yards — the ninth most in NFL history. He had a season-high 52 yards after contact at halftime, and he opened the second half with a 70-yard score. Barkley would add yet another 72-yard TD run in the fourth quarter, and his 302 yards from scrimmage were the most in Eagles’ franchise history. This will mark the sixth week this season Barkley has finished as the RB2 or better, and he should be the clear favorite to win Offensive Player of the Year. His 44.2 half-PPR fantasy points are the most by an RB this season so far. WOW SAQUON WOW pic.twitter.com/DliVWBTUVn — NFL (@NFL) November 25, 2024 • A.J. Brown caught his first touchdown in five games, racking up a 31.9% target share with DeVonta Smith out. • Jalen Hurts only attempted 22 passes, and he missed an open Dallas Goedert in the end zone in the first half. Goedert remains a must-start as long as Smith is sidelined, despite Sunday night’s disappointing box score. • Puka Nacua led the Rams in targets (13), catches (nine) and receiving yards (117), while Cooper Kupp caught a late garbage-time touchdown. Los Angeles provided solid fantasy production, especially considering it was facing the league’s toughest defense right now. Philadelphia held its opponent under 300 total yards for the seventh straight game Sunday night; no other defense in the league has a span longer than three games. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. • The Chiefs had a quiet second half, but Patrick Mahomes led yet another late game-winning drive and posted his highest weekly fantasy finish (QB2) since October 2023 (entering SNF). Mahomes threw three touchdowns for the third time over his last four games, and he ripped off an impressive 33-yard run while finishing with a season-high 60 rushing yards. Mahomes is cooking despite maintaining a low aDOT (14th percentile Sunday). • Noah Gray caught two touchdowns (before halftime) for the second straight week and finished as fantasy’s TE1 before the primetime games. He’s totaled nine targets over that span and should remain on waiver wires. Meanwhile, Travis Kelce passed Antonio Gates for third all-time in tight end receiving yards. • Kareem Hunt failed fantasy managers for the second straight week, only this time in a highly favorable matchup. Hunt hasn’t lost a fumble since his very first NFL carry back in 2017, but he’s about to lose most of his fantasy value with Isiah Pacheco’s imminent return. • Xavier Worthy dropped a pass thrown behind him that could’ve gone for a score in the second quarter, as the rookie and Mahomes remain out of sync. • Kansas City has already clinched its 10th straight season with double-digit wins and became the first team in NFL history to win eight of its first 11 games by seven points or fewer. • Bryce Young got 9.8 YPA in the first half and led an impressive TD drive to tie the game late in the fourth quarter. Young is showing real signs of improvement, and he gets a favorable matchup at home against the Bucs next week. • Ja’Tavion Sanders made a terrific catch before leaving with a scary-looking neck injury. The rookie has stood out on tape this season and should be a fantasy target in 2025. • Jonathon Brooks’ long-anticipated NFL debut resulted in two carries for seven yards, as his frustrating rookie season continued Sunday. • Aaron Jones lost a fumble on the 2-yard line during Minnesota’s opening drive, allowing the Bears to score before their opponent for the first time this season. Cam Akers was in during Minnesota’s next goal-line opportunity (a Sam Darnold TD pass), but Jones later punched in a short score in the fourth quarter. Jones saw 26-of-30 RB opportunities and finished with a season-high 106 rushing yards, as he took full advantage of Chicago’s run-funnel defense. • Jordan Addison set career highs in catches (eight) and receiving yards (162) while leading all Vikings’ WRs in targets (nine). Addison pulled down multiple impressive catches Sunday, including a 69-yard play that was the longest Chicago has allowed all season. • While Addison finished as this week’s WR1 ahead of primetime, Justin Jefferson was held to a 5-2-27-0 line that included a catch in overtime. Jefferson had a touchdown called back late in the fourth quarter during his worst game of the season. • Caleb Williams entered with the longest streak in NFL history without throwing a touchdown or interception before tossing two scores Sunday. Volume helped while facing a pass-funnel Vikings’ defense, but Williams also led Chicago in rushing and limited the sacks. He’s looking better and has clearly benefitted from the Bears’ OC switch. • DJ Moore had his best game since Week 5 despite three of his teammates seeing double-digit targets. Moore has been peppered with designed screens since Thomas Brown replaced Shane Waldron, which is a big boost to his fantasy value. • Keenan Allen hadn’t topped 50 yards all season, but he had 70 at halftime (not including a terrific 25-yard catch that was overturned). Both Allen and Moore finished as top 10 fantasy WRs this week. • D’Andre Swift had a tough matchup, but he also continues to lose goal-line work to Roschon Johnson. • The Bears executed the NFL’s first successful onside kick this season. • Tony Pollard ran for the most yards (119) by any back against Houston this season and scored his first TD since Week 6. Pollard saw 29-of-31 RB opportunities with Tyjae Spears inactive. • Will Levis went 11-of-12 for 177 yards (16.1 YPA) while taking seven sacks in the first half. He was hurried on roughly half his dropbacks and impressed Sunday despite throwing his third pick-six of the season. • Chig Okonkwo recorded a career-long 70-yard touchdown catch, while Calvin Ridley remained stuck on 93 receiving yards over the game’s final 20+ minutes. • C.J. Stroud got no help from his running game (or offensive line), but he struggled Sunday (-4.7% CPOE) despite having Nico Collins fully back. Stroud threw his first career interceptions inside his division, although his fantasy production (QB9) was his best since Week 4. • Nico Collins scored a sick 33-yard touchdown late in the fourth quarter that was negated by an illegal shift penalty. • Ka’imi Fairbairn has already set the NFL record for most 50-yard field goals (12) this season, but he also missed a crucial 28-yarder with less than two minutes left Sunday (right after the negated Collins TD). • David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs both scored during the same game for the ninth time, which is the third-most ever. They are the first pair of running back teammates in NFL history with at least 10 rushing TDs apiece in consecutive seasons. Montgomery left with a shoulder injury, and Gibbs would become fantasy’s No. 1 back should he miss time. • Anthony Richardson struggled with accuracy again (39.3 completion percentage) while posting an average depth of target (14.1 yards) in the 98th percentile. Richardson missed an open Alec Pierce on a potential 88-yard TD on the game’s second drive, while Josh Downs had two long gains in the second half nullified by penalties. Adonai Mitchell also had a would-be long catch in the fourth quarter but couldn’t keep both of his feet in bounds, and Alec Ogletree suffered a brutal drop in the end zone. • The Lions’ defense entered allowing the second-fewest EPA/play, and they’ve ceded just one QB touchdown over their last four games now, as Richardson also continues to suffer from the league’s toughest QB schedule. AR had three designed runs for 35 yards during the Colts’ opening drive, and he’d finish with a team-high 61 rushing yards. The accuracy issues are ugly, but that type of rushing production still gives Richardson a bunch of fantasy upside in more favorable matchups. • Tua Tagovailoa threw four touchdowns during his best fantasy performance of the season. He has a 7:0 TD:INT ratio over the last two weeks, when the surging Dolphins offense has scored 34 points in back-to-back games. Tagovailoa gave way to Skylar Thompson at one point during the blowout but returned after a New England defensive touchdown. Tagovailoa improved to 7-0 in his career against the Patriots. • Jaylen Waddle woke up and had six catches for 118 yards by halftime. He caught a touchdown in the second half in by far his best game of 2024. Waddle had nearly as many receiving yards Sunday (144) as he had over his previous five games combined (146). • Rhamondre Stevenson had a meager 13 rushing yards, as he had multiple long gains called back by penalties. But he added a truck stick and a two-point catch on a trick play. • Drake Maye’s first 10 touchdown passes have all gone to different receivers, tying an NFL record. • Bucky Irving and Rachaad White split carries evenly (12), but Irving saw six targets despite Mike Evans’ return. Irving turned 18 touches into this week’s RB3 fantasy finish despite being tackled at the 1-yard line during two separate drives. Sean Tucker scored a goal-line TD after the first time Irving was stopped just short of the end zone, but Tucker fumbled during his second chance. Irving ran in a six-yard TD after Tucker’s fumble (during a later drive), although he’d later lose a GL TD to White. Irving fumbled himself in the fourth quarter, but he also had a terrific run and finished with a career-high 64 receiving yards. • Baker Mayfield didn’t throw a TD after entering with the most passing scores (52) in the league since the start of last season. But he threw for nearly 300 yards and had a nice touchdown run that ended with a Tommy DeVito celebration. • DeVito failed to push the ball downfield at all, and it’s concerning Malik Nabers didn’t produce more in this matchup. At least DeVito owns the fourth-longest streak without an interception in Giants’ franchise history. • Tyrone Tracy Jr. lost another fumble during the opening drive in the second half, and the rookie back would later lose a goal-line touchdown to Devin Singletary likely as a result of his ongoing ball security issues. • The Giants fell to 0-6 at home this season, and Brian Daboll has reportedly lost the locker room. The Buccaneers had as many touchdowns (three) as New York had first downs in the first half. • Jayden Daniels had just 3.78 fantasy points at halftime, but a wild fourth quarter that featured 41 points helped him comfortably finish as this week’s QB1 ahead of primetime. Daniels ran for the most yards (74) since his rib injury, and he scored his first rushing TD since September. He appeared healthier coming off the extra rest, but Daniels struggled against a shaky Dallas defense throughout most of Sunday’s game. An 86-yard scoring strike to Terry McLaurin with less than 30 seconds left dramatically altered Daniels’ final box score. Fantasy managers will take it either way, but there should be concern over Kliff Kingsbury offenses that have struggled in the past after being figured out. COMMANDERS 86-YARD TOUCHDOWN WOW📺: #DALvsWAS on FOX📱: https://t.co/waVpO909ge pic.twitter.com/apaNEKNCkh — NFL (@NFL) November 24, 2024 • Brian Robinson Jr. injured his ankle early in the game. He briefly returned before ultimately leaving for good. It was especially disappointing given the favorable matchup against a Cowboys defense that had allowed 402 yards per game (and 32.4 ppg) over their last five contests, although Sunday’s game script certainly didn’t go as expected. • Brandon Aubrey missed two field goals, and Dallas had a punt blocked all in the first half. Meanwhile, Austin Seibert missed a field goal and both of his extra point attempts, with the last EP trying to send the game into overtime. That led to a Cowboys’ kick return touchdown on the ensuing onside attempt, which then led to Austin Ekeler suffering a scary head injury during Washington’s kick return. The broadcast announcers called it the worst special teams game in NFL history even before the late missed extra point, although to be fair, KaVontae Turpin also had a nice TD return. • Courtland Sutton pulled down two scores and finished as this week’s WR2 ahead of primetime. He caught both of his scores in the second half and took advantage of the Raiders missing two starting corners. • No Broncos’ RB can be trusted in fantasy even with Bo Nix’s emergence. Javonte Williams somehow finished with -2 rushing yards Sunday on eight carries (with a long run of seven). • Brock Bowers was held in check, but Jakobi Meyers put up a big line (15-10-121) in a tough matchup. Meyers’ usage has been elite since Davante Adams was traded, and soon, his schedule finally eases up. Unfortunately, Desmond Ridder may be Las Vegas’ new quarterback with Gardner Minshew suffering a season-ending injury Sunday. Ridder lost a fumble on his first play after replacing Minshew, and he finished with a CPOE (-17.1%) in the fourth percentile despite an aDOT (5.4 yards) in the eighth percentile. It’s not good news for Bowers, either. • Ameer Abdullah caught a TD on six targets, but Sincere McCormick led Las Vegas in rush yards (33). The Raiders are averaging the fewest rushing yards per game since 2019. • The Raiders had a successful fake punt, but they haven’t won a game since September. • Jaxon Smith-Njigba led Seattle in targets (seven), catches (six), receiving yards (77) and touchdowns (one). JSN’s score came from three yards out, as he continues to emerge as the Seahawks’ new No. 1 wide receiver. • Kenneth Walker III was active as a receiver again, but he was held under 70 rushing yards for the sixth time over his last seven games. Walker has averaged just 2.97 YPC and scored one touchdown over his last four games after racking up seven TDs over his first five contests. • Kyler Murray, James Conner and Marvin Harrison Jr. were all fantasy busts, as Arizona scored just six points in a fast-paced matchup with one of this week’s highest projected totals. Murray had been playing well, but the Cardinals offense came out of their bye completely flat. The only touchdown Murray produced was when he threw an ugly pick-six during a fourth-down play. • Michael Wilson caught a touchdown in the second quarter that was called back by a penalty, while Harrison Jr. couldn’t get a second foot down in the end zone on the next play. Wilson also had a nice Willie Mays-style catch during a rare Murray attempt downfield. • Murray threw mostly underneath Sunday, which resulted in career highs in targets (15), catches (12) and receiving yards (133) for Trey McBride. The tight end is now up to an NFL-high 80 targets without a receiving touchdown this season. • The Cardinals failed to score a touchdown during a goal-to-go situation for the first time this season in the fourth quarter."

Their latest? Reportedly signing veteran lefty starter Yusei Kikuchi. According to Jon Heyman of the New York Post, the Angels and Kikuchi have agreed to a three-year, $63 million deal. Kikuchi, 33, is coming off the best half-season of his MLB career. Acquired by the Houston Astros just before the 2024 trade deadline, Kikuchi started 10 games for the Astros, averaged six innings per start, and allowed just 18 earned runs, eight home runs and 14 walks. He struck out 76 batters over those 10 starts and ended his regular season with a 2.70 ERA in Houston. Kikuchi has pitched in the U.S. since 2019, but he's a true veteran. He made his professional debut in Japan in 2010, and pitched nine seasons for the Seibu Lions before being posted and signing a four-year deal with the Seattle Mariners. He signed a three-year deal with the Toronto Blue Jays in 2022, where he pitched until he was traded to the Astros. It's possible the time Kikuchi spent in Houston will extend his career several years. Coming into the 2024 season, Kikuchi's career MLB ERA was 4.71 with a 1.383 WHIP. And through the first four months of 2024, his 4.75 ERA was right in line with his career numbers. But he began to find more success after he was traded to the Astros, who worked with Kikuchi on locating his pitches better. The difference was enormous. His strikeouts exploded, making him an incredibly effective weapon in the starting rotation. The Angels have been shockingly aggressive since the World Series ended in late October. They traded for designated hitter and outfielder Jorge Soler on Halloween, sending right-handed pitcher Griffin Canning to the Atlanta Braves to acquire him. Two weeks later, they signed former Braves catcher Travis d'Arnaud to a two-year, $12 million deal. Now they've landed Kikuchi, all before some teams have made even a single consequential move."

The Eagles veteran defensive end went down with an injury early in Philadelphia's 37-20 win over the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday night. After the win, Graham confirmed that he tore his left tricep and will be out for the rest of the season. Graham was incredibly emotional in the locker room at SoFi Stadium when speaking with reporters, and said he had been dealing with a tricep issue for quite some time.

It hurt, but I’m telling you, I’m gonna be better from it.” Graham had two total tackles and a sack in the win on Sunday night. He moved into third on the Eagles’ all-time sack list when he brought down Matthew Stafford in the second quarter. That brought Graham to 76.5 sacks in his career. Only Trent Cole and Reggie White have more.

Graham got his start in the league with the Eagles, who selected him with the No. 13 overall draft pick in 2010 out of Michigan. He’s been a staple in the team’s defense ever since, and he became the first player in team history to appear in 200 regular-season games. Graham is perhaps best known for sealing the Eagles’ win at Super Bowl LII. He got to New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady late in the fourth quarter and forced a perfect strip sack, which gave the Eagles the ball. It was the first turnover of the game, and it couldn’t have come at a better time. The win on Sunday night moved the Eagles to 9-2 on the season. They hold a solid lead in the NFC East heading into next week’s matchup with the Baltimore Ravens, where they’ll attempt to pick up an eighth straight victory. While he didn’t commit to anything — Graham said he was still trying to process the news — the injury may mark the end of his career as a whole. The 36-year-old said before the season that he wanted this to be his “farewell tour,"" and he signed a one-year, $4 million deal to return to the team this past offseason. “If I had to go out like this, I gave it everything out there on the field,” Graham said, via Bleacher Report’s James Palmer. “All I know is, they ain’t done with me yet … I’m content where I’m at.”"

He’s on pace for it, with 1,392 yards through 11 games. That's a career high for Barkley with six games to go.","The last time a running back won NFL MVP was 12 seasons ago. Adrian Peterson got it after rushing for more than 2,000 yards. The last time a running back was MVP without 2,000 rushing yards in a season or breaking an NFL single-season touchdown record was Emmitt Smith in 1993. Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley is going to make it hard on voters to pick just the best quarterback available for MVP this season. Barkley added to his remarkable season with another huge game, and this one was in prime time. Barkley was unstoppable as he ran over, around and past the Los Angeles Rams. Barkley rushed for 255 yards, passed 1,500 yards from scrimmage on the season, and the Eagles cruised to a 37-20 win. Barkley's rushing total was the ninth highest in a game in NFL history and the most in Eagles history. The victory puts Philadelphia's record at 9-2 for the season. With the Washington Commanders’ loss on Sunday, the Eagles lead the division by three games with six to play. Barkley could end up with 2,000 rushing yards this season. He’s on pace for it, with 1,392 yards through 11 games. That's a career high for Barkley with six games to go. That might get him enough MVP votes to win the award. But as the Eagles surge toward an NFC East championship, Barkley’s case keeps getting stronger, regardless of if he hits the magic 2,000 number. The New York Giants blew it this offseason. Saquon Barkley is clearly a first-team All-Pro this season and so is Green Bay Packers safety Xavier McKinney, who is tied for the NFL lead in interceptions. The Giants let both leave in free agency this offseason. Even worse, the Giants made Barkley look like a mostly average running back for many seasons. The same Barkley who is electrifying the NFL and revitalizing Philadelphia’s offense didn’t even break 1,000 yards rushing on the Giants last season. Barkley must be thrilled to be with a legitimate NFL operation this season. The Eagles don’t usually spend much on running backs, but made Barkley an exception. They must have seen how the Giants were wasting his talent and how their stellar offensive line could turn him back into a star. Barkley has been dominant since the Eagles’ Week 1 win over the Packers. The Eagles got another brilliant performance on Sunday night. The game was mostly in hand with less than three minutes left, but Barkley broke a 72-yard touchdown run to punctuate his massive night. It’s not easy to break long touchdowns like that in the NFL, but Barkley has made it look routine this season. Since its bye week, Philadelphia is 7-0. If there’s an NFC team that could go to Detroit and knock off the Lions in the playoffs, the Eagles are the most obvious answer. Barkley carried the day on Sunday, but the defense has quickly become one of the NFL’s best. The Rams have a potent offense when they’re healthy, and in a pivotal second quarter they had -6 yards on four possessions. As Philadelphia picks up new coordinator Vic Fangio’s scheme, there has been steady improvement on that side of the ball. And the offense has plenty of options. Barkley just transformed the Eagles’ run game. Now they have a superstar who is capable of big plays and massive games, a player who can turn what should be a failed play into something positive more often than not. If that sounds like a good MVP candidate, it’s because he is. Defenses can’t stop Barkley this season. The only thing that might stop him might be recent MVP voting history.

"Yahoo!

Any team with a loss to the New York Giants on its record had some things to work on. But it might not matter. With one win over the Arizona Cardinals, the Seahawks are suddenly looking good in the NFC West race. A week after coming back to beat the San Francisco 49ers, the Seahawks dealt a 16-6 loss to the division-leading Arizona Cardinals. As the late games ended on Sunday, the Seahawks were technically in first place of the NFC West. They were tied with the Cardinals at 6-5 with the head-to-head tiebreaker, with the 49ers a game back and the Los Angeles Rams a half game back before they played Sunday night. The Seahawks were fortunate that the rest of the NFC West didn't separate as they worked through some issues with first-year head coach Mike Macdonald. The other three teams might regret not putting more distance between themselves and Seattle, which seems to be getting better as the season goes on. The Seahawks were in a tough, close game against the Cardinals when Kyler Murray made one massive mistake that put his team in a big hole. On fourth-and-1, the Cardinals ran a fake handoff with Murray rolling right. It was slow to develop, there was pressure on Murray so he forced a pass. It floated to cornerback Coby Bryant, who had nothing but green in front of him. Bryant returned it 69 yards for the touchdown. That turned a 7-3 Seahawks lead into a 13-3 lead, and it's tough to come back on the Seahawks when they're at home. COBY BRYANT PICK-6 IN SEATTLE!📺: #AZvsSEA on FOX📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/xVFRwEbk70 — NFL (@NFL) November 24, 2024 The Seahawks can still have moments of inconsistency, and a Geno Smith interception in the fourth quarter kept Arizona in the game. Smith was scrambling and threw it right to Cardinals cornerback Garrett Williams. The Seahawks were at Arizona's 18-yard line on that play, and the interception cost them a shot at a field goal. The Cardinals drove downfield after that and while they couldn't get in the end zone, a field goal cut Seattle's lead to 13-6. The Seahawks came through with a game-clinching drive after that though. They had a 13-play, 59-yard drive that chewed up 8:12 of the clock and ended in a field goal to restore the 10-point lead. It wasn't the prettiest win, but it's one that vaults the Seahawks into playoff contention. The Seahawks were bound to improve as the season went on. Macdonald came over from the Baltimore Ravens after two outstanding seasons as their defensive coordinator, but his scheme is complicated. On Sunday, the Seahawks looked like they were picking it up well. Against a Cardinals offense that had been playing very well, Seattle allowed very little. Arizona didn't score a touchdown. And the Seahawks defense made the biggest play of the game on the pick-6. If the Seahawks defense continues to get better, the offense has enough firepower on most days to put up points. The rest of the NFC West hasn't been too impressive. Seattle should feel pretty good about its chances after a crucial win on Sunday."

It's the last thing left in Pandora's Box. It's the undercurrent theme all through ""The Shawshank Redemption."" And it's what NFL teams and fans cling to when a young quarterback is drafted. Give us a reason to believe tomorrow will be better than today. It's been an up-and-down season for rookie quarterbacks, as expected. But the two biggest tickets showed improvement in Week 12's early window. Jayden Daniels and Caleb Williams didn't earn real-life wins Sunday, but they helped plenty of fantasy managers. When the early window closed, Daniels was at the top of the quarterback board (32.4 points) and Williams ranked third (26.9 points). A nifty comeback week when one was desperately needed. Both players were in catch-up mode in the second half, which can be nectar of the fantasy gods. The Commanders scored 23 points after halftime against Dallas (including 17 in a chaotic final period) and the Bears used 17 fourth-quarter points and the rare onside-kick recovery to force overtime against Minnesota. We can't call it garbage time when a comeback actually works. Washington would have tied Dallas late if not for a botched extra point. Daniels had a better fantasy game than a real-life one. He was intercepted twice and only had 57 yards passing at halftime. The most encouraging sign was the return of his running game (7-74-1); he was an ineffective and sometimes reluctant runner the previous two weeks. I openly speculated that perhaps his rib injury hadn't completely healed, but he looked fine against Dallas. The Daniels bottom line was boosted when the Cowboys allowed a gift 86-yard score to Terry McLaurin in the final minute of the game; you could write a book on how poorly Dallas defended that play. But fantasy managers won't apologize or give the points back. After scoring about 13 points a week over a five-game stretch, Daniels was back in business. DIDN'T MATTER FOR THE COMMANDERS BUT THAT'S A LOT OF LAST-SECOND FANTASY POINTS FOR JAYDEN DANIELS AND TERRY MCLAURINpic.twitter.com/tpoOTPIUoO — Yahoo Fantasy Sports (@YahooFantasy) November 24, 2024 The upcoming schedule is medium — Tennessee, a bye week and then New Orleans to open the fantasy playoffs in Week 15. The Titans and Saints are middle of the pack with respect to QB points allowed. Daniels gets a Week 16 challenge against Philadelphia, then closes with a home date against Atlanta. Bottom line, if he's willing to run, we're willing to play him. Daniels was needed more Sunday with Brian Robinson Jr. (5-13-0) getting dinged up early. We appreciated the two touchdowns passes going to fantasy staples McLaurin (5-102-1) and old reliable Zach Ertz (6-38-1). Williams had a better real-life game than Daniels did — he threw for 340 yards and didn't turn the ball over against the respected Vikings defense. He took a modest three sacks against the blitz-happy Minnesota scheme, although one of them was a hold-the-ball killer in overtime. There were two touchdown passes, the first for Williams since Week 6 — and 33 resourceful scrambling yards. I don't know where the Thomas Brown story is headed, but he seems much more in sync with Williams than departed OC Shane Waldron ever was. And as usual, the Bears kept the target tree gloriously compact — 42 of the 47 targets went to the Big Four of Keenan Allen (15), Cole Kmet (10), Rome Odunze (10) and DJ Moore (seven). Fantasy being the silly game it is sometimes, Moore had the best return (7-106-1 for 23.4 fantasy points) despite the smallest workload. He also caught a two-point conversion. But it's fun to see this offense trustable again. The buzzkill for Williams fantasy managers is the upcoming schedule — it's a sea of red. Three daunting road games are on the way — Detroit on Thanksgiving, San Francisco and then Minnesota in primetime. The Lions rematch follows in Week 16, with the Seahawks in Week 17. Hopefully, fantasy managers have a safer option to dial up at QB. But if Williams can merely show competence, it makes us more comfortable starting the critical pass-catchers in this offense. And wouldn't it be nice? Sticking with the rookie QBs, Bo Nix has pulled back from his scrambling lately. But the way he's throwing the ball, it's a trade-off the Broncos will gladly accept. Nix played a clean and efficient game at Las Vegas, throwing for 273 yards and two scores in a 10-point victory. Nix didn't have any turnovers and took just one sack, keeping the offense on schedule. The passing was essential, because Denver ran for just 63 yards and 2.9 a carry (backfield bingo is no fun when Sean Payton is calling out the numbers). Nix is one of the league's most improved players over the past two months. Fantasy managers miss his rushing backboard, of course. Nix has just 10 yards on the ground the past three games, and he hasn't scored a rushing touchdown since Week 7. But boundary specialist Courtland Sutton is taking off as Nix gets his sea legs; Sutton had two touchdown catches Sunday and is on a 36-467-3 binge in the last five games. Maybe Sutton is the new Doug Baldwin, the most underrated receiver in the league. Is it too late for Nix to get into the Rookie of the Year mix? He's been better than Daniels over the last several weeks. Both Denver and Washington look headed towards surprising playoff berths. Denver hosts Cleveland in Week 13, then takes a Week 14 bye. A juicy Cincinnati matchup (Week 17) is waiting at the end of the fantasy playoffs.

It will be interesting to see how the NFL and fantasy markets react to so many second-contract running backs starring for their new clubs. Barkley's smashing for Philly, Josh Jacobs had a hat trick for Green Bay, Derrick Henry is a weekly touchdown for Baltimore. Obviously it underscores how important it is for players to escape bad situations whenever possible — keep in mind Barkley fled the Giants, Jacobs escaped from Vegas and Henry upgraded from Tennessee. • I realize Kyler Murray was injured in the fourth quarter, but he basically laid an egg in a critical game for NFC West supremacy. I'm never surprised when Murray's rushing evaporates, and I'm never surprised when he struggles to punctuate touchdown drives. Sometimes I think he's just good enough to lose with. • Obviously CeeDee Lamb misses Dak Prescott, but he's absorbed a ridiculous 77 targets over the past six games, and he's at an 18-160-0 line the last two weeks, as Cooper Rush has settled in. This type of usage can mostly offset the drop of talent at quarterback. Lamb remains a set-and-forget guy. • I don't know why the Cowboys don't find other things for KaVonte Turpin to do, but that electric speed needs a bigger role. Your season is already dead, anyway. Experiment with the unknown upside of your players. • The Jaylen Waddle splash game came out of nowhere, the type of pinball score that lifts 3-8 fantasy teams to 4-8. It's already too late. But will the current Dolphins ever solve the Tyreek Hill problem? Hill was terrific in the season opener; here's what he's done in 10 games since: 42 catches, 441 yards, two touchdowns, just 10.5 YPC. The last three weeks, with Tua Tagovailoa back, Hill's averaging 8.3 yards per reception. It boggles the mind. (Meanwhile, you'd swear Jonnu Smith was a long-lost relative of Tony Gonzalez. He looks amazing.) • Bryce Young was composed and effective in the near-miss against an engaged Kansas City defense. In short, he has a shot. Anthony Richardson regressed against the nasty Lions defense, but both Young and Richardson benefited from their mid-season benchings, no matter how unpopular they were in the moment. • The Bears prioritized Justin Jefferson in coverage so Sam Darnold did what a shrewd quarterback does — he torched the opponent with Jordan Addison, his second-best receiver. So many of the great quarterbacks through history would admit their favorite target was the guy with the prime matchup. Let's not forget Addison was a first-round pick who already has 15 pro touchdowns. He also won the Fred Biletnikoff Award in college, as 2021's best receiver. (Commonly, those players turn out to be stars. But you'll never guess who won the award in 2022.) • It took too long for the Giants to get Malik Nabers going, but 6-64-0 on nine targets isn't a nightmare. It will get better. At minimum, the target share will go up. • Is a wide usage tree going to spoil the Tampa Bay offense? Three running backs plus Baker Mayfield had ground touchdowns at the Giants. Mayfield targeted 11 different players, no one more than six times. Mike Evans is too big to fail and maybe Bucky Irving is too, but when you spread the usage this thin and you romp anyway, it doesn't encourage changes in the immediate future."

Los Angeles Galaxy and Seattle will meet in the West Final; Orlando City and New York Red Bulls will meet in the East Final. Saquon Barkley for MVP? The Eagles running back added to his remarkable season with 255 rushing yards (ninth-most ever) in Sunday night's 37-20 win over the Rams. Back-to-back: Barkley is the first player to have 500+ scrimmage yards over a two-game span since Walter Payton in November 1977. This week: 26 carries, 255 yards, 2 TD; 4 receptions, 47 yards Last week: 26 carries, 146 yards, 2 TD; 2 receptions, 52 yards By the numbers: Barkley (1,392 yards through 11 games) is on pace to become the ninth member of the 2,000 yards club. Four of the eight current members won MVP that year (O.J. Simpson in 1973, Barry Sanders in 1997, Terrell Davis in 1998, Adrian Peterson in 2012). From Yahoo Sports' Matt Harmon… The Eagles cultivate such a great rushing ecosystem. We've seen multiple different backs have career-best years in Philly alongside Jalen Hurts and behind this offensive line the last three seasons. The current-era Eagles have never employed a running back like Saquon Barkley, who can take over a game and launch this ecosystem into the stratosphere. He makes the team right when the scheme is wrong. I just don't know how we're still having the same conversations about running back value when we've seen an elite back like this weaponize an already great rushing attack. He's not even the only one doing it; look at 2022-23 Christian McCaffrey in San Francisco and Derrick Henry in Baltimore. Meanwhile, in New Jersey: The Giants lost 30-7 to the Buccaneers in their first game since releasing QB Daniel Jones, the player they chose over Barkley in a brainless decision forever immortalized on ""Hard Knocks."" They are now 2-9 and haven't held a lead since the Mets were tied 1-1 in the NLDS… 50 days ago. Around the league: Cowboys 34, Commanders 26: Dallas and Washington combined for five touchdowns in the final five minutes of this bonkers affair, which featured two missed extra points, two missed field goals, two kick return TDs, a blocked field goal and a blocked punt. Chiefs 30, Panthers 27: Kansas City eked out a win thanks to a big game from Patrick Mahomes (269 yards, 3 TD, 60 rush yards) and a walk-off field goal from rookie Spencer Shrader. Eight of the Chiefs' 10 wins have come by a single score. Vikings 30, Bears 27 (OT): Sam Darnold (330 yards, 2 TD) and a trio of players with over 100 scrimmage yards (Aaron Jones, Jordan Addison, T.J. Hockenson) handed the Bears their fifth straight loss, also on a walk-off field goal. Titans 32, Texans 27: Entering Sunday, teams that took 8+ sacks and committed 3+ turnovers were 6-145 in the Super Bowl era. They are now 7-145 after Tennessee stunned first-place Houston on the road. More scores: Seahawks 16, Cardinals 6 | Lions 24, Colts 6 | Dolphins 34, Patriots 15 | Broncos 29, Raiders 19 | Packers 38, 49ers 10 The following is based on Tom Haberstroh's latest Yahoo Sports feature: The NBA's 'shot desert' problem is real. Could 3-point dunks save us? There is a growing grumble around the NBA that the sport is suffering — and TV ratings are tumbling — because the math says players should fire up 3s at a high rate, often at the expense of dunks and other more exciting basketball plays. What they're saying: On opening night, after the Celtics launched 61 3-pointers in a sleepy rout over the Knicks, FS1's Nick Wright, in a clip that generated millions of views on X, lamented the modern playing style and called for the league to change its rules: ""The NBA is at its best when dudes are flying over people, meeting 'em at the rim. That is when it's at its best television product. A bunch of finesse guys hanging out at the 3-point line hoisting 30-footers is not good TV."" How did we get here? The NBA's problem isn't just the rise of 3-pointers; it's the ""sameness"" that has come as a result. Everyone's shooting the same damn shots, and it all traces back to the death of the mid-range — an area of the court that was abandoned by analytically-driven basketball minds looking to squeeze every morsel of efficiency out of every possession. Then vs. now: In 1996-97, the first season of shot-location data, the Michael Jordan-led Bulls paced the NBA with 41.5 mid-range shots per game. This season, the Kings lead the league with 14.1 attempts, and most teams are in the single digits. The craziest part? It's gotten to the point where teams will go entire games without scoring from the mid-range area at all… The rise of ""desert games"": This season, there have been 24 instances in which a team didn't score a single point in the mid-range area. For decades, we never saw one such game — even as recently as 2010-11. Then one. Then two. Then a big jump to 64 (inspired by the Moreyball Rockets, who won 65 games the year before). Then, a plateau around 80 such games. This season, we're on track for 136 (!!). There's a ""desert game"" almost every night now. Here's Tom… This is a radical change in strategy that has transpired right before our eyes. When Stephen Curry came into the league in 2009, we went the entire season without seeing a desert game. Curry was the transcendent shooter that lit the fire. James Harden/Moreyball fanned the flames. The Celtics poured gasoline on it. Now it's wildfire spreading across the league. Track it next time you watch an NBA game. Notice how teams rarely take the open mid-range shot, opting instead to drive into the paint and kick. Drive and kick. Drive and kick. Until an open 3 is created. Or the rim protectors cry, ""Uncle."" Keep reading: Could 3-point dunks save us? Norman, Oklahoma — Unranked Oklahoma stunned No. 7 Alabama, 24-3, to hand the Tide their first three-loss season since 2010. It was one of four huge upsets on Saturday that could drastically shake up the CFP rankings.

Then vs. now: Clark's debut came during COVID, so the announced crowd for Iowa's 96-81 win over Northern Iowa was just 365 people. Four years later, her Indiana Fever set the WNBA's single-season home attendance record (340,715 fans), and her final regular-season game against the Mystics had the largest crowd in league history (20,711). A career to remember: Clark was a two-time National Player of the Year, three-time unanimous first-team All-American, and she led the Hawkeyes to a 109-30 record and back-to-back national championship games.

She scored fewer than 10 points just once in 139 games, and had nearly as many 40-point games (13) as games with fewer than 20 points (15).

Sunday's game at TD Garden was no exception as the Celtics escaped TD Garden with a 107-105 victory. The last four games between the C's and Wolves have either been decided in overtime or by a margin of two points. Boston has been victorious in three of those four meetings. But after Minnesota's one win last season, Wolves star Anthony Edwards trash-talked Celtics star Jayson Tatum in a clip that aired on Netflix's Starting 5. ""You seen Tatum trying to get me on the switch, locked his ass up two times. He started talking s---,"" Edwards told his teammates in the locker room after the game. ""Tatum was talking crazy, saying, ‘Yeah, I’m here,’ then I said, ‘I’m coming again.’ Talking ‘bout best player in the league, y’all trippin’."" Tatum got his chance to respond to Edwards after leading the C's to a win on Sunday. ""We had two good games against each other last year,"" Tatum said. ""Obviously, spent the summer with each other in the Olympics. I love Ant. Hell of a player, hell of a competitor. He talks a lot and he had a lot to say this summer about the games we played against them last year and getting excited to play against us this year. So you enjoy playing against the other best players in the league. It's always fun and competitive."" Edwards' trash-talk caught Tatum's attention, but the 2024 NBA champion didn't take it personally. ""I saw it. We was talking a lot of s--- to each other during the summer,"" Tatum added. ""I got a pretty good record against Minnesota in my career. That was the one time he beat us so far. ""But I mean, it's fun. They're a really good team, they're well-coached. They've got some talent over there, so I'm certain for the near-future the games against those guys will be really fun ones."" Tatum is 12-1 in his career against Minnesota. He dropped 45 points in the Celtics' win over the Wolves last season and notched 26 points in Sunday's victory. Edwards did his part in Sunday's game, logging a team-high 28 points on 6-of-11 shooting from 3-point range. The 23-year-old has already made a name for himself as one of the league's biggest stars, but there's no doubt Tatum has all of the bragging rights at this stage of their respective careers. Tatum and the C's will look to earn their sixth consecutive win when they host the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday night. Tip-off is set for 7:30 p.m. ET on NBC Sports Boston."

The Dallas Cowboys scored a 99-yard touchdown and the Washington Commanders scored an 86-yard touchdown in the final three minutes of what became an out-of-control fourth quarter. Ultimately, the Cowboys snapped a five-game losing streak with the 34-26 win, improving to 4-7 as the Commanders fell to 7-5 with their third consecutive loss. But before any of those outcomes were assured, the teams played a wild fourth quarter. Let’s break it down. Just as Washington pulled to within three points with a little over three minutes left, kick returner KaVontae Turpin struck back. The ensuing kickoff bounced through Turpin’s legs, a fitting last gaffe for a group that had already endured a blocked field goal, a missed field goal and a blocked punt. Turpin nonetheless grabbed the loose ball at the 1-yard line and powered a spin move to confuse the Commanders’ leverage. His 99-yard touchdown seemed to seal the Cowboys win.

COMMANDERS 86-YARD TOUCHDOWN WOW📺: #DALvsWAS on FOX📱: https://t.co/waVpO909ge pic.twitter.com/apaNEKNCkh — NFL (@NFL) November 24, 2024 Trailing by one, Washington opted to go for the more surefire extra-point attempt than the 2-point attempt. Austin Seibert’s kick — like many before it, on what play-by-play announcer Joe Davis fittingly called the “worst special teams day in history” — shanked wide left. NO GOOD.📺: #DALvsWAS on FOX📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/FDg7wGy8KF — NFL (@NFL) November 24, 2024 Washington attempted an onside kick for a last-ditch effort. Cowboys safety Juanyeh Thomas instead recovered it and returned it for a 43-yard touchdown. The Cowboys now led by eight. But was scoring wiser than running out the clock against a team that beat the Chicago Bears on a Hail Mary this year? Daniels scrambled around as he set up his final play 58 yards from the end zone. This time, the well-arced ball wasn’t tipped into his teammate’s hand. Safety Israel Mukuamu grabbed the game-winning interception. Daniels completed 25 of 38 pass attempts for 275 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions including the final Hail Mary. He also rushed seven times for 74 yards and another score. Cooper Rush justified Jerry Jones’ insistence that he, rather than Trey Lance, gave the club its best chance to win in the wake of Dak Prescott’s season-ending hamstring surgery. Rush completed 24 of 32 pass attempts for 247 yards and two touchdowns, while taking just one sack and committing no turnovers. Rush found a well-defended Jalen Tolbert for a 6-yard touchdown that helped the Cowboys take a 10-9 lead. The prospect of either team, much less both, scoring 25 points on the day seemed unlikely when they entered halftime at 3-3. It wasn’t just that the Cowboys were struggling without three Pro Bowl players and the Commanders were continuing to grasp, unsuccessfully, for a rhythm they’d established before Daniels’ midseason rib injury. Rather, the first half’s absurdity centered more on how each team, and especially their special teams units, struggled. The Commanders blocked a Cowboys field-goal attempt before connecting on their own. Dallas kicker Brandon Aubrey’s second attempt doinked off the right upright, a bonanza Washington entered when missing its own field goal. Cowboys running back Rico Dowdle fumbled in the first quarter before Daniels threw an interception in the second. The teams combined for six punts before Aubrey made his first field goal of the day, a 46-yard attempt, seconds before halftime. Six first-half punts were interrupted only by Dallas defensive lineman Chauncey Golston’s highlight-reel interception. The Cowboys’ lone first-half score came off perhaps the game’s most ridiculous play of all. Commanders cornerback Noah Igbinoghene intercepted Rush’s pass attempt to receiver CeeDee Lamb, Igbignoghene ultimately fumbling it for Cowboys fullback Hunter Luepke to recover. Officials flagged Igbigoghene for defensive pass interference on the play, rendering most of the sloppiness moot as the Cowboys stayed on the field. Coming out of halftime, Washington leaned heavily on the run, alternating carries between Daniels and running backs Austin Ekeler and Jeremy McNichols as normal starter Brian Robinson Jr. nursed an ankle injury. Facing third-and-3 in the red zone, Daniels faked a handoff to Ekeler then tucked and scurried around the left end for a 17-yard, go-ahead touchdown. The Cowboys answered, Rush finding a well-defended Jalen Tolbert for a 6-yard touchdown that helped the Cowboys take a 10-9 lead. Five punts later, the Cowboys hit a field goal and forced a fumble the immediate next play. Quarterback Cooper Rush noticed a coverage bust in the red zone and responded with a 22-yard touchdown pass to tight end Luke Schoonmaker, the first score of the rookie’s career. Then Daniels completed 7-of-7 passes on a scoring drive that included a touchdown strike to tight end Zach Ertz and a 2-point conversion keeper of his own. The chaos was just beginning."

Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games","With upset loss to Cowboys, Commanders at risk of falling into Kliff Kingsbury trap",https://sports.yahoo.com/with-upset-loss-to-cowboys-commanders-at-risk-of-falling-into-kliff-kingsbury-trap-053507814.html,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 05:35:07 GMT",Kingsbury deserves a share of credit for the remarkable rookie year of Jayden Daniels. But the coordinator also can’t escape the reality that has followed him from Arizona to Washington.,"When the Arizona Cardinals fired Kliff Kingsbury in January 2023, the coach who jumped from the college game to NFL head coach had developed a reputation. He was a sharp play-caller with creative offenses that had helped jumpstart 2019 first overall draft pick Kyler Murray’s career. Opposing coordinators wondered how to stop the looks he threw at them early each season, the time in the college trenches fueling Kingsbury’s creative and diverse schematic wrinkles. But midway through the season, a shift would occur. Opposing coordinators competing at the game’s highest level would begin to solve the problems that the Cardinals gave them. One team would counter Arizona’s game plan with success, and the next team would follow that blueprint — often adding its own trump card. The result: In four years with Kingsbury as their head coach, the Cardinals’ winning rate always trailed off in November and December. Arizona won 56.9% of their first nine games across those years (20-15-1). Afterward: They won just 26.7% (8-22) to close the season. The difference and repeated nature of the annual drop shaded Kingsbury’s coaching reputation, fair or not. He took the 2023 season off before Dan Qunn hired him to coordinate the Washington Commanders' offense during a cycle in which Kingsbury had plenty of suitors. Kingsbury deserves a share of the credit for the remarkable rookie year of Jayden Daniels, whom the Commanders drafted second overall before he had the best career start. But the coordinator also can’t escape the reality that has followed him from Arizona to Washington. The Commanders’ production and ability to win games is dipping after a strong start to the season. Their third straight loss, a 34-26 loss to a reeling Dallas Cowboys team, reflects that. And while the accountability goes far beyond Kingsbury, Daniels’ postgame sentiments eerily reflected the tropes that shaped Kingsbury’s Arizona tenure. “Defensive coordinators look at teams having success against [their next opponent] and how can they incorporate that into their schemes,” Daniels said. “You start to see trends and watch film, but you got to be able to adjust on the fly. We were able to adjust on the fly, but we didn’t do that early enough. And that starts with me seeing it, the receivers seeing it, everyone seeing it all as one accord.” The 2024 Commanders have drastically exceeded preseason expectations. Their head coach, general manager, quarterbacks and both coordinators are all in Year 1 in Washington. Even team ownership remains the newest, in Year 2. And yet, in their first nine games, the Commanders’ 7-2 clip matched or exceeded the franchise’s win total from eight of their past 11 seasons. Washington jumped out to an NFC East lead, and then had a chance to reclaim it last week during a Thursday night visit to the Philadelphia Eagles. Instead, the Eagles have now won seven straight to sit comfortably atop the division at 9-2. The Commanders have lost three straight, including two straight division games, and dropped to 7-5. “When you got a home game and you’re going for the division, you want to take advantage of those,” Quinn said. “When you miss them, it stings.” Against the Eagles and Cowboys the past two weeks, Washington has managed to stay close if low-scoring through three quarters. The Commanders led 10-6 entering the fourth in Philadelphia; hosting Dallas, they trailed 10-9 after three quarters. Both times, the fourth quarter got out of control, and a culturally young Washington team struggled to keep up. The Eagles outscored Washington 20-8 in the fourth quarter, the Commanders’ only contribution a final-minute touchdown to tight end Zach Ertz. The Cowboys outscored the Commanders 24-17 in the fourth during a period most appropriately and professionally described as bonkers. The Cowboys scored a 99-yard touchdown on a kickoff return, then the Commanders followed up a field goal with an 86-yard touchdown that Terry McLaurin took 58 yards after the catch. Washington kicker Austin Seibert — whose field-goal attempt 71 seconds earlier was good — missed the game-tying extra point, and the Cowboys then returned Washington’s onside kick attempt for a touchdown before intercepting Daniels’ final Hail Mary. (No guarantee after the Commanders beat the Chicago Bears on a Hail Mary last month.) The game — with several missed field goals, a blocked field goal, a blocked punt and a missed extra-point attempt — required managing emotions and schematic adjustments alike. “As I’m learning, you don’t ride the roller coaster, you stay even-keeled throughout it all because it’s a long season,” Daniels said. “A lot of things can happen in a game in the NFL. So man, just try to stay even-keeled and control the things you can control.” The Commanders controlled their offensive possessions and end-of-game scenarios far more reliably to start the season. As defenses have ramped up their exotic pressures and more effectively stifled Washington on early downs, the Commanders have not been able to respond. Regardless of how Washington’s next several weeks unfold, there will be reason to view 2024 as a success for the franchise. The team’s functionality and efficiency is better than it’s been in years, its culture under Josh Harris’ ownership group seemingly light-years ahead of predecessor Dan Snyder’s era. The Commanders have discovered a grit and toughness that will lay the groundwork for Quinn’s tenure. They’ve created a framework for their franchise quarterback’s success from the first few weeks of his rookie year, giving them the opportunity to chase postseason success while exploiting the best market hack of the NFL’s salary cap era: a quarterback’s rookie contract. Even as Daniels’ performance dipped in recent weeks — he’s had three touchdown passes to three interceptions the past two weeks after beginning his career with a 9:2 ratio — he’s still creating explosive plays like McLaurin’s 86-yard chance to save the game and Daniels’ own 17-yard rushing touchdown that gave Washington a lead in the third quarter. The quarterback will be fine. The coordinator might be, too. But as the Kingsbury late-season ghosts begin to reappear, the coordinator and all of Washington’s staff have a chance to buck the trend with which he began his NFL career. Quinn touched on that lesson when he praised his team’s effort and process while acknowledging it’d be nice to need late-game heroics less often. The Commanders can’t just keep learning lessons, Quinn said. They also need to apply what they’ve learned. How can they harness the belief they’re creating? “Because we’ve been in these, being battle-tested as a first-year group more than most,” Quinn said. “And you want to be able to [not just learn] these end-of-game, winning-time moments. It’s about winning them. And we’ve won some.” Washington is currently sitting in the final NFC wild-card spot, with a 60 percent chance to make the playoffs, per Next Gen Stats. Games against the Tennessee Titans and New Orleans Saints await on either side of their bye. They’ll finish their year with another round of Eagles and Cowboys games on either side of the Atlanta Falcons. Quinn will encourage his players between now and then to drill down on execution and attention to detail. He’ll continue to preach confidence and attitude, he said. The hope: The many high notes of the Commanders season will begin rounding into more consistent form. Kingsbury will hope that, too. “I don’t want it to go up and down, up and down,” Quinn said. “Every time we go: This is the edge, this is where we go, this is the time to go to capture it.”"

Among the 41-car field for the South Carolina 400 was the iconic No. 8 Budweiser Chevrolet that NASCAR Hall of Famer Dale Earnhardt Jr. popularized during the early years of his career. Accompanying Earnhardt Jr. at Florence was his devoted fanbase that enveloped the grandstands with a sea of red once commonplace at NASCAR races around the country. Earnhardt Jr. could not help but get immersed in the atmosphere generated by the Budweiser No. 8’s first race since 2007. The tribute nearly ended with Earnhardt Jr. taking the beloved scheme to Victory Lane, but he found satisfaction in what the weekend meant to himself and those who have been invested in his storied career. “I felt great about the car,” Earnhardt Jr. said. “Picked them off as I could. The car was excellent and a lot of guys were starting to struggle with the balance of their car. For the second half, we were going to sit there in second. When it was time to start pressuring (leader Treyten Lapcevich), I could probably get him loose, drive off the corner and beat him. “It was about time to turn it on and then the fuel pump broke.” 🎉 Party like it‘s 2004! 🍻 pic.twitter.com/UJHpmFBxRX — NASCAR Regional (@NASCARRegional) November 23, 2024 A 40th-place starting position did little to stymie Earnhardt Jr., who carved through the field with relative ease to nestle himself into the second position at the halfway break, all while being cheered on by his exuberant fans. Earnhardt Jr. stayed in second the rest of the evening until a broken fuel pump knocked him out of the race with 31 laps remaining. The final showing of 28th was not the outcome most members of Junior Nation had anticipated, yet the South Carolina 400 proved to be more about the journey for Earnhardt Jr.‘s followers instead of the destination. Although Earnhardt Jr. spent more time in a Hendrick Motorsports No. 88 Chevrolet during his Cup Series tenure, the No. 8 Budweiser Chevrolet for Dale Earnhardt Inc. is where he first built his identity. During his eight full-time years with DEI, Earnhardt Jr. amassed 17 victories, 76 top fives and led over 5,000 laps. The most notable of Earnhardt Jr.‘s accomplishments in the Budweiser No. 8 Chevrolet was his first of two Daytona 500 victories in 2004. BACK IN BUD: Photos of Dale Jr. at Florence Earnhardt Jr. parted ways with DEI at the end of the 2007 season, but the memories of his success in the No. 8 Budweiser Chevrolet never faded. Nearly two decades on from Earnhardt Jr.‘s final outing with DEI and NASCAR events are still filled with spectators who adorn the iconic No. 8. One of those fans is David Faulkner, who traveled five hours from Hampton, Virginia, to see the Budweiser No. 8 for at least one final time. A lifelong follower of the Earnhardt family since the 1970s, Faulkner admitted seeing Earnhardt Jr. pilot a red No. 8 again evoked memories of the victories he got to witness in person. “I remember the wins at Richmond, because Richmond is my home track about an hour away [from Hampton],” Faulkner said. “Just watching the Budweiser car running around brings back a lot of memories.” Many stories like Faulkner‘s awaited Earnhardt Jr. as he greeted fans throughout the afternoon at Florence. One woman Earnhardt Jr. interacted with had been waiting to obtain his autograph since the Budweiser No. 8 made its formal Cup Series debut during the 1999 Coca-Cola 600. The impact of Earnhardt Jr. on NASCAR extends far beyond spectators. Since returning to his Late Model Stock origins in 2022, Earnhardt Jr. has been approached by countless competitors young and old, with every conversation providing Earnhardt Jr. a healthy perspective into how he has shaped the world around him. “I qualified really bad and I was pretty mad at myself,” Earnhardt Jr. said. “I got done, pulled around and one of the other drivers [Gary Greenwood] who qualified poorly got out and said, ‘Keep your head up. I am racing because of you. I lost my dad and listening to your podcast has really helped me. That’s why I got this car.’ “I was so upset with qualifying, but sometimes it‘s good to be reminded that it‘s not that important.” For Dylan Braswell, who ventured to Florence from the small town of Nashville, North Carolina, he never witnessed Earnhardt Jr. pilot the No. 8 Budweiser Chevrolet but had long been familiar with the Earnhardts and NASCAR through his late grandmother Dianne. The two got to see Earnhardt Jr.‘s final Cup Series race at Homestead-Miami Speedway in 2017 a couple of months before Dianne passed away. Braswell saw his trip to the South Carolina 400 to honor Dianne‘s love for racing and to get a firsthand account as to why the No. 8 was so special to so many people. “My grandmother got me into NASCAR and she was always big into Earnhardt Jr.,” Braswell said. “I got to watch the VCR tapes and all that stuff back in the day, so that‘s kind of where the No. 8 car is for me, watching it on TV. “I bought tickets instantly as soon as I heard.” Braswell and the rest of Earnhardt Jr.‘s fanbase colloquially known as Junior Nation were treated to a thrilling performance from their favorite driver as he battled to make his own history in the South Carolina 400. Up until a few months ago, not many in the NASCAR industry would have expected to see Earnhardt Jr. bring back the scheme that kickstarted his career for any reason. Circumstances brought the Budweiser No. 8 back to life, an opportunity not many Earnhardt Jr. fans were willing to pass up as evidenced by the South Carolina 400‘s sold-out crowd. Saturday was perfect for people like Faulkner, as it allowed him and others to reflect on pleasant memories and cherish seeing part of the past being reborn into the present day. “I‘ve been waiting on this since I saw a little hint back in April when [Earnhardt Jr.] threw a bunch of Budweiser stuff on the Internet,” Faulkner said. “I thought he was going to bring the Budweiser car back and now I‘m here. “It‘s iconic.” RELATED: Dale Jr. through the years Other than the broken fuel pump and poor qualifying effort, Earnhardt Jr. got everything he wanted by bringing the Budweiser No. 8 Chevrolet to the South Carolina 400. The purpose of the initiative was to give back to the fans, many of whom descended upon Florence to see what Earnhardt Jr. could do in his iconic scheme. The performance Earnhardt Jr. put together on Saturday gave him a much-needed jolt ahead of four planned Late Model Stock starts in 2025. While he is unsure of when that Budweiser scheme will next see the track, Earnhardt Jr. intends to bring it back before inevitably deciding to retire from racing altogether. “At some point, you‘re going to age out,” Earnhardt Jr. said. “I don‘t know why that happens or how it happens, but I don‘t know when that happens. Maybe I got another three, four, five years left. If I have anything to do with it, they will see that Bud car again.” Whenever or wherever Earnhardt Jr. unloads the Budweiser No. 8 next, the grandstands will be red and black, filled with loyal spectators eager to see if the famous car will find its way to Victory Lane just like it did back in the 2000s."

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Fantasy Football Week 12 Pulse Check: Can we trust the Dolphins offense again?,https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy-football-week-12-pulse-check-can-we-trust-the-dolphins-offense-again-015412896.html,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 01:54:12 GMT","The Miami Dolphins were looking like one of the most disappointing units of 2024. Then, Week 12 happened. Fantasy football analyst Tera Roberts breaks things down.","It’s time we readdress a question that we’ve been asking all season long: what should we do with the Dolphins’ offense? This week, however, we look at the question from a more positive outlook. When Tua Tagovailoa was out, the entire offense was unusable. When Tagovailoa returned, De’Von Achane was the only reliable option. Now, in Week 12, the entire Dolphins offense finally looked like a cohesive and coherent unit poised for the fantasy upside we’d hoped for heading into the season. Is it too little too late though? Heading into the season, the Dolphins late-season schedule was a major concern for me: Week 13 @ Green Bay Packers Week 14 Vs. New York Jets Week 15 @ Houston Texans Week 16 Vs. San Francisco 49ers Week 17 @ Cleveland Browns It was a daunting schedule … in theory. However, moving forward, it now looks intriguing. Green Bay had a known issue in defending the run but they’ve held up fairly well, almost dead center in average points to opposing running backs. They’ve been stout against quarterbacks, allowing the seventh-fewest fantasy points to opposing passers and the 10th fewest to receivers. Oddly enough, Green Bay might be the most difficult matchup for Tagovailoa. The Jets defense has been reeling and is vulnerable to all positions since the firing of Robert Saleh. The Texans can’t seem to pick a lane and decide if they are good or bad on defense. The 49ers have been hit with a wave of injuries. The Browns are in a tailspin and their only advantage is playing in Cleveland. With this new perspective of the rest-of-season schedule in mind, and finally seeing a strong overall offensive performance in a dominant win over New England, let’s talk about what we can expect from our key Dolphins’ fantasy assets moving forward — and who we can trust. As with any NFL offense, it all starts and ends at quarterback. Heading into the week, Tagovailoa was coming off his best performance of the season with 23.5 fantasy points and three touchdowns — both season highs. He capitalized on that momentum, delivering an even better performance with over 300 passing yards, four touchdowns and 28.48 fantasy points, making him the overall QB3 of the week (prior to the primetime games). While I do have some cold-weather concerns for Tagovailoa, particularly in a Thanksgiving night game at Green Bay, and Cleveland during championship week, his rest-of-season outlook remains strong. The Week 17 matchup against Cleveland is likely a no-go due to weather concerns, but the Dolphins are fighting for their playoff lives and keeping their foot on the gas. Despite some season-long struggles from the receiving corps, Tagovailoa has one of the league’s most prolific groups of pass-catchers, including his running backs and tight end. He has QB1 upside through Week 16. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Speaking of prolific pass catchers, the most consistent and reliable option through the air has been Achane. Often, we see strong receiving backs become PPR cheat codes through massive reception totals, but that’s not the case with Achane. I don’t have the updated Week 12 stats yet, but heading into the week, Achane ranked third in red-zone targets among running backs and first in red-zone touchdowns. Narrowing it down further, inside the 5-yard line, Achane led all running backs in targets. Those numbers should only improve after Achane caught two red-zone touchdowns today. In an ideal world, we want the reliability of a back with strong work on the ground, but 100 yards rushing truly isn’t necessary for Achane to reach his ceiling on a weekly basis. His rest-of-season schedule is running back-friendly and his work on the ground is adequate but will continue to be carried by his work through the air. The aforementioned red-zone stats for Achane include the weeks without Tagovailoa. With Tagovailoa, Achane has been an absolute machine. He’s matchup-proof and should be considered a weekly top-5 play. For all the brilliance Achane has shown since Tagovailoa’s return, we’ve seen only a modest improvement in production from Hill. From Weeks 3 through 7 without Tagovailoa, Hill averaged just 5.9 fantasy points per game. Since Tagovailoa’s return in Week 8, Hill has averaged 10.6 fantasy points. It’s an improvement, but it’s far from what we’ve come to expect. Some level of volatility is understandable, but we’re not even getting that. Hill’s best performance since Tagovailoa’s return came in Week 11 against Las Vegas, when he scored 15.6 fantasy points in half-PPR to finish as WR16. Essentially, we’re stuck with a middling floor and only the hope of WR2 upside. Because it’s Tyreek Hill, we can’t stop playing him. His talent is undeniable and a lingering hand injury could be impacting his performance. However, he’s now firmly in WR2 territory, and quite frankly his ranking there is sustained purely by name value. The upside exists in theory, but theory needs to translate into actual production. Waddle has been the opposite of Hill. While Hill has provided at least some level of a floor — albeit a low one — Waddle’s floor has been a basement, making him completely unstartable. After scoring 11 fantasy points in Week 1, Waddle failed to exceed five fantasy points for nine straight games. It didn’t matter who was at quarterback or what the matchup was; he simply couldn’t produce. Just when you were ready to give up, though, he delivered a massive boom game with 24.4 fantasy points in half-PPR this week. Waddle caught 8 of 9 targets for 144 yards and a touchdown, easily his best game of the season. Unfortunately, the production was left on a lot of fantasy benches as he was started in only 48% of leagues. This performance is encouraging, but it’s hard to trust it as the new norm for Waddle. We’re cautiously optimistic, but the reality remains: Waddle has shown zero floor all season. We can’t look to matchups to predict if Waddle will repeat because good matchups hadn’t yielded any positive results prior to this week. I’d like to see a low-end WR2 performance next week before declaring Waddle rehabilitated. Proceed with caution. I wrote about Smith in last week’s Make or Break column, highlighting the increased consistency in his targets and touchdowns as the key to his double-digit fantasy performances. This week, he delivered his second-best performance of the year, catching nine of 11 targets for 87 yards and a touchdown. Smith has now exceeded 19 fantasy points in the past two games and has become one of Tagovailoa's most reliable targets. Smith’s increased usage isn’t surprising. The Dolphins have struggled to find a tight end who fits Mike McDaniel’s system, and Smith seemed like the perfect one. He has truly ascended into the weapon we’ve been hoping for. With two solid weeks in a row, my confidence in Smith is growing. The schedule ahead is less favorable for tight ends, with San Francisco, the Jets and Houston all ranking in the top 10 for fewest fantasy points allowed to the position. However, given the volume Smith is seeing, he remains a clear top 10 weekly option."

The Chiefs rallied in the final two minutes to pick up a 30-27 win at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte on Sunday. Spencer Shrader, who is in for the injured Harrison Butker, kicked a 31-yard field goal as time expired to give them the narrow win. That pushed the Chiefs to 10-1 on the season, and brought them back after they dropped their first game of the year last week in Buffalo. CHIEFS WIN ON A LAST-SECOND FIELD GOAL!#KCvsCAR pic.twitter.com/OHMwGqbm4G — NFL (@NFL) November 24, 2024 Though they didn't get the win, the outing was easily the best of the season, if not his career, for Young. He was benched earlier this season after leading the team to an 0-2 start, but he regained the starting job after veteran backup Andy Dalton injured his thumb in a car crash last month. Young went 21-of-35 for 262 yards and a touchdown in the win, and kept them in it late against one of the best teams in the league. It's just the second time this season he's surpassed 200 passing yards in a single game, and it marked the second-highest output he's had in his career. Young's career-high came last December when he put up 312 yards in a loss to the Green Bay Packers. ""I thought he played his tail off, man,"" Mahomes said of Young, via the Charlotte Observer. ""He throws a really good football ... It's been cool to see him bounce back these last few weeks and play some great football, because I know he has it. I've seen it for a long time, and he gave us a scare today because he played his tail off."" The Chiefs, who were a step ahead nearly the entire day, looked like they were going to cruise to the win late in the fourth quarter. But a brutal pass interference call on safety Chamarri Conner, who ran into Adam Thielen in the end zone, set the Panthers up at the goal line. From there, Chuba Hubbard ran in an easy 1-yard touchdown to bring the Panthers back within two points.

After a pair of quick passes, he broke out a huge 33-yard run to suddenly get Kansas City into field goal range. That set up Shrader's final field goal and won the game for the Chiefs. MAHOMES. 33-YARD RUN.📺: #KCvsCAR on CBS/Paramount+📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/HbrtvTfb6n — NFL (@NFL) November 24, 2024 The Panthers offense struggled to do much of anything in the first half, and they entered the locker room at the break with just nine points off three field goals from Eddy Pineiro. The Chiefs jumped up to an 11-point lead at halftime after Mahomes hit Noah Gray for a pair of touchdowns — first a 35-yard toss on their opening drive of the game and then an 11-yard reception late in the second quarter. But Young led the Panthers on two critical touchdown drives in the second half, including one right away in the third quarter. That drive, a 15-play, 70-yard endeavor, ended with a 1-yard touchdown pass to David Moore. Mahomes went 27-of-37 for 269 yards with three touchdowns in the win for the Chiefs. He had 60 yards on five carries on the ground, too, just shy of Kareem Hunt's 68 rushing yards. Gray finished with 66 yards and two scores on just four catches. The Chiefs now have eight wins by a single score this season, which matches the NFL's record through a team's first 11 games. ""You want to have some blowouts,'' Mahomes said, via ESPN. ""You want be a little calmer in the fourth quarter. I've always said it can be a good thing as you get to the playoffs and later in the season, just knowing that you've been in those moments before and knowing how to kind of attack it. ""But I would love to win a game [before] the very last play.'' While Young didn't get the win in the end for the Panthers, Sunday's showing was still incredibly impressive for the former Alabama standout and Heisman Trophy winner. After losing his job just a few weeks ago, the Panthers now have reason to stick with Young to once again see if the 2023 No. 1 overall pick is part of their future. Whether he can keep that going into next week's matchup against the Las Vegas Raiders and for the rest of the season, however, remains to be seen."

The Bruins knocked off South Carolina, the defending national champion that had held the top spot in the previous 23 polls, with a dominant 77-62 victory that snapped UCLA’s 0-20 record against No. 1 teams. It came in front of a raucous, star-studded crowd, too. “I think the piece that really hits me is that we’re doing something for the first time in school history and we shared it with decades of alum,” UCLA coach Cori Close said as the poll was released. “It was great to have so many alumni in our locker room to share it with. The people that blazed the trail for us we’re walking in is really special.” UCLA, which was No. 5 in the poll last week, earned 20 first-place votes from the 32-member national media panel. UConn remained second, garnering nine first-place votes after a historic week of its own with coach Geno Auriemma setting the NCAA all-time victories record. Notre Dame, which pulled off its own upset over the weekend in Los Angeles by beating then-No. 3 USC, moved up to third. The Fighting Irish received the other three No. 1 votes in a week that saw only four teams remain in the same spots from last week’s poll. South Carolina dropped to fourth after its 43-game winning streak came to an end. Texas was fifth. USC fell to sixth with LSU, Oklahoma, Kansas State and Maryland finishing off the top 10. Iowa State dropped from eighth to 15th after a 12-point loss to Northern Iowa. The Bruins are the 26th different school to hold the No. 1 spot in the history of the women’s Top 25 that began in the 1976-77 season. “We came here saying we want to be an elite basketball program and to be in that company as the 26th program ever to be a No. 1 team is significant,” Close said. “I’m grateful.” Iowa entered the Top 25 for the first time this season jumping into the poll at No. 22. The Hawkeyes made it all the way up to No. 2 last season behind star guard Caitlin Clark, who is now flourishing in the WNBA. This year’s team is 6-0 and has used stellar defense to stay unbeaten so far, holding four of its six opponents to under 60 points. Baylor fell out of the poll after a loss to Indiana. Illinois moved up to No. 19 this week, the school’s best ranking since it was 13th on Jan. 17, 2000. With South Carolina’s loss, the Illini now have the longest active winning streak in the country with 10 consecutive victories. The team won the inaugural WBIT last season and is 5-0 this year. South Carolina had been No. 1 in 61 of the past 62 polls with the lone exception coming in the preseason Top 25 on Oct. 17, 2023, when then-defending champion LSU was the top choice. The Gamecocks then moved back up to No. 1 in the first regular season poll, climbing from No. 6, the biggest leap in the history of the poll to the top spot. The last time South Carolina was not No. 1 before that was March 15, 2021, the final poll that season. How good have the Gamecocks been recently? The loss to UCLA was the Gamecocks’ biggest margin of defeat since the 2019 Sweet 16 and the school’s first road loss since December 2021. Coach Dawn Staley says her team will get back to work. “Taking a loss will help us focus on anybody that we play,” she said."

With the win, the Packers improved to 8-3 to remain in full control of their path to the postseason. The 49ers dropped to 5-6 and in further peril of missing the playoffs for the first time since the 2020 season. The Packers picked up the win against a 49ers team missing multiple key starters including quarterback Brock Purdy (shoulder), All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams (ankle) and All-Pro pass rusher Nick Bosa (hip/oblique) were also among the 49ers' inactives. With Brandon Allen starting at quarterback for the 49ers, the Packers took early control and a 17-0 second-quarter lead as San Francisco managed to run just six offensive plays in the game's first 23:37. The 49ers put together their first successful drive of the day to cap the second quarter with a touchdown that raised hopes of a rally before they received the second-half kickoff. But Xavier McKinney snuffed out those hopes hopes with an interception of Allen midway through the third quarter. McKinney returned the ball 48 yards to the San Francisco 26-yard line to set the Packers up in scoring position.

A fourth-quarter fumble by Allen on a sack allowed the Packers to extend their lead again to 31-10 on Jacobs' third touchdown of the day. Jordan Love's touchdown pass to Malik Heath in the final five minutes punctuated the Packers' blowout in front of a jubilant Lambeau Field crowd. Injuries to the 49ers or not, it added up to a decisive win for a Packers team that's been on the upswing since a 2-2 start that included a knee injury to Love that was initially feared as potentially season-ending. Instead, Love missed just two games. Since Love's return, the Packers have gone 6-2 while producing a top-five offense. Sunday's win was a well-rounded effort as the Packers forced three turnovers and scored 38 points against one of the NFL's stronger defenses. Love finished the day completing 13 of 23 passes for 163 yards with two touchdowns and no turnovers. Jacobs added 106 yards and three touchdowns on 23 carries. Green Bay limited San Francisco's playmakers in an offense that struggled without Purdy under center. George Kittle was the most potent San Francisco weapon on the day with six catches for 82 yards. Deebo Samuel caught just one pass for 21 yards and had an 87-yard kickoff return to start the second half called back for a hold. Christian McCaffrey struggled again in his third game back from a calf/Achilles injury. He tallied 68 yards from scrimmage and averaged 2.8 yards on 11 carries. His fourth-quarter fumble set up Green Bay's final touchdown. Allen completed 17 of 29 passes for 199 yards with a touchdown, interception and lost fumble. It added up to another disappointing loss in a once-promising season that was partly derailed by McCaffrey's early injury. Now the 49ers sit at 5-6 and on the wrong side of the playoff picture with a remaining schedule that includes games against the Bills, Rams and Lions. They need a lot to go their way to sneak back into the playoff hunt. Purdy's status for next week's critical matchup against the Bills is unclear. The Packers remain behind the 10-1 Detroit Lions and 9-2 Minnesota Vikings in a loaded NFC North. But they're well ahead of the back of the NFC wild-card pack and in prime position to make the postseason."
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games","Bears' playoff hopes are gone, but at least Caleb Williams is just arriving",https://sports.yahoo.com/bears-playoff-hopes-are-gone-but-at-least-caleb-williams-is-just-arriving-001456771.html,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 00:14:56 GMT",Williams played his best game against one of the league's toughest defenses. Changes are coming to Chicago. The franchise QB is set.,"Getting walked down the field by Sam Darnold as overtime expires is a terrible way to lose, and the Chicago Bears endured that in Sunday's 30-27 overtime loss to the Minnesota Vikings. But the Bears got an incredible performance from their young franchise quarterback against one of the best defenses in the entire league. Caleb Williams made several big-time plays that showed off his poise, playmaking and overall talent that made him one of the more hyped quarterback prospects in recent memory. He gave the Bears a chance to win against one of the best teams in the NFL, which is all they ask for at this point as they continue to free fall down the NFC standings. ""You don’t want to be around people that are quitting, that are giving up,"" Williams said. ""That’s not the type of guys we have."" From an overall operation standpoint, this might have been the Bears’ best game of the season considering their opponent. The Vikings' defense led by the blitz-happy Brian Flores has given offenses hell all year, despite not having a superstar cast of characters on that side of the ball. It was easy to imagine that the Bears’ normally sloppy offense wouldn’t be up to the tall task in front of them, but they played very well. Interim offensive coordinator Thomas Brown had a great plan involving a heavy dose of screens to keep the Vikings at bay and give Williams better opportunities when they did rip it downfield. ""That’s a tough defense to go against, with the different looks and the pressures and variation of coverage, and I thought he did a really good job of finding the space as we talked about earlier in the week, and getting the ball to our skill,"" said Bears head coach Matt Eberflus. Williams threw two touchdowns, his first TD passes since the Bears’ London game against the Jaguars on Oct. 13, and Williams eclipsed 300 yards for the third time this season. He had several big-time throws downfield that looked like they were shot out of a cannon en route to his receivers, including a laser to get the Bears in field-goal range right before overtime started. This was a winning performance from the Bears’ offense, which was huge because that unit has been having an extremely tough go recently. DJ Moore had seven catches for 106 yards and a touchdown, while Keenan Allen had nine catches for 86 yards and a score. Cole Kmet and Rome Odunze chipped in as well. It wasn’t enough to get the win. ""I think we’ve gotten better over these past couple games,"" Williams said. ""I think today was a testament to that, being decisive, receivers and everybody, and things like that."" Unfortunately for Chicago, its defense wasn’t able to capitalize on multiple errant throws by Darnold and eventually allowed the Vikings' offense to have a very solid day. Chicago's run defense was leaky and the Bears were eventually carved up on the final drive of the game as they dropped to 4-7 on the season. This loss will likely close the door on whatever playoff hopes they had, but in terms of projecting success for the future, this was still a positive game for the Bears. There have been ups and downs for Williams this season, and the Bears have fallen short of the expectations that were set upon them in the offseason, but he has shown plenty of times that he has the talent to lead the Bears into the future. What games like this show is that the Bears have a path to sustainable offensive success, something that’s been foreign to this franchise for essentially the entirety of its existence. It might not happen this year, but with a (likely) new coaching staff next year, they should at least be feeling really good about their quarterback situation. Williams has the talent to be the guy for the Bears. ""I think the world of him,"" Vikings head coach Kevin O'Connell said. ""He just continues to get better and better. You can see it when he starts creating off schedule, and that change of direction and athleticism. We had him dead to rights a couple times and he gets out and makes huge plays."""

Coming in fresh off a  victory as the underdog, the Nuggets will stroll into this one as the favorite.  The Nuggets will head into Saturday's  contest on the come-up: they were handed a three-point  defeat in their last  matchup, but they sure didn't let that happen against the Lakers  on Saturday. The Nuggets blew past the Lakers 127-102. For those keeping track at home, that's the biggest  win Denver has posted  since November 2nd.  Nikola Jokic was  his usual excellent self,  dropping  a double-double on 34 points and 13  rebounds. His evening made it four games in a row in which  he has scored at least 30 points. Another player making a difference was  Michael Porter Jr., who  shot 4-for-7 from long range and  dropped  a double-double on 24 points and 11  rebounds.  The Nuggets were working as a unit and  finished the game with 37  assists (they're ranked first in  assists per game overall). The team's really been improving in that area: they've now improved their  assist total in three consecutive  games.  Meanwhile,  after a string of four wins, the Knicks' good fortune finally ran out  on Saturday. The  match between them and the Jazz wasn't a total blowout, but with the Knicks falling  121-106 on the road  it was darn close to turning into one. New York didn't live up to their potential and found themselves falling short of the advantage oddsmakers thought they had coming into the game.  Even though the team lost, they still had their share of impressive performances. One of the best came from  OG Anunoby, who  went 7 for 12 from beyond the arc en route to 27 points plus three  steals and two  blocks. Those seven  threes gave  him a new career-high.  Denver's victory bumped their record up to 9-6. As for New York, their loss dropped their record down to 9-7.  Monday's  matchup is shaping up to be a masterclass in shooting:  The Nuggets have been dynamite from deep this season,  having  made 39.6% of their  threes per game. However, it's not like the Knicks struggle in that department as   they've  drained 39% of their  threes this season. Given these competing strengths, it'll be interesting to see how their clash plays out.  The Nuggets were able to grind out a solid  win over the Knicks when the teams last played  back in March, winning  113-100. Do  the Nuggets have another victory up their sleeve, or will the Knicks turn the tables on them?  We'll have the answer soon enough.  Denver is a 4-point favorite against New York, according to the latest NBA odds. The oddsmakers had a good feel for the line for this one, as the game opened with the Nuggets as a 3-point favorite. The over/under is 232.5  points. See NBA picks for every single game, including this one, from SportsLine's advanced computer model. Get picks now.

The tournament, hosted annually by Woods, takes place Dec 5-8 at Albany Golf Club in the Bahamas. While there was a spot for him in the 20-man field, the 48-year-old has chosen to forgo what would have been his first competitive start since The Open and first since undergoing a sixth back surgery in September. ""The surgery went smoothly, and I'm hopeful this will help alleviate the back spasms and pain I was experiencing throughout most of the 2024 season,"" Woods said at the time. ""I look forward to tackling this rehab and preparing myself to get back to normal life activities, including golf."" In recent years, this has been the time during which Tiger has emerged from his hibernation. Playing with his son, Charlie, at the PNC Championship the last four years, Woods added a stop at the Hero World Challenge in 2023 as he eyed a busier playing schedule for the upcoming PGA Tour season. Playing in his event for the first time since 2019, the 15-time major champion put his game and physical endurance to the test. While Woods finished in 18th place with rounds of 75-70-71-72, he proved capable of walking 72 holes of tournament golf and appeared to get stronger as the week progressed. Unlike the PNC Championship where golf carts are permissible, the Hero World Challenge does not allow them. Woods believed playing once a month was a ""reasonable"" goal in 2024, but unfortunately, the ambitions were never met. He played in five sanctioned tournaments and saw the weekend once. After getting off to a solid start in his season debut at the Genesis Invitational, Woods withdrew from the tournament due to illness and back spasms during his second round. He was not seen again until the Masters where he made the cut for a record 24th consecutive time but ultimately finished last.  Missed cuts followed at the final three major championships of the season. Woods has played in just 10 official PGA Tour events since he was seriously injured and hospitalized following a single-car crash in February 2021. His last top-20 finish on the PGA Tour came at the 2020 Farmers Insurance Open just two starts after securing his 82nd career victory at the Zozo Championship that prior fall."
CBSSports.com Headlines,Warriors' Brandin Podziemski working through sophomore shooting slump: 'You do what's best for the team',https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/warriors-brandin-podziemski-working-through-sophomore-shooting-slump-you-do-whats-best-for-the-team/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 21:43:51 +0000",Podziemski has managed to impact winning despite shooting a jarring 18.5% from 3-point range so far,"Last fall, the Golden State Warriors got an early indication that Brandin Podziemski was no average rookie, and it had nothing to do with his basketball skills. The 6-foot-5 guard, playing in one of his first scrimmages with the team, yelled at Draymond Green -- yes, Draymond Green -- for committing a turnover that cost them the game. While some probably held their breath in anticipation of Green's reaction, the verbal lashing only elicited one feeling in the fiery 12-year veteran: Respect. ""Here we are playing a pick-up game, a game to get me ready [to return from injury] and he's yelling at me,"" Green told The Athletic. ""That, to me, said a whole lot. I was like, 'You know what? No problem. But make sure you speak up like that all the time.'""   Not a problem. Despite being just 21 years old and in his second NBA season, Podziemski has already become one of the vocal leaders on a team that features the venerated voices of Green and Stephen Curry. As his chestnut tendrils bob up and down above his headband while he dribbles down the floor, Podziemski confidently gesticulates and shouts toward teammates in order to get them organized. His role off the bench is partly why the Warriors have raced out to a 12-4 start, tied for the best record in the Western Conference. ""I think the biggest strides I've made is as a leader,"" Podziemski told CBS Sports. ""Being a point guard on the floor, guys -- no matter their age or their status in the league -- kind of look at you on the floor to know what's going on. And so, learning a lot from Steph and seeing how he went about things, learning a lot from Chris Paul last year and how he went about it, helped me now."" From the way he dealt with Green early in his career, to the way he answers questions, to simply the way he stands -- goateed chin held high and shoulders assertively back -- Podziemski exudes confidence well beyond his years. Last season, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr even went as far as to call him ""cocky,"" meant as the best compliment possible. But Podziemski's self-assured nature doesn't mean he thinks he's perfect. Far from it. And a good example is the smile he prominently displays when his team accomplishes something brilliant on the court. Podziemski is using Invisalign treatment to straighten out the teeth that, to him, could use some improvement. He had braces as a young man but they didn't quite do the trick. ""With anything that you want done for yourself, or things that you're doing, when you feel good, you're more confident,"" Podziemski told CBS Sports in an interview set up by Invisalign. ""And so, yeah, I'm a confident person, but there's always room for improvement."" Podziemski's smile may already be looking better, but he hasn't had much reason to display it on the court this season. An All-Rookie selection last year, he's shooting just 37% from the field and a jarring 18.5% from 3-point range, down 20% from his accuracy rate from deep as a rookie. Kerr has made headlines for playing 11- or 12-man rotations all season long, which means Podziemski's playing time has also been inconsistent. He's averaged 19 minutes over his last nine games, often playing in the 15-16 range. That's not much time to make an impact, especially if the shots aren't falling. Coming in and going 0-for-5 on 3s, as he did in a recent win over the New Orleans Pelicans, would test the confidence of even the most self-assured veteran, let alone a guard in his early 20s. But Podziemski has found a way to impact winning despite his dreadful early shooting numbers. He's averaged 7.2 points, 4.5 rebounds and 3.2 assists, and the Warriors are plus-60 in his minutes, which ranks fifth on the team. ""I think it's the maturity piece. You do what's best for the team,"" Podziemski told CBS Sports. ""You obviously have personal, individual goals that you want to live up to, just coming off the season I had last year. But I think an immature player would be, 'It's all about me, me, me, and it only works if I'm successful.' And I think through team success, individual success is a lot easier."" While many players of his age and talent would be playing 30-plus minutes per night on a losing team, Podziemski needs to make an impact in whatever time Kerr decides to put him on the floor. ""Obviously, 15-16 minutes, you want to play more, and that's just a given in competitive nature,"" Podziemski said. ""But if you're winning, you know, what is there to say? Right? You could argue that X, Y, Z should play more or play less, but if you're winning, I think that kind of takes care of a lot of problems, a lot of questions."" In terms of the poor shooting, Green recently issued a message to Podziemski through the media which essentially amounted to: who cares? To Green -- who has certainly struggled with his own jumper throughout his Hall of Fame career -- Podziemski does so many other important things on the court, that making shots is just a bonus and he needs to stop putting so much pressure on himself. ""If the one thing that you're struggling with is your shot, but you're doing five or six other things great, I think that will outweigh your shot,"" Green said of Podziemski's struggles. ""And he should appreciate that, lean into that. If he leans into that, the shots will fall."" Podziemski has also received advice from the greatest shooter to ever live, who happens to be a couple lockers down from him. Curry pointed to his own preseason shooting woes, and that he's been in the league long enough to know that eventually he'll get on a hot streak and the average will settle where it's supposed to be. Podziemski has taken that to heart and is focusing on ""the things I can control"" in order to help the Warriors maintain one of the best records in the league. And as far as the deep rotation, Podziemski sees it as a blessing in the long run, even if it means his minutes get cut down a bit. ""We all bring something different, and I think that's the difference between last year,"" Podziemski said. ""Last year, there's only so many lineup combinations he could throw out there, given what players bring, what they need around them to be successful. And I think now we have so many diverse pieces that can be plugged and played in so many different lineups that it makes it easier."""

CBSSports.com Headlines,"NBA injury updates: Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal, Ja Morant among stars set to return this week",https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-injury-updates-kevin-durant-bradley-beal-ja-morant-among-stars-set-to-return-this-week/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 21:25:41 +0000",The Western Conference is about to be a bit less banged-up,"Kristaps Porzingis of the Boston Celtics is not the only prominent NBA player who is about to get back on the floor. According to multiple reports on Monday, Memphis Grizzlies star Ja Morant is on the verge of returning, as are Dejounte Murray and CJ McCollum of the New Orleans Pelicans and Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal of the Phoenix Suns. Morant, who has missed Memphis' last eight games due to a right hip subluxation and pelvic muscle strain, will be in the lineup on Monday against the Portland Trail Blazers, according to Chris Haynes. The Grizzlies are 5-4 without Morant on the season, in part because of the emergence of guard Scotty Pippen Jr., who put up 30 points (on 13-for-16 shooting) and 10 assists in a 142-131 win against the Chicago Bulls on Saturday.  At 10-7 overall, Memphis is seventh in the West. Morant is officially listed as questionable against the Blazers as of Monday afternoon. Murray, who broke his left hand in the Pelicans' season opener, will miss his 17th straight game when they visit the Indiana Pacers on Monday. He will be in the lineup, though, when they host the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday, per Haynes. After starting the season with two consecutive wins, New Orleans has lost 13 of its last 15 games. At 4-13, the extremely banged-up Pelicans are dead last in the West. Before Murray comes back, they could get a boost in the backcourt from McCollum, who was upgraded to probable for the Pacers game. McCollum has missed New Orleans' last 13 games due to a strained right adductor. Star forward Zion Williamson (strained left hamstring), wing Herb Jones (strained right shoulder) and guard Jose Alvarado (strained left hamstring) remain out, and forward Brandon Ingram (sore right calf) is listed as questionable against Indiana. Durant strained his left calf on Nov. 8 against the Dallas Mavericks, and Beal suffered the same injury on Nov. 12 against the Utah Jazz. Both are expected to play on Tuesday against the Los Angeles Lakers. Suns coach Mike Budenholzer said Monday, via the Arizona Republic's Duane Rankin. Phoenix started the season 8-1, but it has gone 1-6 without Durant and 0-5 without both him and Beal. At 9-7, the Suns are eighth in the West. Phoenix hasn't played a game since last Wednesday, and it has officially listed both Durant and Beal as probable for the Lakers game. ""Bringing that extra firepower back to the team is going to help us a lot,"" forward Ryan Dunn said, via the Arizona Republic."

This is the third meeting between the two brothers, with John winning the first two, most notably defeating Jim Harbaugh's 49ers, 34-31, in Super Bowl 47. Both teams have appealing options in the NFL DFS player pool, including Derrick Henry, Zay Flowers, and J.K. Dobbins. Should you include either Lamar Jackson or Justin Herbert in NFL DFS lineups, or even find a way to roster both and fill NFL DFS picks with cheaper NFL DFS sleeper picks? Before locking in any NFL DFS picks on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel for Ravens vs. Chargers, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.  McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings. Last year, he won the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him is way up. Now, McClure has turned his attention to Chargers vs. Ravens on Monday Night Football and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. One of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for Monday Night Football is Chargers receiver Quentin Johnston. The second-year receiver has emerged as a reliable option for Justin Herbert in the passing attack as Johnston has a touchdown in each of the last three games. Although he only had two receptions last week, Johnston generated eight targets and finished with 48 yards and a score, two weeks after having four receptions for 118 yards and a touchdown. The Chargers love to run the ball nearly as much as any team in the league with the sixth-highest rush percentage (48.8%). But the way to attack the Baltimore defense is through the air and a coach like Jim Harbaugh knows that and will likely develop his game plan that way. The Ravens are allowing the fewest yards per rush and second fewest rushing yards per game this season but are allowing the most passing yards (284.5 per game) this year. With  Johnston emerging as one of Herbert's most reliable options, he's a strong play for McClure in MNF NFL DFS lineups. See who else to target here. Part of McClure's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Chargers tight end Will Dissly. This is Dissly's seventh season in the NFL, but he has already outperformed his previous six campaigns in Seattle. He has been a reliable safety valve for quarterback Justin Herbert, catching 37 passes on 48 targets for 352 yards and a touchdown.  Dissly has been targeted at least six times in four of his last five games, finishing with 80 yards and his first touchdown of the season last week against Cincinnati. He is facing a Baltimore defense that has struggled to defend opposing tight ends this season, and the Ravens could be without linebacker Roquan Smith (questionable, hamstring). Dissly is a cheap way to add value to your NFL DFS lineups on Sunday night. See who else McClure likes right here.  McClure is also targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Monday Night Football. This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine. So who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for Monday Night Football, and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out."

The AI PickBot notes that Flowers has gone under his total receiving yards prop in eight of his last 12 games in which the Ravens were favored against teams with winning records. Flowers is an electric playmaker with five games on the season in which he has recorded 90 receiving yards or more. However, his size keeps him from dominating on the outside and he is regularly schemed out of games, either because the Ravens have committed to the run or because the opposing defense is gumming up the middle of the field, taking away his chances to catch the ball in space. Flowers has had six games this season in which he has failed to record 40 receiving yards. See more NFL props here.

However, the Giants instead parted ways with their former No. 6 overall pick immediately.  On Friday, the Giants announced that Jones had asked for his release, and that the team would grant Jones his request. Jones officially headed to waivers Saturday, and cleared waivers on Monday. He is officially an unrestricted free agent and can sign with any team. Giants president John Mara released a statement on his former quarterback: ""Daniel came to see me this morning and asked if we would release him. We mutually agreed that would be best for him and for the team. Daniel has been a great representative of our organization, first class in every way. His handling of this situation yesterday exemplifies just that. We are all disappointed in how things have worked out. We hold Daniel in high regard and have a great appreciation for him. We wish him nothing but the best in the future."" Jones broke his silence on his benching less than 24 hours before his release, saying it was an honor to play for this franchise, while taking responsibility for the fact that there were more lows than highs over the past six years. ""The opportunity to play for the New York Giants was truly a dream come true and I am extremely grateful ... for the chance to play here,"" Jones said. ""The Giants are truly a first class organization and I have nothing but genuine respect and appreciation for the people who built it and who help carry on the tradition. I met so many specialty people and created relationships that will truly last a lifetime. Thank you all my teammates, coaches and staff that have done so much for me these past six years. There have been some great times, but of course we all wish there had been more of those.""  The reason the Giants were keeping Jones on roster until this offseason (and why they benched him in the first place) had to do with money. As Spotrac points out, this decision to part ways with Jones now and put this entire saga behind them leaves the Giants with dead cap hits of $47.1 million in 2024 and $22.1 million in 2025. But the Giants do free up $19.4 million in cap space for next year. Overall, there was not much difference in releasing Jones now compared to releasing him the day after the Super Bowl. But if Jones was released with a post-June 1 designation, NFL Media reported that the Giants would carry $11.1 million dead cap hits in 2025 and 2026 and save $30.5 million in 2025. Prior to Friday, that was the expected outcome -- since the Giants could spread the dead money over two years. From a business standpoint, releasing Jones right now is not the ideal move as it pertains to the 2025 salary cap, but the organization wanted to do right by Jones.  Jones' fall over the past five days was a dramatic one. He went 2-8 as the starter this year, and completed 63.3% of his passes for 2,070 yards, eight touchdowns and seven interceptions. It was clear the Giants made the decision to bench Jones to protect themselves from the $23 million injury guarantee in his contract, but general manager Joe Schoen maintained it was a ""football decision."" Jones was demoted from QB1 to QB3/QB4 to ensure he wouldn't see the field, which was a storyline in itself, and then he was spotted playing scout team safety at practice, which led to criticisms on social media. The Giants may have had enough of the negative headlines, but this decision also allows Jones to move on with his career. After he clears waivers, Jones will be free to sign with any team."

After one quarter, neither  squad has the  contest in the bag, but Illinois State leads  29-27 over George Wash.  If Illinois State keeps playing like this, they'll bump their record up to 5-2 in no time. On the other hand, George Wash. will have to make due with  a  5-2 record unless they turn things around (and fast).  Illinois State Redbirds @ George Wash. Revolutionaries Current Records: Illinois State 4-2, George Wash. 5-1  The Illinois State Redbirds' road trip will continue as they head out to face the George Wash. Revolutionaries at 3:00  p.m.  ET on Monday at Virgin Islands Sport & Fitness Center. The Redbirds pulled off an upset win in their last outing, and are hoping to pull that off once more against the  1.5-point favorite Revolutionaries.  Illinois State's offense and defense might be a bit winded after their high-scoring matchup with UAB  on Saturday. Illinois State skirted by UAB 84-83 thanks to a clutch  free throw from  Johnny Kinziger with 5 seconds left in the second quarter.  Illinois State got their  win on the backs of several key players, but it was  Kinziger out in front who  went 8 for 12 en route to 21 points plus two  steals. The team also got some help courtesy of  Chase Walker, who  went 5 for 7 en route to 16 points plus eight  rebounds.  Meanwhile, George Wash. beat Louisiana 83-74  on Saturday.  George Wash.'s success was the result of a balanced attack that saw several players step up, but  Darren Buchanan Jr. led the charge by  dropping  a double-double on 17 points and ten  rebounds. Buchanan Jr. had some trouble finding  his footing against Kansas State on Friday, so this was a step in the right direction. Trey Autry was another key player,  earning 16 points.  Illinois State's victory bumped their record up to 4-2. As for George Wash., their win bumped their record up to 5-1.  Some high-performance offense is likely on the agenda as  both  are some of the highest scoring teams in the league. Illinois State hasn't had any problem running up the score this season,  having  averaged 81 points per game. However, it's not like George Wash. struggles in that department as   they've been averaging 80.2. With both teams so easily able to put up points, the only question left is who can run the score up higher.  Not only did both teams in this  Monday's  game win their last matches, they also took care of their bettors and covered the spread. Looking forward, George Wash. is expected to win a tight contest, barring any buzzer beaters. Illinois State might be worth a quick bet   since they're sitting on a four game streak of covering the spread when  playing as the underdog.  George Wash. is a slight 1.5-point favorite against Illinois State, according to the latest college basketball odds. The oddsmakers were right in line with the betting community on this one, as the game opened as a 1.5-point spread, and stayed right there. The over/under is 149.5  points.

Sitting on a score of  33-32, Alabama A&M has looked like the better team, but there's still one more half to play.  If Alabama A&M keeps playing like this, they'll bump their record up to 5-3 in no time. On the other hand, IUI will have to make due with  a  2-6 record unless they turn things around (and fast).  IUI Jaguars @ Alabama A&M Bulldogs Current Records: IUI 2-5, Alabama A&M 4-3  The Alabama A&M Bulldogs will face off against the IUI Jaguars at 3:00  p.m.  ET on Monday at Alabama A&M Events Center. Coming in fresh off a  victory as the underdog, the Bulldogs will stroll into this one as the favorite.  Having struggled with three  defeats in a row, Alabama A&M finally turned things around against Coastal Carolina  on Saturday. They came out on top against the Chanticleers by a score of  77-70.  Meanwhile, IUI's recent rough patch got a bit rougher  on Saturday after their fourth straight  loss. They took  a  72-62 hit to the loss column at the hands of SC State. The Jaguars didn't live up to their potential and found themselves falling short of the advantage oddsmakers thought they had coming into the game.  Alabama A&M now  has a winning record of 4-3. As for IUI, their defeat dropped their record down to 2-5.  Rebounding is likely to be a big factor in this contest:  Alabama A&M has been smashing the glass this season,  having  averaged 41.1  rebounds per game. However, it's not like IUI struggles in that department as   they've been averaging 37.9. With both teams battling to corral missed shots, we'll see if one team can grab an edge.  Alabama A&M is a 4-point favorite against IUI, according to the latest college basketball odds.

Their road trip will continue as they head out to face the Memphis Grizzlies at 8:00  p.m.  ET at FedExForum. Both come into the  matchup bolstered by wins in their previous  matches.  The Trail Blazers are headed into this one after the oddsmakers set last week's over/under low at 225.5, but even that wound up being too high. They snuck past the Rockets with  a  104-98 win on Saturday.  The Trail Blazers  smashed the offensive glass and  finished the game with 16  offensive rebounds (they're ranked third in  offensive rebounds per game overall). That strong performance was nothing new for the team: they've now  pulled down at least ten  offensive rebounds in 26 consecutive  contests  dating back to last season.  Meanwhile,  winning is always nice, but doing so behind a season-high score is even better  (just ask the Grizzlies). They walked away with  a   142-131  victory over the Bulls  on Saturday. Memphis' season wasn't pretty last year but it's starting to look like struggles are in the rearview.  The Grizzlies' win was a true team effort, with many players turning in solid performances. Perhaps the best among them was   Scotty Pippen Jr., who  dropped  a double-double on 30 points and ten  assists. The dominant performance also gave  Pippen Jr. a new career-high in  field goal percentage (81.3%). Another player making a difference was  Jaylen Wells, who  went 6 for 10 from beyond the arc en route to 26 points plus six  assists.  Portland's victory  ended  a  four-game drought on the road  and  puts them at 7-10. As for Memphis, they are  on a roll lately: they've  won three of their last four matches,  which provided a nice bump to their 10-7 record  this season.  Not only did both teams in this  Monday's  game win their last matches, they also took care of their bettors and covered the spread. Looking ahead, the Grizzlies are probably looking forward to this one considering their 10 advantage in the spread. This contest  will be Portland's 11th straight  as the underdogs (so far over this stretch they are 6-4 against the spread).  The Trail Blazers were pulverized by the Grizzlies 134-89 in their previous matchup  two weeks ago. That  matchup was pretty much over by halftime, at which point the Trail Blazers were down  64-44.  Memphis is a big 10-point favorite against Portland, according to the latest NBA odds. The line has drifted a bit towards the Grizzlies, as the game opened with the Grizzlies as a 8-point favorite.

Each of these two teams is coming off a wild game against an AFC North opponent, with the Chargers blowing a big lead and then managing to win anyway against the Bengals, and the Ravens seeing their comeback attempt against the Steelers fall short after missing on a two-point conversion.  They each currently occupy an AFC wild card spot, with the Chargers a half-game ahead at 7-3 while the Ravens are 7-4. The AFC race is incredibly close among the seven teams currently in playoff position, so this game carries some massive seeding implications. Which of these AFC playoff contenders will secure a much-needed victory? We'll find out soon enough. Before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game. Date: Monday, Nov. 25 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: SoFi Stadium (Inglewood, California)Channel: ESPN | Stream: fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports App   Betting odds: Ravens -2.5; O/U 51 (via Caesars Sportsbook)Check out the latest Caesars promo code to get in the game. It was a struggle for Baltimore against the Steelers last week, starting with Derrick Henry's fumble on the opening drive of the game. They ended the game with three turnovers, and having scored on just two of their 12 drives before getting a late touchdown in the hurry-up offense. This from a team that had produced a touchdown or field goal on more than half of its drives through the first 10 weeks of the year. For much of this season, the Chargers have been the same type of defensive unit. They have allowed the league's lowest touchdown-or-field-goal rate on opponent drives, yielding a score only 25% of the time. But when you take a look at L.A.'s schedule, you can see some holes in that number. The Chargers played the Raiders, Panthers, Steelers (with Justin Fields), Chiefs, Broncos (before Bo Nix started playing well), Cardinals, Saints, Browns and Titans before lost week's game against the Bengals. Prior to Cincinnati putting up 27 last weekend, nobody had scored more than 20 -- and only the Steelers had even reached that number. Through the first half against the Bengals last week, it was more of the same. But after halftime ... the Bengals gained 274 yards on 32 plays, hanging 20 points on the board and creating several explosive plays. They did it mostly by spreading the field and letting Joe Burrow go to work. Burrow went 17 of 27 for 261 yards and three scores after the break, ripping off eight completions of 10-plus yards and three of 20 or more. And this was despite being pressured on 50% of his dropbacks, per Tru Media. We've seen the Ravens do similar things in the passing game for most of this season. Lamar Jackson still leads the NFL in both yards per attempt, touchdown rate and passer rating, with a career-high passing success rate and a completion percentage just 0.2% off his career-best mark set last year. Of course, Jackson has again been arguably the NFL's most effective scrambler, running away from pressure 24.4% of the time and gaining 7.6 yards per scramble. The Chargers have been one of the league's worst defenses against scrambling quarterbacks, allowing 9.9 yards per scramble, which ranks 30th in the league. The Chargers also play an absolute ton of zone coverage, which Jackson has torn apart throughout this season. The distance between his 0.38 EPA per dropback against zone and Jayden Daniels and Baker Mayfield in second place (0.22) is equal to the distance between those two and Jalen Hurts in 16th (0.06).  In the run game, L.A. has allowed the league's fewest rushing touchdowns (three), but the Chargers are just 24th in yards allowed per carry. They have one of the league's worst missed-tackle rates on running plays, which is less than ideal against a team with Jackson and Derrick Henry. The Chargers have stopped only 16.2% of opponent runs at or behind the line of scrimmage, via Tru Media, and have allowed a gain of five-plus yards 37.9% of the time. That's a recipe for a very good rushing performance from the Ravens, and we should expect them to press that advantage. We know what we're getting on this side of the ball. Absolutely nobody can run on the Ravens, and absolutely anybody can throw on them.  The Ravens rank second in EPA per play against the run and 31st against the pass, according to Tru Media. They have allowed just 3.4 yards per carry, the best mark in the NFL. And they've allowed 7.7 yards per pass attempt, which ranks 27th. Opponents have gained 12 or more yards on just 4% of their rushing attempts, which is not only the best mark in the league but is also less than half of the 8.5% NFL average. Meanwhile, 10.2% of opponent passing attempts have turned into 20-plus-yard gains, which ranks as the fourth-worst mark in football. So, we should not expect this to be a big game for J.K. Dobbins or Gus Edwards, or whomever else the Chargers decide to put in the backfield. Instead, things will rest almost entirely on the right shoulder of Justin Herbert, and on his pass-catching corps of Ladd McConkey, Quentin Johnston, Joshua Palmer and Will Dissly. Herbert looked fantastic early in the game against the Bengals last week, then went through a protracted lull for much of the middle of the game, only to make up for it with consecutive lasers on the team's late, game-winning drive. He ended the evening 17 of 36, but for 297 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also had another one of his best rushing games of the season, totaling 65 yards on his five carries. He has been a low-volume passer throughout this season, averaging just 27.7 pass attempts per game after averaging 39.1 through his first four NFL seasons. He has just 13 touchdown passes in 10 games, but he's averaging a career-best 7.9 yards per attempt, with a career-best 102.1 passer rating and a league-best 0.4% interception rate.  Baltimore's defensive backfield seemingly has the talent to handle this passing attack, with Marlon Humphrey, Brandon Stephens, Ar'Darius Washington, Kyle Hamilton and Marcus Williams. But that's been true all season and it has simply not happened for the Ravens to date. Add in Roquan Smith's uncharacteristic (relative) struggles in coverage and Trenton Simpson's weaknesses in that area, and there should be plenty of openings for Herbert to find downfield. Prediction: Ravens 27, Chargers 24 Both of these teams should be able to find success offensively. Before struggling against Pittsburgh last week, the last time the Ravens faced a pass defense that had been smothering everybody in the NFL, they came out and tore up the Denver Broncos and hung 41 points on the board. We saw last week against Cincinnati that the Chargers defense does have some leaks, and we expect Lamar Jackson to find them. Bonus: Mike Tierney, who is on a 52-22-2 roll on Ravens games, has released his best bets for the Week 12 Ravens vs. Chargers matchup. Tierney is leaning the Under total, but who is he backing to cover? Find out right here at SportsLine."

Pitre will be out for multiple weeks, though the exact timetable for his return is not yet known. Per NFL Media's reporting, Pitre will not undergo surgery as of now, and a return later this season is on the table. Houston's second-round pick in 2022, Pitre has played and started 44 games across his three NFL seasons. He has 65 tackles (six for loss), eight pass breakups and an interception so far this year, and has been on the field for 87% of Houston's defensive snaps. He exited Sunday's game after playing just 21 snaps and was replaced in the lineup with extra snaps for Eric Murray and Jimmie Ward. Pitre was spending a significant amount of time in the slot this season, aligning there for 267 coverage snaps, per Pro Football Focus. The Texans will need someone else to assume that role, with Ward being one of the primary candidates to do so.  The Texans remain in first place in the AFC South despite the loss to Tennessee, the team's fifth in its last seven games. They have another divisional matchup in Week 13, against the Titans, before taking their bye and finishing up with games against the Dolphins, Chiefs, Ravens and Titans again. If Pitre can make it back onto the field, he would be a key piece in any potential playoff run. Considering the relative struggles of the team's offense, having the defense playing at full strength is of utmost importance, and that just got a bit more difficult."

This is a Bruins program that missed the NCAA Tournament two years ago but has been trending upward, and now has one of the nation's deepest rosters. ""We have a lot of great, versatile players,"" UCLA coach Cori Close said after Sunday's win. ""... We wouldn't have this if we didn't have selflessness and elite work ethic. This is my 32nd season in Division I coaching, and I've never had a team that works extra more than this team."" As South Carolina coach Dawn Staley pointed out after the Bruins handed the Gamecocks a 77-62 loss, any team's scouting report starts with 6-foot-7 center Lauren Betts. In the first five games of the season, Betts is averaging 19.4 points and 12 rebounds per game, while collecting a total of 13 blocks. But the team doesn't just rely on her when it comes to scoring, as six Bruins are averaging at least nine points per game this season. ""We have so many weapons on this team, and our bench is just so deep,"" Betts said. ""Everyone's ready when their numbers called to go out there and make a difference in the game… And it doesn't matter who's scoring the most points at the end of the day -- we all just want to win."" The Bruins also showed they can play lockdown defense, which was on full display against South Carolina. The Gamecocks' 62 points marked their fewest scored since they tallied 59 in the Sweet 16 of the 2023 NCAA tournament -- against UCLA, coincidentally.  Londynn Jones with some really strong on-ball defense, and Lauren Betts cleans up with another block down low pic.twitter.com/oNMKPH83q8 UCLA came into the 2024-25 campaign with high expectations because of key returners including Betts, Kiki Rice, Gabriela Jaquez, Angela Dugalic and Londynn Jones. The start of the season saw a couple of those players in and out of the lineup, but the Bruins have managed it well.  Jaquez missed the Colgate game on Nov. 10 because of a minor foot injury, but she is back on the court averaging nine points and 5.3 rebounds per game. Dugalic, who missed two games while representing Serbia in a FIBA Women's EuroBasket qualifiers, is one of the team's top rebounders along with Betts and Texas A&M transfer Janiah Barker. Despite Jones not being in the starting lineup against South Carolina, she scored a team-high 15 points while going a perfect 5 of 5 from beyond the arc. In February, Jones had a career night against Utah while making seven 3-pointers. Londynn Jones today 🔥• 15 points • 5/5 3PMUCLA BEATS SOUTH CAROLINA! pic.twitter.com/i06jDvoMsi Jones said she works on 3-point shooting every day, but she is not the only player who stands out in that area for the Bruins. Oregon State transfer Timea Gardiner, who's averaging 3.2 3-pointers per game while shooting 51.6% from distance, is also a big threat from deep. Rice has only played two games this season because of an injury, but her absence actually led to the team to discover a powerful weapon in freshman Elina Aarnisalo, who filled in for Rice during her absence. Aarnisalo is the Bruins' second-leading scorer with 12.6 points per game on 57.8% shooting, and she has a team-high 34 assists.  ""She's incredible and I will keep hyping her up,"" Betts said of Aarnisalo. ""Just the skill set that she has at her age, and to come in and start from the very beginning of the season. And obviously Kiki being out, she wasn't expecting that, but she kind of took on that role and just went for it.  ""She's just never intimidated by anybody… She's going through people like it's nothing. I'm like, 'Dang, it's crazy,' but she's so skilled and I'm just really proud of her."" Lauren Betts said UCLA has been underrated this season, so I asked her who is the most underrated player for the Bruins. Her answer? Freshman Elina Aarnisalo. pic.twitter.com/IEOfYmzVSf Aarnisalo and Rice were both in the starting lineup against the Gamecocks, which Close partly attributed to how the freshman has been impacting the team. Aarnisalo had 20 assists and just one turnover in the previous two games, with Close describing her as ""mature beyond her years."" As for Rice, the team got better upon her return.  ""She's just a super calm presence on the court and I just trust her with the ball in her hands,"" Betts said. ""She's gonna make the right decision a lot of the time. So for me it's just like, 'OK, we got Kiki back. Let's go. We're back to how it should be.' … she really is the rock of our team, so I'm just so happy to have her back."" The Bruins could be adding even more depth later this season when Washington State transfer guard Charlisse Leger-Walker returns from a torn ACL she suffered on Jan. 28. UCLA is definitely in a good spot, but Close has made it clear she doesn't want her team to get too caught up in the hype. ""Lauren said on TV that we were underrated and if you were sleeping on us, you better stop. But I'm like, 'Sleep away,'"" Close said. ""I think teams that fall in love with what other people define them as, they lose opportunities to get better."" Betts agreed with Close and said her team is very focused on a specific goal. ""We know what we want to do at the end of the season: we want to win a national championship,"" Betts said. ""But I'm just taking each practice as preparation and keeping those same habits every single day so we can get to that point."""

They and the Los Angeles Clippers will face off  at 7:30  p.m.  ET at TD Garden without much rest after finishing up games yesterday. Each of these teams will be battling to keep a five-game winning streak alive.  The Celtics are headed into this one after the oddsmakers set last week's over/under low at 222, but even that wound up being too high. They skirted past the Timberwolves  107-105. The 107-point effort marked Boston's lowest-scoring  contest of the season, but in the end it didn't matter.  Multiple players turned in solid performances to lead the Celtics to victory, but perhaps none more so than   Jaylen Brown, who  went 7 for 10 from beyond the arc en route to 29 points. What's more,  Brown also posted a 70%  three-point shooting accuracy, which is the highest he's  posted since back in March.  Meanwhile, the Clippers posted their biggest  victory since April 5th on Sunday. They put the hurt on the 76ers with a sharp  125-99 win. Los Angeles pushed the score to  97-72 by the end of the third, a deficit Philadelphia had  little chance of recovering from.  The Clippers' win  was the result of several impressive offensive performances. One of the most notable came from   James Harden, who  scored 23 points along with eight  assists.  The Clippers were working as a unit and  finished the game with 31  assists. They easily outclassed their opponents in that department as the 76ers only posted 22.  Boston has  been performing  incredibly well recently as they've  won seven of their last eight matches,  which provided a nice bump to their 14-3 record  this season. As for Los Angeles, their victory  ended  a  three-game drought on the road  and  puts them at 11-7.  Monday's  game is shaping up to be a scrappy  matchup:  The Celtics haven't given up the ball easily this season,  having  only  averaged 11.4  turnovers per game (they're ranked third in  turnovers per game overall). It's a different story for the Clippers, though, as  they've been averaging 15.7. Given the Celtics' sizable advantage in that area, the Clippers will need to find a way to close that gap.  The Celtics might still be hurting after the devastating  115-96 loss they got from the Clippers  in their previous meeting  back in January. Can the Celtics avenge their  defeat or is history doomed to repeat itself? We'll find out soon enough.  Boston is a big 9.5-point favorite against Los Angeles, according to the latest NBA odds. The line on this game has moved quite a bit since it opened, as it started out with the Celtics as a 5-point favorite. The over/under is 218.5  points.

The Mavericks are expected to lose this one by 3.5  points, so we'll see if that gives them a bit of motivation.  The Mavericks fought the good fight in their overtime  matchup against the Heat  on Sunday but wound up with a less-than-desirable result. They took  a  123-118 hit to the loss column at the hands of Miami. Dallas' loss signaled the end of their four-game winning streak.  Even though they lost, the Mavericks  smashed the offensive glass and  finished the game with 15  offensive rebounds. That strong performance was nothing new for the team: they've now  pulled down at least 11  offensive rebounds in six consecutive  contests.  Meanwhile,  the point spread  may have favored the Hawks  last Friday, but the final result did not. The  match between them and the Bulls wasn't a total blowout, but with the Hawks falling  136-122 on the road  it was darn close to turning into one. Atlanta hasn't had much luck with Chicago recently, as the team's come up short the last two times they've met.  Despite their  defeat, the Hawks saw several players rise to the challenge and make noteworthy plays.  Trae Young, who  dropped  a double-double on 25 points and 13  assists, was perhaps the best of all. Young had some trouble finding  his footing against the Warriors on Wednesday, so this was a step in the right direction. Another player making a difference was  Jalen Johnson, who  dropped  a double-double on 25 points and 13  rebounds.  Dallas' loss dropped their record down to 9-8. As for Atlanta, their defeat dropped their record down to 7-10.  Monday's  game is shaping up to be a scrappy  matchup:  The Mavericks haven't given up the ball easily this season,  having  only  averaged 12.5  turnovers per game. It's a different story for the Hawks, though, as  they've been averaging 15.5. Given the Mavericks' sizable advantage in that area, the Hawks will need to find a way to close that gap.  The Mavericks strolled past the Hawks when the teams last played  back in April by a score of  109-95. The rematch might be a little tougher for the Mavericks since the  squad won't have the home-court advantage this time around. We'll see if the change in venue makes a difference.  Atlanta is a 3.5-point favorite against Dallas, according to the latest NBA odds. The line has drifted a bit towards the Hawks, as the game opened with the Hawks as a 1-point favorite. The over/under is 237.5  points. See NBA picks for every single game, including this one, from SportsLine's advanced computer model. Get picks now.

CBSSports.com Headlines,Eagles' Saquon Barkley thought he tempted fate by looking at this one statistic before record-setting run,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/eagles-saquon-barkley-thought-he-tempted-fate-by-looking-at-this-one-statistic-before-record-setting-run/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 20:16:06 +0000",Barkley looked at the scoreboard prior to his record-setting run,"Saquon Barkley passed up an opportunity at setting a career high in rushing yards earlier this season. The Philadelphia Eagles weren't going to let Barkley off the hook this time.  The Eagles were leading 30-14 with 5:13 left in the fourth quarter, looking to run out the clock in the four-minute offense. With the game a score away from being in hand, Barkley was at 22 carries. Philadelphia could have taken Barkley off the field in favor of Kenneth Gainwell, but Barkley already had 22 carries for 173 yards (7.9 yards per carry).  Barkley isn't one to look at his numbers during a game, but fate tempted him in this instance.  ""I'm not going to lie. I looked up and I saw I was at 173, and I said, 'Ah man, I wish I never saw that,'"" Barkley smiled after Sunday's win, via a team transcript. ""It worked."" Barkley had three carries for 10 yards before breaking off for his 72-yard touchdown run to seal the eventual 37-20 victory. He finished with 26 carries for 255 yards and two touchdowns.  Not only did Barkley set the Eagles' single-game record for rushing yards (255) and yards from scrimmage (302), he became the first player to have two 70-yard rushing touchdowns in the second half of a football game. Barkley didn't jinx his career night by looking up at the scoreboard.  ""I'm a big believer in if it happens, it happens, and let it come to you,"" Barkley said. ""It was 4-minute (offense). We were trying to put the game away, so I did look up one time to see a replay of the run, and I saw where I was at, and I literally said to myself, 'I wish I never saw that.'  ""That's just the devil talking. That's how I look at it. Just kept my head down, trusting the system and we popped the long one."""

Peters' letter is the latest development in what's become a contentious situation between the local government and the team concerning the proposal to build a new ballpark in the area over the coming years. Peters' letter requests that the Rays provide a notice of termination by Sunday if they don't intend to continue down this road. Team owner Stuart Sternberg told The Times last week that repeated delays in funding approval ""sent a clear message that we had lost the county as a partner,"" and team presidents Brian Auld and Matt Silverman followed with a letter saying that the Rays ""stand ready to work on a new solution with any and all willing partners."" The delays, Auld and Silverman said, have made it impossible to expect the new stadium to be ready for the 2028 season as planned. ""Pinellas County has operated in good faith, working toward the stadium deal while balancing the needs of our community after back-to-back hurricanes,"" Peters wrote. ""If the Rays want out of this agreement, it is your right to terminate the contract. Clear communication about your intentions will be critical to the next steps in this partnership."" Auld has since issued a statement that reads: ""We are eager to work with all partners on a solution for the 2029 season that keeps Major League Baseball in Tampa Bay for generations to come. As we always have, we will maintain contact with the city and county as we navigate our future."" Plans for the $1.3 billion stadium included a capacity of 30,000 for baseball and a sloped roof, much like the existent Tropicana Stadium. Larger plans for the surrounding Gas Plant district included 5,400 residential units, 750 hotel rooms, 1.4 million square feet of office and medical space, 750,000 square feet of retail space, a new Woodson African American Museum of Florida, a concert/entertainment venue of 4,000 to 6,000 seats and 14 acres of green space, according to the team. Just last week, the County Commission elected to delay a vote on the public funding aspect of the Rays' proposal until Dec. 17. The St. Petersburg City Council, meanwhile, originally voted to authorize more than $23 million to repair the Tropicana Field domed roof, shredded during October's Hurricane Milton. The City Council subsequently changed course, voting against that action. (The Rays will play their 2025 home games at Steinbrenner Field, the spring training home of the New York Yankees, as well as the home of the Yankees' A-ball affiliate.) The Rays, predictably, have resumed partaking in their favorite exercise: saber-rattling about relocation. Team co-president Auld, no stranger to threatening to walk, told reporters last Thursday that there is no longer a deal on the table.  As such, it's unclear precisely what the future holds for the Rays -- in St. Petersburg and overall."

Minshew left the game in the fourth quarter after going down awkwardly on his left shoulder. He remained on the turf while trainers attended to him, but eventually walked off under his own power. Minshew completed 25 of 42 passes for 230 yards, one touchdown and one interception before exiting the contest.

He was signed to the active roster from the Arizona Cardinals practice squad just last month after the Raiders lost fellow quarterback Aidan O'Connell to a thumb injury. However, O'Connell is eligible to return this week if healthy enough to play.  Pierce said that they will have to rely on doctors regarding if O'Connell will be able to start this week or not, per NFL Media. It may come down to if he can grip the football.  Minshew went 2-7 as the starter this season, and entered Week 12 with 1,783 passing yards, eight touchdowns and nine interceptions. He had been playing some of his best ball recently, as Minshew threw five touchdowns compared to two interceptions over the past four contests.  Unfortunately things don't get much easier for the Raiders. Not only are they on a short week, but they will have to travel to Kansas City to take on the reigning Super Bowl champion Chiefs on Black Friday."
CBSSports.com Headlines,Cooper Flagg Tracker: Duke star freshman putting up big numbers heading into showdown vs. No. 1 Kansas,https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/cooper-flagg-tracker-duke-star-freshman-putting-up-big-numbers-heading-into-showdown-vs-no-1-kansas/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 20:03:48 +0000",Flagg has been nothing short of exceptional five games into his young Duke tenure,"On Friday night in Tucson, Arizona, No. 12 Duke went into the hornet's nest that is the McKale Center and won convincingly 69-55 over a talented No. 17 Arizona team that has been nearly automatic on its home floor under coach Tommy Lloyd. The schematic explanation for how they did so includes forcing turnovers, making big 3s and creating extra opportunities, but the simple explanation boils down to two words. Cooper Flagg. Duke's freshman phenom was sensation in the win with 24 points, six rebounds, three assists, two blocks and a steal in yet another stat-sheet stuffing showing. The No. 1 recruit has been the No. 1 option for Duke and one of the best players in college basketball right away, and it's shown in the box score, where he now leads Duke in every major statistical category, as Global Scouting noted over the weekend -- making him the only currently Div. I player to be doing so right now.  Cooper Flagg currently leads the Duke Blue Devils in every major statistical category.— 17.8 PPG (1st)— 8.8 RPG (1st)— 3.8 APG (1st)— 1.8 SPG (1st)— 1.8 BPG (1st)He’s currently the only player in Division I basketball to lead his team in every major statistical category. That's as impressive as it is jarring. A 17-year-old is dominating for a Duke team likely to be in or very near the top 10 of the AP Top 25 on Monday, and in a way that no other player -- not just freshmen, but player -- is doing so at the Div. I level.  Flagg's passed every test this season with flying colors save for a late turnover vs. Kentucky in the Champions Classic that might've cost Duke the win. He'll have his biggest test of the season -- and maybe the year -- on Tuesday night in a major spotlight showdown as Duke faces No. 1 Kansas in Las Vegas, pitting him up against star big man Hunter Dickinson and a talented froncourt that includes freshman Flory Bidunga and KJ Adams. It should be appointment viewing, as every Flagg game has been this season. 31%: Flagg has the second-highest usage rate among qualifying freshmen this season in college basketball at 31%, trailing only Texas freshman Tre Johnson, whose usage rate through six games stands at 31.2%. Since 2000, only eight other players in the power structure conference have posted that high of a usage rate while averaging at least 17.5 points and 9.0 rebounds per game in a season. That list is: DeAndre Ayton, Marvin Bagley III, Ben Simmons, Michael Beasley, Kevin Love, Kevin Durant, Kris Humphries and Carmelo Anthony.  Five games into the season is a small sample size but it's hard to be too critical of what Flagg has accomplished already as a 17-year-old true freshman playing for the most scrutinized team in college basketball. He's looked every bit the part of the No. 1 recruit and is tracking toward becoming the overwhelming favorite to go No. 1 in the 2025 NBA Draft. Grade: A+ In his first true road game as a collegiate player Flagg led No. 12 Duke to a 69-55 victory Friday at No. 17 Arizona in one of the premier nonconference games of the 2024-25 college basketball season. Flagg finished with 24 points, six rebounds and three assists vs. the Wildcats. The Blue Devils jumped out to a 34-27 halftime advantage and held off a late rally from Arizona to improve to 4-1 on the season. The Blue Devils' lone loss came earlier this month to Kentucky in the Champions Classic. Duke has since won two straight ahead of its biggest game of the season against No. 1 Kansas next week. Flagg played a career-high 38 minutes in the win over Arizona. Meeting the hype and expectations will be a tall task for a young player like Flagg. But even though he's just 17 to begin the 2024-25 season, he is believed to be the rare talent capable of meeting the overused ""generational"" label. We'll be tracking his progress here all season long. Here's more on his second game with the Blue Devils. With just over 12 minutes remaining in the second half on Friday, Flagg drove through the middle of the lane and threw down a powerful one-handed flush. COOPER FLAGG GOT 🆙 pic.twitter.com/F16odYW8Hs 24 points: Flagg has now scored double figures in four of his five career games. Flagg scored eight points in 28 minutes during a blowout loss to Wofford last week and responded with a nice scoring effort days later. Flagg's career-high (26 points) came against Kentucky in the Champions Classic earlier this month. The McKale Center in Tucson is one of the toughest and most intimidating environments for any (opposing) player to play in. Flagg's overall efficiency (10 of 22) wasn't amazing, but he did score 24 points — the most of any player on the floor. Flagg held his own against one of the best teams in the country. Grade: A Duke travels to Las Vegas on Tuesday to face No. 1 Kansas. The Jayhawks opened the season as the top-ranked team in both the AP and Coaches polls and will enter this matchup with a perfect 5-0 record. Longtime coach Bill Self recently became the winningest coach in Kansas program history following a victory over Michigan State in the Champions Classic.  No. 6 Duke defeated Wofford 86-35 on Saturday at Cameron Indoor Stadium just days after suffering its first loss to Kentucky in the Champions Classic. Duke star freshman Cooper Flagg had a quiet offensive performance, finishing with a season-low eight points, but stuffed the stat sheet with nine rebounds, six assists, three steals and two blocks. Flagg didn't have to play much in the second half because his team jumped out to a 51-14 halftime advantage. The star forward played all 20 minutes in the second half in the loss to the Wildcats and logged only 13 minutes after intermission against the Terriers. Despite the loss to Kentucky, Flagg had the best scoring performance of his career, posting a team-high 26 points. Flagg had scored in double-digits in Duke's first three games of the season coming into the weekend. Flagg had a quiet day on offense against Wofford, but did record an And-1 bucket in the first half. He celebrated appropriately. Cooper Flagg just hit the LeBron shrug😭 pic.twitter.com/jShn3kUNQN Thirteen second half minutes: Flagg played all 20 minutes in the second half against Kentucky earlier this week but checked out with 5:41 remaining against Wofford. The star freshman got some well deserved rest ahead of a marquee showdown against Arizona next week. Flagg didn't have to do much for his team to record a bounce-back win at home. The star forward only logged 28 minutes and finished with eight points, nine rebounds, six assists, three steals and two blocks. Flagg went 1 of 5 from the 3-point line - an area he will need to improve on to take the next step in his development. Grade: A- Duke travels to Tucson, Arizona, on Friday to face No. 9 Arizona. The Wildcats are coming off a 103-88 loss on the road to Wisconsin for their first loss of the season. This game will be a rematch of last year's showdown at Cameron Indoor Stadium, won by Arizona 78-73. Arizona is coached by Tommy Lloyd, who is in his fourth season with the program after spending two decades as an assistant coach at Gonzaga. Through three games, Cooper Flagg has had his ups (he's averaging a double-double) and downs (poor shooting, cramping). All in all, it's been a fine early debut for the freshman phenom. Taken in context of how other eventual greats began their careers, Flagg is right on track.  However, keep an eye on how Flagg shoots the ball the next few weeks -- both the result and the process. Here's how Adam Finkelstein, the Director of Scouting at 247Sports and a draft analyst for CBS Sports, assesses Flagg:   The cramping and the two late turnovers against Kentucky may be what people will talk about, but the 17-year-old had 26 points and 12 rebounds at the Champions Classic. For him to play that well, and yet still have so much untapped upside is what is so exciting. Most scouts assume the cramping won't be a long-term problem. The self-creation is a work in progress, but that was largely expected.  It's been the shooting that has stood out as a variable that's going to potentially be even more important than expected. He's 3-for-13 from three so far (23%), but more than that it's that his spot-up shots in particular haven't looked particularly good. He's getting almost no lift into his release, versus when he shoots off the dribble or on the move and he tends to rise-up more into that release.  Having repeatable mechanics is a big part of shooting consistency and so the sheer variance of his elevation into different types of shots creates some uncertainty about the way it could trend long-term.  No. 6 Duke plays against Nov. 16 against Wofford.  With No. 6 Duke down by two against No. 19 Kentucky coming out of a timeout with just over two minutes remaining on Tuesday night, the Blue Devils were in desperate need of a bucket after missing six straight shots from the floor. So, with the game hanging in the balance, they turned to the youngest player on the floor.  Freshman phenom Cooper Flagg took the basketball, bullied his way inside the free-throw line and sank a contested jumper over Koby Brea as Brea committed a foul. Flagg made the free throw, which put Duke ahead. It felt for a moment like the game's pivotal play.  But neither the lead, nor Flagg's brilliance lasted over the game's final two minutes as the No. 19 Wildcats edged the No. 6 Blue Devils 77-72 in a Champions Classic thriller. Flagg's 26 point, 12-rebound effort featured many dazzling moments as he played in the first showcase game of his college career. But it also featured some growing pains down the stretch.  Following the aforementioned and-one sequence, Flagg made another physical bucket to tie the game at 72-72. But when the Blue Devils went back to Flagg twice in the final 30 seconds on two separate possessions, he committed two turnovers that sank Duke's chances.  Cooper Flagg turned the ball over two possessions in a row late in regulation.No. 19 Kentucky takes down No. 6 Duke 77-72‼️ pic.twitter.com/11fiwuov61 Flagg's skill and versatility shined throughout against a veteran-laden Kentucky team. However, the ending will go down as a hard-learned lesson for the projected No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft.  Flagg made his presence felt immediately, as he finished a lob on the game's first possession to open the scoring. It was part of a strong start as Flagg needed just over 11 minutes to reach double figures.  COOP WITH THE ALLEY-OOP 🔥On Duke's first possession of the game 🍿 pic.twitter.com/w1QzeWWVOD 20 minutes: After playing just 12 minutes in the first half after picking up his second foul, Flagg played the entire second half. That was a significant development for Duke after Flagg dealt with cramping issues in the Blue Devils' first two games.   While on the one hand, it's hard to knock a 17-year old freshman for such a statistically productive performance in his first game against a high-major college opponent, there was plenty for Flagg to improve upon. In particular, his inability to even get up a shot before committing consecutive turnovers in the final 30 seconds was costly. But the legion of NBA scouts in attendance likely saw nothing that would prompt them to consider moving Flagg from No. 1 on their big boards. Overall, he was great, but the performance was marred by the ending. Grade vs. Kentucky: B  Duke hosts Wofford on Saturday. The Terriers are coached by Dwight Perry, a former Kentucky walk-on who is originally from Durham, North Carolina. Wofford was picked to finish fourth in the Southern Conference preseason poll and ranks No. 7 nationally in minutes continuity with a deep well of players back from a team that finished 17-15 last season.  Cooper Flagg needed just one half to record the first double-double of his college career as the No. 7 Blue Devils beat Army 100-58. The freshman phenom had 13 points, 10 rebounds, two blocks and a steal at halftime as Duke opened up a 43-20 lead.  Flagg was quiet in the second half, adding a rebound to that tally in just six minutes as the Blue Devils cruised to a 2-0 start and he dealt with apparent cramps for a second straight game.  There was no need for Duke to force the issue with Flagg in the second half as the Blue Devils owned a commanding lead behind a strong team effort. Fellow freshman Kon Knueppel was impressive again, finishing with a team-high 15 points on 4-of-6 shooting from 3-point range As a team, the Blue Devils made 17 of 38 looks from deep as Tyrese Proctor also made four 3-pointers. Six players reached double figures for Duke.  Duke had missed six straight shots from the floor and led just 7-6 when the Blue Devils got a transition opportunity by virtue of their pressure defense less than four minutes into the game. Sion James came up with a steal, and Tyrese Proctor led a fast break that Flagg finished with an emphatic alley-oop slam.  Rese up top to Coop (ACCN) pic.twitter.com/aHHujE3srK 2 of 4: Flagg's 3-point shooting, which was a welcome sight after he went 0 for 4 from 3-point range in Duke's season-opening win over Maine. His two 3-pointers bookended an 18-0 Duke run in the first half.  While Flagg's cramping issues in the second half of both games so far this season is a concern, he's nonetheless looked the part of a college basketball star. For any player to secure a double-double in their second collegiate game is an impressive accomplishment. That Flagg needed only a half to reach that threshold of statistical productivity is a testament to his dominance. It wasn't a perfect performance — a 1-for-3 performance from the free-throw line is worth a slight knock — but Flagg looked great for the most part. Grade: A-  Duke faces a considerable uptick in competition on Tuesday as the Blue Devils will play No. 23 Kentucky in Atlanta as part of the Champions Classic. The Wildcats are a veteran-oriented team under first-year coach Mark Pope.  Duke phenom Cooper Flagg made his long-awaited collegiate debut on Nov. 4 as the Blue Devils outlasted Maine 96-62 to open the 2024-25 season. Flagg finished with 18 points, seven rebounds and five assists in 30 minutes before checking out with 3:28 remaining while battling cramps.  The Maine native didn't get his first basket from the floor until 6:25 remained in the first half. But his command for the game was on display early as Flagg assisted on two of Duke's first three buckets. With fellow freshman Kon Knueppel on fire with 13 points in the first seven minutes, Flagg took on a complimentary role for much of the first half.  But Flagg's ability to impact the game without the ball in his hands is part of the allure that makes him the projected No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft. Here is more from his debut:  With Duke leading just 35-27 and under four minutes remaining in the first half, Flagg offered a glimpse of the highlight-reel capability that helped make him the No. 1 overall prospect in the Class of 2024. Operating on the right wing, Flagg beat a Maine defender off the dribble, hit the paint and then exploded for a vicious right-handed dunk. The play ignited the Cameron Crazies and offered a glimpse of the electric potential that Flagg brings.  COOOOOOP  👀👀 (ACCN) pic.twitter.com/K9gkbl04Xu Flagg made 6 of 6 free throws, which was a great sign considering how much time he's likely to spend at the charity stripe this season.  Flagg looked comfortable and in command, even during a slow offensive start. The Blue Devils were +27 with him on the floor, and he passed the eye test in his first game against a Division I opponent after a couple of exhibitions against lower-tier foes. Flagg rarely forced looks on offense, but he did finish just 6 of 15 shooting. Flagg's 0 for 4 mark from beyond the arc was the biggest drag on his grade. Overall, though, it was a good start. Grade: B+  Duke returns to action Friday at 6 p.m. ET when the Blue Devils welcome Army to Cameron Indoor Stadium. It will be the final tune-up before a Nov. 12 showdown vs. Kentucky in the State Farm Champions Classic.  Flagg had a nice and-one finish in the first minute of Duke's 103-47 exhibition beatdown of Arizona State. He added a couple of free throws shortly thereafter while accounting for four of his team's six points. From there, it was mostly a quiet day for Flagg as the Blue Devils steamrolled the Sun Devils. He finished with nine points, four rebounds and three assists on 3 of 9 shooting in 21 minutes. Flagg logged just five minutes in the second half as the Blue Devils played their reserves ample minutes.  ""I thought he just impacted the game in a lot of ways,"" Scheyer said. ""Of course, his numbers aren't going to wow you or anything. I didn't put him back in the game, so that's part of it. He has this 'it' factor that you can't explain, where he just makes everyone around him better. His unselfishness, when your best player is not searching for stats it has such an amazing impact on the rest of your team. That's what he does. He guards whoever you ask him to. He's pushing the break, the ball flowed through his hands. I thought he had a good game and, still, he's got a lot more in him.""  Cooper Flagg in his 2nd Exhibition game for Duke vs Arizona State last night..9 PTS (3-9 FG)4 REBS3 AST21 MINSHow we feelin RN? pic.twitter.com/Y03wTbTVya Flagg logged an efficient 24 minutes in Duke's 107-56 exhibition win over Division II Lincoln (PA) on Oct. 19. He led the Blue Devils in points (22), assists (6) and blocks (4). While the competition was lacking relative to what Flagg will see throughout the regular season, it was an encouraging first glimpse at his versatility.  Here's what head coach Jon Scheyer had to say about Flagg's defensive performance in the game, via The Devils Den: ""He has great instincts, obviously, with how hard he plays. And then, you add in his feel, he's going to make some special plays. Today, he had four blocks. I think he can even add in some steals, preferably next time going forward. But I thought it was good for him. I thought he was himself. I thought even for 'Coop,' he can rebound more. There's so much there for him. And I thought it was great for him to get a feel today.  a pro move for your Monday feed @Cooper_Flagg pic.twitter.com/RFLwImeqRp CBS Sports published its list of the top 100 and 1 players in college basketball entering the new season. Flagg registered at No. 3 on the list, trailing only Mark Sears of Alabama and RJ Davis of North Carolina. Here's what senior writer Gary Parrish had to say about Flagg:  ""Any time the consensus top-ranked high school player in the country, who also doubles as the projected No. 1 overall pick in the next NBA Draft, enrolls at Duke, the eyes of the sport will focus on Cameron Indoor Stadium, which is exactly what's happened this preseason. Will Flagg live up to expectations and become the youngest Wooden Award winner in college basketball history while helping Jon Scheyer advance to his first Final Four as a coach?   ""As always, we'll see. But there's no doubting that the 6-9 forward from Maine is a generational talent who can and does impact winning in a variety of ways — from scoring to rebounding to passing and guarding. There's real substance behind the hype. His first high-profile game will be Nov. 12 against Kentucky in the Champions Classic in Atlanta.""  Matt Norlander went behind the scenes with Duke during preseason practice. ""Get ready, because Duke is probably going to be The Biggest Deal in College Basketball again, potentially reaching the stratospheric levels of Zion Williamson and company in 2018-19,"" Norlander wrote. ""Whether the Blue Devils are the best team, top-10 good or an inconsistent curiosity, coach Jon Scheyer knows this season is going to be evaluated and adjudicated more intensely than his first two.   ""The reason for that is obvious. Cooper Flagg.""   Cooper Flagg was unanimously voted CBS Sports preseason Freshman of the Year and was the only freshman named to the CBS Sports 2024-25 Preseason All-America First Team. Here's what Cameron Salerno had to say about Flagg's lofty preseason accolades:  ""Flagg has generated the hype of being the top-ranked prospect in his respective recruiting class because of his unique skill set that will translate to the college level and make him one of the most dominant players at just 17 years old. Flagg will be surrounded by a veteran Duke squad with national championship expectations in Year 3 of the Jon Scheyer era. No pressure, kid."""

The Pelicans took a loss in their last  matchup and will be looking to turn the tables on the Pacers, who come in off a win.  The Pacers took a loss when they played away from home  on Friday, but their home fans gave them all the motivation they needed  on Sunday. They walked away with  a   115-103  victory over the Wizards. The  contest marked Indiana's most dominant  win of the season so far.  The Pacers' success was spearheaded by the efforts of   Pascal Siakam, who  earned 22 points plus six  assists and six  rebounds, and   Tyrese Haliburton, who  almost  dropped  a double-double on 21 points and nine  assists. What's more,  Haliburton also racked up five  threes, the most he's  had since back in April.  The Pacers were working as a unit and  finished the game with 31  assists. They easily outclassed their opponents in that department as the Wizards only posted 24.  Meanwhile, the Pelicans' recent rough patch got a bit rougher  on Friday after their fourth straight  loss. They fell to the Warriors  112-108.  Even though the team lost, they still had their share of impressive performances. One of the best came from  Jeremiah Robinson-Earl, who  dropped  a double-double on 19 points and 12  rebounds.  With the  victory, Indiana broke their three-game losing streak and moved their record to 7-10. As for New Orleans, their defeat dropped their record down to 4-13.  Going forward, the Pacers are the favorite in this one, as the experts expect to see them win by 6.5  points. This contest  might not be the best time to bet them against the spread since they've let bettors down the last four times they've played.  The Pacers came up short against the Pelicans in their previous matchup  on November 1st, falling  125-118. Will the Pacers have more luck at home instead of on the road?  Indiana is a solid 6.5-point favorite against New Orleans, according to the latest NBA odds. The line has drifted a bit towards the Pacers, as the game opened with the Pacers as a 5-point favorite.

They will host the Orlando Magic  at 7:00  p.m.  ET at Spectrum Center.  The Hornets are hoping to turn things around  on Monday after a slow start to the season, which is looking a lot like last year's. They took  a  125-119 hit to the loss column at the hands of the Bucks.  Despite the  loss, the Hornets had strong showings from  LaMelo Ball, who  dropped  a double-double on 50 points and ten  assists, and  Brandon Miller, who  dropped  a double-double on 32 points and 11  rebounds. The  match was  Miller's third in a row with at least 30 points.  Even though they lost, the Hornets  smashed the offensive glass and  finished the game with 14  offensive rebounds. That strong performance was nothing new for the team: they've now  pulled down at least 11  offensive rebounds in five consecutive  matchups.  Meanwhile, the Magic earned  a  111-100 victory over the Pistons  on Saturday. The  win made it back-to-back  victories for Orlando.  The Magic's success was spearheaded by the efforts of   Franz Wagner, who  almost  dropped  a double-double on 30 points and nine  rebounds, and   Moe Wagner, who  went 7 for 11 en route to 18 points plus seven  rebounds and five  assists. That's the most  assists  Moe has posted since back in March.  Charlotte's defeat dropped their record down to 6-10. As for Orlando, their win was  their 15th straight at home dating back to last season, which  pushed their record up to 11-7.  While only the Magic took care of their fans the last time they played, both teams pleased bettors by covering the spread. Looking ahead, the Magic are the favorite in this one, as the experts expect to see them win by five  points. This contest  will be Charlotte's tenth straight  as the underdogs (so far over this stretch they are 7-2 against the spread).  The Hornets suffered a grim  114-89 defeat to the Magic  when the teams last played  two weeks ago. Will the Hornets have more luck at home instead of on the road?

The Raptors are no doubt hoping to put an end to  a 12-game streak of away losses dating back to last season.  On Sunday, the Raptors ended up a good deal behind the Cavaliers and lost  122-108.  Even though they lost, the Raptors  smashed the offensive glass and  finished the game with 19  offensive rebounds (they're ranked second in  offensive rebounds per game overall). That's the most  offensive rebounds they've posted since back in December of 2023.  Meanwhile, the Pistons' recent rough patch got a bit rougher  on Saturday after their third straight  loss.

CBSSports.com Headlines,Is Notre Dame a College Football Playoff lock? Examining Fighting Irish's outlook as 2024 season winds down,https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/is-notre-dame-a-college-football-playoff-lock-examining-fighting-irishs-outlook-as-2024-season-winds-down/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 20:16:36 +0000","Notre Dame is in strong standing, but is a playoff bid guaranteed?","Multiple prominent teams around the nation are sweating their College Football Playoff fate as the 2024 regular season draws to a close. For those on the bubble, there's only one guaranteed game left to leave an impression.  Then there are the programs that feel like a virtual lock. A 12-team field does provide some margin for error, at least, especially in a year as chaotic as this one.  Notre Dame is one of those schools that has quietly worked its way back into a prime position. Many were quick to count the Fighting Irish out after a disastrous early season loss to Northern Illinois, which still stands as arguably the biggest upset of the entire year.  That must have lit a considerable blaze under coach Marcus Freeman and his program. Notre Dame has been one of the most dominant teams in the sport over the last couple of months. Eight of their nine wins since Sept. 7 have come by two possessions.  The Irish are riding a nine-game winning streak (tied for second-longest in the FBS) with an average margin of victory of 32.6 points per game. That includes two ranked wins against Army and Navy, and one quietly strong résumé-builder against a Georgia Tech team that beat Miami. Notre Dame currently leads the FBS with a +301 point differential on the year with the No. 10 strength of record, according to ESPN's FPI metric.  Thanks to some major shuffling in Week 13 -- notably Indiana's loss to Ohio State -- Notre Dame will almost certainly be a top-five team in Tuesday's latest round of College Football Playoff Rankings. All that stands between the Irish and their third playoff appearance is a 6-5 USC team.  But does the result of Saturday's rivalry game matter? One could argue that, given the evidence above, Notre Dame has already done enough to round out a 12-team field.  The Irish have some impressive stats on their side: No. 4 nationally in total defense (273.1 yards per game), No. 2 in scoring defense (11.6 points per game), No. 1 in passing defense (139.5 ypg), No. 6 in scoring offense (39 ppg) and No. 11 in rushing offense (221.8 ypg). Plus, whether it's fair or not, Notre Dame has the all-important brand recognition on its side as one of college football's legacy programs.  Another aspect working in Notre Dame's favor is the fact that it does not have to play in a conference championship game. The promises of automatic bids to each of the five highest-ranked conference champions was seen as a huge drawback for independent Notre Dame. But now it insulates the Irish against a potential third loss. Just look at 9-2 Georgia, which had much consternation and hand-wringing among its fanbase when Auburn beat Texas A&M, sending the Bulldogs to the SEC Championship Game. A win obviously means they're in, but the opposite result gives UGA a third loss one day before the CFP committee makes its final decision.  Not only does Notre Dame avoid any worry about leaving a sour impression 24 hours before Selection Sunday, but not having to play in a conference title game gives the Irish an added bye week as they prepare for the playoff. Recent upsets also help Notre Dame's case, even in a situation where it falls to 10-2. The SEC once looked like it was a lock to snag four playoff spots, but Texas A&M, Alabama and Ole Miss all losing to unranked opponents in Week 13 effectively knocked them out of the at-large race. It also seems as if the Big 12 will be a one-bid league.  The only thing, at this point, that would entirely knock Notre Dame out of the conversation is a blowout loss against USC. Otherwise, even in a close defeat, the Irish should be feeling confident."
CBSSports.com Headlines,"NBA winners and losers: LaMelo Ball shooting at Kobe-like pace, Zion Williamson's bad news, an ugly ejection",https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-winners-and-losers-lamelo-ball-shooting-at-kobe-like-pace-zion-williamsons-bad-news-an-ugly-ejection/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 19:54:42 +0000",We're taking a look at the biggest winners and losers from the NBA weekend,"Friday night, the Golden State Warriors became the first team to clinch a spot in the knockout rounds of the NBA Cup. Please try to contain your excitement. As much flak as the tournament formerly known as the In-Season Tournament gets, it actually has added some legitimate pomp and circumstance to ordinary November NBA games. The courts are weird. Joe Mazzulla's fouling up by 10 to try to extend the game and add to the Celtics' point differential. People who hate soccer are begrudgingly forced to understand the rules of soccer tournaments to see if their team has a shot to advance. Are there a few tweaks that can be made? Sure. But overall, it's hard to say the initiative hasn't been a success. That being said, Saturday was WAY more eventful than Friday night's generally boring NBA Cup games. As you'll see, there were some strange goings on -- both good and bad -- over the last few days, so let's take some time and catch you all up. Here are this weekend's NBA winners and losers. Pro athletes play at such a high level of intensity and competitiveness that it's only natural for emotions to occasionally spill over. What Fred VanVleet did on Saturday night during the Rockets' loss to the Trail Blazers, however, clearly crossed the line. Beyond calling all three refs a ""b----"" (which we saw Kelly Oubre Jr. do not that long ago, coincidentally) on his way off the floor, VanVleet stuck his fingers dangerously close to the eyeball of official John Conley. Oh yeah, FVV got ejected. Did we mention that?  Fred Van Vleet commits a frustration foul then points to each referee individually and tells them ""you suck, you suck, and you suck... bitch asses"" then points at the referee who ejects him and says ""you're a bitch"" pic.twitter.com/eo4wjnj4W6 Our Brad Botkin broke down the reasons behind VanVleet's outburst, and the referees' response. VanVleet was fined $50,000 by the league on Monday.  Say what you will about LaMelo Ball, but the dude can get up some shots. Ball had a prolific night in the Hornets' Saturday's loss to the Milwaukee Bucks, putting up a career-high 50 points, including a ridiculous 40-spot in the second half.  And while 50 is a cool number, there's another number you should be aware of with Ball: 384. That's how many shots he's attempted this season, a whopping 40 more than second-place Giannis Antetokounmpo, who has also played 16 games. If you're bad at math like I am, that averages out to 24 shots per game, and Ball chucked up 38 of them, the highest single-game total in the NBA this season, to get his 50-burger on Saturday (FYI, De'Aaron Fox scored 60 points on 35 shots last week).  The last time a player put up 24 field goal attempts per game for a whole season was James Harden in 2018-19, and he averaged six more points than Ball on essentially the same number of shots (you history buffs out there will point out that old Max Zaslofsky averaged a meager 21 points on 24 shots per game for the 1947-48 Chicago Stags ... YES WE'RE AWARE). Here are the last five NBA players to average at least 24 shot attempts in a season.  LaMelo Ball 				 2024-25 				 24.0 				 James Harden 				 2018-19 				 24.5 				 Russell Westbrook  2016-17 				 24.0 				 Kobe Bryant 				 2005-06 				 27.2 				 Allen Iverson 				 2005-06 				 24.2 				 For the season, Ball is shooting 43% from the field, the eighth-lowest mark in the league of anyone taking at least 15 shots per game, but it doesn't look like he's going to ease up any time soon.  Get some ice for that right arm, young man. It's getting a workout. Everyone, rightfully so, is gushing over Nikola Jokic's 3/4-court volleyball spike that ""almost went in"" (not really). Give the man credit for tying something truly creative that also, by all known rules of physics, should be impossible.  Jokić somehow almost got this to go 😮 pic.twitter.com/5INHUGe5IE Pretty cool. But now, take a trip with me back to 2015. ""Uptown Funk"" was the No. 1 song on the charts, ""Furious 7"" hauled in $350 million at the domestic box office, and the Utah Jazz were inbounding the basketball with 0.2 seconds left on the shot clock. The defending Oklahoma City Thunder were simply waiting for time to expire and a violation to be called once the ball touched someone's hands. Trevor Booker had other ideas.  The journeyman forward, who wound up playing eight NBA seasons, ran to his spot, took the bounce pass and busted out a smooth two-hand flick OVER HIS HEAD that went straight through the net. The best part is that he ran back on defense like it was no big deal despite later saying he had ""never done it in a game situation or even practice, for that matter."" Incredible.  So Booker is a loser this weekend because nobody seems to remember that -- while Jokic's attempt was spectacular -- Booker actually finished the job.  We haven't seen someone named McCain campaign this hard since the 2008 presidential election (I'll see myself out). 76ers first-year sensation Jared McCain took a short break from annihilating the Brooklyn Nets on Friday to declare to the spectators, and to the entire world: ""I'm the Rookie of the Year.""  ""I'M THE ROOKIE OF THE YEAR!""—Jared McCain 🔥 pic.twitter.com/ezzlIDg4Q9 Who wore it better, McCain or Austin Reaves?  Gotta love the confidence. And at this point, McCain is right. He leads all rookies with 16.6 points per game on insanely efficient 46/40/94 shooting splits. A lot of season left, though. On Sunday he snapped a streak of seven straight 20-point games by scoring ... 18 points. Oh, and the game before he started that streak he scored ... 18 points. So why don't we just say he's scored at least 18 points in nine straight games? The streak is alive, baby!  Zion's not a loser in the sense of like, why isn't this loser coming back from an injury? He's losing, in this particular situation, because he's in danger of missing a huge chunk of yet another season to start his frustrating career after the report that he's not close to returning from a hamstring issue. When this guy's healthy he's one of the most dynamic basketball players we've ever seen, but's he's topped the 60-game threshold just twice in his six seasons, and fallen below 29 games three times including missing the entirety of the 2021-22 campaign.  It sounds like Williamson could be out until mid-December... which could end up meaning Christmas... which could end up meaning 2025. The Pelicans have been hit harder than most by the injury bug this season (at one point they had seven of their top players out and they recently signed Elfrid Payton off the scrap heap), but Williamson's absence not only affects the franchise and Zion himself. It also hurts the fans who are once again missing out on his singular talent.  Blazers rookie Donovan Clingan had himself a night on Saturday, pulling down a career-best 19 rebounds in just 25 minutes. The story would have ended there, had there not been another significant character in one of the stat sheet columns. Clingan scored zero points in the game, making him the first player since 2012 to pull down at least 19 rebounds in a game while going scoreless. The 7-foot-2 UConn product absolutely dominated the glass as a fill-in starter for Deandre Ayton, and likely would have added to his board total were it not for some moderate foul trouble and a late knee injury. He's just the eighth player ever to accomplish the ... feat? The only players to do it more than once are Marcus Camby (2) and Dennis Rodman (7!), and Clingan definitely has a chance to join them with the way he cleans up the glass and his, let's say, limited offensive arsenal at this stage of his career."

Soon, the moves will begin pouring in, and it'll fall on us to make sense of them all. By ""us,"" I mean, well, everyone, but especially Chris Towers and I, two Fantasy Baseball gurus guiding you through the transactions of actual consequence for Fantasy Baseball. You've landed in the place where we'll react to them as they happen, breaking down what they mean for 2025 drafts. You'll notice not much has happened yet. It's been a pretty slow start to an offseason that could see players like Juan Soto, Corbin Burnes, Pete Alonso, and Garrett Crochet change hands. Once the dominoes begin to fall, though, you'll be glad you have one stop for keeping track of them all. So bookmark this page and keep checking back. You never know what move could reshape your entire draft plan. The three-year, $63 million deal is a modest one for a pitcher who seemed to have real momentum heading into the offseason, having just put together a 2.70 ERA, 0.93 WHIP and 11.4 K/9 in his 10 starts for the Astros. The improved performance coincided with Kikuchi roughly doubling his slider usage, and his 2025 destination matters less for his Fantasy value than whether or not he sticks to that approach. He has always missed bats at a good rate but has gotten inconsistent results due to questionable pitch selection and a penchant for hard contact. Going to the Angels gives him a lower margin for error than if he had gone to a true contender and also does nothing to soften his vulnerability to the long ball, but again, his success is tied more to continuing his slider-heavy approach. And for that, we'll just have to wait and see. I cautiously rank him just inside my top 50 starting pitchers for 2025, but he has the upside for more. --Scott White  Unfortunately, this trade is close to a worse-case scenario for the two major players involved. India goes from the most favorable park for home runs -- i.e., one of the few where his fringy power plays -- to one of the least favorable. According to Statcast, his 63 career home runs would be 42 if he played every game  at Kauffman Stadium. Obviously, the reverse move is bad for Singer, a pitcher who's on the more pitch-to-contact side of the ledger, but since he generally puts the ball on the ground, maybe it's not as bad. Then again, he has a career 3.92 ERA at home in Kauffman Stadium compared to a 4.74 ERA everywhere else. Neither India nor Singer figured to be a hot commodity prior to this trade, and both might go undrafted now in shallower leagues. India is a little more useful in points leagues because of his on-base skills, and both he and Singer at least stand to be high-volume plays. India's removal does free up some of the Reds' infield logjam with Matt McLain expected back, penciling in Noelvi Marte at third base again. --Scott White  Rather than test the free agent market, Martinez accepted the Reds' qualifying offer of $21.05 million, which isn't altogether surprising given that it now represents roughly 40 percent of his career MLB earnings. That the Reds extended the offer is telling. They had a front-row seat to the 34-year-old's career season and bought in hard at an amount that virtually guarantees he'll be a full-time starter rather than reverting to a swingman role. Perhaps, then, we should take Martinez just as seriously. He's always had a killer changeup, and he became a strike-thrower of the highest order in 2024, boasting the third-best walk rate among pitchers with at least 100 innings. His home run prevention was probably too good to be true, particularly for pitching half his games in Cincinnati, but he won't be priced for another 3.10 ERA. More likely, he'll be sort of a poor man's Jose Berrios or Zach Eflin, good for piling up innings with a low WHIP, and he takes on added value in Head-to-Head points leagues due to his relief pitcher eligibility.  --Scott White Finally freed of his catching tandem with Sean Murphy, d'Arnaud was quick to put himself in another one, this time with up-and-comer Logan O'Hoppe. It's frustrating for a couple reasons, one being that O'Hoppe loses some of the volume that made him so attractive for Fantasy, likely going from a 75 percent workload share to 60 percent or less, and the other being that d'Arnaud himself could have pursued a full-time role. Instead, d'Arnaud figures to remain a fringe second catcher for two-catcher leagues, and while O'Hoppe doesn't necessarily slide down the rankings -- he was already regarded as a low-end No. 1 -- his upside takes a hit. Maybe his .196 batting average in the second half is evidence he was overworked, but even if it improves, his counting stats will be capped. Meanwhile, Murphy has a golden opportunity to reestablish himself in Atlanta after bombing for the past season-and-a-half there. Injuries have likely contributed to his struggles, as has irregular playing time due to the presence of d'Arnaud, but he'll need to prove himself quickly to hold off prospect Drake Baldwin. --Scott White  Only three months after acquiring him from the Giants, the Braves flipped Soler to the Angels in what was essentially a salary dump. They ended up non-tendering the player they got back in the deal, Griffin Canning. You might think Soler's departure reflects well on Ronald Acuna's recovery from a torn ACL, but GM Alex Anthopoulos later confessed that the star outfielder likely won't be ready for the start of 2025. As for Soler, he has an easy claim to the Angels' DH spot and will play in a pretty nice venue, particularly for home runs, but his success has never depended on such factors. He's a mercurial performer coming off a down season but still has the 35-homer upside to pay off handsomely as a fourth or fifth outfielder. --Scott White"

It could have been Jordan-Hare Stadium morphing into its annual upset mosh pit with an unexpected win for Auburn -- this time it was Texas A&M falling victim.  Definitely when Ole Miss coughed up a hairball at Florida ridding Lane Kiffin from the burden of having to play in the SEC Championship Game. Never mind the -- chuckle! -- College Football Playoff. With a week to go in the regular season, it has become clear the CFP doesn't deserve itself. There's too much mediocrity, mostly. It's actually too big at this point. Well, at least too big to make it a quality playoff. The three SEC teams listed above lost Saturday for the third time. Each one of them were upset with everything on the line.  Never mind not holding serve. They couldn't even grasp the racquet, and it wasn't anything new for those schools this season.  Also, one or two of them may still make the playoff field. Try to stop your gag reflex.  Expansion? Going to 16 teams would be like picking up hitchhikers on the side of the road at this point. Automatic qualifiers? Please. That's the fatal flaw with the initiative earlier this year by the SEC and Big Ten. At some point you have to actually earn your way in.  If this were a Taylor Swift concert, there are major football brands out there that would still need a wrist band just to stand in line for the ticket lottery -- except some of those major brands think they deserve floor seats.  Heading into the final full week, the playoff looks overpriced and bloated. A credible playoff doesn't have to include any or all of those three-loss teams.  We don't necessarily need to see Alabama or Texas A&M attempt to make a run. Ole Miss apparently still has between a snowball's chance in hell and an asteroid hitting earth of still getting in the CFP.  Call it parity, but parity means you have a bunch of not-great teams. That's college football this season. And it's been fun as hell to watch ... at times. But let's not call it something more than what it is. You know what would impact the CFP's credibility? If Indiana was left out. Yes, the team that lost by 23 at Ohio State, but at least the Hoosiers have shown up each week. In fact, Oregon, Ohio State and Indiana have been the most consistent teams this season. ""Is that a serious question,"" Indiana coach Curt Cignetti said when asked postgame if his team deserved to be in the playoff. ""The answer is so obvious."" Swagger in central Indiana. Love it.  Throughout the CFP era, three-loss teams would have been in a 12-team bracket, but no one told us there'd be so many pretenders backing in that it would sound like the ""beep, beep, beep"" of a trash truck at dawn.  It's to the point now that we're almost looking for volunteers to fill out the field. After Saturday, most of this is on the SEC. They'll never admit it, but from this press box view, the Rebels, Aggies and Tide don't deserve a spot. Georgia could join that three-loss group if Texas wins out.  Look, we can only be so gullible on this SEC schedule strength narrative. Sooner or later you have to win games. Nick Saban was right on ""College GameDay"" -- perhaps Jordan-Hare Stadium is haunted. That's the way it seemed when Auburn rallied late to beat Texas A&M in four overtimes.  That was tragic for a team that has beaten a four-loss LSU and lost by 24 to South Carolina.  What exactly was that for Bama at OU? Vanderbilt beat Alabama and Auburn in the same season for the first time since 1955. Oklahoma did it in its first 13 weeks in the SEC.  Alabama went without a touchdown for the first time since 2011, but that 9-6 overtime loss to LSU was a prelude to a national championship rematch. For the first time since Pat McAfee had sleeves, the Iron Bowl suddenly means little on the SEC or national stages.  The success of two teams with 1-5 conference records -- Auburn and Oklahoma -- should stifle any talk about the incredible depth of the Strength Everywhere Conference.  Perception is everything. The same thing is happening in the Big 12, but that league looks more entertaining than watered down. Expectations were low to begin with for the league that lost big dogs Texas and Oklahoma.  Everybody in the Big 12 has at least two losses, and it seems like the league has overachieved -- at least in entertainment value. A current four-way tie atop the league could turn into an eight-way tie by the end of Saturday. Kansas became the first team with a losing record to beat three ranked teams in consecutive weeks. Colorado lost by 16 to the Jayhawks, but one of the takeaways was Travis Hunter solidifying his Heisman Trophy credentials. Arizona State coach Kenny Dillingham seemingly did everything he could to allow BYU back in Saturday's game. With a week to go, all the Sun Devils have to do is beat Arizona in the Territorial Cup -- no sure thing -- to earn a spot in the Big 12 Championship Game.  Well, unless the Jenga that is the Big 12 race completely collapses and some combination of Colorado/BYU/Iowa State/Baylor/Kansas State/TCU go to Jerry World.  SMU clinched a spot in the ACC Championship Game and is a heartbeat away from playing in the CFP in its first season as a member of a Power Four conference.

Literally. With four seconds remaining and the Rockets down by five points, VanVleet was whistled for an offensive foul and proceeded to point at every ref on the floor while offering some NSFW words. This earned him an ejection on Saturday and a fine two days later. Monday, NBA executive vice president and head of basketball operations Joe Dumars announced that the outburst will cost VanVleet $50,000. The NBA did not suspend VanVleet for the incident. VanVleet was fined ""for confronting and directing profane language toward the officiating staff near the conclusion of the Rockets' 104-98 loss,"" per the official press release.  The following has been released by the NBA. pic.twitter.com/iCldye6S8c VanVleet's frustration with the officials seemingly stemmed from the possession before his ejection, when he felt he was fouled on a 3-point attempt with the Rockets trailing by three. After the game, VanVleet told reporters that he could hear the Portland bench instructing Toumani Camara to intentionally foul with the Blazers trying to protect a three-point lead, and that he felt he anticipated Camara's contact by going into his shooting motion.  You can be the judge as to whether or not this was a natural shooting motion, but nonetheless, VanVleet didn't get the call.  Even if it is contact the refs aren’t calling a foul. That is a bad play by VanVleet. No way around it. pic.twitter.com/osNT0XJEKB Crew chief Courtney Kirkland told a pool repoter after the game that a foul should have been called on Camara, but that it would not have resulted in free throws for VanVleet as the contact occurred before he started his shooting motion. ""In live action, we felt that the defender stayed directly on the path of VanVleet during his attempted motion toward the basket,"" Kirkland said. ""After video review, we see the defender did close space and did make contact with the hip of VanVleet and a foul should have been called. However, shots would not have been awarded on the play."" The NBA's Last Two Minute Report backed up Kirkland's assessment. As for VanVleet's ejection, Kirkland confirmed what everyone could see: ""VanVleet was ejected on one technical foul for his vulgar language and pointing at all three officials."""

Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele and Rory McIlroy make up the three-player race for the Jack Nicklaus Award, while Nick Dunlap, Max Greyserman, Jake Knapp and Matthieu Pavon are among those vying for the Arnold Palmer Award. Scheffler was named Player of the Year in 2022 and 2023, becoming the first since Tiger Woods from 2005-07 to emerge as a back-to-back winner. He has a great chance to follow in Woods' footsteps and claim the award for the third straight season. Following one of the greatest statistical seasons ever in 2023, Scheffler married his consistent output with consistent trips to the winner's circle in 2024. The world No. 1 entered 19 events and came away with seven trophies, which consisted of the Masters, the Players Championship, four signature events and the Tour Championship. Scheffler got his hands on the FedEx Cup trophy as well as the Olympic gold medal in what can only be described as a summer to remember. He claimed the Byron Nelson Award for the lowest scoring average (68.65) for the second straight season and led the PGA Tour in terms of top 10s with 16. While Scheffler put together one of the best seasons in PGA Tour history, Schauffele put together one of the best major championship campaigns of all time. After finishing top 10 in the Masters, Schauffele won the PGA Championship in dramatic fashion for his first career major title. Another top-10 finish came at the U.S. Open before Schauffele left no doubt Sunday at Royal Troon where he carded a final-round 65 to win The Open and raise the Claret Jug. Across 22 events on the PGA Tour, Schauffele recorded 15 top-10 finishes and did not miss a cut. He holds the longest active made-cut streak (56) since Woods' record 142 in a row from 1998-2005. McIlroy finds himself nominated for the third straight season. A winner of the award three times, the 35-year-old put together another consistent season and raised trophies at the Zurich Classic alongside Shane Lowry and the Wells Fargo Championship. He finished sixth in scoring average (69.91) and collected seven top-10 finishes in 19 starts. Events 19 22 19 Wins 7 2 2 Top 10s 16 15 7 Major wins 1 2 0 Major top 10s 3 4 1 The Rookie of the Year race may be closer than many originally suspected. Nick Dunlap shot out to the early lead when he won The American Express as an amateur. Turning professional soon after, the Alabama product etched his name into the history books once again when he won the Barracuda Championship. Dunlap is the first player in PGA Tour history to win as both an amateur and professional in the same season. He is not the only rookie to have won in 2024, however. Journeyman Matthieu Pavon entered the winner's circle the week after Dunlap's win at The American Express. Emerging from a crowded leaderboard at Torrey Pines, the Frenchman won the Farmers Insurance Open. The 32-year-old then went on to to nab top-five finishes at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and the U.S. Open where he played in the final group on Sunday. Pavon was also the only rookie to qualify for the Tour Championship. Knapp's season was highlighted by his victory at the Mexico Open. Collecting three other top-10 finishes in his first stroll on the PGA Tour, Knapp was hindered late in the season due to injury. That is the exact same time when Greyserman seemed to find his footing. The 29-year-old entered 26 events and did everything but win. Finishing runner-up at the 3M Open, Wyndham Championship and the Zozo Championship, Greyserman did enough to finish inside the top 50 of the FedEx Cup standings. He recorded three additional top-10 finishes and finished ninth in scoring average (70.00).

Voting will close on Wednesday, Dec. 4 with winners announced at the end of the year."
CBSSports.com Headlines,Fantasy Basketball 2024 Week 6 Start/Sit advice: Moussa Diabate's defense makes him a start-worthy candidate,https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/basketball/news/fantasy-basketball-2024-week-6-startsit-advice-moussa-diabates-defense-makes-him-a-start-worthy-candidate/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 19:22:16 +0000",Moussa Diabate is the only healthy center in Charlotte,"Week 6 brings with it a topsy-turvy schedule due to there being no games Thursday as a result of Thanksgiving. That leaves four days with nine or more games – days on which knowing whom to start and whom to sit becomes even tougher. The week features 18 teams suiting up four times, with 10 teams tabled for three games. That leaves only the 76ers and the Bucks with two games. Sitting players who only go two or three times has its advantages, but Fantasy managers still have to make smart decisions when figuring out whom to play, regardless of game count.  Four Games: ATL, BKN, CHA, DAL, DET, IND, LAC, LAL, MEM, MIA, NOP, NYK, OKC, ORL, POR, SAC, TOR, UTA Three Games: BOS, CHI, CLE, DEN, GSW, HOU, MIN, PHO, SAS, WAS Two Games: MIL, PHI Here are four potential starts and four potential sits entering the fifth week of the NBA season. Just keep in mind that this is based on games played for the week. If you play in a rotisserie league, the number of games played each week may not matter in your format.  Consider starting: Quentin Grimes, DAL Opponents: @ATL, NYK, @UTA, @POR With Luka Doncic sidelined due to a wrist injury, Grimes has found himself in the starting lineup of late. While his production has been nothing to write home about, he remains well-positioned to potentially put together a string of positive performances. He should see upwards of 27 minutes per game as long as Doncic is out, giving him a somewhat safe floor when it comes to overall fantasy value. He can provide managers with traditional guard numbers, including points, 3s, and assists, as well as out-of-position rebounds. Consider starting: T.J. McConnell, IND Opponents: NOP, POR, DET, @MEM The Pacers are without both Andrew Nembhard and Ben Sheppard, opening the door for McConnell to step into a slightly larger role. He has scored double digits in four straight games, adding 22 assists and 10 steals in that time. He is one of the more proven per-minute producers in the league, now serving as the primary backup behind Tyrese Haliburton. Although his playing time is unlikely to exceed 25 minutes per game, that is more than enough for him to have standard league value. A favorable schedule could see him flirt with top-80 value, making him a definite starting candidate this week. Consider sitting: Buddy Hield, GSW Opponents: BKN, OKC, @PHO After a red-hot start to the season, Hield has cooled off recently, scoring more than 14 points only once in the past eight games. He has been outside the top 200 in standard formats over the past two weeks, averaging 12.3 points and 2.7 3-pointers in 22.9 minutes per game, shooting just 41.5 percent from the field. Although he will almost certainly pick it up at some point, the Warriors are also in a position where they don't need to roll him out there unless his shot is falling. Given so many teams play four times this week, Hield's lack of overall upside makes him a risky starting option. Consider starting: Toumani Camara, POR Opponents: @MEM, @IND, SAC, DAL Camara continues to sit right on the cusp of standard league value, typically doing just enough to be rostered in most leagues. While his numbers have been a little inconsistent, his role appears set, providing managers with an element of assurance. With Deandre Ayton and Donovan Clingan out, Robert Williams and Duop Reath are going to have to soak up the bulk of the center minutes. Williams himself is no stranger when it comes to injury, and based on what we have seen thus far, he, too, could miss a game this week due to rest purposes. All of this adds up to the fact that Camara could be required to do a little more work on the boards, perhaps pushing him over the edge when it comes to whether to start him or not. Consider sitting: Jabari Smith, HOU Opponents: @MIN, @PHI, OKC It's been a modest start to the season for Smith, once again failing to take his game to the next level. He currently sits outside the top 150 in 12-team formats, averaging 11.7 points to go with 6.6 rebounds and 1.5 3-pointers. He is also averaging career-low numbers on the defensive end, putting up just 0.9 combined steals and blocks. It does appear as though his starting role is secure, at least for the time being, giving managers hope that he might be able to turn things around at some point. However, with only three games on the docket and a slew of poor performances, now might be a good time to move him to the bench. Consider sitting: Paul George, PHI Opponents: HOU, @DET George continues to miss time due to an ongoing knee injury initially suffered during the preseason. Upon his return, George re-injured the same knee. Although it doesn't appear as bad, it is a worrying sign. He is set to be re-evaluated Monday, giving managers some optimism that he could return this week. However, there is also a chance the team opts to give him a few extra days to get it right, which could rule him out for the entire week. Despite the obvious upside, the risk associated with not only the knee but also the poor schedule makes him a tough yet sensible bench candidate.  Consider starting: Moussa Diabate, CHA Opponents: ORL, MIA, NYK, ATL Having lost Grant Williams to a season-ending knee injury over the weekend, the Hornets are now without three center options. That leaves Diabate as the only viable option and one who has proven himself over the past few games. Despite a very limited offensive game, Diabate has been able to put up top-80 value over the past two weeks, averaging 4.5 points, 11.2 rebounds, and 2.8 combined steals and blocks. There is no indication as to exactly when Nick Richards or Mark Williams might return. While there is always a chance it comes sooner rather than later, that should be a risk managers are willing to take, given the Hornets' track record when it comes to reporting injuries. For now, Diabate has to be considered as a starting option for anyone needing boards and defensive contributions. Consider sitting: Joel Embiid, PHI Opponents: HOU, @DET Basically, we are taking what was said regarding Paul George and applying it to Embiid. After missing the start of the season with a knee injury, Embiid has struggled to stay on the court. Although he has been able to put up good numbers when available, Embiid certainly looks hampered to the point where every step appears to cause him pain. This is a tough call, given the per-game upside Embiid possesses. Two games of healthy production is probably worth rolling out there, to be fair. However, much like George, there is a definite element of risk, which makes it tough to have any faith that he will be able to play heavy minutes in two straight games."

CBSSports.com Headlines,Why Yusei Kikuchi's contract and other offseason moves are a good sign for mid-rotation free-agent pitchers,https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/why-yusei-kikuchis-contract-and-other-offseason-moves-are-a-good-sign-for-mid-rotation-free-agent-pitchers/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 19:00:36 +0000",It's not just aces who stand to get paid this winter,"Major League Baseball's offseason remains in its infancy (the winter meetings won't begin until Dec. 9), but free-agent starting pitchers and their agents should rejoice. All signs to date point to this being a bull market, with teams ready, willing, and able to fork over big money to anyone capable of slotting into at least the middle of a rotation.  Consider that both Nick Martinez and Nick Pivetta were tendered the one-year qualifying offer, valued this offseason at $21 million. Each has their merits and their flaws. Martinez has averaged fewer than 12 starts per pop since returning from overseas three years ago; Pivetta, meanwhile, enters the winter with a career 92 ERA+ that lines up almost exactly with a league-average starter. Martinez accepted his QO to remain with the Reds, while Pivetta rejected his. Simultaneously, Frankie Montas, he of the 89 ERA+, turned down his part of a mutual option that would have paid him $20 million in 2025. That teams were OK ponying up for Martinez and Pivetta, and that Montas was willing to walk away from such money before the offseason shifted into gear says something about how front offices and agents expected the rest of the winter to play out with respect to the pitching market -- specifically, they anticipated things getting wild. Sure enough, those suspicions were validated on Monday -- at least to some extent -- when the Los Angeles Angels reportedly reached a three-year agreement with lefty Yusei Kikuchi worth $63 million. There are reasons to believe Kikuchi has achieved a new level of production by altering his pitch mix and leaning into his strengths. Still, he's a 33-year-old with a career 91 ERA+ who has underachieved in MLB more often than not. If he's getting both term and wage, that suggests some of the winter's superior mid-rotation starters have to be salivating at what's to come. To be clear, we're not talking about Corbin Burnes, Blake Snell, or Max Fried -- they're more properly labeled as front-of-the-rotation types. We're also not talking about Roki Sasaki, the Japanese wunderkind whose earning potential is restricted by his amateur free-agent designation. We're talking about the following pitchers who occupied the space ahead of or around the likes of Kikuchi (No. 20), Pivetta (28), and Martinez (37) on our ranking of the top 50 free agents available this winter. The likes of Jack Flaherty, Sean Manaea, Nathan Eovaldi, Luis Severino, and even Walker Buehler, who could find himself in-demand despite a rough regular season. Perhaps the early winter trend shouldn't come as a surprise. There are only so many worthwhile starting pitchers available at a given time, leading multiple clubs (including the champion Los Angeles Dodgers) to turn to bullpen games during the postseason. Of course, that strategy is easier to deploy in October, where off days are more readily available, than during the regular season. That means that first, and perhaps foremost, someone has to make 25 to 30 starts during the spring and summer before any fall plans can be hatched. You get the point.  And, should the trend hold, soon enough those aforementioned pitchers will get the paper."

The incident took place at Bradshaw's off-campus apartment last week, though details remain unclear. He missed the Buckeyes' last game, which came Friday vs. Campbell. The school sent out a statement a few hours before Friday's 104-60 victory vs. the Camels declaring that Bradshaw ""is not currently participating in team activities"" but declining to provide more information, citing federal privacy laws.  Ohio State coach Jake Diebler was asked for specifics on the situation after the game but also declined to elaborate and instead referenced the school's statement. ""Regarding Aaron, I understand that you may have some questions,"" Diebler said. ""But I have to refer to the statement released and can't comment on that any further.  ""He's currently going through a university process, and I can't comment any further,"" he added in response to a question about Bradshaw's status and a potential timeline for that process. Bradshaw, a former five-star recruit ranked as a top-five player nationally and the No. 1 center prospect in the Class of 2023, transferred from Kentucky this offseason and was expected to be a centerpiece for a Buckeyes team on the rise. He averaged 7.8 points, 1.8 blocks and 4.8 rebounds per game in four starts this season for Ohio State but was held out of Friday's game. He's also not expected to play Monday vs. Green Bay. There have not been charges filed against Bradshaw related to the incident and there remains no timeline for what a university investigation process might look like, according to The Dispatch."
Not the Bee,Courts gagged the doc who exposed Texas Children's Hospital.

Chris Rufo of City Journal and the Manhattan Institute exposed multiple doctors at Texas Children's Hospital who were giving cross-sex hormones to children, in direct contradiction to Texas law.  After the story broke, the Biden Department of Justice investigated and charged the anonymous whistleblower, surgeon Dr. Eithan Haim, with four counts of violating HIPPA. The hospital also fired a nurse that helped reveal the hospital's illegal program - that is, after FBI agents showed up to her door to harass her. Texas AG Ken Paxton is investigating the hospital, but gag orders remain on information related to the case against Dr. Haim. We want to know why Biden's government refuses to explain itself. From Harmeet Dhillon's link: The Dhillon Law Group, on behalf of client Not the Bee, LLC, has taken legal action to unseal critical documents in the criminal case against Dr. Eithan Haim, a whistleblower accused of exposing controversial transgender medical practices on minors, at Texas Children's Hospital. Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, the motion aims to make public docket entries 101, 104, 107, and 108, which were sealed without clear justification. Dr. Haim's revelations about these medical procedures have ignited fierce debate across the country, drawing attention from politicians, legal scholars, and media outlets. Critics have labeled the prosecution of Dr. Haim as retaliatory, claiming it seeks to silence dissenting voices in an area of intense public and political concern.  Whether it's the manifesto of the school shooter in Nashville or whistleblower documents related to gender surgeries on Texas kids, courts absolutely love to shut down the release of information related to transgenderism so that no one gets the idea that radical gender theory is incorrect or to blame for any of society's ills. But lack of transparency doesn't make the problems go away. Not the Bee Co-Founder and CEO Dan Dillon explains why it is essential for the American public to have all the facts about this case. 👇 At Not the Bee, we make a living from finding humor in the absurd, but this case is no laughing matter. When a doctor risks everything to shine a light on medical practices involving children, especially in the controversial realm of gender transitions, the public has a right to see the full picture. The sealed documents in this case could provide the public with evidence that this case was justified - or, it could show that the government is harassing Dr. Haim without any justification other than blind obedience to the woke religion. Here are a few reasons that the whole things is sketchy, straight from the motion we have filed with the U.S. District Court in Southern Texas: First, immediately after the hearing and before the second superseding indictment was filed, a filing was made under seal, with no description. Second, a government attorney filed a motion to withdraw as counsel of record for the United States. Though the filing was entirely under seal, the court then granted the motion and provided the title of the motion. Third, on November 20, 2024, the government moved for a gag order to prevent Dr. Haim and his counsel from making public statements or talking to the press, except for statements that merely recite, without any characterization, matters of public record. For this motion, the government filed two exhibits under seal and described them as tweets from Dr. Haim and his counsel. The government characterized the tweets as demonstrating that the 'defendant and his counsel have now crossed a line, bombarding social media with inaccurate and inflammatory descriptions of pretrial proceedings that would never be admissible before a jury.' We believe none of these elements provide justification for the government's efforts in quieting information regarding this case, especially considering the fact that we live in, well, AMERICA. Sealing a document constitutes a prior restraint, and it is 'constitutional only if the government demonstrates that the protected speech restrained poses a ‘clear and present danger, or a serious or imminent threat to a protected competing interest.'"" Davis, 78 F.3d at 928 (quoting CBS Inc. v. Young, 522 F.2d 234, 238 (6th Cir. 1975)). Furthermore, '[t]he restraint must be narrowly drawn and cannot be upheld if reasonable alternatives are available having a lesser impact on First Amendment freedoms.' Harmeet Dhillon has this to say about the motion: Transparency in this case is essential -- not just for justice but for public trust in the system. The requested sealing these documents is inconsistent with applicable law, violates the public right to examine the government's conduct, and further would deprive the public of the First Amendment right to hear commentary about a matter of significant public interest -- namely, the prosecution of a whistleblower raising alarm about alleged medical misconduct and mistreatment of minors in Texas. Thanks to Dhillon Law Group for their work in filing this motion.  I'll leave you with this January interview with Dr. Haim that outlines why he decided to be brave and say something about what was happening at Texas Children's Hospital:  People need to hear the truth. People need to hear what happened.

A whopping 33% of Republican women own guns, compared to just 29% of Democratic men.  And I love this headline from Gallup:   Here's what the poll found. According to six-year groupings of Gallup's annual measurement of personal gun ownership since 2007, the percentage of Republican women who own a gun has increased from 19% in 2007-2012 to 33% in 2019-2024. Meanwhile, the rate has fallen seven percentage points among Democratic men, to 29%, and is down five points among independent men, to 39%. Republican men remain the most likely gun owners among gender and party identification subgroups, at 60%. Not at all surprising ... if you've been paying attention. Some other interesting finds in this poll: While the gender gap has shrunk, the political party gap has expanded. In 2007-2012, personal gun ownership rates differed by 16 points among Republicans (38%) and Democrats (22%). Now the gap is 28 points (47% and 19%, respectively).…gender is the strongest predictor of gun ownership. However, the influence of gender is weaker today than it was in the past.The model estimates that the statistical odds of a man owning a gun are 3.1 times greater than the odds of a woman owning a gun, after taking into account the effect of other variables.

Listen to CBS News explain how that meanie Donald Trump is going to send them all home:  Notice that this segment doesn't consider the perspectives of the native Americans who have lived in Springfield for generations.  It ignores the effects of putting tens of thousands of migrants from a very different culture into a small community and instead focuses on the plight of the foreigners who are only supposed to be here temporarily. Take Springfield, Ohio, where Trump accused Haitian immigrants without any evidence of eating pets.    No evidence at all! Ketlie Moise fled unspeakable violence in her homeland of Haiti hoping to find peace and a slice of the American dream, settling in Springfield, Ohio.'I stay here,' Moise told CBS News. 'I do two jobs to make my business. That's why I don't go back to Haiti.'Moise saved money for years and recently opened a restaurant. She is one of the thousands of Haitian migrants building a life in Springfield who now find themselves in the crosshairs of the incoming Trump administration. 'I stay here,' Moise told CBS News. 'I do two jobs to make my business. That's why I don't go back to Haiti.'Moise saved money for years and recently opened a restaurant. She is one of the thousands of Haitian migrants building a life in Springfield who now find themselves in the crosshairs of the incoming Trump administration. Moise saved money for years and recently opened a restaurant. She is one of the thousands of Haitian migrants building a life in Springfield who now find themselves in the crosshairs of the incoming Trump administration. Moise, like most fellow Haitians in Springfield, is here legally through Temporary Protected Status, which Trump has vowed to end. The TPS program allows federal officials to grant deportation relief and work authorization to migrants from countries beset by war, environmental disaster or another 'extraordinary' crisis. Is CBS News in favor of the president circumventing Congress and the courts? Do they believe the ""temporary"" in ""Temporary Protected Status"" actually means ""forever""? Is Moise actually at risk of being deported, considering that Trump has repeatedly said he wants hard-working immigrants to continue to come to America, just not illegally? Moise says she knows about 10 friends and neighbors who have recently left Springfield, along with several restaurant employees.  Trump's not even in office yet and Springfield is already seeing relief! Here's where some people will accuse me of being mean and uncharitable.No. What I'm doing is pointing out how CBS News is trying to manipulate you with emotions, and jarring you out of the propaganda takes a bit of brute force.A recent YouGov survey of Americans found that 73% approve of mass deportation and 57% agree with deporting ALL illegal aliens.As the writer of this particular article, I've personally resettled refugees. I've worked on multi-million-dollar grants to assist in war-torn nations overseas. My church sponsors a village in Haiti!Are we evil and mean ... or might we be operating on compassion for our neighbors who have been drastically affected by importing the entire world into their neighborhoods?A truly compassionate person might say we should find a path that leads to good outcomes for both our neighbor and the refugee.Faith is fueling Moise's motivation to remain in Springfield and run her restaurant, while her business and her future hang in the balance.'We're hoping that everything works out the way it's supposed to work out,' she said.

This is Ryan Borgwardt, a 45-year-old man from Watertown, Wisconsin. You might remember him from this story we published a few weeks back:  This adventure began on August 12th when Ryan vanished while kayaking in Green Lake, Wisconsin. Authorities searched for 54 days, spending nearly $40,000 in the process, assuming he'd drowned in the lake. But it turns out that Ryan wasn't at the bottom of the lake! He was basically living out a weird Eastern European spy thriller fantasy in Europe. ""Great news, we know that he's alive and well,"" said Green Lake County Sheriff Mark Podoll in a press conference. ""And, well, the bad news is that we don't know where Ryan exactly is, and he has not decided to return home."" Ryan has been in touch with investigators via email and even sent a video to prove he's alive. In the clip, he casually says, ""I'm in my apartment. I am safe, secure.""  The case was cracked back in early October, with investigators discovering that he had staged his August kayak flipping, paddled to shore in what was described as a child-size inflatable boat, and hopped on an e-bike to a bus station. From there, it was Detroit to Canada to a plane bound for Europe. And all this while syncing his laptop to the cloud, replacing his hard-drive and scrubbing his search history. What are the chances ""how do you fake your death"" was a recent search? Then there's the $375,000 life insurance policy he conveniently took out in January, the foreign bank account, and the airline cards. Oh, and a mysterious woman in Uzbekistan.  Now, police are trying to persuade Ryan to return home to his devastated family. ""Christmas is coming, and what better gift he could give his kids is to be there for Christmas with them,"" Podell said. Because nothing says holiday cheer like Dad flying home after faking his death and fleeing the country for a months-long bender in Uzbekistan.  Follow Ian on Substack or X (@ighaworth).

CBS News and YouGov polling shows that the American people, despite media hysterics, have a generally positive view of the future in Trump's America and are supportive of his agenda. What's somewhat surprising, however, is how many Americans want the deportations to begin, quickly.  That's about 3 out of 4 Americans who want Donald Trump to start the mass deportation program soon.  45% think it's a high priority, 28% say medium priority which = 73% say it's a priority.  Now, of course, you have to dig for this number. Here's how CBS covered this polling subject in their writeup.  Even this has to be mind-blowing for CBS, because that's a majority of Americans who think Trump needs to start rounding up ALL illegal immigrants for deportation. Never mind the 3/4 of the country who want to make deportation a priority. One thing that is clear, however, is that Americans say they'd be fine with deportations ... unless the military gets involved.  (Because American soldiers are supposed to be used for fighting pointless wars overseas, not protecting the homeland!)  These reflect the numbers now, before deportations start. When CBS and the news mafia start running photos of crying border crossers being put into vans, expect these numbers to drop quickly. Additionally, the poll found 55% of Americans are happy or satisfied with Trump's victory, 59% are happy with Trump's transition efforts so far, and 52% support Trump's tariff plans.

And (2) what can my company or organization do to prevent war?…If we can make sure that all crucial services and goods can be delivered no matter what, then that is a key part of our deterrence. Deterrence is much wider than the military alone. When it comes to great power competition, all instruments of power can and will be used.…Businesses need to be prepared for a wartime scenario and adjust their production and distribution lines accordingly.

Jeffrey Arthur Moynihan Jr., 56, of Florida, tricked an elderly Texas woman into believing she'd befriended Elon Musk on Facebook and then he stole at least $250,000 from her by tricking her into investing in his business. His business, she would later find out, was scamming her out of hundreds of thousands of dollars. A Florida man has been arrested after impersonating tech billionaire Elon Musk in a bid to scam an elderly woman out of at least a quarter of a million dollars, according to police …While reportedly operating under the guise of the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, the 56-year-old businessman befriended the victim, a 74-year-old Texas resident, on Facebook and began messaging her in 2023.The victim was allegedly promised a $55 million return on investment.

The victim was allegedly promised a $55 million return on investment. ""Elon"" began messaging her on Facebook in 2023, and built rapport with the elderly woman by giving her regular updates on how Elon was doing. Moynihan used up-to-date news on the real Elon Musk to formulate these updates. Eventually, he reached out to the elderly woman offering her an investment in his business. Records obtained by authorities show the victim transferred $250,000 to accounts belonging to Moynihan and his own business, Jeff's Painting and Pressure Washing LLC. Yeah, I'm thinking Elon Musk doesn't spend his time on painting and pressure washing. Though I could be wrong. The woman's husband claims she sent the man $600,000, though there's no telling where the rest of that money went if it was, in fact, part of the scam. Here's how authorities caught wind of this: Detective Jim Curulla of the Bradenton police was tipped off by authorities in Frisco, Texas, who were investigating an incident in which a woman had reportedly given a large sum of money away to an entity posing as the tech billionaire, according to a department spokesperson.Nearly half of that money could be traced back to banks in Bradenton, and the accounts were determined to belong to Moynihan, the spokesperson continued.

But can anyone answer me why they're making everything about the Wicked movie gay? Why is this all about being gay?  Ariana Grande: I love my queer brothers and sisters so much, more than anything ... Oz is a very queer place and has always been. Even from the L. Frank Baum books it's always been queer ... gay!  And the movie? Well, I've watched the original Wizard of Oz a few dozen times. It's not ""queer"" or ""gay,"" unless you're using those terms' original meanings, where queer meant ""weird"" and gay meant ""happy."" Let's turn to this second clip to see if we can get any further clues on what these cast members meant.    Anyway, a fantastical book about family, courage, and seeing through the duplicitous schemes of politicians and economists ... is apparently about being super gay. And don't you forget it!

Normally, if a male police officer were to conduct a strip-search of a female suspect, it would be considered sexual assault. Authorised in September by the assistant chief constable for network policing, it reads: 'British Transport Police recognises the status of transgender and non-binary detainees/staff from the moment they permanently identify in that gender with or without a GRC. (It would be fun to join the British police for the sole purpose of identifying as something different every hour, just to clown them)  'This means that even when a person has not legally changed their sex, we should continue to use the correct pronouns and recognise the person's gender. BTP officers/staff will only search persons of the same sex as either their birth certificate or GRC.' The Transport Police tried to implement the new guidance back in January, but were stopped by the conservative government of Rishi Sunak. However, in July the far-left Labour Party took control, and this is what the British people have won for voting in the side that systemically hates women. Here he was a decade or so ago:  Then he was featured in a puff piece to try to normalize allowing men with mental illnesses and fetishes to police their communities:  And then he was celebrated for ""blazing a trail"":  And now he's speaking in a weird voice with crazy eyes:  Cathy Larkman, retired police superintendent and national policing lead for the Women's Rights Network, said, She said: 'British Transport Police think that the possession of a GRC conveys some sort of right for a male officer to strip-search a woman, or for a female officer to be pressurised into searching a male detainee.'Their eagerness to bring this in despite the clear warnings made indicates that they have forgotten about women's rights, or at best that these can be dispensed with. But women have human rights too.'It is appalling that police chiefs are so intent on disregarding the law and shocking that it is left to women to hold them to account and to remind them that not so long ago, they promised to rebuild women's trust. Those were hollow words.'This is state-sanctioned sexual assault and police chiefs have lost their mind bringing this in. They have failed women, it is absolutely unforgivable. It cannot go on.'

The contest was to be held in the city of Matsue, backdropped by the historic Matsue Castle.  We are seeking participants for a seppuku contest to be held at the Dandan Terrace at Matsue City Hall on December 14 (Saturday). After committing seppuku with a plastic sword, please demonstrate your acting skills by writhing around for 30 seconds to one minute. The person with the most vivid performance will be named the champion! *The use of fake blood is prohibited.  Matsue Castle was constructed in the late 1600s by the feudal lord Horio Yoshiharu. Just look at how beautiful this place is:  No doubt a few harakiri ceremonies involving disgraced samurai took place inside those walls. So, it seemed like a great setting for the contest in a land known for their absurd contests.  But even the Japanese need to draw the line on entertainment somewhere.  The flea market organizers said, Our core concern for this event [the flea market] was how to attract customers. I've organized various events with vendors, and the idea [for the seppuku contest] came from a girl in one group who stabbed herself in the stomach with a retractable [toy] sword that she was selling. We thought it would be interesting to use the toy for that kind of acting performance.I would like to apologize to the involved party at city hall for causing such a disturbance from something we intended to serve as entertainment. On the other hand, we have also received emails from people saying they approve of the idea and want to participate, but we feel that holding it could contribute to a loss of trust from city hall, and so we are cancelling the contest.

The bottle was found washed up on the shore of Lake Saint Clair, close to where Makenzie Van Eyk (formerly Morris) and her classmates at St. John the Baptist Catholic Elementary School in Ontario had dropped off their bottles.  Now, Van Eyk is a mom who sends her own children there. Her daughter Scarlet just happens to be in fourth grade, the same grade that Makenzie was when she wrote the message in the bottle back in 1998.  At the time, Makenzie was in Roland St. Pierre's fourth-grade class. St Pierre told GMA that he remembered the project well, saying, We had done a study on the Great Lakes and the water unit, and I read to them the book 'Paddle to the Sea.' … From that, I gave them a writing assignment where they had to identify themselves and write up little things about what they learned. Then, we walked it over to the lake, and they all threw their bottles in the water. And a few weeks later, we received one response from Tecumseh, which is about 10 miles from here, but then, that was it, until two weeks ago.   The bottle didn't travel very far at all during its 26-year journey, but it was found by those who would appreciate it most and in a very unexpected way. Van Eyk told GMA, When I initially heard that the letter had been found, I was very shocked, something you don't expect to be found 26 years later. For it to be found, especially by a child who goes to this school, was really exciting and memorable.

Yeah, a group of people are making a petition to try to convince the folks at Georgetown that forcing this young mother to take this exam on campus within days of giving birth is, you know, insane! Brittany requested to either take the exam early, before giving birth, or at home after giving birth. But the school is going to force her to bring her baby to class to take the exam with her DAYS after birth. But don't worry, it isn't totally crazy. They aren't giving her absolutely no accommodations. Georgetown Law suggested Brittany bring her days-old child to campus a few days after birth, with minimal recovery, to take the exam with more time so she can breastfeed her newborn baby during the exam. They told her, ""Motherhood is not for the Faint of Heart.""   Because when I'm taking a law exam, in class, I would love the convenience of stopping, leaving the room (while on the clock) and feeding my 5-day-old baby. Why not?  And then, to add to it all, that departing shot that ""Motherhood is not for the Faint of Heart""? What the heck is that? We used to have a proper society that doted upon new mothers, that would do whatever it took to treat a lady properly. Now they can't even move an exam date at Georgetown law!?  I'm sure if there was an election the day before Georgetown would have let her take the day off and skip the exam, or take it from home.  But they won't give time off to have a baby? You have to bring your brand new baby to a smelly and germy old law school. That's the rules. We don't want our ""non-birthing"" students put out.  I'm just saying, it seems like our society is going out of its way to be anti-child now.

	The Cowboys led 20-9 with just over three minutes to play and ended up with a 34-26 win thanks to the dumbest finish to a game this year.","The Commanders and Cowboys played in. one of the funniest games in the NFL this season, as the two divisional rivals went back and forth with each team being on the wrong end of some massive blunders in what ended up a 34-26 Cowboys win.  The final three minutes was particularly insane, as it saw the game go from 20-9 Dallas to 34-26 with a truly outrageous sequence of events. The first was a touchdown from Jayden Daniels to Zach Ertz, with Daniels running in the two-point try to make it 20-17. On the ensuing kickoff, Kavontae Turpin let the ball bounce in front of him and had it roll past him for a near-disaster, before turning it into a touchdown return with a quick spin move and outrageous speed, making it 27-17.   A post shared by NFL (@nfl)  The Commanders would then kick a field goal with just under two minutes to play to make it 27-20. A failed onside kick figured to be about the end of things, but it was truly just the beginning. Washington’s defense got the three-and-out needed to give their offense a chance at a miracle, and Daniels delivered for the second time this season as Dallas’ defense melted down, allowing Terry McLaurin to catch the ball and evade everyone on his way for an 87-yard touchdown. However, Austin Seibert had already missed an extra point earlier in the game, so it was anything but a guarantee they would tie the game, and sure enough a bad snap led to a rushed operation and Seibert hooked another left of the uprights to keep it a 1-point game (videos below).   A post shared by NFL (@nfl)  On the ensuing onside kick, the Cowboys scooped it up and ran it back for a touchdown, which was the one thing that could keep the Commanders hopes alive, as they would get the ball back with time on the clock and a chance at another Hail Mary. Alas, this time Daniels’ efforts at a miracle ended up being caught by Dallas and the game finally ended with a Cowboys win that became far more difficult than it ever needed to be."

	Fred VanVleet did not like getting ejected and definitely earned a fine with how he went out at the end of Blazers-Rockets.","The Houston Rockets have had a phenomenal start to the 2024-25 season, entering Saturday’s game against Portland at 12-5 on the young season, but things did not go as planned against the scrappy, young Blazers in a 104-98 loss.  The frustrations of that loss were evident late in the fourth quarter when Fred VanVleet got ejected after getting into it with the officials, telling them all that they suck, but then took things a step further after getting run by walking directly to the official that tossed him, pointing in his face, and telling him “you’re a b*tch.”  pic.twitter.com/wtHPtHgSMc — Diamond Scar (@diamondscar22) November 24, 2024  From the TV angle, it wasn’t clear if VanVleet made contact with the official’s face, which was of concern to the Rockets broadcast crew as that would’ve been an auto-suspension. However, a side angle showed that he did not make contact, but did still point his finger right in the ref’s face in a moment that wasn’t exactly his finest. This will definitely lead to VanVleet paying a hefty fine to the league office, and we’ll have to wait and see if, even without actually poking the ref, this crossed enough of a line to earn him a night off without pay. VanVleet is averaging 14.9 points and 6.2 assists per game this season for Houston."

	The Warriors tend to have very good seasons when Kendrick Lamar puts out an album.","Kendrick Lamar stunned everyone on Friday afternoon. There had been hopes for months that a new album was on the way following his high-profile feud with Drake, and it looked like we were going to get another sign that something big was on the horizon when he released the music video for “GNX.” And then, Kendrick took things a step further by just releasing his sixth studio album, which is also titled “GNX.” Because it is an album that Kendrick Lamar released out of nowhere, people went from being stunned to praising the project. And it’s possible that no one ends up being happier about this than the Golden State Warriors. Why, you may ask? Well, as it turns out, good things tend to happen to the Warriors — which entered Friday night’s game against the New Orleans Pelicans with an 11-3 record, good for first place in the Western Conference — when Kendrick puts out an album. Each of the last four times that has happened, the team has gone on to win an NBA championship, with To Pimp a Butterfly coming out in March 2015, Damn. getting released in April 2017, and Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers dropping in April 2022. There was also the soundtrack to Black Panther, which came out in February 2018 and featured songs that were either performed or curated by Kendrick. As for his other two studio albums, Section.80 and good kid, m.A.A.d city, the former came out a few weeks after they drafted Klay Thompson, and the latter was released in Oct. 2012, one week before the start of the 2012-13 NBA season, which marked the first time that Golden State made it to the postseason with Steph Curry on the team. Now, the overwhelming likelihood is that this is a bunch of insane coincidences, but if the Warriors do end up winning a championship, we’re going to think something weird is going on … and Kendrick will probably be a little bummed, as he’s a well-documented fan of the Los Angeles Lakers, which are currently the 4-seed in the West and find themselves 1.5 games back of Golden State."

	Jones, the No. 6 overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, was benched by the Giants earlier this week.","The New York Giants made the decision to bench starting quarterback Daniel Jones earlier this week amid a brutal year where the offense has struggled to find any sort of consistent rhythm. Now, in a shocking turn of events, the team announced on Friday afternoon that the sixth overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft asked for and was granted his immediate release. In a statement, which you can read in its entirely below, Giants president John Mara praised Jones for his handling of his benching, and made clear that parting ways was a mutual decision. Daniel came to see me this morning and asked if we would release him. We mutually agreed that would be the best for him and for the team.  Daniel has been a great representative of our organization, first class in every way. His handling of this situation yesterday exemplifies just that. We are all disappointed in how things have worked out.  We hold Daniel in high regard and have a great appreciation for him. We wish him nothing but the best in the future. Jones has had a tumultuous tenure in New York, as the decision to draft him that high was largely based on his perceived upside. While he’s certainly flashed the ability to be an accurate passer and a threat with his legs — so much so that the team gave him a $160 million extension in 2023 that was cited as a reason why they could not bring back Saquon Barkley in free agency this offseason — he’s never been able to become the face of the franchise the team envisioned. The Giants sit at 2-8 on the season, and are playing host to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday afternoon. The team has already announced that Tommy DeVito will start under center. To add some intrigue to this, the Giants face the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving this year. Dallas has had its own QB struggles this season as Dak Prescott is out for the year with the injury, and if they wanted, it would make sense to bring in Jones and try to get him up to speed ahead of Thursday."

	Miller made one of the best defensive plays you will ever see to stop an alley-oop by the Pistons.","The Charlotte Hornets and the Detroit Pistons squared off on Thursday night in a battle of two up-and-coming teams that hope to take a step forward in the Eastern Conference this season. While neither of them are expected to compete for a championship or anything, both are built around promising young players and hope that better days are on the horizon. One of the brightest young stars in Thursday’s game was Brandon Miller, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft who flashed as a rookie and has built on that in a big way during his second year in the league. Unfortunately for the Pistons, that meant finding out that Miller is a freak of nature, as evidenced by him making one of the best defensive plays you will ever see when he single-handedly blew up an attempted alley-oop by picking a Wendell Moore lob out of mid-air.  A post shared by NBA (@nba)  If Miller became horizontal during this, it’d look an awful lot like Odell Beckham Jr.’s famous one-handed catch from when he played for the Giants. Anyway, the Hornets won in overtime, 123-121, with Miller leading the way, as the former Alabama standout went for 38 points, seven rebounds, four assists, four steals, and a block in 42 minutes of work."

	Gobert got a 3-second call as he pouted over not getting the ball late in a tie game, and Anthony Edwards was not happy.","The Minnesota Timberwolves were one of the best teams and stories of the 2023-24 season, as Anthony Edwards made the leap into superstardom, Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert figured out how to play off of each other around him, and they made a run to the Western Conference Finals.  The vibes in Minnesota were, as they say, immaculate, but then a week before training camp they traded Towns to New York for Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo in a trade that has seen both the Knicks and Wolves struggling to build chemistry early in the season. Both teams are still hovering around .500, but the Knicks can get away with that in the East and still have a good look at a top-4 seed. In the West things are very different, as the Wolves came into Thursday’s game in Toronto with a tenuous hold on sixth at 8-6, needing a win to avoid dropping to a tie for 10th early this season.  In theory, the 3-12 Raptors should’ve been a good spot to get a win for the Wolves, but Minnesota found themselves in a dogfight with Toronto (on their incredible alternate court) late in the fourth quarter. With the game tied at 95-95 and five minutes to play, the Wolves chemistry issues became apparent when Randle waved off Gobert who had deep post position under the hoop, and the 4-time DPOY responded by walking to the other side of the lane to get a 3-second violation.   A post shared by LeagueAlerts Inc. (@leaguealerts)  While Gobert’s frustration is understandable, as he had two feet in the restricted area with a seal on a smaller defender and didn’t get the ball, you also can’t purposefully get a turnover in a tie game in the fourth quarter. That was what Anthony Edwards was thinking, as he got on Gobert as they came down the floor, letting him know that’s not an acceptable reaction to not getting the ball. That turnover proved to be important as the Wolves saw the Raptors pull away late for a 110-105 win, dropping Minnesota to 8-7 and a tie for 10th in the West with Dallas and Sacramento."

	To celebrate Hubie Brown calling it a career, we looked back on how old he was during major events that happened in his lifetime.","Basketball fans are going to see broadcasts get a little worse sooner rather than later. That’s because Hubie Brown, the legendary former coach who has turned into a stalwart on ESPN’s coverage of the league, will only call one more game before he retires at 91 years old. “We are going to give Hubie one last shot on a game,” ESPN president Burke Magnus told Jimmy Traina of Sports Illustrated. “He deserves that. We think the world of him. I think it is absolutely remarkable the level in which he still calls games at age 90-plus. I don’t mean to be purposely mysterious here but we are going to honor Hubie during the regular season at some point to be determined and send him off in style.” That he is still capable of working at 91 is remarkable, but Brown is still sharp as a tack and as good as it gets calling basketball games, and while no one has deserved retirement more, it’s always a tough day when someone as highly-regarded as him calls it a career. There is, still, no one better at seeing something, pointing it out, and explaining why it’s a big deal than Brown, and he has terrific chemistry with his broadcast partners. We’re all going to miss Hubie, and to celebrate the end of his time in the booth, we wanted to celebrate him by having some fun and looking at everything he’s seen over his extraordinary life. You see, Hubie was born on Sept. 25, 1933, which means he has been around for, quite literally, every single game that the NBA has played — the league was founded in June of 1946, when he was 12 years old. That got us wondering: How old was he during some of the biggest moments in world, American, and NBA history over the last century or so? Let’s dive in. Start of WWII: 5 years old (Sept. 1, 1939)
End of WWII: 11 years old (Sept. 2, 1945)
The first NBA game: 13 years old (Nov. 1, 1946)
Jackie Robinson breaks baseball’s color barrier: 13 years old (April 15, 1947)

Wilt Chamberlain plays in his first NBA game: 26 years old (Oct. 24, 1959)
John F. Kennedy Assassination: 30 years old (Nov. 22, 1963)
Super Bowl I: 34 years old (Jan. 15, 1967)
First moon landing: 36 years old (July 20, 1969) End of the Vietnam War: 41 years old (April 30, 1975)
Hubie Brown’s first game as an NBA head coach with the Atlanta Hawks: 42 years old (Oct. 21, 1976)
The first time Larry Bird and Magic Johnson played in the NBA Finals: 51 years old (May 27, 1984)
First NBA Draft Lottery: 52 years old (May 12, 1985)

	ESPN content president Burke Magnus explained that the network's biggest star ending up on its newest property is a bit tricky.","ESPN has about a year to figure out how it’s going to handle Inside the NBA. As part of Warner Bros. Discovery’s deal to remain in the NBA’s media ecosystem, it was announced that Turner will continue to produce Inside, but license it out to ESPN, which solves the network’s longstanding issues trying to put together a pregame, halftime, and postgame NBA show that viewers enjoy. An unsurprising question that popped up after this was whether Stephen A. Smith — who is in the middle of some high-profile contract negotiations with ESPN — would find a way onto the show. Smith is the guy ESPN has built its NBA coverage around, and while that has come under plenty of criticism, he’s famously close with the Inside crew and has appeared on it in the past. But apparently, as of now, the network doesn’t have any intetion of putting Stephen A. on their newest property. “We have no plans to do that,” ESPN content president Burke Magnus told Jimmy Traina of Sports Illustrated. “And that’s because, frankly, the construct of the deal really doesn’t — that’s not how it was conceived. What is conceived is that Turner, as they have always done with this show, with this cast, with the people involved behind the scenes, are going to continue to do what they’ve always done. And we’re going to distribute it on the ESPN platform. Frankly, that’s exactly what we want. We don’t want to change it. We don’t want to interject new talent into it. We don’t want to really do anything to it.” It is worth mentioning that the scuttlebutt around Smith’s contract negotiations revolves around him wanting to do more NFL stuff for ESPN, but considering how big Inside is and his relationship with the guys, it is fair to wonder if he’d want to have any sort of presence on the show as part of a new deal (if, of course, he comes to terms with the network on one). For now, the complexities of the deal with Turner gives ESPN a way to say they have no plans of putting him on Inside in any capacity, but we’ll certainly be waiting to see if that changes as Smith and ESPN sit down at the negotiating table.

	Come get these winners.","In many circles, Week 11 has been described as the best slate of games so far when it comes to the 2024 NFL season, and it is hard to argue. There was entertaining action in every window other than Monday night and, on a week-to-week basis, that is not always the case. In this space, we also found success with a third winning week in the last four. Granted, it came with a hilarious investment in a team that lost by approximately 100, but a loss counts the same by a half-point or 30 points, right? Before we get to the Week 12 schedule and five picks against the spread, let’s take a look at the (unfortunately negative) season-long progress. Come get these winners. We struck with our principles last Thursday to success, and we’re doing it again here. It is unsightly to bet on Cleveland right now, and I won’t argue that. The Browns are 2-8 and having a season from hell. With that said, the market is too high on the Steelers in this spot. Pittsburgh continues to be unreal in an underdog role under Mike Tomlin, but the Steelers are 33-41-3 (44.6%) as a road favorite under his watch. Do I think the games from 2008 impact this week? I do not, but I can’t get this to more than a field goal on a short week in Cleveland. Let’s go Browns. This is a space that prides itself on taking the stands that few others will take. This is another example. The Lions are dominating everyone. We found that out the hard way last week. But this is really a 7.5-point number on the road? Detroit’s ATS record (8-2) is stellar but things have gone too far. Or maybe we’ll lose this bet and swear off fading the Lions for a while. Either way, I like the home dog here. Our Wong teaser of the week is here. Tennessee’s defense has been spunky this season, but the Titans still have Will Levis and a rudderless offense that gives us hope in the Texans at home with the move through key numbers. On the other side, I’ve actually been a touch low on the 49ers compared to the market this season and, while that has been the right stance on the whole, this is a principle play to take it up to 8.5. Remember when the 12th Man meant something? Well, the Seahawks are 2-4 at home this season, and the word is out on that. While I am not suggesting that home-field advantage is the reason for this play, I like Seattle to keep it going after a strong performance in an upset over San Francisco a week ago. Arizona is off a bye and on a four-game winning streak but, no matter what I do, I can’t get this to a pick’em, much less than +1 available at BetMGM right now. I don’t give out many road favorites, but I tend to make exceptions for when the Chargers are the home team. Granted, a lot has changed in Los Angeles, with Jim Harbaugh immediately turning the Chargers into a very competent and effective outfit. However, the Chargers still might have the least significant home-field advantage in the NFL, and Baltimore is at least slightly undervalued here coming off a loss to Pittsburgh."

	Charles Barkley wasn't gonna let the night go by without making a joke about their upcoming move to ESPN next fall.","Over the weekend, some exciting news broke regarding the future of Inside the NBA, as ESPN is adding the beloved studio show as part of a new licensing agreement with Warner Bros. Discovery. The show will continue to be produced independently by TNT Sports from their Atlanta studio, with Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, Shaquille O’Neal, and Charles Barkley remaining employees of WBD — well, so long as they get Shaq’s contract done — but they’ll be part of ESPN and ABC’s coverage of the Playoffs, Finals, and major regular season games. That was stunning news to many fans, largely because ESPN has been trying to figure out how to create a competitor to Inside for decades to no avail, and the fellas have never been afraid of making fun of ESPN — particularly Barkley. Chuck has taken ESPN and their analysts to tasks a number of times over the years, and while I doubt that stops in total, he knows times are changing soon for he and the rest of the fellas. On Tuesday night, after the Spurs beat the Thunder in the late game on TNT, Chuck couldn’t help but crack a joke to Kenny Smith that they’ve gotta “go back to kissing ass” ahead of their move to ESPN next fall.  No one has been more outspoken over the last six months about the contract negotiations with the NBA than Barkley, sometimes to the chagrin of his colleagues. He’s been extremely vocal about his frustrations with TNT not keeping NBA rights and has noted his biggest concern is trying to figure out how to keep everyone at TNT employed. That mission seems to have been accomplished with this latest news of the show being licensed to ESPN, and he showed still going to be Chuck and poke fun at the new arrangement."

	Another case of Vince Staples, being Vince Staples.","Vince Staples isn’t afraid to voice his opinion regarding anything and anyone. No one is exempt from the “Little Homies” rapper’s blunt takes—not fellow musicians, fans, or content creators. Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum is the latest person to feel his humorous wrath. Today (November 19), Vince Staples and Jayson Tatum came face-to-face in a new commercial for the Jordan brand (viewable here). Instead of using his beloved lyricism on full display, Vince channelled his words for another reason. As highlights of Tatum’s Championship season took over the screen, Vince gave Tatum a piece of his mind. “What type of dude is Jayson Tatum,” asked Vince. “The type of dude who’d crush a team and then say some cold sh*t like, ‘We just played our game and the rest took care of itself.'” As Vince pointed out, Tatum is a many of few words but when he does speak out against his opponents it cuts deeps. However, Tatum manages to keep a cool head or so Vince argued, saying: “The type that have a whole city and internet, booing him. And he’s just smiling.” Before the clip ends, Vince has one more grievance to air as a long-suffering Los Angeles Clippers fan. “That sh*t really message me up, man,” he said.  Unfazed by it all, Tatum laughs off Vince’s monologue. In Tatum’s eyes, it doesn’t matter who hates him because his partner, singer Ella Mai and their child provides more than enough love to make up for it."

	After a loss dropped the Sixers to 2-11 on the year, the team held a players-only meeting where Maxey voiced a gripe about Embiid.","The Philadelphia 76ers have been the biggest disappointment in the NBA to start the 2024-25 season. While there have been injuries to Joel Embiid, Paul George, and Tyrese Maxey that have prevented them from taking the court as a trio, Philadelphia has gotten off to a 2-11 start this year, which is tied with the openly tanking Washington Wizards for the worst record in the NBA. For a team that entered this season with championship aspirations, it’s pretty shocking to see just how bad Philly has been. And following a 106-89 loss to the Miami Heat on Monday night where the team blew a 19-point lead, Kyle Lowry called for a players-only meeting, according to Shams Charania of ESPN. And per Charania, the meeting included Maxey confronting Embiid with a message that the former NBA MVP “accepted.” Via ESPN: In the meeting, Maxey challenged Embiid to be on time to team activities, calling out the former league MVP about being late “for everything” and how it impacts the locker room, from other players to the coaching staff, sources briefed on the meeting told ESPN. Maxey and Embiid have a close friendship and have a history of holding each other accountable, according to those around the team. Embiid was listed as doubtful to play against the Heat with an illness, but eventually took the floor and struggled, going for 11 points, eight rebounds, and five assists in 31 minutes of work on 5-for-11 shooting from the field. Maxey, meanwhile, was unable to play, as he’s working his way back from a hamstring strain he suffered earlier this season. Charania also noted that Sixers players addressed head coach Nick Nurse, saying that “they want to be coached harder, and coaches in turn said they want players to practice with purpose and attention to detail.”"

	Powerhouse Hobbs has a list of aspirations after spending seven months out with a knee injury.","Powerhouse Hobbs wasn’t sure how fans were going to receive his return. Recency bias is a real thing in the wrestling industry, and any extended absence comes with the reality that you’re out of sight and out of mind.  When he walked out of the tunnel to the roar of the live audience as Ricochet’s surprise partner just two weeks ago, any anxiety over what the reaction would look like evaporated. For Hobbs, it was like he’d never left.  “It was one of those things where it let me know how special this business is, how special the fans are,” Hobbs tells Uproxx Sports. “When it comes down to it, we do it for them. We do it for their entertainment. We do it for their reactions. We do it because we love it. We all love to go out and perform in front of them. But then when they go ahead and give you that love back, man, it makes you want to go even harder.” As smooth as he looked in his return to the ring, the prior seven months were anything but easy.  He ruptured his patella tendon in a main event match, going from the high of being prominently featured on television on Wednesday night to having surgery the following Monday. The next day, he flew across the country, and just a week later was back in the gym determined to return stronger.  “I probably had a few days to be in my feelings and soak everything in,” Hobbs says. “But my main objective was to come back better than when I left. This recovery, I would get up at five, eat, in the gym by six on one leg for two hours, come home, eat, then off to PT for three hours a day, Monday through Saturday.” There were moments Hobbs says he felt helpless. He couldn’t bend his knee at all. He remembers the emotions of asking his three-year-old daughter to help take his sock off, asking his son to help him stand, or making sure he had something to hold onto so he didn’t fall in the shower.  The experience, Hobbs says, humbled him. Small accomplishments compounded. A strong support system that included conversations with wrestling legends like Sting, Mark Henry, and Billy Gunn helped him prepare for the ups, downs, and evolving mindset in how he’d navigate his return.  In his time away, Hobbs focused on the things he could control and put extra effort on how he could elevate other areas of his game.  “I got a lot of promos just sitting on the couch watching wrestling. I was very angry, not being able to do what I want to do,” Hobbs says.  Practicing patience is something Hobbs has had to learn over his four years in AEW, and especially now in what’s essentially a fresh start. You can’t manufacture many of the special moments in wrestling — they’re going to happen organically, like the infamous Meat chants last year. “You’re going to hear the people tell you what they want,” Hobbs says, “so it’s on you to capitalize on it.” Hearing the crowd react to his return, and feeding off their energy over the past few weeks, should give him confidence that he’ll be able to be successful in his career refresh. He created a list of aspirations during his time away, including another singles championship reign.  There’s no order to how he goes about checking off his accomplishments, but admits the primary focus is a “longer, stronger reign.” His path to wearing championship gold again comes with confidence, believing in himself, and turning the volume up on his character.  Before his injury, Hobbs says there were discussions about how he could start bringing who he is in real life to his character. Now that he’s had time to sit and stew on the future, he’s ready to show the world who he is.  “I’m going to start bringing my life into my character, the things that I hate, the things that I love. I’m just gonna show everyone how much more intense I can be, how destructive I can be, how I don’t give a shit at times who’s in my way,” Hobbs says. “In the end, this business, there only can be one. It’s going to come to a point where I’m going to show everybody that it’s all about me. They’re either going to be with me or be against me. It doesn’t matter. They boo me, I’m just going to start tearing everything up in front of them.  “And I think that’s what wrestling is missing a little bit. That one guy who makes people afraid, but they want to see him kick someone’s ass. I feel that it’s time to bring it out.”"

	Jake Paul's boxing fit in his match against Mike Tyson was one of the most expensive in boxing history. Here is what he wore.","Over the weekend, social media sensation turned legit boxer Jake Paul faced off against the mighty (if aged) Mike Tyson, attracting the eyes of 60 million viewers for what was undoubtedly the fight of the year. The two fighters, aged 27 and 58 respectively, lasted the entire eight rounds, with Paul ultimately besting Iron Mike, crushing the hearts of pretty much everybody over the age of 30. But we’re not here to talk about the fight, we’re here to talk about Jake Paul’s fit, which Paul revealed on the “Talk Tuah” podcast was worth over $1 million. “This outfit that I’ve made for the fight is the most expensive fight outfit in the history of boxing,” said Paul. The fit was a custom piece designed by Dominic Ciambrone’s Surgeon Studios and featured metallic silver shorts with diamond tennis chains, and a graphic of Mr. Monopoly holding a money bag. The full outfit was completed with a jewel-encrusted gray jacket prominently featuring the logo of Paul’s new body care line W. It’s flashy, brash, and eye-catching, a perfect reflection of Paul’s whole vibe. Love him or hate him, you can’t deny that this fight helped to solidify Paul’s status as a pop culture icon of the 2020s, and despite Tyson’s advanced age, being able to go toe to toe with the GOAT and come out on top is no easy feat. This is also a big win for Ciambrone, who we’ve been keeping a close eye on since the days he was simply referred to as the Shoe Surgeon. Check out the fit in action below."

	Tyrese Haliburton took over the NBA Cup last year. Which young, up-and-coming player is most likely to do that this year?","Tyrese Haliburton entered last season in an interesting spot. Yes, everyone knew he was a really good, really talented basketball player — he even made it onto the 2023 All-Star team. And yet, Haliburton was mostly a guy who did some cool things on a not great Indiana Pacers team, which came on the heels of him doing some cool things as a rookie and a second-year player on a not great Sacramento Kings team. And then, last season happened. More specifically, the inaugural NBA Cup (known at the time as the In-Season Tournament) happened, and Haliburton was the driving force behind an upstart Pacers team that took it to everyone and made the championship game, where they fell to the Los Angeles Lakers. It was the exact sort of springboard to stardom that a cup competition should provide, as a young, up-and-coming team led by a young, up-and-coming star went on a run and nearly won the whole thing. Haliburton averaged 26.7 points, 13.3 assists, and 4.9 rebounds in seven tournament games, and while he cooled off a bit as the year went on due to lingering injury issues, he was still able to use his NBA Cup performance as a springboard to an All-NBA Third Team nod and an appearance in the Eastern Conference Finals. Now, with this season’s NBA Cup underway, it’s worth wondering which young star is going to use this edition of the tournament as a way to assert themselves as a superstar, and today, we wanted to look at some of the frontrunners to do just that on teams that have already gotten off to good starts in Cup play. The Rockets have been one of the best up-and-coming teams in the league so far this season, and while you can toss a few guys in as their answer (Jalen Green would be a good fit here, too), we’ll go with Sengun, who was great last year but was sidelined with an injury during their big run later in the calendar. Anyone who watches Houston knows that Sengun is good, but ever since they traded James Harden, the Rockets haven’t gotten a ton of attention. The NBA Cup is a chance to change that — they steamrolled the Clippers in their Group A opener last week — and if they can win their game in Minnesota next week, they’re going to be the overwhelming favorites to move out of their group. Add in that Houston has a net rating of +12.98 when Sengun is on the floor this season and while depth is one of their biggest strengths, we’re willing to bet that he’s the guy who will carry them to Cup wins if they come. Atlanta beating the Celtics in their NBA Cup opener was a shock, and they followed it up with a win over Washington in their second game. The craziest thing about the game against Boston: Trae Young didn’t play, as Daniels was a two-way menace (28 points, seven assists, six steals) and Johnson stuffed the stat sheet (18 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists, three steals, a block). Young is, obviously, the face in Atlanta, but on the heels of the Dejounte Murray trade, there’s space for someone to blossom into his star running mate. Daniels’ ability to just ruin opposing backcourts and Johnson’s ability to do anything Atlanta needs on a given night both fit well alongside him, and they’ll both have to be great if the Hawks go on a run. Things have been completely dire in Detroit for a while now, and as a result, Cunningham hasn’t lived up to his billing as a No. 1 overall pick. But things are starting to change — Detroit is 2-0 in Cup play, with Cunningham going for 21 points, nine assists, seven rebounds, and two blocks against the Heat before putting up a 21-point, 10-rebounds, 10-assist triple-double with five steals and a block against the Wizards. He has to cut down on his turnovers, but he’s spearheading the Pistons as they try to take a big step forward under JB Bickerstaff. So far, so good, and if Detroit goes on an improbable NBA Cup run, it’ll be because Cunningham took a big leap towards becoming the face of the franchise the Pistons have craved for years. The most likely option to go on a Haliburton-esque run. Orlando is 2-0 with wins over Charlotte and Philly, even though Paolo Banchero is out with a torn oblique. The ball has been in Wagner’s hands a lot as a result, and the decision has paid off in a big way. He’s starting to find his shot after he couldn’t hit anything last season, while he looks really comfortable as a scorer and a facilitator. The Magic being good without Banchero is only possible because of Wagner, and a trip to the knockout rounds of the NBA Cup is within reach — their game in New York on Dec. 3 looms large, and we cannot wait to see what Wagner does under the bright lights of Madison Square Garden. You might have heard this by now: The Cavs are the best team in basketball this year at 15-0, and they won their only NBA Cup game so far against Charlotte. All eyes are on Tuesday night’s trip to Boston to take on the defending champs, which is the exact sort of high-profile stage Cleveland could use to emphatically say they’re championship and NBA Cup contenders. A big reason for the success? Mobley, as the decision to bring Kenny Atkinson on board as head coach has led to him looking more comfortable on offense and his usual brilliant self on defense. He has to continue to do that if the Cavs are going to be championship contenders, and the NBA Cup is a great place for him to show that he’s taken a step forward in his fourth season. If you want, you can also make a case for Darius Garland here, who has been nothing short of spectacular this season and is showing why he’s one of the best young guards in the league. However, Garland has been an All-Star and Donovan Mitchell is a known commodity, so we’ll go with the young big man as the Cav most likely to turn heads.  The Thunder are in a tricky spot due to the injuries suffered by Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein, so it’s possible they are just not big enough to go on an NBA Cup run. If they can, though, our hunch is it’s because of Williams stepping up and being the perfect running mate alongside Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. He keeps getting better and better the more experience he gets under his belt, and so far this season, Williams has done that again, as he’s putting up career-best marks in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks per game. He won’t unseat Shai as the man in Oklahoma City any time soon, but the Thunder are the exact sort of team that can use the NBA Cup as a chance to announce their arrival to the rest of the league. Williams can do the same."

We pick up the HBCU Homecoming series with only a day left before Director of Bands Chancellor Mills gets to prove himself in his first year in the position with the help of more than 100 band members and his staff. “It’s all in the planning, first and foremost,” Mills said in preparation for the event. “We don’t want to throw anything together and just put it out there; it’s huge this year.” As Mills said, the planning is critical, as the pressure of the occasion couldn’t be any higher, with current students and alumni all expecting a great show. “This performance is just going to signify where this program is,” said Mills. “It’s going to dictate how we’re going to move for the next 3-5 years. It’s significant in terms of what we want to give back to our community.” Fortunately, the hard work pays off as the band comes out at halftime to give the crowd their best with renditions of hip-hop classics produced by Just Blaze, including Joe Budden’s “Pump it Up” and “What We Do” by Freeway, who appeared to perform the song in-person. “I’ve had my songs played at a million sporting events,” Blaze said of the performance. “This is just kind of a great add-on to that part of the legacy. It sounded amazing.” As Blaze says in the episode, the party was far from over after the performance. Check out additional footage from the band’s night performance and more to see how the performance was received."

	Apparently, Shaq is a little upset with things, although he would like to remain on the show.","Basketball fans got some pretty monumental news over the weekend. As part of the agreement that will keep Warner Bros. Discovery as one of the league’s broadcast partners during its upcoming media right deal, Turner Sports will continue to produce “Inside the NBA” but license the show out to ESPN, which will air it going forward. The deal officially got announced on Monday, and there are some pretty big questions that continue to hang over the agreement that ESPN and Turner will have to get sorted out between now and the start of the 2025-26 season. As it turns out, there’s one especially big one that hangs over the deal, as Jimmy Traina of Sports Illustrated reported that Shaquille O’Neal is out of a contract on July 1, 2025. And apparently, there’s a bit of tension on the Hall of Fame inductee’s side of things right now. While sources say Shaq wants to remain on the show, he’s frustrated that there has been congratulations and press releases hyping that Inside the NBA is remaining the same while he is currently not under contract to be with the company next season. As Traina noted, Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, and Charles Barkley all do other things for Turner, so their deals are different from Shaq’s, who exclusively does NBA work for the network. It goes without saying, but Inside without Shaq would not feel the same, although we’re optimistic that Draymond Green joining the show whenever his playing career ends would be a good fill-in for him. Still, whether it’s agreeing to another deal with Turner or working something out with ESPN, here’s hoping that Shaq is at the desk with the rest of the guys when Inside airs on the Worldwide Leader for the first time."

	There's no word on whether the league will have a high-profile halftime show for its other Christmas game.","The NFL has started to have a larger and larger presence on Christmas Day over the years. This season, the league will put a pair of marquee games on Dec. 25, as the Kansas City Chiefs will travel to Pittsburgh to Take on the Steelers in the 1 p.m window, while the Houston Texans will play host to the Baltimore Ravens at 4:30 p.m. ET. Late on Sunday night, the NFL decided to announce that it has something special up its sleeve for the late afternoon game, as it was revealed that Beyonce will perform at halftime in her hometown.  A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce)  There’s no word on whether the league has a similarly huge name lined up for the early game, but lining up Beyonce — who headlined the Super Bowl halftime show back in 2013 — for a performance during a showcase game like this makes a ton of sense. Of course, there is a potential problem that will be monitored throughout the Christmas Day schedule, as the games will be aired on Netflix, which just struggled mightily with its broadcast of the boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul. Adding Beyonce to what will already be a highly-anticipated NFL game should only bring more eyeballs onto the platform, and there’s going to be a whole lot of interest in whether or not Netflix will be able to keep up with the demand."

The ping-pong balls fell in favor of the Wings, who will get the opportunity to select Bueckers first overall next spring and figure to create one of the WNBA’s most exciting backcourts immediately with Bueckers joining established Wings star Arike Ogunbowale in Dallas. For the second straight year, the Sparks will hold the No. 2 overall pick and the Sky will pick at No. 3, while the Mystics will have the fourth pick. The fifth pick will go to the expansion Golden State Valkyries, followed by the playoff teams from a year ago — aside from the Aces, who forfeited their draft pick as part of a league punishment.  The 2025 WNBA Draft first round order looks as follows:  1. Dallas Wings

5. Golden State Valkyries
6. Washington Mystics (via the Atlanta Dream)

10. Chicago Sky (via the Connecticut Sun)
11. Minnesota Lynx
12. Phoenix Mercury (via the New York Liberty)  Behind Bueckers, Kiki Iriafen is the presumptive No. 2 prospect in this class, which means she could be making a very short trip from playing college ball at USC this season to pro ball with the Sparks.

	Jon Jones successfully defended his UFC Heavyweight championship at UFC 309 in New York.","Jon Jones (28-1) knocked out Stipe Miocic (20-5) in the third round to retain the heavyweight championship at UFC 309 from Madison Square Garden in New York.  Jones opened with a couple shots up top, a leg kick, and eventually a takedown. On top, Jones worked the ground and pound, refusing to give Miocic any room on the ground in a dominant first round — but while it looked like Jones could have ended it early, Miocic was able to hang on. Miocic opened the second round with a more measured approach, waiting for his own opportunities to attack without being taken down. The former heavyweight champion was relatively flat-footed before opening a more active approach in the third, but as Miocic moved, it was Jones who picked apart Miocic.  Jones hurt Miocic with a big right hand midway through the round, but kept the champ at bay with a combination of his own. Jones hurt Miocic with a spinning back kick to the body, then finished him off with lefts and rights on the ground before the referee stoppage.  Jones’ return to the UFC on Saturday was just his second bout in the heavyweight division. He hadn’t fought since last year, claiming the UFC Heavyweight belt in his debut in the heavyweight division against Ciryl Gane. Jones is arguably the greatest fighter in UFC history, but his background is riddled in controversy amid two victories over another greatest of all-time contender, Daniel Cormier. Miocic hadn’t fought since 2021, when he suffered a second-round knockout at the hands of Francis Ngannou.  Jones as the winner has an interesting path forward. On one hand, the interim champ, Tom Aspinall, is waiting in the wings and ready to prove himself against an all-time great. On the other hand, Alex Pereira seems prepped to climb to the heavyweight division, making possibly two weight jumps in three year as the former middleweight and current light heavyweight champion. Jones hasn’t seemed as interested in Aspinall recently, but opened the door to that fight after the win.  After his loss, Miocic retired from the UFC."

	Chuck, Shaq, Kenny, and Ernie will continue covering NBA games in 2025, as ESPN will license the show from TNT starting next year.","When TNT Sports lost the rights to the NBA this summer, with the league opting for a three-network deal with ESPN, NBC, and Amazon, the biggest question from fans was what would the future look like for ‘Inside the NBA’. After initially sounding as though it would end after this season, TNT was able to get Charles Barkley to agree to stick around for the remainder of his contract, with plans to continue the show in some capacity.  Now, we know what that will be, and instead of TNT airing the fellas talking about various sports (as was rumored at one point), they will continue to cover the NBA as part of ESPN’s NBA coverage in a unique licensing deal between Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery. According to the Wall Street Journal and Andrew Marchand of The Athletic, the deal will see TNT Sports continue producing the show, but it will air on ESPN.  Separately, Warner Bros. Discovery struck a deal with Disney to license the TNT show “Inside the NBA” to ESPN and ABC starting next season, according to the people familiar with the matter. The show, which features the former players Charles Barkley and Shaquille O’Neal, has an enthusiastic and large following. The show will air throughout the course of the season. This all happens alongside a larger settlement between the NBA and WBD, with Bleacher Report and House of Highlights maintaining rights to NBA videos. That is all excellent news for those at TNT Sports and those outlets, and sources inside TNT Sports tell Dime that they are “considering it a best case scenario” after losing NBA game broadcasts. [UPDATE: This post previously stated WBD would continue operating NBA TV and the league’s digital platforms, as was reported by the WSJ, but that was incorrect. NBA Digital and WBD will continue their current relationship but will not be operated by WBD (as is the current structure), while NBA TV will not be operated by WBD in the future.] For NBA fans the biggest news is that Charles Barkley, Shaquille O’Neal, Kenny Smith, and Ernie Johnson will still be on our televisions — one would assume from Studio J in Atlanta still if TNT is producing it — each week during the NBA season. One would expect they’ll move from their Thursday slot to Wednesday for ESPN’s biggest night of games — as the other options are Friday and Sunday and I have a hard time imagining them moving to either of those. The move allows the best show to continue without any changes to talent in front of or behind the camera, which is particularly important, and one would think if ESPN is adding the show they will understand what makes it so good and give it the kind of space and time it deserves, rather than what they currently do with their studio offering. It remains to be seen what happens with NBA Countdown, as they’ll still need to have something for those Friday and Sunday games, but may shake up their main crew with the Inside fellas becoming their A-crew and Finals team."

	The NBA has big plans for how it wants to build on 2024's shooting competition between Steph Curry and Sabrina Ionescu.","The NBA struck gold at All-Star weekend in 2024. While the game itself was bad enough that the league is considering a major shake-up in its format and the Dunk Contest was a dud, a shooting contest between Steph Curry and Sabrina Ionescu injected a whole lot of excitement into the festivities on Saturday night — Curry was able to win, but it was awfully close. With the 2025 edition of the All-Star Game taking place in the Chase Center, it would make a ton of sense for the league to run back a Steph vs. Sabrina shootout. According to Shams Charania of ESPN, that is, indeed in the works, but there’s a catch: They may not be the only NBA and WNBA players involved. Curry and WNBA star Sabrina Ionescu of the New York Liberty participated in the first NBA versus WNBA 3-point challenge at All-Star Saturday night this February in Indianapolis. Curry and Ionescu are in strong conversations to return in a variation of the shootout, which could include other NBA and WNBA players such as Klay Thompson of the Dallas Mavericks and Caitlin Clark of the Indiana Fever, sources said. Expanding on the competition and including Thompson and Clark always made far too much sense, so it’s good to see that the NBA might do something that would obviously be a huge draw."

	The NBA is considering a shakeup to make the All-Star Game a 4-team tournament like Rising Stars -- and include the Rising Stars winners.","The last really good NBA All-Star Game was in 2020, which was both the first year of the Elam Ending format and just a few weeks after Kobe Bryant’s tragic death. Players took the game more seriously than we’ve seen in quite some time, as it was a league-wide celebration of the Lakers legend, but since then the game has fallen back into old habits of being a glorified pickup run with barely a hint of defense being played.  That has led to fans tuning out and TV networks being upset, and Adam Silver seemed like a broken man after last year’s game was the highest scoring in history, handing Giannis and the East the All-Star Game trophy with the glowing praise of “you scored the most points. Well, congratulations.” The truth is, the All-Star Game just isn’t important enough for players to go all-out, especially with how much money is at stake for them nowadays. It’s no longer the biggest national stage some of them will get to show out and build their profile, and the result is a bunch of guys trying not to get hurt while producing a few highlights.  For that reason, the league needs to get creative. We offered our thoughts on what that should look like last year, as they’ve bounced back-and-forth between formats and how they pick teams to varying degrees of success. This year we might see a significant change to the format, as ESPN’s Shams Charania brought word that the league is in deep discussions on a new format that would be similar what they did with the Rising Stars Game, breaking the All-Star rosters into 4 teams and having them play a semifinal game and then the winners of those playing in the final. The teams would be 3 teams of 8 All-Stars and the winning team of the Rising Stars Challenge from Friday. Charania highlights how discussions around this format started at Summer League and have included league personnel, team executives, players (including Stephen Curry), and coaches, with significant momentum towards being adopted for the 2025 game in San Francisco. At the very least, you could bet that whatever team of All-Stars got matched up with the Rising Stars winners would likely have a little more juice to not lose, which would yield the intended results of raising the level of competition.  I think anything would be an improvement over a regular four-quarter game, and the Rising Stars games have been improved as a result of this format change. Even if they aren’t suddenly the greatest basketball games in history, they move quicker and when it’s close late the competitive juices get flowing in a way we don’t see often in the current All-Star format."
Sports – UPROXX,It Is Silly That Nikola Jokic Has Somehow Gotten Better To Start The 2024-25 Season,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/nikola-jokic-start-2024-25-nba-season-denver-nuggets/,"Fri, 15 Nov 2024 21:41:00 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	Nikola Jokic entered this season as an all-time great already. Somehow, someway, he keeps getting better.","There’s this fun thing I like to do sometimes that I affectionately call the Barry Bonds game. How it works: You go onto baseball-reference, pull up the page for the legendary San Francisco Giants slugger, and just look at how ridiculous it was that Bonds was able to put up the numbers he did during his prime. Yes, steroids, I know, but even with that caveat, individual players are not supposed to break their sport the way that Barry Bonds was able to break the game of baseball. We’re not fully there yet, but going onto Nikola Jokic‘s basketball-reference page is getting to a similarly very silly point. Ever since becoming the no-doubt cornerstone of the Denver Nuggets back in 2018-19, Jokic has consistently put up some of the wildest numbers in the league. His last four years feature three MVPs and a second-place finish while averaging 26.1 points, 12.2 rebounds, 8.7 assists, and 1.4 steals in 34.1 minutes per game while shooting 58.8 percent from the field and 36.4 percent from three. The advanced stats especially love him — scroll on down to the “Advanced” section, a lot of stuff is bold (led the league) and a few things are gold (all-time career marks). There is no one quite like Jokic, and there has never been anyone quite like Jokic. His career True Shooting percentage is third in league history, behind only Rudy Gobert and DeAndre Jordan, while attempting 1,942 more three-pointers than those two combined. His career total rebound percentage is 15th, right in between ABA legend Mel Daniels and Marcus Camby. He’s 25th all time in assist percentage — the three names directly behind him are Ja Morant, Ricky Rubio, and LeBron James. The dude just has his fingerprints all over games in a way that no one has ever consistently matched. I say all of that to say this: Somehow, someway, on a team that needs him more than ever (which says a lot as the entire franchise is built around having him), Jokic has raised his game through the first stretch of the 2024-25 season. This should not be possible. It’s not even like he’s suddenly adding something new to his bag of tricks, he’s just better than ever at being Nikola Jokic. Small sample size caveats are prominent here, but here’s some stuff to consider: Points per game: 29.7 (fifth in the NBA, his current career-high is 27.1 PPG)
Rebounds per game: 13.7 (leads the NBA, current career-high is 13.8 RPG)
Assists per game: 11.7 (leads the NBA, current career-high is 9.8 APG)
Steals per game: 1.7 (t-9th in the NBA, current career-high is 1.7 SPG) The only players to ever average a triple-double over a full season, of course, are Oscar Robertson (once) and Russell Westbrook (four times). Neither of them, in any of their triple-double seasons, were in the same galaxy as Jokic’s current True Shooting percentage of 66.7 percent — both guys, funny enough, posted a TS% of 55.4 percent in their most efficient season with a triple-double. And all of the advanced stats that tend to show that Jokic is a marvel (PER, win shares per 48 minutes, box plus/minus) are outrageous — if the season ended today, he’d post the highest single-season PER (33.31) of all-time, the highest BPM (15.02) of all-time, and the fourth-highest WS/48 of all-time behind some guys named Kareem and Wilt. So, yeah, Jokic is a joke, the single best basketball player in the world today and the guy spearheading a Nuggets team with some flaws that came as the result of a talent drain over the last few years to an early 7-3 record and, as of this writing, the longest-active winning streak (five games) in the Western Conference. And here’s the funny thing: If Denver did not have Jokic playing like this, they would be in some serious trouble. Have a look at how dire things get when he is not on the floor, via PBP Stats: There is a reason why, when asked what the ideal number of minutes is for Jokic to be on the floor for the Nuggets, Michael Malone said “48.” We’ve seen plenty of teams over the years be totally helpless when the sun around which everything revolves goes to the bench — LeBron’s teams in his prime were famously horrendous when he would sit, the Sixers have an organizational commitment to being awful without Joel Embiid, etc. — but seeing as how Jokic is either scoring or assisting on nearly half of all the points that Denver scores, well, it’s pretty important that he never comes off the floor. That’ll have to change at some point (well, probably), but Jokic playing like this means it’s easier for the Nuggets to slowly bring along their young guys who have to take on bigger roles this season — although it must be said that Christian Braun has impressed as the de facto Kentavious Caldwell-Pope replacement. They can also afford to be patient with Jamal Murray, who still hasn’t quite looked like himself on the heels of a pretty nasty run of injuries that made his postseason and Olympic efforts hard to watch at times, but just got paid in a big way and absolutely has to get on track. Of course, at some point, Denver is going to need to totally round into form, even if there are some really encouraging signs beyond Jokic. Aaron Gordon has been awesome so far this year when healthy, while Michael Porter Jr. continues to just do his thing as a huge dude who can shoot the hell out of the basketball. When 75 percent of the core your team is built around is playing at a high level from the start of the year — and that final member of your core has a reputation for saving his best for when the lights get brighter — you’re usually in a pretty good spot. There are still big picture questions that can only be answered when the playoffs roll around, which is the curse of being a team with title-or-bust aspirations. In the meantime, all anyone can really do is sit back, watch, and marvel at the spectacle that is Nikola Jokic, the best player in the world at the very height of his powers, someone who keeps finding ways to break the game of basketball, and an all-time great who stands shoulder-to-shoulder alongside the greatest players to ever set foot on the hardwood. And the scary part? As the early portion of this season has shown, if anything, he’s only getting better."

	'We’re nothing. We’re just dead. We’re dust.'","Tonight, November 15, is the much-publicized boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul. Ahead of the fight, which will stream on Netflix, Iron Mike was asked by internet-famous teen reporter Jazlyn Guerra, a.k.a. Jazzy’s World TV, for his thoughts on legacy. He took it very seriously.   “Well, I don’t know. I don’t believe in the word ‘legacy,'” Tyson replied. “I just think that’s another word for ego. Legacy doesn’t mean nothing. That’s just some word everybody grabbed onto. Someone said that word, and everyone grabbed on the words, and now it’s used every five seconds. It means absolutely nothing to me. I’m just passing through. I’mma die, and it’s gonna be over. Who cares about legacy after that?”  Tyson somehow wasn’t done. “What a big ego,” he continued. “So I’mma die. I want people to think that I’m this, I’m great. I’m, no. We’re nothing. We’re just dead. We’re dust. We’re absolutely nothing. Our legacy is nothing.” Guerra responded to Tyson’s stream-of-consciousness existentialism with a polite “thank you so much for sharing that,” but 50 Cent had another takeaway. “G*ddam it! Mike ya scaring the kids, WTF chill,” the rapper wrote on X. “Note to self, keep the kids away from Mike.”  You can watch the video here. Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson streams on Netflix beginning at 8 p.m. ET."

	This year's NBA City Edition unis were officially unveiled on Thursday, so we're ranking them from 30 to 1.","The NBA and Nike officially unveiled the 2024-25 City Edition uniforms for all 30 teams on Thursday, and while the designs have been leaked since this summer, I like to wait until we get the official images to rank them. That is because the actual jerseys themselves almost always look better than their 2D mock-ups, which is certainly the case with this year’s crop. The leaks got roasted to no end on social media and while I’m not crazy about this year’s group of uniforms, they aren’t as bad in actuality as the leaks looked.  That said, there are some heaters and some really bad ones, along with a big crop this year of very “meh” looks as it’s fair to wonder if Nike and the teams are running a bit short on ideas — good news guys, at least another 12 years of these! Here we are ranking the uniforms from worst to best, where there’s one that should become part of one team’s permanent look.  NBA
Creating good alternates is hard when you have an iconic jersey set, and that’s the problem the Celtics (and Lakers) run into every year. These are just bad and don’t even seem to be trying to do anything interesting. Wear your normal (and great) uniforms, please.  NBA
Same goes for the Lakers. These are just unbecoming of a once proud franchise.  NBA
I’m honestly kind of stunned they went back to the Heat Culture well again after the reaction to when they did this last year, but it does look a little better on the all red uniform. Still, c’mon guys, stop trying to make this a thing. NBA
On the opposite end of the spectrum from Boston and L.A. is OKC, which has had one uniform in its history that I thought was legitimately good (the 2018 City Edition honoring Oklahoma’s Native American heritage). Everything else has been either “meh” or outright bad. I’ll say this, these aren’t the worst unis they’ve ever had, but I just am not a fan.  NBA
The Pacers have done this look before in black, and it’s just not for me.  NBA
A retro look that just doesn’t really land for me. I will say, I bet the court they have for this color scheme will look great, but I’m just not a big fan of the lettering.  NBA
I wouldn’t call these bad, they just don’t land for me, but that’s also been the case for a number of the Brooklyn City Editions over the years.  NBA
I’m just out on the 5280 thing. I like the mountains on the side and the topographical map thing, and while I think there are better executions, leaning into the rainbow coloring is generally good for Denver. However, I just can’t get on board with the 5280 in place of lettering. NBA
All of the uniforms in this tier have the same issue of not being bad, but also not being particularly inspiring. Dallas’ are particularly plain, which, again, not necessarily bad, but not memorable either.  NBA
I get they’re going for the Chicago musical font here, but it feels like they weren’t willing to go all-in on it and the end result is pretty bland.  NBA
I get what Minnesota’s going for, but I just see an old Windows 98 screensaver in that design.  NBA
They aren’t as bad as the Lakers and Celtics, but they also have a similar problem where their normal uniforms are iconic classics and trying something new often just makes you want them to do what they always do.  NBA
The Magic are at the top of this group by virtue of having the best lettering/logo — the Magic with a star for the A is always great — but Orlando has great uniform looks and this one just falls flat comparatively.  NBA
Like Orlando, Charlotte has some great throwback looks and this just makes me wish they were wearing one of those instead.  NBA
My colleague Mark said the logo looks like it should be for store brand paper towels and I can’t unsee it. I do like that shade of blue though.  NBA
Perfectly fine, even though it’s still a little confusing when the Bucks are wearing all-blue.  NBA
Never seen a more Oklahoma State jersey in my life. Go Pokes.  NBA
I actually kinda like these, but they are giving off strong vibes of made up Houston jerseys for a movie that couldn’t afford NBA licensing.  NBA
If I were to guess, these will be among the most polarizing unis. I dig New Orleans leaning into being a little different and weird, and the herringbone pattern with actual bones certainly does that. They will likely be at the bottom of some folks rankings but I don’t think their standard unis are so good that they can’t get weird and have it work.  NBA
These have grown on me a bit, in part because they at least look like Warriors uniforms — unlike their Michigan/Marquette alternates from a year or two ago. They aren’t the best uniforms in the world, but a solid attempt at playing off something unique to the Bay (the Golden Gate Bridge).  NBA
I really like the District font and this year they put it on a nice color instead of whatever the hell the black and green and orange thing was a year ago. The Wizards won’t be good this year, but I do think they’ll look good in these.  NBA
I like this Spurs font, they’ve done it before but it works for me. I also like this shade of blue. These aren’t as good as their fiesta look in the past, but a solid choice and I just like when the Spurs have a little pop of color.  NBA
I like these, even though I will not immediately spot this color and go “Cavs” in my brain. Part of why these will work is their court that goes with them is phenomenal.  NBA
Another one that gets a big boost from an unbelievably good court design. These play off the old 1995 All-Star logo, and while I’m not crazy about the font, I still dig them. If they incorporated the saguaro cactus into them, they’d be higher.  NBA
The Blazers almost always do a good job with the City edition uni, and this year is another good addition to their rotation. A big part of that is their “Rip City” font just looks good on anything. NBA
The Jazz are finally making the move back to the purple mountains with their full-time uniform set, and this year’s City Edition is a very good version of that.  NBA
The throwback to the Memphis Sounds just looks fantastic. I love that Memphis font and these are going to look fantastic on the floor — even if it’ll take a little adjustment to seeing a team in red and thinking “Grizzlies”.  NBA
The Kings also have another really good throwback look, taking it to the days of the Cincinnati Royals. The royal blue and red just pops, and they didn’t try to do too much with a uniform that doesn’t need much more.  NBA
I’m a sucker for this spectrum Sixers look. I just think it’s so clean and the white edition is even better than the navy look from a couple years back.  NBA
The Vince Carter Raptor doing his legendary between-the-legs dunk is so good and the Raptors need to just make it their permanent logo. These with the purple retro look they brought back this year is a damn-near perfect uniform set and it’s a shame they will move on to something new next season."

	Come get these winners.","Sometimes, you simply want to unplug the season and plug it back in. That is where we are when it comes to NFL handicapping in 2024. After a pair of encouraging weeks, the ugliness returned in Week 10, including a Falcons-Saints game that impossibly stayed under with three missed field goals and other malodies. We won’t be deterred from the goal of righting the ship but, hey, you could also fade these picks if you’re feeling spicy. Before delivering this week’s five-pack, let’s take a look at the carnage in 2024.  Come get these winners. A Thursday night Under? Let’s get back to basics. Washington has been an “over” team to the tune of 7-3 this season, but Philadelphia has been quietly stout on defense in recent weeks. This is, of course, a short week for both teams, and Washington has some injury issues along its offensive line. I tend to think the Commanders defense is a touch undervalued in this spot as well, and this is a favorable price. The Saints got the bounce last week after firing their coach and, with the help of one of the worst kicking performances of the season for Atlanta, New Orleans won a game it shouldn’t have won. That could benefit us this week, as the Browns are underdogs in a spot where they probably shouldn’t be. Let’s ride the Jameis roller coaster and hope it goes well. Detroit is a wagon. They seemingly cover every week and, when they don’t like in Week 10, they somehow win the game despite a million turnovers. With that said, getting a full 14 here on Jacksonville is something I can’t pass on. Trust me, I know how ugly it is. Seattle is healthier and coming off a bye, including the projected return of DK Metcalf. I’ve also been a touch low on San Francisco all season, and I simply can’t get this to 6.5 points, even with McCaffrey back for the 49ers. This teaser happens to involve a pair of prime time games, but I would like it even if it didn’t. Candidly, I love each leg here, with the Bengals more than able to get in the backdoor if things go south at the outset. Houston is on the road, which does scare me a bit, but the situation in Dallas is rather dire, and the Texans may be discounted a bit after a maddening loss to Detroit."

	Giannis got called for a foul despite getting all ball. But fortunately for the Bucks, as Rasheed Wallace once said, ball don't lie.","The Milwaukee Bucks played host to the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night, and while there is still a ton of basketball left to be played this season, you won’t find a more insane final 90 or so seconds of regulation than what we got out of these two Central Division opponents. The two teams traded the lead back and forth, and after a Marcus Sasser three tied things up with just under 30 seconds left, Milwaukee got the ball and had a chance to win. A wide open look by Taurean Prince did not fall, and with a hair over a second left on the clock, Detroit called a timeout, advanced the ball, and tried to replicate the magic it found on a sideline out of bounds play on Tuesday night against Miami. It looked like that was going to happen, as Cade Cunningham lobbed one up to Ron Holland near the rim, but Giannis Antetokounmpo was able to break things up … well, at least it looked like he did, but the referees called a foul that stood after a review even though it really did not look like Giannis fouled Holland at all. However, in the words of the great philosopher Rasheed Wallace, ball don’t lie. Holland stepped up to the charity stripe and missed short twice, which ended up sending the game to overtime. It would’ve been an awfully harsh way for the game to end for Milwaukee, but, again, Sheed’s got us covered here."
Sports – UPROXX,Draymond Green Claims Steph Had Extra Juice For Warriors-Mavs Because Klay ‘Ghosted Him’,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/draymond-green-klay-thompson-ghosted-steph-curry-warriors-mavs/,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 23:16:08 +0000","<div class=""upx-component upx-embed-url""><div class=""embed-holder""></div></div>Steph Curry apparently had a little extra motivation for Klay Thompson's return to the Chase Center.","Klay Thompson made his return to the Chase Center on Tuesday night as a member of the Dallas Mavericks. It went the way that things tend to go when teams travel to take on the Golden State Warriors: Steph Curry did some absolutely ludicrous Steph stuff, and the Warriors went on to pick up a 120-117 win to start their NBA Cup campaign. Curry scored all 12 of the Warriors’ points during a 12-3 run to close out the game, and plenty of people noted that he looked especially fired up after hitting a three with 27 seconds left that essentially iced things. It turns out there’s a reason why: According to Draymond Green, Curry was ghosted by Thompson in the lead-up to the game. “I’m stirring the pot, I pissed Steph off,” Green said on his podcast, which you can watch at the 4:30 mark of the video at the top of this post. “He’s like, ‘Yeah, I talked to Klay last night about’ — cause he was supposed to speak before the game. He was like, ‘Yeah I called Raymond and told him I’m not speaking. I just need to lock in on the game, so I ain’t speaking and I talked to Klay about it.’ He tried to check in with Klay about something else, and Klay ghosted him, so he got pissed. And here we go. Locked in.” Steve Kerr said that Curry was supposed to address the crowd before the game, but he and Thompson decided against it, while Green did drop a hint after the game that Thompson isn’t an easy guy to get a hold of when he told the press “You ever try to keep in touch with Klay? It’s very one-sided. The love is there. The relationship is there.”"

	The legendary Spurs coach has been away from the team since Nov. 2.","The San Antonio Spurs have been without the services of legendary head coach Gregg Popovich since the start of November. While the team previously said that Popovich’s absence was due to an illness, on Wednesday afternoon, the Spurs revealed that Popovich suffered what was described as a “mild stroke” ahead of their game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Nov. 2, 2024. “The San Antonio Spurs today announced that Head Coach Gregg Popovich has suffered a mild stroke,” the team said in a statement. “The episode occurred on Nov. 2 at the Frost Bank Center. Popovich, who has already started a rehabilitation program, is expected to make a full recovery. At this point, a timeline for his return to the sidelines has not been determined. During this time, the organization is grateful to the extended community for providing privacy and space to the Popovich family.” Assistant coach Mitch Johnson, who has been part of the Spurs’ famed coaching system since 2016, has filled in for Popovich as he’s been away from the team for the last six games. When asked last week for an update on Popovich, Johnson said that the Hall of Fame coach was “in good spirits,” even though there was no word on when fans could expect to see Popovich back on the sideline. One of the greatest basketball coaches of all time, the 75-year-old Popovich has been at the helm of the Spurs since 1996. He is a 5-time NBA champion, a 3-time Coach of the Year, and is the NBA’s all-time wins leader among coaches."

	Let's be honest, Charles Barkley and Shaq were always going to do this at some point.","It’s been a rough start to the year for the Toronto Raptors. While they were never expected to compete for a championship this year, injuries to a number of key contributors like Scottie Barnes and Immanuel Quickly have played a big role in the team going 2-10, which is the worst record in the league at this early juncture. A bright spot has been the play of Gradey Dick, the No. 13 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft who is shooting 37.3 percent from three and his upped his scoring to 20.1 points per game. He’s a good player whose last name has led to stuff like this happening, and shockingly, it was not until Tuesday night that the Inside the NBA guys had their inevitable meltdown over him.

I’m not gonna say his name, I don’t give a damn what y’all say around here.” It was right around this point that we got one of the consistently funniest things on Inside: Shaq laughing so hard at something insane that Chuck said that he sounds like he’s furiously trying to clear his throat. Anyway, the fellas kept going down this road for a bit longer, because there was never going to be any stopping this riff once it finally happened.

	There was some extra juice in the building for Klay Thompson's return to the Bay, and Steph reminded the fans whose house it was late.","The biggest game of the night in a packed slate of NBA Cup games was the Mavs taking on the Warriors in Klay Thompson’s first game back in San Francisco since leaving as a free agent this summer for Dallas.  It was an emotional scene as they played a terrific tribute video and had the crowd in captains hats to honor their former star, but once the game got going there was plenty of juice on both sides in a reunion that wasn’t all happy. The two teams went back and forth, as the stars on both sides all played their roles, with Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving combining for 52 for the Mavs, while Thompson hit 6 threes on his way to 22 points in his return, including a big one late that gave Dallas a five-point lead midway through the fourth quarter.  That lead would get up to seven before Stephen Curry took over for the Warriors, scoring 12 points in the final 3:10 of game time, including a personal 10-0 run (aided by some spectacular defense from Draymond Green) that turned a Golden State deficit into a 4-point Warriors lead. His final bucket of that run was a vintage stepback three-pointer over Dereck Lively II, as he hit the Mavs big man with his signature “night night” celebration, before making a demonstrative declaration to the crowd that “this is my sh*t.”  STEPH CURRY HAS THE LAST 10 WARRIORS POINTS. 10-2 run to put GSW up 4 with under 30 seconds. 🏆 DAL-GSW | West Group C action🏀 #EmiratesNBACup on TNT pic.twitter.com/xNxak7xWr5 — NBA (@NBA) November 13, 2024  The Mavs would hit a three to cut the lead to one, but a pair of Curry free throws and a missed Luka three saw the Warriors win in regulation, 120-117. Curry finished with 37 points in the win, and while it’s clear there’s not actual bad blood between either side in the Splash Bros. breakup, there did seem to be a little extra fire from Curry for a mid-November game to make a statement at home with Klay now on the other side. While the “night night” is nothing new, the jersey popping and yelling “this is my sh*t” was more than we ever see from Curry in a non-playoff environment, and while I am a fan of the NBA Cup and think it brings out more competition in these games, I think this had more to do with who was on the other side than the Cup ramifications of this game."

	Shaq, who is never shy about being brutally honest when modern big men come up, did not mince words about Joel Embiid.","Joel Embiid took the floor for the Philadelphia 76ers for the first time this season on Tuesday night. Embiid, who has spent the start of the year ramping up to play after some knee problems, looked like someone who needs to work off a ton of rust, as he went for 13 points on 2-for-11 shooting with five assists and three rebounds in a 111-99 loss to the New York Knicks. It’s probably safe to assume that Embiid will be fine as long as he can manage whatever is up with his knee, while the Sixers — which find themselves 2-8 at this early juncture — have to get him, Paul George, and Tyrese Maxey all healthy and clicking as soon as possible. But even if that happens, Shaquille O’Neal is not optimistic about Philly’s ability to win a ring with Embiid at the center of things, which he expressed at halftime on TNT. “In New York, it’s a tough team to play,” O’Neal said. “But this was the fear I had for Joel Embiid. You announce arrogantly, I’m not playing back-to-backs, Ernie. I’m not injured but I’m sore. I’ll come back when I want to come back. Now, when you say things like that, you’re supposed to come back with extra energy. 0-for-3? I would have been 0-15. But you know what y’all would have said. ‘Hey, Shaq’s not playing well, but he’s playing aggressive.’ The plan that they are having, it’s not working. And not only that, I say this respectfully, Joel Embiid will never win a championship until he gets his mind and his attitude right.” Shaq has essentially staked out a place in the basketball punditry world as the guy who will call out big men when he feels they aren’t living up to what they’re capable of, and clearly, he thinks Embiid is the kind of guy who can lead Philadelphia to a championship. In fairness to Embiid, while he did say he may not play in back-to-backs going forward in an effort to be healthy when the playoffs roll around, he said after the loss to the Knicks that he wants to play in Wednesday’s game against the Cleveland Cavaliers, even if the decision is out of his hands."

	With the game tied in overtime, Miami tried calling a timeout. There was just one problem: They didn't have one available.","The second annual Emirates NBA Cup tipped off on Tuesday night, with a number of teams taking the (very vibrant) floor for the league’s relatively new in-season tournament. In the East Group B, the Detroit Pistons played host to the Miami Heat and looked like they were going to cruise to a win before Miami got hot down the stretch of regulation. With things tied up, the two teams went into overtime, where Miami was able to take a lead with just under two seconds left before things got very, very weird. First, the Pistons drew up a beautiful sideline out of bounds play to get a dunk for Jalen Duren that tied things up. And then, a furious Erik Spoelstra walked onto the court and called a timeout. There was just one problem: Miami didn’t have one, which meant we had a classic Chris Webber situation on our hands — perhaps it was fate that one of Webber’s Fab 5 teammates, Jalen Rose, was in attendance and lost his mind. Malik Bealey stepped up to the free throw line, buried it to put Detroit ahead, then on the ensuing Pistons possession, got fouled one more time with 0.1 seconds left to seal the game. It was, quite frankly, stunning to watch Spoelstra make such a big mistake, but at the very least, we got a really entertaining end to a game that suddenly has some stakes to it because of the NBA Cup."

	Caitlin Clark found a very unique pitfall of fame at The Eras Tour: Getting so many friendship bracelets you start to lose circulation.","Taylor Swift’s “The Eras Tour” has been the biggest show in the world for the past few years, as the tour has had millions of fans pass through the gates at stadiums around the globe. After finishing her international leg of the tour, Swift added another run of U.S. tour dates, which included recently playing three nights in Indianapolis at the start of November.  In attendance for those shows was the biggest sports star in the city at present, as Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark wasn’t about to miss a chance to see her favorite artist play shows in her new home city. The only problem for Caitlin at the Eras Tour was that she’s too popular in Indianapolis, which meant she was being constantly given friendship bracelets from other Swifties. That’s a very nice problem to have, but in her effort to wear every one she was given, it started to create an issue, as she explained at the Women’s Leadership Summit.  “Taylor Swift, I just went two nights in a row in Indianapolis. I’ve been three times,” Clark said. “I had a ton [of bracelets], all the way up the arms. I had to take them off, my circulation was getting cut off! Everyone was just chucking their bracelets at me. I’ve seen her three times, and every time the show has just gotten better.”  She showed off her collection on Instagram during one of the shows and it was a lot of bracelets.  Clark has spent the last year or two learning the ups and downs of life as a superstar, but this is certainly a very unique pitfall of fame, being so popular you get too many friendship bracelets and start to lose feeling in your arm."

	The NBA Cup is back for a second season, and here's how it will all work and what groups each team ended up in.","The NBA’s efforts to add a little excitement to the doldrums of its regular season will return on Tuesday evening. For the second straight year, the league will hold its new cup competition, now known as the Emirates NBA Cup. The first year was fun, with the Los Angeles Lakers winning the whole thing by knocking off the Indiana Pacers in Las Vegas, and now, the NBA will continue its efforts to turn this nascent event into a crucial part of its calendar. What does this all mean? Well, we tried to answer that today by explaining what’s new this year, how the whole thing will work, and why we’re excited to watch this as it tries to become a tentpole event on the NBA calendar. So is this just the In-Season Tournament but with a new name? It is! While the NBA has never explicitly said this, my assumption is that they spent the first year calling it the In-Season Tournament so fans would get a sense of what it is before calling it what they always wanted to call it: The NBA Cup, or more specifically, the Emirates NBA Cup. Or maybe they just couldn’t find a sponsor in the first year. What’s that Emirates thing? I’ve seen its logo on courts but never actually looked into what it is. It’s an airline based out of the United Arab Emirates that sponsors a lot of stuff. They’re sponsoring this event, which is the second-best thing that the NBA does, and fortunately, Emirates has plenty of experience sponsoring the second-best thing, as they are the shirt sponsor for Arsenal. What? Just let me cook. Ok, so, any major differences from last year other than the name? A big one are the courts. Last year, they came under criticism from players (who kept slipping on them) and fans (who thought some were huge eyesores, particularly because of the weird, cumbersome stripe they had going down the middle of the courts). They’re not nearly as bad this year, as they replaced the stripe with rings in the center of the floor and got rid of some of the more abrasive designs that just do not work on television. I’m sure not everyone will love them, but I think they are a huge improvement on last year — we just have to see if players struggle with their footing on them, or else the aesthetic changes do not matter at all. What about point differential? I know some players disliked that. Well, that’s still sticking around as a potential tiebreaker for which teams do and do not advance. Frankly, I think it’s fine and we saw last year that some of the European players were trying to egg their teammates on — Domantas Sabonis was the main one I remember — but it’ll still take a bit of a shift for everyone to get on board with it. Remind me how determining how teams advance will work again? Sure! Right from the league: So the easiest way to move on is to just win your group and not worry about any tiebreakers. That is correct. Well then, what do the groups look like? Once again, the NBA broke things up into three groups of five teams in each conference — this will, hopefully, look a lot cleaner when expansion happens, we get up to 32 teams, and they can do groups of four in each conference where each team plays group games home and away. The group games will happen on Tuesdays and Fridays starting tonight and running through Dec. 3. Here’s how it all looks: West Group A: Minnesota, LA Clippers, Sacramento, Houston, Portland West Group B: Oklahoma City, Phoenix, LA Lakers, Utah, San Antonio West Group C: Denver, Dallas, New Orleans, Golden State, Memphis East Group A: New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Brooklyn, Charlotte East Group B: Milwaukee, Indiana, Miami, Toronto, Detroit East Group C: Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington How do these teams qualify for the knockouts? Same as last year — win your group and you get a spot. Both conferences then get one remaining spot for a wild card team, which goes to the best remaining team that did not automatically qualify by winning its group. This is probably where those aforementioned tiebreakers would come in, but you never know. And will the knockouts work like last year, too? Yup! Single-elimination basketball games, with the quarterfinals happening on-site at home arenas and the semifinals and final happening in Las Vegas. The quarters are on Dec. 10 and 11, the semis are on Dec. 14, and the final is on Dec. 17. And are these games all considered regular season games, too? For the most part they are — group games, the quarters, and the semis will all count towards regular season records again, while the championship game will not. So it looks a lot like last year, then. That’s right, the league has, essentially, decided to keep a lot of things the same other than the name and the courts. Oh, also, as a programming note: home teams will wear their Statement Edition uniforms, while road teams wear their Association edition uniforms, according to the league. Huh, well then, ok. You don’t seem enthused about all of this, dear reader. Yeah, I mean, I am still unsure why I should care about this. Well that’s easy: You don’t have to! You’re an adult with agency and the ability to care about whatever you want, times are tough, maybe you don’t want to get super personally invested in a new thing the NBA is doing, that’s fine. But you seem to like this. I do! Why? I think a big split I have noticed here is “fans who like soccer” and “fans who do not,” with the former being more open to the idea of a midseason cup competition — Adam Silver has compared the NBA Cup to the FA Cup in English football, but basically every domestic league has a secondary cup competition. The thing is that these competitions are universally considered not as important as winning the league, but they are still important because it’s an opportunity to win something historic and provide some validation for a team’s season. The NBA Cup is only in its second year, so clearly, it has a way to go before it gets taken that seriously — the whole saga with the Lakers debating putting up a little banner is an example of this. But the FA Cup, for example, is not considered cool because everyone farts around and then Manchester City wins it at the end. It’s considered cool because teams from several levels of English football have a chance to win it, and sometimes, you get magical runs to the very end. We got a glimpse of what that could look like last year when the Indiana Pacers nearly won the whole thing. Hell, if not for the fact that they’re the Lakers, it’d probably be viewed as proof of concept that the final was between a Play-In team and an upstart young squad trying to win something for the first time. That is, to steal a phrase from the English, the magic of the cup. So acknowledging that this isn’t as important as winning the NBA Finals is fine? One-hundred percent. The longer the NBA sticks with this — and, let’s face it, Silver is essentially staking his legacy as a commissioner on this becoming a big deal — the more likely it is that it’ll settle into a spot where fans/franchises like that it is a thing that they can win, all while understanding that the big prize is still waiting for them in June. It helps, of course, that there’s a financial incentive to do well. Remind me what that is. Sure! Players whose teams make the quarterfinals make $50,000, players whose teams make the semifinals make $100,000, players on the runners-up make $200,000, and players on the team that wins the whole thing makes $500,000. Nice. I agree. Anyway, this sounds like, bare minimum, a thing I can have on my television on Tuesdays and Fridays. It is, and really, if that’s all that comes from this for the next year or two, that’s totally fine. Something like this will only become a big deal the more it happens and the more it becomes ingrained as part of the sport’s culture, and as long as this year is a step towards doing that, I’m sure it’ll all work out in the long-run. Nice. Well, I suppose I can tune in. That you can, and if you want to know what games are on, when they’re on, and which networks they’ll be on, you can click right here."

	The NBA Cup starts Tuesday night and we are looking at eight teams that should invest a little extra energy in the early season competition.","The second edition of the NBA Cup (now with a fancy sponsor, Emirates) will begin on Tuesday night as group stage action gets started. Feelings on the NBA Cup vary, but for the most part, it seems to have been at least a mild positive in terms of adding a little juice to November regular season hoops.  Last year, the eight teams that emerged from group play were the Celtics, Bucks, Pacers, and Knicks in the East, and the Lakers, Kings, Suns, and Pelicans in the West. Ultimately, the Lakers beat the Pacers in the final, marking the high point of the season for Los Angeles, while that was just the beginning of a run to the conference finals from Indiana. There are differing views from teams on how they approach the Cup, but because most of the games until you get to Vegas count all the same as regular season games, you should see contenders still trying at least until the quarterfinals where they may punt to avoid adding a trip to Vegas to their schedule.  Not every team has the Cup schedule circled on their calendars, and for some, it gets in the way of the long-term goals (either to get lottery balls or winning a title). But as the Pacers showed a year ago, for a young team without much playoff experience, the Cup can get guys feet wet to that kind of environment and build some confidence for the tournament everyone cares about come April, May, and June.  Here, we’ll look at eight teams that we think should be willing to invest early season energy into trying to get to Vegas and hoist the NBA Cup.   Houston’s gotten off to a strong start this season at 7-4, and I think they’re in a similar position to the Pacers last year, as they can use this as a way to test their young roster without much playoff experience. A successful run to the knockout rounds (and maybe beyond) would be a genuinely big deal for the Rockets, who can assert themselves as a genuine threat in the West playoff race with a strong tournament showing.  We saw that the Lakers were willing to raise their level a year ago in the Cup competition, and it’d be kind of incredible if they went back-to-back. Their group is a bit less daunting now that the Thunder are without Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein (although that’s still an excellent team), and if they make the knockout rounds, a team with LeBron and AD is always going to be a threat in a single-elimination basketball game. We’ll see if they approach it with the same aggression, but this is a team that has to try and chase wins regardless, so I’d expect the effort to be there, even if they can’t replicate the same kind of run.  The Grizzlies want to prove they are fully back as West contenders, and they can make a strong statement if they come out of the aforementioned Group of Death. They are playing at a high level right now, led by Jaren Jackson Jr.’s continued brilliance, and if they can get to Vegas, they’d have a very good chance at lifting the Cup. And if Ja Morant can get healthy and come back in time, absolutely no one will want to see that guy in a one-off. By the time the season is over, the Spurs will likely have filtered out of the Play-In race, but this is the exact kind of team I think should place an overemphasis on the NBA Cup. The Spurs are still building around Victor Wembanyama and figuring out what that should look like, but this team has been fairly competitive early (5-6) and could take advantage of some injury woes for the top teams in their group to try and make a little noise in the Cup. We saw in the Olympics that Wemby loves some heightened competition, and this might be a good chance to turn him loose and make an all-out push for something in November, understanding that they probably don’t have the roster just yet to really threaten the playoffs.  Will the Cavs ever lose? At some point, yes, but why not keep the good vibes rolling as long as possible and try to win the Cup? Yes, they’re a title contender, but unlike, say, Boston, this isn’t a team that’s had any real playoff success. Building some good habits in the knockout rounds could pay dividends down the road, and seeing as how they’re in the same group as the Celtics, I’m sure they’d love to use this as a statement of intent in the event they cross paths in the postseason. The Bucks desperately need something to turn around their season, and maybe the Cup gives them a carrot to chase that can wake things up. I’m skeptical they have the juice to make this happen, as the vibes are just horrendous in Milwaukee right now, but theoretically, Giannis and Dame (who will miss their opener with a concussion) are good enough as a tandem to beat anyone. That will require them to get on the same page, which hasn’t really happened to this point, but perhaps playing on different courts can change the mojo in Milwaukee.  Like every team other than the Cavs and Celtics in the East, the Knicks are off to a sputtering start at 4-5. Their star-studded roster isn’t clicking just yet, the defense has taken a major step back, and the offense hasn’t been quite good enough to make up for it. Their group, at one point, looked like the toughest in the East, but the Magic are without Paolo Banchero and the Sixers … well, we’ll get to them in a second. That cracks the door for the Knicks to try and lay a foundation of winning they can build on as the season progresses and create that chemistry that’s been lacking in games with a slightly bigger game feel. Joel Embiid is back for the Cup games, but Tyrese Maxey is out and Paul George has been on a minutes restriction. This team is desperate to go on a run, and with the big fella back, there’s no time like the present to try and climb out of the East’s basement. Like the Bucks, Philly just needs to stack some wins and get some positivity, and if they can somehow make it to Vegas, they can erase a decent amount of the early season concern about them."

	The Cavs are off to an 11-0 start, and we talked to Garland about the work this summer that led to the return of his confidence and smile.","The Cleveland Cavaliers came into the 2024-25 season with plenty of pressure, as this felt like a make-it-or-break-it season for their Core Four. They re-signed Donovan Mitchell and gave contract extensions to Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen, while Darius Garland is entering the second year of his own 5-year deal. A ton of money has been committed to this group, with the expectation that they would take another step forward as a real threat in the Eastern Conference under new head coach Kenny Atkinson.  While they can’t fully answer whether they’ve done that until May and June, the Cavs have made an emphatic statement to open the season, as they are the NBA’s last remaining unbeaten at 11-0. That hot start is the byproduct of confidence and trust in their group, something they’ve built over the years but had to fortify by figuring out how everyone can play to their strengths. One of the difficult tasks of building confidence as a unit is that each player has to first have that confidence in themselves. The story of the young season for Cleveland has been strides in that area by the two youngest members of their core, as Garland and Mobley are playing some of the best basketball of their careers.  For Garland, he’s bounced back after a difficult 2023-24 campaign that saw him suffer a broken jaw early in the year and never get fully back to his peak level. As he explained to DIME over the weekend, after missing a third of the season, he wasn’t too interested in vacations this summer, instead opting to get in the gym and build back the strength, confidence, and wiggle that had been missing at the end of last season.  “It’s a total difference. It’s a big difference,” Garland said of how he feels starting this season compared to the second half of last year. “I’m in a good head space right now. I’m fully healthy — some little nicks, but nothing too major right now. And yeah, just came in with a lot of confidence over the summer, put in a lot of work. Especially after last year, I didn’t play a lot of games, so wasn’t a lot of vacations for me this summer, or a lot of hangout time. It was really just strictly in the gym trying to get better, trying to put some more weight and some more muscle on that I lost from last year, from having to jaw surgery. And yeah, trying to get my confidence back, trying to get my wiggle back, and my ball handling and just trying to stay consistent with it.”  Garland’s summer in the gym helped him remember how much he loves the game. One of the lasting images from the end of last season for Garland and the Cavs was Donovan Mitchell on the bench putting his arm around Garland and saying “I believe in you,” as Garland was mired in the midst of a shooting slump. It was a touching moment between teammates, but also telling of how difficult things were for Garland, who had lost his perpetual smile and was finding it difficult to have that same sense of belief.  This season, his confidence is back, as is his infectious smile, and Garland is looking to spread that positivity beyond the court as well. For Veteran’s Day weekend, that means welcoming a pair of Gold Star families from the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) to the Cavs’ games against the Nets and Bulls, as Garland is helping honor a pair of families of fallen veterans from his hometown of Gary, IN.  “It’s super cool just to have some veteran families around me,” Garland said. “My grandfathers were veterans, so just trying to show some love and support for some of the families, and show that they’re loved and that they mean a lot to us, and we know how it is battling some things that they’ve gone through and that they’ve been through. So yeah, just to have their backs and just show that they’re loved and that we really appreciate it.” Both families have ties to Garland, as his mother went to high school with both of the fallen service members. He wants to take the opportunity his platform provides to show them love and do his favorite thing: put a smile on someone’s face. “I try to do it a little bit more often now, especially to kids and those with special needs,” Garland said. “I was one of the kids growing up looking up to Kobe, LeBron, Dame Lillard, Steph, so when I was growing up and they were giving back to younger kids and other people, I just always wanted to do the same. I know that it’ll just make their whole day and change the way that they look at things. So, trying to do it often and just try to put a smile on somebody’s face. That always means a lot to me, because I always wear a smile on my face.”   A post shared by Cavs Care (@cavscare_)  The way the Cavs have played so far this season has put an awful lot of smiles on faces in Cleveland, and Garland credits their hot start to the connectivity of the group and the confidence that’s instilled up and down the roster. This is the third year together for the Core Four, and many of their reserves have also been part of the team for at least a year or two. That familiarity has created a culture of accountability, with Garland noting that from players to coaches to the training staff, there’s a camaraderie that allows for honest conversations that make everyone better.  The newest face in the room is head coach Kenny Atkinson, as he took over for JB Bickerstaff (now in Detroit) with aspirations of taking this group to the next level. Garland, like everyone else in Cleveland, has been impressed with how Atkinson hit the ground running with the Cavs, and highlighted the way he instills confidence in everyone as the biggest thing he’s brought to the team. “He was a player, so he knows what it’s like playing a lot of games, and just having that confidence out on the floor — I mean, when you have that confidence, I think you just get boosted a little bit more,” Garland said. “You think that you can do anything and make any kind of shot, and that’s what our team has right now. We’re shooting the ball with confidence, making plays with confidence, and we’re doing it on both ends of the floor, and I think that’s where he’s just instilling us. Even at film, when we don’t shoot a shot we’re wide open, he’s going to get on us about shooting the ball, because that might be the only good shot that we have in that possession. So he wants us to shoot every ball with confidence, shoot every open one and just keep continuing to play hard and trust each other.” Garland has always been a good shooter, but last season, that confidence in his shot waned a bit, particularly in the postseason. That gave Garland plenty of motivation this summer, where he stripped his game back down to the basics and built it back up with a focus on the little details that go a long way in the games.  “Just trying to pay attention to details,” Garland said. “Just try to do all the little things to make me a better scorer, make me a better shooter. Literally the smallest things, like getting my feet ready, staying down low before I even get the ball. I mean, just literally everything, all the little things. I really went back from square one, from when I started basketball and just worked my way up until I could really start moving and going full speed for the entire summer. So I really went back to the basics this summer, and just tried to clean everything up and just try to polish everything, and getting some of the results back right now.”  The results are the best shooting percentages of his career from every level, with splits of 53.8/47.5/95.0 through the first 11 games. He’s finishing better than he ever has at the rim, a byproduct of the strength he added over the summer, and he’s shooting threes at a higher rate and making more of them than he ever has as a pro. That’s a lethal combination, and he certainly seems to have found that wiggle off the bounce once again, helped by his decisiveness and confidence with the ball as both a shooter and driving to attack the defense.  Garland is far from alone in having a strong start, as the Cavs are finding a way to feed off each other and recognizing how each of them can make the others better. Along with Garland’s return to All-Star form, Mobley has become a bigger part of the offense and is a big beneficiary of that boost of confidence Atkinson has provided. Mobley playing with more force and freedom on both ends of the floor raises their ceiling, and Garland is quick to note how his play opens up so much of the floor for everyone else, calling him “our catalyst.” “He gets us going on both ends of the floor, and he can do so many things, especially on offensive side of the ball,” Garland said. “We can set a 1-5 pick and roll with him, and I go set a pick-and-roll, or Don go set a pick-and-roll for him, and let him just work off that screen. And when he gets downhill he’s a great decision maker, so he’s going to make the right read. We really have a lot of trust in him. We just want him to continue to be confident in his game, want him to shoot some more threes, which is getting better over the years. And yeah, just to be the leader on both ends of the floor, especially defensively. Hopefully he’s All-NBA or Defensive Player of the Year this year, which he’s super capable of, and especially him and JA back there, it’s really tough to get anything at the rim.” The grind of the NBA regular season is impossible to avoid, but the Cavs have found an early comfort in leaning on their depth. At the top, they can play to the hot hand among their stars, but they’re finding an ability to be more adaptable as a roster to change their approach and lineups as needed based on matchups and game flow. With Mobley and Allen, they’ve always been able to go big, but against Brooklyn on Saturday, they closed with a four-guard lineup and showed how they can succeed going small, with Caris LeVert and Ty Jerome stepping in and playing well to close out their 11th win to start the season. As Garland explains, their experiences together, the highs and the lows, have taught them a lot about how they need to play, particularly in late game situations where slowing down and getting stagnant to let one player operate can be tempting, but ultimately plays into the hands of the defense.  “We have so much talent on this team and a lot of depth, so we just have a lot of confidence in everybody, and we’ve been in these situations before. Like I said, we’ve been around each other for a couple years now, so we know what to do. We’ve seen all different scenarios, from being in regular season or the playoffs, so when it’s late game situations, I think that we’re starting to get pretty good at it. And even with our depth last night, Ty Jerome and Caris, they ended the game with us. And, I mean, they made a difference when we went four guards and Evan at the five. It’s just so many different things that we can do because of because of our depth. And we got so much talent. I mean, you really have to just pick and poison, either you’re gonna give up a wide open three or a layup or a floater or something.” Garland and the Cavs know there are no banners to be hung for a fast start to the season, but for a team that just never seemed to hit their stride a year ago, this stretch is a reminder to both themselves and the rest of the league that they do have the kind of ceiling where they can beat anyone. There are still 71 games left in the season, but building the confidence and trust internally early on figures to pay dividends down the road.  For now, the Cavs will look to prolong their winning streak as long as they can, but as Garland notes, they have “bigger plans in May and June” and hope to keep putting smiles on faces in Cleveland deep into the spring."

	Barrett did a literal double-take and couldn't stop from blurting out ""Game of Thrones!""","There is no team that has more celebrities attend their games than the Lakers (the Knicks being a close second), as the courtside seats at L.A. games often go a few rows deep with stars from the world of entertainment. There are the regulars like Jack Nicholson and Denzel Washington, but on any given night you might find an actor from your favorite TV show or movie watching the Lakers play.  That happened to Toronto wing RJ Barrett on Sunday night as the Raptors made their annual trek to Los Angeles. After finishing through contact for an and-1, Barrett turned to the crowd in the corner to celebrate only to find himself face-to-face with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, best known for playing Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones. Barrett realized this mid-celebration and did a literal double take, turned back to Coster-Waldau, pointed, and blurted out “Game of Thrones!” at him before turning around and walking to the free throw line.   A post shared by Dime (@dimemagazine)  It’s a very funny thing to happen in the middle of an NBA game, but also, that’s exactly how I would react if I turned around and was suddenly face-to-face with the guy that played Jaime Lannister. I feel like this is far from the first time someone has pointed at Coster-Waldau and just yelled “Game of Thrones!” at him, as that is by far the role he’s best known for."

	We caught up with Liv Morgan after she made history as the first Women's Crown Jewel Champion.","Before kicking off the Liv Morgan World Tour, and before becoming the first Women’s Crown Jewel Champion, the current Women’s World Champion sat at home nursing a dislocated shoulder. As Liv Morgan recovered for six months throughout 2023, she says she had a moment of clarity.  Over the first decade of her career, she’d allowed her ring work to speak for itself. During her time away, Morgan took a step back and felt like she had lacked a true voice or character. As she plotted her return to the ring, she created the Liv Morgan Revenge Tour built around the realities of her injury, while envisioning a path back to the top of the WWE mountain.  “The Liv Morgan Revenge Tour,” Morgan tells Uproxx Sports, “gave me such a purpose.” Some of the best stories in professional wrestling have been at least somewhat based in reality, and the way Morgan was injured gave her a motive, direction, and something so personal and true, that it allowed her for the first time in her career to really sink her teeth into a story. “Rhea (Ripley) really did dislocate my shoulder,” Morgan says. “I really sat home for six months watching her ascend to the top of the division. And so it was all really personal to me, and I used all that to come back and do exactly to her what she did to me. But I did that and more.” While she’s navigated trying to find her character throughout a decade in WWE, elements of who Morgan is as a person have helped her continue to chip away at this dream. Her drive, passion, wanting to learn as much as she can, and desire to give herself an opportunity to see what she could achieve has brought her this far.  “(My time away) just gave me the time and space that I needed to really settle into my own, which brought out the best version of Liv Morgan than we’ve seen thus far,” Morgan says.  The last seven months have been a whirlwind for Morgan. She kicked off the Raw after WrestleMania 40 with a beatdown of Ripley that would alter the trajectory of her career. A legitimate shoulder injury suffered in the melee forced Ripley to relinquish the title and led to Morgan beating Becky Lynch for the belt. That win kickstarted the pivotal run of her career, with new twists and turns added by the month.  “I like to believe that everything happens for a reason. Even if you don’t know the reason, I know that’s so cliche, but I really live my life by that. And so even when things happen that I feel are bizarre or even unfortunate things, I always tend to think that on the other side of it, it is going to be for a greater purpose,” Morgan says.  “There’s so much beauty in the madness and it’s cool to be able to pivot and adjust when things aren’t going the way we anticipated it, because we took something that was supposed to be great and we made it even greater. And so I just think that the stars are aligned and everything is happening exactly as it should.” Morgan has embraced the “crazy, messy love triangle” that’s followed her dynamic with Dominik Mysterio and Ripley, “whether they love to hate us or hate to love us.” Mysterio switched allegiances, Morgan joined the Judgement Day while Ripley was ousted, Raquel Rodriguez returned to join her side, and Ripley recently suffered another injury that will sideline her for the foreseeable future. Paired alongside Mysterio and thus far able to hold off Ripley, Morgan isn’t just matching the status quo for a world champion — she’s literally doing things that haven’t been done before.  The latest in her evolution from charting a Revenge Tour to creating a Liv Morgan World Tour came with a championship-worthy diamond ring, after claiming the first-ever Women’s Crown Jewel Championship in a win over Nia Jax last week.  “It means so much to me on so many different levels,” Morgan continues. “We’ve made history in Saudi Arabia. We had the very first women’s title match for the Women’s Crown Jewel Championship. And that is so much progress. I feel like since I’ve started in WWE, all I’ve wanted to do is really carve my own path and see how great I could become. And the fact that I’ve made history and the first and only Women’s Crown Jewel Champion, I am just so proud and so honored. And I just hope that I do it justice.” The opportunities are endless for where Morgan goes from here. She’s open to the idea of a second Evolution all-women’s wrestling show, with a loaded roster across Raw, Smackdown, and NXT.  “I don’t think we need our own show to be more prestigious,” Morgan says. “I think we are prestigious and I think people tune in specifically for the women’s segments and for women’s wrestling. But to give the fans what they want is why I would love to have another all women’s show in Evolution part 2.” A WrestleMania main event is something that’s eluded Morgan across her career, but calls it the pinnacle of wrestling in WWE and is without a doubt an accomplishment she’d love to check off her bucket list. “You can’t get any bigger, higher, better, more prestigious than main eventing WrestleMania,” Morgan says. “I spend a lot of my life dreaming and hoping and wishing. And I’ve been fortunate and lucky and blessed enough to have a lot of those things come true. So yes, main eventing WrestleMania is definitely on my list. With whom, I don’t know what that looks like or what it is but I hope that we can find out together.” Morgan can accomplish just about anything because at this very moment she genuinely has the faith and belief that she can. As she continues to build upon her second world title run, the Liv Morgan we see onscreen every week couldn’t be any more different than the one that was Smackdown Champion two years ago.  “It’s just a different Liv Morgan. The Liv Morgan that won the SmackDown Championship from Ronda Rousey, that girl she was just happy to be there. She maybe didn’t even see herself or believe in herself as a champion yet. She was a girl with just a pipe dream, cash in her briefcase at the right moment in the right time,” Morgan says. “This Liv Morgan is the most confident version of herself so far. This Liv Morgan knows her worth. This Liv Morgan knows she’s the greatest women’s champion of all time. This Liv Morgan knows she’s untouchable. This Liv Morgan knows she has the most dominant faction in all of WWE by her side. That’s the difference.”"

	Holmgren fell hard on his right hip after contesting a shot and had to be helped off the floor without putting weight on his right leg.","The Oklahoma City Thunder entered Sunday tied with the Suns for the top spot in the Western Conference, and figured to face a stiff test with the red-hot Golden State Warriors in town. OKC got off to a strong start, taking a 33-26 lead after the first quarter, but there was some considerable concern about their star big man as Chet Holmgren had to be helped off the floor and into the locker room after landing hard on his right hip after contesting an Andrew Wiggins layup attempt at the rim (watch here).  Holmgren slams down onto the hardwood and immediately grabbed at his right hip in pain. He was ultimately helped off the floor and into the tunnel without putting any weight on his right leg by a pair of Thunder staffers. Holmgren has gotten off to a tremendous start to his sophomore campaign, averaging 18.2 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 2.9 blocks per game coming into Sunday’s contest, asserting himself as a serious threat for DPOY with his work protecting the rim for the league’s best defense so far.  The Thunder will hope Holmgren’s injury was just a painful fall and not something more serious that could lead to an extended absence, as they are already incredibly thin at the center position with Isaiah Hartenstein still out with a fractured hand.  UPDATE: Holmgren was ruled out for the game with what the Thunder officially called a right hip injury. Shams Charania reported later Monday night that Holmgren would miss 8-10 weeks with a hip fracture."

	Giannis played a little prank on Jaylen Brown after catching him with an elbow, but the Celtics star wasn't a big fan of Giannis' antics.","The Milwaukee Bucks and Boston Celtics have had two very different starts to the season, as the defending champs have picked up where they left off with another strong beginning to their repeat bid, while the Bucks have been one of the NBA’s worst teams despite having a healthy Damian Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo.  It has not been the kind of start Milwaukee envisioned, and they were hoping to kickstart a turnaround on Sunday when they played host to the Celtics with a chance to alleviate some of the panic about the team’s start by beating one of the league’s best. As they’ve done on a few occasions this season, the Bucks came out hot, scoring 40 in the first quarter to take a double-digit lead, but couldn’t maintain that offensive output, scoring just 38 in the entire second half to see the Celtics pull ahead and pull away for a 113-107 win.  During the game, Giannis and Jaylen Brown had an interesting exchange, as Antetokounmpo elbowed Brown in the head on a post move and then hit Brown with a fake handshake as they went back down the court, which Brown didn’t seem to appreciate.   A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston)  After the game, Brown gave some brief, but unfiltered thoughts on the exchange. “Giannis is a child,” Brown dead-panned. “I’m just focused on helping my team get a win, and that’s what we did tonight.”  Giannis certainly wasn’t the chief culprit for the Bucks struggles on Sunday, as he had 43 points and 13 rebounds, but this kind of silly exchange doesn’t quite land as well with fans when the team is falling to 2-8 on the season, with the only team worse than them in the East being the Embiid-less Sixers."

	The Chiefs moved to 9-0 after blocking a 35-yard kick by Denver with one second left that would've won the game.","The Kansas City Chiefs entered Sunday as the NFL’s last remaining undefeated team at 8-0, and were heavy favorites to move to 9-0 at home against their divisional rival from Denver. However, the Chiefs offense, which has been sluggish at times this season, could not finish off drives with touchdowns and allowed the Broncos to hang around all game.  On Sunday, it looked like that would finally catch up to them and result in a loss, as the Broncos moved the ball inside the Chiefs 20 on their final drive of the game, trailing 16-14, setting up a 35-yard field goal attempt for the win by Wil Lutz. However, the Chiefs special teams unit still had at least one more miracle in them, as George Karlaftis, Leo Chenal, and company caved in the left side of the Broncos field goal unit and blocked the kick to preserve the 16-14 win.  A post shared by NFL (@nfl)  It’s an insane way for the Chiefs to win that game, as they were completely unable to run the ball (19 carries for 57 yards, 19 yards coming from Patrick Mahomes scrambling), missed a number of big play opportunities and had to settle for field goals, and gave up a critical late game drive deep into their own territory. And yet, they move on to Week 11 at 9-0 on the season with a schedule that isn’t the most difficult if they can get past a road trip to Buffalo next week — although, as Sunday proved, division games can always get weird."
Sports – UPROXX,The Bucks Have ‘Called The Whole League’ Trying To Find A Trade After Their Awful Start,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/milwaukee-bucks-trade-rumors-called-whole-league/,"Fri, 08 Nov 2024 22:30:53 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	The Bucks are trying to find a roster upgrade, but with their cap situation, they're finding it nearly impossible despite their best effort.","The Milwaukee Bucks came into the 2024-25 season hopeful that having both Damian Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo fully healthy and coming off a full training camp together would vault them back into being a threat in the Eastern Conference. Instead, the Bucks are 2-6 with their only wins over the tanking Jazz and the Sixers on opening night — who were without Joel Embiid and Paul George and have also looked awful to start the season.  It’s been rough on both sides of the ball for the Bucks, as they are in the bottom half of the league in both offensive and defensive rating through the first few weeks of the season, and while things should improve if and when Khris Middleton can get back healthy for an extended period of time, it’s also pretty clear this roster has some flaws in need of fixing. The problem for the Bucks is, as a second apron team, making a trade is extremely difficult, as they’ve found out the hard way recently.  On Friday’s episode of NBA Today, Brian Windhorst said the Bucks have “called pretty much the whole league” trying to find a trade that could improve their roster, but have run into the same issues with just about everyone.  “The Bucks are doing something that we don’t see very often, which is scouring the trade market in the first week of November,” Windhorst said. “As I was talking to teams this week, they were like, ‘The Bucks just called. The Bucks just called.’ I think the Bucks right now are just kind of searching and trying to cover their bases. And by the way, Giannis is not on the table, Dame is not on the table, they’re looking to try and (find) help for some of their wing play — Khris Middleton’s absence has been extended.  “I talked to one team who said, ‘Yeah, we talked to the Bucks. We came up with two or three different scenarios and realized we’re not allowed to make any of those trades.’ The Bucks are hemmed in as a second-apron team with the new rules. They can’t aggregate players together, they can’t put like two or three players together in a trade. They can’t do a trade where they bring in more money. They have traded away the next six first round picks, either the picks or the swaps, they have traded away the next six second round picks. They are $75 million in the luxury tax. I don’t think help is on the way through the trade market. But they are making calls, which is interesting because from what I can tell, they called pretty much the whole league.” The two players the Bucks were reported to be shopping over the summer (and even last trade deadline) were Bobby Portis and Pat Connaughton, but as Windhorst notes, being unable to aggregate those salaries together means they have to find a player to trade for that matches salary exactly or makes just a little less than either of those two. Given Portis makes just over $12.5 million and Connaughton makes just under $9.5 million, that’s a tough thing to do if the goal is to add a strong contributor for a contender. As such, Windy doesn’t expect them to find a miraculous deal out there, and it sounds like, despite the front office’s best efforts in working the phones, it’s going to come down to this roster to turn things around in Milwaukee."

	Come get these winners.","More than half of the 2024 NFL regular season is over. That reality is painful for those enjoy consuming every aspect of professional football and, in this space, things haven’t gone particularly well. In fact, it was largely a disaster for the first seven weeks but, after back-to-back winning performances, optimism is beginning to creep in.  Would it have been better if the Cleveland Browns or Green Bay Packers could’ve taken care of business last week? Certainly. But here we are after a 3-2 showing. Before handing out this week’s selections, let’s take stock as we dig out of the hole.  Come get these winners. I am actually quite high on the Bills dating back to the summer, but I can’t get them to -4 here. Buffalo is riding high with a four-game winning streak, which helps to explain the number, and Indianapolis has flopped with two straight losses. Still, Joe Flacco and company shouldn’t be getting a full four at home, and we have to take the candy. This is just a principle play. We’re taking advantage of a Wong teaser here, sending Pittsburgh through a pair of key numbers and doing the same with Kansas City. The Steelers have been a wagon as an underdog under Mike Tomlin. The Chiefs will eventually lose (I think) but it won’t be here.  As noted a week ago, this credit goes to UPROXX editor Robby Kalland, but NFC South overs are unbeaten this season. Perhaps that will come to an end here, but Atlanta’s offense can put up points in bunches and its defense is capable of letting the Saints hang around. Let’s go touchdowns. I have to admit that I hate this. I know my editors will hate this. But Los Angeles is laying more than a touchdown with a total in the 30’s? It isn’t as if the Chargers have a real home-field advantage either. I’m holding my nose as I type this, but I simply must. New York has been a sharp side all week, and that makes sense. I couldn’t quite give out the Jets in an awesome spot last week, but I think this is a sell-high spot on Arizona after their blowout win over Chicago. Take me there, Aaron Rodgers."

	The new release from ""A Philly Special Christmas Party"" features an unlikely duet between the Hall of Fame center and the legendary singer.","Jason Kelce clearly has some pretty major aspirations for this year’s version of his annual Christmas album. Earlier this month, fans of Kelce’s holiday project with his former Philadelphia Eagles teammates Lane Johnson and Jordan Mailata heard the first track off of their upcoming album A Philly Special Christmas Party, which featured Kelce teaming up with his brother, Travis Kelce, and Boyz II Men on the track “It’s Christmas Time (In Cleveland Heights).” Kelce collaborated with another legendary artist for the latest track off of the upcoming release, as he recorded a duet with Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks. The track, a cover of Ron Sexsmith’s “Maybe This Christmas,” got teased on the project’s Instagram account over the last week and on the latest edition of the Kelce brothers’ podcast, and was officially unveiled on Friday.  A post shared by A Philly Special Christmas (@aphillyspecialchristmas)  “There are no words to describe how incredible it is to have Stevie Nicks on this record,” executive producer Conner Barwin said in a statement given to Rolling Stone. “There is so much emotion in this song, and it was thrilling to be with them in the studio and watch her and Jason connect, be creative together, and witness this beautiful song become a reality.” A Philly Special Christmas Party will come out on Nov. 22, 2024, but if you’d like to listen to the new track, you can do that right here."

	NBA players have been appearing in music videos for years, and today, we highlighted some of the best cameos.","NBA players and musical artists have always been close with one another. One frequent way that we’ve seen that over the years is music videos, as NBA players have frequently made cameos in them, whether they’re just showing their face for a moment or they’re a main character in the story that an artist is trying to tell. Today, we wanted to highlight some of our favorite appearances that NBA players have made in music videos over the years. Players from a number of different eras — and songs from a number of different genres — made it on the list, but all of them feature artists making it a point to get some of the biggest names in basketball into their videos. This wasn’t the only time Kobe linked up with Destiny’s Child — he recorded a verse on a remix of their track “Say My Name.” He does have a cameo in the video for “Bug-a-Boo,” though, as Destiny’s Child — which is trying to get away from a group that is bugging them — dips into a locker room. While going through there, they come across Bryant, who is sitting there and getting ready to play basketball. MJ and MJ just had to appear in a music video together at some point, no? The two appear on a basketball court and shoot hoops with one another, and at one point, Michael (Jackson) teaches Michael (Jordan) some dance moves. These might have been the two most famous people in the world when this video came out in 1992, and it’s a pretty remarkable cultural artifact. The newest release on this list, DeRozan was one of the many celebrities who made a cameo in Lamar’s summer anthem that doubled as the high point of his feud with Drake from earlier this year. It turns out DeRozan has known Lamar for quite some time, and while he said he still has love for Drake despite appearing in this video, well, it sure seems like there might be some tension here. Shaq, as we’ve laid out before, has been in a ton of music videos over the years. His first was the iconic “Make ‘Em Say Uhh!” video, where he sits courtside and looks like he’s having the time of his life as Master P and co. put on a show on the hardwood. One of the biggest music videos of all time — it’s a little more than 14 and a half minutes long, and is absolutely jam packed with some of the biggest names in sports and entertainment at that time. Names like Deion Sanders, Rickey Henderson, and Wayne Gretzky make cameos, while the NBA is well-represented with two members of the Dream Team and, uh, a third player who was almost on the Dream Team. Easily the most … unique video on this list. It features Jimmy Butler dressed up in what I can only describe as an emo cowboy costume and really committing fully to the bit. (The bit, of course, is “Jimmy Butler dressing like this in a Fall Out Boy video.”) There is no one in the NBA quite like Jimmy, and this video is a pretty good example of why that is the case."

	Travis Kelce caught a stray on 'Jeopardy!.'","Travis Kelce has long been one of the NFL’s most visible stars, but recently, he has achieved a new level of widespread cultural notoriety thanks to his relationship with Taylor Swift. Jeopardy! made a nod to that during the November 6 episode. In the episode’s opening round (per J! Archive), the $200 clue in the “The TV Show In Question” category read, “Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity? is hosted by this man who’s maybe more famous as a BF than as a 3-time Super Bowl champ.” Contestant Derek Hieronymus correctly responded with Kelce. Here’s a video of the moment. This came shortly after Jeopardy! found itself in a bit of hot water. As USA Today notes, Heather Ryan, a contestant on the October 28 episode, recently spoke out about a clue that read, “Men seldom make passes at…,” with the correct response being, “Girls who wear glasses.” She said, “It is definitely an odd choice. I think it made everybody in the audience and on stage — and Ken Jennings, too — a little uncomfortable. It was like, ‘Oh, that was unexpected.’ Maybe we choose better rhyming phrases in 2024. […] Unfortunately, there are still girls who are (in) middle school, and they don’t want to wear their glasses and they’re losing out on their education. So, I think it’s much better to be able to see than anything else.” Jennings apologized following the incident, saying, “A little problematic, sorry Heather.”"

He eventually landed on his dad’s Los Angeles Lakers squad in the second round of this year’s NBA draft. After just a few games, however, he was sent to play in the NBA’s G League to build up his skills.  
	Upon his arrival, it was reported that Bronny would “shuttle” between both teams during an undisclosed period of time and will only be playing in G League home games, as to not fly commercial with his South Bay Lakers teammates. It is also reported that Bronny would be skipping road games due to the team staying at affordable hotels like the Courtyard-Marriott, rubbing many, including former NFL star and podcaster Ryan Clark, the wrong way.

	








 
	On his The Pivot podcast, Clark shared his confusion over Bronny’s ability to skip games due to travel and lodging accommodations when he hasn’t earned his stripes as an athlete just yet.

	“What has Bronny James done that he shouldn’t be able to stay at the Courtyard-Marriott?,” Clark questioned. “You say, ‘well, they fly commercial.’ What has Bronny James done where he should be too good to fly commercial? The pros isn’t about where you came from, how you were raised, what your parents had. Professional sports is about how well you can contribute, and you don’t get treated differently because of your parents.” A post shared by The Neighborhood Talk (@theneighborhoodtalk) 
	Many agree with Clark, including ESPN reporter Brian Windhorst, who believes coddling Bronny now will be “detrimental” to his career, adding that he believes the special treatment the former USC student receives from the Lakers has gone “too far,” The Post reports.   
	Another ESPN insider, however, is arguing that the Lakers are treating Bronny differently because, well, he’s different.  
	“Bronny James isn’t just your normal, everyday G League player,” ESPN’s Shams Charania said on The Pat McAfee Show on Tuesday. 
	“I don’t know if it’s a security thing, but there’s a different level of fanfare when he’s on the road for these G League games, a different level of everything when he’s with that G League team. How do you manage that on the road? I don’t think the door is necessarily completely shut on him playing in those road games as the G League season goes on, but as of right now that is the plan that the Lakers have laid out, and they want him to continue to shuttle back and forth, spend as much time on the active roster as possible.”

The fight ended up being highly underwhelming for many, and Michael Irvin recently shared his belief that most likely was not an accident. 
	“That fight was a lie,” he said during an appearance on Cam’ron and Ma$e’s popular sports talk show It Is What It Is. He continued, citing how both boxers didn’t seem to be putting in 100% effort and Iron Mike did not utilize a special move in his arsenal. “Everybody’s lying […] they had no intentions to really strap it on. If you look through that, I didn’t see one patented uppercut by Mike Tyson. What did Mike Tyson win on? Uppercut.”

	








 
	The NFL Hall Of Famer revealed rumors he heard that could explain why the fight wasn’t as exciting as it was promoted to be. “I heard some people talking about they couldn’t put [Mike Tyson’s uppercut] in the contract,” he stated. “He couldn’t body and then uppercut. Like, how can you put that in a fight contract?”

	Michael Irvin continued his assessment of the fight and rumored contrast terms by drawing a parallel to his NFL career. “That’s like making me play a game without running a slant route in the deep end or the deep out,” he said. “You do what you do best. If they take that away, you ain’t that dude anymore, and they took that away.” 
DJ Whoo Kid supported Irvin’s claims when he recounted a conversation he had with Jake Paul at a fight after-party, saying, “Legally they each cannot go at each other hard.” Despite being disappointed by how the boxing match went, the former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver was happy to see Mike Tyson secure a large payday. “I’m happy he got every dime, or whatever it is,” he said. “I want him to get his money. I just wanted him to free the beast.” 
	Per the final tally of the fight, Tyson threw 97 punches and only landed 18. Paul threw 278 punches and landed 78. Iron Mike was paid $20 million and Paul got $40 million. One valid explanation for the underwhelming bout is the health issues Tyson dealt with in the lead-up, which made them postpone the match as it was originally booked for July. He suffered from an ulcer flare-up and revealed that he almost died in June. 

	








 
	“This is one of those situations when you lost but still won,” Mike Tyson wrote on X. “I’m grateful for last night. No regrets to get in ring one last time. I almost died in June. Had 8 blood transfusions. Lost half my blood and 25lbs in hospital and had to fight to get healthy to fight so I won. To have my children see me stand toe to toe and finish 8 rounds with a talented fighter half my age in front of a packed Dallas Cowboy stadium is an experience that no man has the right to ask for. Thank you.” 
	“I wanted to give the fans a show, but I didn’t want hurt someone who didn’t need to be hurt,” Jake Paul said of the match. “I didn’t wanna hurt someone that didn’t need to be hurt.”  Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox"

	People’s complaints about the quality of Netflix’s stream were well-documented in realtime on social media during the night of the showdown. One user wrote, “How are y’all gonna have the biggest fight of the year on your platform & y’all stream can’t go longer than 5 minutes without buffering… WTF Netflix.” 
	Another person raised concerns about another major event next month and expressed doubt about whether or not Netflix could handle the traffic. “Netflix couldn’t even stream a Tyson fight right but now they doing a Christmas NFL game. Featuring Beyonce. Ok bro,” they sarcastically typed.

	On Nov. 6, Portis, the Milwaukee Bucks forward released a public message via Instagram pleading for the public’s assistance in locating the stolen items, which he’s willing to pay $40,000 cash for. In the video, Portis spoke of his love for the city of Milwaukee, where he became a resident after signing a deal with the Bucks organization in 2020. 
	“Over the last four-and-a-half seasons, I’ve considered Milwaukee as a home,” Portis, 29, said. “I’ve grown here, I come here a boy and elevated into a man. The love you guys have given me here isn’t something I’ve ever felt before in my NBA career.”

	








 
	He continued, explaining the circumstances behind the burglary, which occurred while Portis was out of town for the Bucks’ matchup against the Cleveland Cavaliers earlier this month.

	“While I was at the game yesterday, we had a home invasion and they took most of my prized possessions,” Portis added, expressing the importance that the items, which he did not specify, hold to him and his family. 
	The burglary of Portis’ home marks the latest in a string of home invasions seemingly targeting professional athletes that have occurred in recent months. 
	In September, Minnesota Timberwolves guard Mike Conley’s Minnesota home was broken into and ransacked, with jewelry being listed among the items stolen. Authorities believe the burglary of Portis and Conley’s homes could possibly be connected due to similarities in the two break-ins, despite occurring in neighboring states. 
	NFL stars and reigning Super Bowl champions Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce’s homes were also burglarized in October, within a 48-hour period of one another. While no items were reported as stolen from Mahomes’ residence, the culprits in the burglary of Kelce’s home made off with $20,000 after breaking into the property through a rear door.

	








 
	Drafted in the first round of the 2015 NBA Draft by the Chicago Bulls, Portis has spent time with Bulls, Washington Wizards, and New York Knicks before joining the Bucks, winning a championship with the team in 2021.

	Jake Paul came out to to the ring to Phil Collins’ “In The Air Tonight,” riding in a customized low-rider with his brother Logan Paul. The entrance was jam-packed with thinly veiled jabs at Tyson, with the song referencing the boxer’s appearance in The Hangover, and even a bird, referencing the “Now Kith” meme. Tyson, however, walked out to the ring with pure intention of throwing down and nothing more. And all the built-up tension was released as the two combatants entered the ring for the highly-anticipated showdown. 
	While both Tyson and Paul promised to knock the other boxer out before the 5th round, the match surprisingly went for the entire eight rounds. Tyson came out swinging for the first two rounds but Father Time quickly got Iron Mike together, as the icon began to slow down with each subsequent round. Paul kept to a moderate pace throughout the whole match.

	“I’m going to do everything Coach Autry needs me to do,” Anthony added. “We talk a lot, especially late at night, about how we can make Syracuse basketball great. Off the court, Coach is super cool.

	While Carmelo Anthony only played one season for the Orangemen, his impact on the university is undeniable.

Former NBA stars Carmelo Anthony and Rudy Gay recently chimed in on the recent back and forth between Drake and DeMar DeRozan, which was a byproduct of the 6 God’s feud with Kendrick Lamar earlier this year. 
	“I think Drake was hurt a little bit because of the relationship he built with DeMar in Toronto,” Melo said on an episode of his show 7PM In Brooklyn. “Representing the 6, Raptors — you know that was a lot of connection with those two. He’s a Raptor for life from a basketball standpoint. Yes, that jersey should be going up.” 

	








 
	Gay, who just recently retired from the NBA, previously played for the Raptors, and is a new recurring co-host on 7PM, disapproved of Drizzy’s behavior. “That’s wack, man. Drake is wack for that,” he asserted. “You gotta pull up on DeMar if you feel that way before you go on camera.” Melo agreed, especially regarding the Toronto rapper’s comments on taking down DeRozan’s banner if the Raptors ever hung one up for him.

	“Drake did a lot when he said I’ma go up there and take it down. That part is a lot,” Carmelo Anthony said. However, he acknowledged that DeRozan turned himself into Drake’s opposition when he joined Kendrick Lamar on stage at The Pop Out concert and appeared in the “Not Like Us” music video. “Those are shots. You my man, we in the crib, we hanging, we building the 6 up. From that standpoint, that would f**k me up, too. I’m gonna feel a way no matter what, but yes, you do have a conversation. As a man, you have a conversation.” 
	Though Rudy Gay did not like the “First Person Shooter” rapper’s actions, he leveled with Anthony on that part. “If you got a problem, come at me,” he said. “To see your man’s out there dancing with the enemy, that’s kinda crazy.” 
	Drake and DeMar DeRozan went viral earlier this month when the For All The Dogs rapper sat courtside for the Toronto Raptors matchup against the Sacramento Kings. At one point, he was interviewed on air and said, “Unfortunately, we’re playing this goof [DeRozan] tonight, but it is what it is” as well as “If you ever put up a DeRozan banner, I’ll go up there and pull it down myself.”

	








 
	After the Raptors defeated the Kings, Drake could be seen mouthing “F**k outta here pu**y” as DeRozan walked off the court. During a post-game press conference, the six-time All-Star was asked about the comments regarding the banner and said, “Well he gon’ have a long way to climb to take it down, so tell him good luck.” 
	This is a significant change in their relationship, just three years after DeRozan said that Drake would “forever have a friend” in him. When he was traded from the Raptors to the Spurs, despite being told he would not be traded, the five-time Grammy winner invited him to his house and gave him support in his time of disappointment. Even after appearing at The Pop Out and in the “Not Like Us” music video, he claimed that he still had love for the OVO head honcho. Those days are seemingly over.

Starting this weekend, he will bring his Green Bay Packers loyalty and overall football insight to NFL Network’s NFL GameDay Morning. 
	The NFL revealed Weezy F Baby as their new weekly guest this past Monday (Nov. 11). He will join their already loaded cast which boasts Rich Eisen, Kurt Warner, Steve Mariucci, Ian Rapoport, Mike Garafolo, Tom Pelissero, and a slew of lauded reporters next Sunday (Nov. 17).  
	Wayne’s guest spot was first teased during halftime of the New York Giants’ and Carolina Panthers’ game on Sunday morning (Nov. 10), live from Munich, Germany. The “A Milli” rapper is no stranger to talking sports, as he recently was a recurring guest on FS1’s Undisputed starring Skip Bayless.

	Lil Wayne’s history of sports talk goes back even further than that. He used to contribute blog posts to ESPN The Magazine and joined Around The Horn as a guest in 2009. He even found creative ways to bring together football and music, like his 2011 track “Green & Yellow” which was an homage to the Green Bay Packers. In 2016, he created “No Mercy” which was Shannon Sharpe and Skip Bayless’ theme song on Undisputed.

Sports,Bronny James To Play For Lakers’ G League South Bay Team,https://www.vibe.com/news/sports/bronny-james-lakers-g-league-south-bay-team-1234942101/,"Fri, 08 Nov 2024 16:19:23 +0000",Bronny will make his South Bay debut in their game against Salt Lake City.,"Bronny James will now play for the Los Angeles Lakers‘ G League affiliate, South Bay.  
ESPN reports that the rookie NBA player will make his debut with the minor league squad in a Saturday exhibition against Salt Lake City. However, Bronny will be on the Lakers roster for their game on Friday, squaring off against the underperforming Philadelphia 76ers. 
	Sources close to the Lakers state that Bronny will only play for South Bay during their home games. James will then “shuttle” between both teams during an undisclosed period of time. While it may come as a shock to some fans, Lakers head coach JJ Redick explained that this was the plan they had for Bronny “since day one.” 
	Bronny James’ situation isn’t unique to him, either. As he was selected to the Lakers with the 55th pick of the 2024 NBA Draft, it was expected that he would get some burn in the G League. Historically speaking, players selected late in the second tend to spend time in the minor league to get additional coaching, structure in their respective team’s culture, and gain game reps.

	








 A post shared by South Bay Lakers (@southbaylakers) 
	Bronny James has only played in four games this season for the Los Angeles Lakers out of the eight games so far. The Lakers are currently 10th in the Western Conference with their 4-4 record.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. When you hear a star player say the team played ""soft as f---"" after yet another blowout loss, the head coach is going to be questioned about whether he still has control of the locker room.  That's what happened to Brian Daboll on Monday morning following the New York Giants' loss at home to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 30-7.  Rookie receiver Malik Nabers, frustrated he didn't see a single target from new starting quarterback Tommy DeVito in the first half, was blunt with his team assessment after the game, which Daboll said led to some conversations.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM New York Giants wide receiver Malik Nabers warms up for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers game at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on Nov. 24, 2024. (Vincent Carchietta-Imagn Images)  ""Leek and I talked last night. We talked this morning. He’s a very competitive individual,"" Daboll told members of the media. ""Again, you want to get the ball in his hands, and I gotta do a better job getting the ball in his hands early. He’s a smart young guy who’s very competitive. When you lose like that, it’s a frustrating thing, but we’ve had good communication as we’ve always had."" Daboll added that he was going to keep what was said in-house, but Nabers wasn't the only one who felt the team lacked effort in the first game post-Daniel Jones' release.  STEPHEN A. SMITH'S CLAIM THAT GIANTS REACHED OUT TO ESPN ABOUT ELLE DUNCAN'S CRITICISM IS FALSE: REPORT Team captain Dexter Lawrence, who was vocal about the Jones situation, also said the team was playing ""soft"" on Sunday, while offensive lineman Jermaine Eluemunor said, ""I personally don't think everybody is giving 100%."" With a 2-9 record now and the organization virtually punting on the season with the release of Jones, who many believed was their best quarterback on the roster despite his own struggles, it's hard to rally the troops to finish the year strong.  But Daboll continues to say he believes in the process and culture that he and the coaching staff have in the locker room.  Malik Nabers on the bench during the Giants' 30-7 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at MetLife Stadium. (IMAGN) ""I believe in what we do. Obviously, the results have not shown themselves,"" Daboll said. ""I believe in the people, and we’ll continue to work as hard as we can, but certainly you think about things you need to change, whether it’s plays – whatever it may be. You’re always thinking what can you do better, and obviously there’s things you can do better. ""I feel good about our communication with the players, with the coaches. Certainly not happy about the results, but I expect a lot from those guys, and they should expect a lot from me. Again, there’s good communication process, but when you lose like that, it’s a frustrating thing."" Daboll, of course, doesn't want his players to be speaking about their frustrations publicly, but like he said, he respects their opinions on the matter.  It is tough for the Giants, though, because there are still six games left on the schedule, including a quick turnaround against the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving this week. Players are frustrated with the results, and losing six straight games is strenuous in a locker room no matter the sport.  New York Giants head coach Brian Daboll looks on before the game at MetLife Stadium.

For coaches, finishing strong can be the difference between another year leading the team, or having to look for a new job next season.  That's the unfortunate reality Daboll and some players in the locker room find themselves in with those remaining games on the schedule.  Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

The players, who represented several schools in the Mountain West Conference, sought to have forfeits rescinded, the standings adjusted and Fleming banned from the tournament citing First Amendment and Title IX violations. Crews’ ruling allowed Fleming to play in the tournament and the forfeits remain as losses.

(Joe Camporeale-USA Today Sports) Two months later, he showed up following the end of Survivor Series: War Games in Chicago – his hometown. It was one of the most shocking surprises in recent memory. Rumors ran rampant in the days and weeks leading into the premium live event, but each thought was met with skepticism. Until, as Levesque put it at the time, hell froze over. The WWE video showed Punk entering the Gorilla Position backstage with executive Bruce Prichard. He greeted Stephanie McMahon and others before he received his cue to go out to the thunderous applause. Fellow WWE stars watched the moment backstage. Wrestlers Bayley and Shotzi were among those surprised. ""What a way to do it,"" Shotzi said. Bayley ran to Gorilla Position to greet her longtime friend when he returned from the stage. ""I’m so happy you’re here,"" she said. Punk greeted nearly everyone who walked out from the men’s War Games match, including Cody Rhodes, Rhea Ripley, Damian Priest, Dominik Mysterio and Randy Orton. Orton also made his return to the WWE on the same night. CM Punk makes a shocking return to WWE on Nov. 25, 2023.

The video didn’t show Seth Rollins and Drew McIntyre’s reactions to Punk’s return. Neither wrestler appeared to be happy to see Punk back in WWE. While pro wrestlers are good at blurring the lines or reality and storyline angles, both acknowledge the real-life tensions they’ve had with Punk in the past. McIntyre told Fox News Digital in October that their issues were very real but had to put business first. ""You can feel the tension,"" he said. ""Everyone could feel the tension when him and I are near each other. We have to be professionals and do our job. We understand, we’ve been doing this a long time, that real personal issues, real hatred draws money. We also know when that bell rings, we can really lean into each other. None of us are going to complain and when we’re on the microphone, we can see how we feel. Both of us have thick skin, unlike a lot of our superstars – they want to cry whenever I tweet about them. I do appreciate that about them. ""But you can feel the tension when we’re around. And I remember there was some picture that came out online recently, and it was the big talk of the internet because Punk and I were close to each other during the day, and it was, ‘Oh my God they really don’t dislike each other.’ I was like, yeah, you frickin’ idiots. You don’t go to your office job and have to stand beside the guy you don’t like in your office occasionally just because someone snapped a picture of that moment because we’re dealing with a situation you have to deal with in your profession even if you can’t stand the p----."" Punk’s WWE return started with the McIntyre feud. It began at the Royal Rumble in January when McIntyre tore Punk’s triceps performing a move on him. From there, Punk tormented McIntyre and even cost him his brief World Heavyweight Championship reign at WrestleMania 40.

""I was so comfortable wearing spandex and very little of it because that's just what you wear when you're wearing a leotard, and you're competing. When I switched into golf, we were struggling a little bit financially, and so I didn't have the luxury to go out and buy a whole new golf-appropriate wardrobe. And so, I wore what was in my closet, which was workout clothes. That's just how I learned to play the game."" Spiranac said she considers golfers athletes and wondered ""why don’t we dress like athletes?"" She remarked about Lucas Glover sweating through his clothes during a PGA Tour event as why golfers should be able to wear what they are comfortable with. LIV golfers, for instance, are allowed to wear shorts during their competitions. ""That was always my mindset when I got into golf, and it really rubs people the wrong way, which is shocking,"" she said. ""They'll have really intense discussions over if they should wear shorts or pants or a blade collar or a real collar, and I'm just out here just in tank tops or spandex and people are like 'What are you doing?'

Lia Thomas, a transgender NCAA champion swimmer who caused controversy in the sport for competing against and winning races over women during the 2021-22 season, railed against an Iowa law that prohibited trans athletes in women’s and girls’ sports. Thomas spoke at the Trans Athletes and the Future of Sports event at Iowa State University earlier this month. Dr. Kelly Winfrey, an associate professor in women gender studies at the school, moderated the event, and Dr. Christina Roberts, a pediatrics professor specializing in adolescent health, joined One Iowa Policy and Advocacy Director Keenan Crow at the event.

(Brett Davis-USA TODAY Sports) Their talk dove into Iowa’s ban on trans inclusion in female sports, according to the Iowa State Daily. Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds signed the bill into law in March 2022. Several others states have since enacted their own laws against trans inclusion in women’s sports as well. ""With the ban here in Iowa … the state is actively saying to trans kids, ‘You don’t deserve to participate. You are actually being excluded,"" the former UPenn swimmer said at the Nov. 13 event. Thomas underscored the value that participating in sports added to the former swimmer’s everyday life. ""I had a team, a group I could identify with… it gave me that belonging,"" Thomas said. ""Athletics and, for me, the water, was just … a place of peace where I could leave my worries outside."" Crow said the ban on trans inclusion in sports barred transgender women and girls from the positivity sports can provide. ""Excluding trans athletes from sports denies them the chance to participate in a part of life that teaches resilience, teamwork and community… there’s value in just being on a team and being included, especially for young people who might be struggling to find acceptance,"" Crow said.  Roberts downplayed trans athletes having an advantage in women's sports after going through male puberty – pointing to studies that allegedly showed hormone therapy treatments lowering testosterone levels of female athletes in two years.

Paula Scanlan, who was Thomas’ teammate at UPenn, told the House Judiciary subcommittee last year that Thomas’ presence in the locker room created a bigger issue for her as a survivor of sexual assault. ""This is real. I know women who have lost roster spots and spots on the podium. I know of women with sexual trauma who are adversely impacted by having biological males in their locker room without their consent. I know this because I am one of these women,"" Scanlan said. ""I was sexually assaulted on June 3rd of 2016. I was only 16 years old. I was able to forgive my attacker but violence against women still exists. Let us not forget the viral #MeToo movement that empowered female victims to speak up.

No. 5 Indiana, which had been writing a terrific Cinderella story, completely folded when going up against No. 2 Ohio State. So, the question was: Who were the teams that were essentially locks for the College Football Playoff? The only answer could be No. 1 Oregon. The Ducks had the weekend off and already clinched a spot in the Big Ten Conference Championship. The 11 other spots appeared to be up for grabs. Which teams went home winners, and which teams went home losers? Let’s break it down here.

(AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack) Arizona State: How about those Sun Devils? Head coach Kenny Dillingham has Arizona State sitting in a tiebreaker for the Big 12 conference, but they control their own destiny after beating BYU on Saturday in what was a wild final minute of action. The biggest takeaway is that with Colorado losing, this sets up a massive final weekend in the conference, and Arizona State is one win away from playing for a title and a spot in the College Football Playoff.  Tennessee: Yes, the Vols beat UTEP on Saturday in what was not much of a football game. But it was what happened around them in the SEC that now has Tennessee in a prime spot for a playoff spot. With Ole Miss and Alabama both being upset on Saturday, a path opened for Josh Heupel's team to clinch a playoff berth next weekend against Vanderbilt. Just when you thought things wouldn't go their way, the Vols are now sitting pretty.  Florida: Since the school came out and said head coach Billy Napier is going to stay for next season, the Gators have done something they haven’t done since 2003: They beat a ranked opponent as an unranked opponent for the second straight game. The Gators picked off Ole Miss Rebels quarterback Jaxson Dart three times in the win, playing spoiler and delivering a crushing blow to the Rebels' playoff hopes. Notre Dame: Notre Dame is doing exactly what they are supposed to do, and the stink from their loss to Northern Illinois is gone. They went to a neutral field against a ranked Army team and ran them out of the building. Who knows if they can hang with Oregon, Ohio State and Texas, but they are rightfully within the top five. Oh, and how cool was it to see a Jeter back in the Bronx? Nebraska: Taking down Wisconsin, 44-25, finally gave Nebraska its elusive sixth win under Matt Rhule. The midseason addition of offensive coordinator Dana Holgorsen has transformed the Cornhuskers' offense. Oklahoma coach Brent Venables celebrates with fans after a college football game against Alabama in Norman, Okla., Saturday, Nov. 23, 2024. (BRYAN TERRY/THE OKLAHOMAN/USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images) Brent Venables: It's been a tough couple of weeks for Oklahoma Sooners head coach Brent Venables. He revealed his wife was battling cancer again as the season seemed to have slipped away. He finally got a win with a big upset over Alabama. The Sooners are 6-5 this season. Colorado: Well, Deion Sanders and the Buffaloes blew their opportunity at playing for the Big 12 championship. Sure, there are a few weird scenarios that could get them in, but the loss to Kansas all but confirms that the Colorado run has come to an end. The only good part about the game against the Jayhawks was Travis Hunter, who looks to have solidified the Heisman Trophy, in my opinion.  Ole Miss: If the Rebels had won out, they would be all but assured a spot in the College Football Playoffs. With their 24-17 loss to Florida, now they need nothing short of a miracle to make it. Jaxson Dart hadn’t thrown more than one interception in a game over the last two seasons prior to Saturday, when he threw three interceptions. Two of his interceptions came in the final two minutes of the game, sealing the Rebels' fate. Rutgers: A timeout that will live in infamy cost Rutgers a chance at its first win vs. a ranked opponent since 2009. The Scarlet Knights are bowl bound regardless, but it will be a senior day the program never gets back. Rutgers head coach Greg Schiano looks on during the first half against Illinois, Nov. 23, 2024, in Piscataway, N.J. (Vincent Carchietta-Imagn Images) North Carolina: The Tar Heels were humiliated by Boston College, and even a pair of late meaningless touchdowns didn't make it much prettier after falling behind 41-7. The SEC: Things went sideways for the conference in a wild way on Saturday. Ole Miss losing to Florida was thought to be the only madness we'd see this past weekend, but Alabama decided to join the party of losing a spot in the College Football Playoff by getting drilled by Oklahoma. Then, Texas A&M was beaten by Auburn in four overtimes, which has caused full-blown chaos in the conference. Georgia clinched a spot in the SEC championship, and the winner of Texas vs. Texas A&M will face the Bulldogs in Atlanta. But what happens if the Aggies win this weekend, then upset Georgia in Atlanta? We can only imagine.

He received the hand off from Hurts, made a move and zoomed through the Rams’ secondary for 72 yards. Barkley also had four catches for 47 yards.

But after the Gainwell touchdown, the Rams missed a field goal on their next drive and punted after that. Stafford threw a garbage-time touchdown to Cooper Kupp but the offense was far from what it needed to be to compete against the high-octane offense of the Eagles. They had no answer for Barkley.

But Glenn Jacobs, a Tennessee mayor and former WWE star, advised him not to do it.","Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Glenn Jacobs, the former WWE superstar who became the mayor of Knox County, Tennessee, said he would advise Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson against stepping into the political ring. Jacobs appeared on ""Going Ringside"" earlier in the week and was asked about the possibility of Johnson – a WWE legend, movie star and TKO board member – trying his hand at politics. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Knox County Mayor Glenn Jacobs (Jamar Coach/Jackson Sun/USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images/File) ""If I’m him, I wouldn’t. Politics is incredibly contentious and toxic right now,"" Jacobs said. ""Everybody likes Dwyane, no matter where you are on the political spectrum, because he’s a great entertainer, and he’s a good guy. ""Got to remember that no matter what you say in politics, 50% of the people are just going to knee-jerk disagree with you, and you’re going to really tick some folks off. I’ve had to deal with that, obviously. If I were him, I would advise him not to do that, personally."" Johnson’s name has been floated as a potential presidential candidate and at one point had aspirations to run. But he said in 2022 all of that took a backseat to raising a family. WWE LEGEND THE UNDERTAKER RECALLS BEING CAUGHT 'OFF GUARD' WITH TRUMP'S WRESTLING FANDOM, WHAT 'IMPRESSED' HIM Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson (WWE/Getty Images/File) Jacobs said there are still ways to make an impact behind the scenes, and while Johnson has historically been likable, it’s not going to be the same if he steps into the political sphere. ""What’s going to happen is that you’re going to immediately alienate almost half your fan base, which can be an uncomfortable place to be,"" he added.  Johnson got a taste of how toxic politics can be after he endorsed Joe Biden for president in 2020. He told ""Fox & Friends"" in April the endorsement was right for him at the time but that he regretted the division it caused. ""Am I going to do that again this year? That answer's no. I'm not going to do that,"" he told Fox News’ Will Cain at the time. ""Because what I realized that what that caused back then was something that tears me up in my guts back then and now, which is division. And that got me."" ""The takeaway after that months and months and months, I started to realize, like, ‘Oh man, that caused an incredible amount of division in our country.’ So I realize now going into this election, I'm not going to do that. I wouldn't do that because my goal is to bring our country together. I believe in that, in my DNA. So in the spirit of that, there's going to be no endorsement.""

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Cowboys score 24 points in 4th quarter for narrow victory over Commanders in bizarre game,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/cowboys-score-24-points-4th-quarter-narrow-victory-over-commanders-bizarre-game,"Sun, 24 Nov 2024 16:56:29 -0500",The Dallas Cowboys needed a bunch of scores and at least one defensive stop to defeat the Washington Commanders in a wild Week 12 game on Sunday.,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The Dallas Cowboys defeated the Washington Commanders, 34-26, on Sunday in their Week 12 NFC East battle. And that’s probably the easiest way to describe what occurred in the game The score was 3-3 at halftime and Dallas took a 10-9 lead with 4:40 left in the third quarter when Cooper Rush found Jalen Tolbert for a 6-yard touchdown. It seemed like it was going to be a defensive battle with no real scoring going on for either team. Then, the fourth quarter happened.

(AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough) The Cowboys took a 20-9 lead over the Commanders after Rush found tight end Luke Schoonmaker for a 22-yard touchdown. It seemed like it was enough for the Cowboys to close out the game as there was only 5:16 left. Jayden Daniels sparked a roaring comeback. He found Zach Ertz for a 4-yard touchdown pass to cut the deficit to three. Dallas struck back with a special teams play. Austin Seibert kicked the ball down the field. Returner KaVontae Turpin fumbled the ball initially, picked it up, made a spin move and then was gone. He galloped 99 yards for the score and the Cowboys had a 10-point lead. The Commanders drove down the field in six plays to set up Seibert for a 51-yard field goal. Dallas went three-and-out on its next possession. But inexplicably made a bad mistake on defense. Daniels found wide receiver Terry McLaurin and the veteran found space around Cowboys defenders and took the ball into the end zone. One play, 86 yards. Washington could have tied the game but Seibert missed the point-after attempt. The Commanders were down 27-26. Seibert tried the onside kick to recover it, but the ball bounced to Dallas player Juanyeh Thomas, who for some reason returned the ball 43 yards for a touchdown. It gave the Commanders one final drive. It would have been an even bigger calamity if Daniels found similar magic as he did against the Chicago Bears.

The two teams combined for 31 points in the fourth quarter. Rush was solid enough to get the win for the Cowboys. He was 24-of-32 with 247 passing yards and two touchdown passes. Schoonmaker had three catches for 55 yards. Tolbert had two catches for 22 yards. CeeDee Lamb led Dallas with 10 catches for 67 yards. The Commanders had three turnovers. Daniels had two interceptions – one to Chauncey Golston and the other to Israel Mukuamu. Commanders tight end John Bates also fumbled. The rookie quarterback was 25-of-38 with 275 yards and two touchdown passes. He also led the team with 74 rushing yards and had a rushing touchdown.

But the Panthers chipped away and played stout defense.  With less than two minutes to go, Chuba Hubbard scored a touchdown to cut their deficit to two, and after the Chiefs committed a defensive pass interference on the two-point conversion, Hubard took another handoff into the end zone to tie the game with 1:46 to go.

Dodgers players including reliever Joe Kelly and utility-man Chris Taylor have been critical of the Yankees after Los Angeles won the World Series in five games. Olney had some choice words for the Dodgers on a recent edition of ESPN’s “Baseball Tonight” podcast. “I know this: if the Yankees had won, Aaron Judge wouldn’t have crapped on the Dodgers,” Olney said, as covered by The Big Lead. “Giancarlo Stanton wouldn’t have. Anthony Volpe? No chance. “I think Taylor’s had a great career, the way he’s adjusted at the plate, he’s adapted to different positions,” Olney continued. “He’s one of the best in the world at what he does. But he and the small handful of other Dodgers who are chirping know better than anyone how hard their sport is to play, and they’re better than this. Why not bask in the glory of an incredible World Series win from the high ground?” Taylor made inflammatory remarks on Bleacher Report’s “On Base with Mookie Betts” show.  “We’re all kind of thinking it — (the Yankees) kind of (crapped) down their leg,” Taylor said, referring to the infamous comedy of errors that was Game 5’s fifth inning. “They were pressing. It was one thing after the next. … All we’ve got to do is put the ball in play right now.” On the “Baseball Isn’t Boring” podcast, Kelly ripped the Yankees as lazy. “We had seen it every single game just let them throw the ball to the infield, they can’t make a play,” Kelly said. “… It was a mismatch from the get-go. If we had a playoff re-ranking, they might be ranked the eighth or ninth-best playoff team. “You’re putting the Padres ahead of them, you’re putting the Phillies ahead of them, you’re putting the Mets ahead of them, you’re putting the Braves ahead of them, and the Braves just got unlucky because they had to play that doubleheader. “I mean, the Guardians played like crap, but the Guardians played better [defense] and better baseball all around. It was just a complete mismatch.”"
"NY Post Sports – Latest News, Scores, Stats & Videos","Pistons vs. Raptors prediction: NBA odds, picks, best bets Monday",https://nypost.com/2024/11/25/betting/pistons-vs-raptors-prediction-nba-odds-picks-best-bets/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 17:12:03 -0500",Sometimes previous games provide a window into how teams might specifically match up with one another.,"A common pitfall for novice bettors is to assume repeat performances, often ignoring the potential variances of a particular game.  For example, not many anticipated the Dallas Cowboys would compete with the Washington Commanders on Sunday, let alone win as a 10.5-point underdog.  But Dallas snapped its five-game losing streak and looked much better than its back-to-back blowouts suggested. However, sometimes previous games provide a window into how teams might specifically match up with one another.  The Toronto Raptors visit the Detroit Pistons on Monday in a rematch of a 99-95 Detroit win from 10 days prior.  The over/under is 220.5, and I anticipate another low-scoring performance and thus am betting the under. While I do expect the teams to shoot a little better than their combined 38.5% from the previous meeting, I still think the total is too high.  The main reason is Pistons star Cade Cunningham listed as doubtful and unlikely to play. He leads the team in scoring and assists, and they lack the depth to replace his production.  Jaden Ivey will now serve as the main point guard but he is more of a shoot-first guard. Thus, I also am betting under 5.5 assists for Ivey. On Saturday, Ivey only mustered four assists in Cunningham’s absence while finishing with a team-high 16 field goal attempts and six free throws.  He has elite speed and athleticism and prioritizes attacking the rim over distribution. He’s also a ball hawk without Cunningham and grabbed seven rebounds so I also played over 4.5 rebounds at +115 odds.  Another prop also has my attention: Raptors center Jakob Poeltl has grabbed at least 12 rebounds in five straight games, including 18 in the previous meeting with Detroit.  I like over 11.5 rebounds at +110 odds with the rationale of my expecting the Pistons likely struggling to generate quality shot attempts and enabling the seven-footer numerous defensive rebounding opportunities. The few times Poeltl has finished with less than 12 rebounds is when he opposes an elite rebounder or dominant big man.  The last five times this occurred, Toronto faced Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Domantas Sabonis (twice) and Nikola Jokic. Detroit’s Jalen Duren simply does not measure up to this All-Stars. PICKS: Under 220.5 (-110, ESPN BET) | Jaden Ivey under 5.5 assists (-140, Bet365) | Jakob Poeltl over 11.5 rebounds (+110, Caesars) Doug Kezirian is a New York Post contributor who currently serves as the Chief Content Officer for Only Players, a sports betting media company.

Judge S. Kato Crews, an appointee of President Biden to the U.S. District Court in Colorado, made the decision amid a national transgender controversy over Blaire Fleming, a redshirt senior who joined the Spartans in 2022.   “San José State University will continue to support its student-athletes and reject discrimination in all forms,” the university said in a statement to OutKick after the ruling. “All San José State University student-athletes are eligible to participate in their sports under NCAA and Mountain West Conference rules.   “We are gratified that the Court rejected an eleventh-hour attempt to change those rules. Our team looks forward to competing in the Mountain West volleyball tournament this week.” The ruling came in the wake of a lawsuit filed by players — including some affiliated with San Jose State —along with Melissa Batie-Smoose, the suspended associate head coach for the Spartans, who alleged she was threatened by the university to stay quiet about the situation.  Batie-Smoose was suspended earlier this month after she filed a Title IX complaint claiming SJSU’s transgender-inclusion policy created a toxic environment for female athletes and accused the university of overtly showing favoritism for Fleming, according to a complaint obtained by Quillette. The Mountain West women’s volleyball championship also features Fresno State, San Diego State, Utah State, Boise State and Colorado State.  Boise State and Utah State, among other teams, previously canceled games this season against the Spartans, a Division I team, giving SJSU six wins by forfeit.  The plaintiffs argued that allowing the player to participate in the tournament would discriminate against women by denying them equal opportunities, and requested an injunction to forbid them from competing.  Fleming has not addressed the matter publicly. San Jose State has not yet confirmed if the women’s volleyball team has a transgender player, citing educational privacy laws, according to The New York Times. Brooke Slusser, the Spartans’ team co-captain and Fleming’s former roommate, previously spoke out against Fleming during the regular season and was a part of the lawsuit. In an interview with OutKick, Slusser, a junior starting setter, said she and her team are worried about who will protect their voice after Batie-Smoose’s suspension. The Spartans hold the No. 2 seed and have a first-round bye in the championships."

They had the goalie, they had added Artemi Panarin, Jacob Trouba, Adam Fox and second-overall pick Kaapo Kakko in the offseason, and they already had Mika Zibanejad, Chris Kreider, Filip Chytil and Ryan Lindgren in place. The team responded to head coach David Quinn, thundering through the winter before COVID-19 shut down the league. But then the bubble tournament happened, the following season the team decided Quinn had become too oppressive, the Rangers stopped responding, and the coach, team president John Davidson and GM Jeff Gorton were all fired."

On a Saturday night earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal broke the news that TNT had struck a deal to license the iconic studio show to ESPN.  During a recent appearance on “The Bettor Angle” show with Kate Constable and Gabe Ramirez on the BetQL network, Barkley said he received no head’s up from his bosses at Warner Bros. Discovery’s Turner Sports that the move was in the works.  “I’ll tell you what’s fun. They haven’t even told us we lost the NBA,” Barkley said, as covered by Awful Announcing.  “We have to hear it through the media. And even this thing with ABC/ESPN, I heard about it on the internet. Scott Van Pelt, Brian Windhorst, Elle Duncan, Bob Myers, all friends of mine who I really like a lot. They texted me welcoming me to the ESPN family. I’m like, what happened? TNT didn’t even have the courtesy. “Basically, we got traded. If I was going to trade somebody that I had respect for and appreciate, I would at least give them a heads up. I wouldn’t let them hear about it from other people or the internet.” Amid all the transition with TNT, which is set to exit its longtime partnership with the NBA after this season, Barkey said that he was most concerned for the production staffers with career uncertainty. “I was never worried about me, Ernie, Kenny, and Shaq because obviously we’re gonna have our opportunities. But it was very frustrating. It’s been frustrating. I’ve never had normal life. I don’t mean that in a negative way,” Barkley said.  “But like, when you talk to people who you are friends with. They’re like ‘Yo man, I’m married, I have kids, I have a mortgage and I’m not gonna have a job in six or seven months.’ That’s like a real thing. That’s like a real thing. I’ve been in the NBA my whole life so I’ve never been around people who have had to worry about their job security. But it was so stressful at work because number one, you could tell we were gonna lose the contract.” Barkley has been part of “Inside the NBA” since 2000 and cohosts the program alongside Kenny Smith, Ernie Johnson and Shaquille O’Neal."

No charges have been filed against Bradshaw, per the outlet. The Buckeyes provided a cryptic update Friday about the Kentucky transfer’s status before a 104-60 win over Campbell. “Aaron Bradshaw is not currently participating in team activities,” the school said in a statement. “The university is following its established process. Due to federal privacy laws, we cannot share further information at this time.” The alleged incident happened in Bradshaw’s off-campus apartment last week.  Bradshaw had started four consecutive games for Ohio State before the alleged incident occurred.  Ohio State coach Jake Diebler did not answer any questions about Bradshaw’s situation after Friday’s game, per the paper. Bradshaw averaged 23.4 minutes per game, along with 7.8 points and 4.8 rebounds spanning the Buckeyes’ first four games. The New Jersey native scored six points and added three rebounds in 27 minutes in his last appearance in Ohio State’s 80-30 win over Evansville last Tuesday. Bradshaw was the No. 1 center prospect coming out of high school and the No. 5 prospect in the class of 2023.  He was previously rumored to be considering Rutgers after they landed stars Ace Bailey and Dylan Harper.  Bradshaw instead opted for the Buckeyes after averaging 4.9 points and 3.3 rebounds across 26 games (10 starts) for Kentucky last season.  The Wildcats underwent a big change with John Calipari leaving for Arkansas and former player Mark Pope taking over the program. Bradshaw is not expected to play in Monday’s game against Green Bay, and it is unclear when he will rejoin the team. The Buckeyes are 4-1 on the season, with their lone loss coming in a 78-64 setback against No. 20 Texas A&M on Nov. 15."

But I got a 33 on my ACT [exam] in high school and I’m finishing college early, so take it as you want.”  When she’s not working, Thomas spends most of her time taking care of her mind and body.  “I’m very athletic,” she said. “I love health, wellness, fitness and anything that has to do with improving yourself physically, mentally and emotionally, I’m all in for. I’m very driven with self-improvement and just becoming the best version of yourself.” Thomas added that she’s not sure what she wants to do with her career after college.  A post shared by Sydney Thomas (@iamsydneythomas) “The past two weeks so much in my life has just been totally flipped upside down,” Thomas said after thanking fans and followers. “My path is just so different and so unique I just take it day by day. I don’t stress too much about the future.”  Thomas joined Paul’s Most Valuable Promotions as a ring girl this year.  The YouTube personality’s unanimous decision win over Tyson marked her second fight working for MVP."
"NY Post Sports – Latest News, Scores, Stats & Videos",Bizarre NFL camera rule revealed on crucial Bears-Vikings play,https://nypost.com/2024/11/25/sports/bizarre-nfl-camera-rule-revealed-on-crucial-bears-vikings-play/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 14:36:56 -0500",You can always learn something new about the NFL rule book.,"You can always learn something new about the NFL rule book. When the Bears played the Vikings on Sunday, Minnesota receiver Jordan Addison appeared as if he might have stepped out of bounds amid a 69-yard reception in the third quarter. Bears head coach Matt Eberflus challenged the ruling on the field that Addison stayed inbounds, but it turned out that a Soldier Field camera that shoots the boundary of the sidelines was not able to be used. “This is the boundary cam, and if a coach challenges you cannot use the boundary cam. There’s not boundary cams in every stadium so there’s a question of equity, whether some stadiums and some don’t have it. So when a coach challenges, you can’t [use it],” Fox Sports officiating expert Mike Pereira said. The rule only got stranger from there.  “On a regular review situation like a scoring play they can [use the boundary camera], but not on a coach’s challenge,” Pereira said.  It seems very bizarre that boundary cams would be allowed to be used for one element of reviews but not another. ProFootballTalk reported Sunday that the NFL is introducing boundary cams to stadiums on a rolling basis.  The variance of cameras between various NFL stadiums and broadcast partners has come up a couple of times this season.  In October, Falcons tight end Kyle Pitts had a controversial play against the Buccaneers where his catch-and-run was ruled a touchdown and it could not be determined if he fumbled before crossing the plane of the goal line because there was no pylon camera.   “I don’t understand why this is such a problem,” legendary former Patriots head coach Bill Belichick mused in the aftermath.  “A camera could easily be mounted on the sideline just like they have in tennis — on the end lines and the sidelines. Or just build a stand and put it on there. I can’t imagine money is a problem. The NFL has plenty of money. They can have a car wash and raise money if money is a problem.” Although the Bears took the game to overtime, the Vikings prevailed, 30-27."

Batie-Smoose was suspended indefinitely after she filed a Title IX complaint against San Jose State University, alleging that Blaire Fleming, the team’s transgender player, conspired with an opponent to help the team lose a match and injure teammate Brooke Slusser. A dozen women are suing SJSU and the Mountain West Conference over Fleming competing on SJSU’s volleyball team, arguing their Title IX and First Amendment rights are being violated. Five teams in the Mountain West conference so far, including Boise State, Wyoming, Utah State and Nevada, have already canceled their games against SJSU this season. Smoose told Fox News host Harris Faulkner Friday that she had reached a breaking point. “I just couldn’t take any more,” she said, recalling how team co-captain Brooke Slusser spoke out about the issue as well. “Speaking out for her rights and that they continued to treat the young women on the team and myself poorly for having our thoughts and opinions, and they were told to us like, we can’t have those.” Faulkner observed that even with this controversy in the open, those involved are appearing to be extremely careful about following various rules and laws. “We’re definitely not allowed to speak on that,” Smoose replied. “I’ve continued to be told that, you know, the suspension would go to being fired if I speak out. So [they’re] continuing to hold that silence over myself and the remainder of the women on the team.” “But you are speaking,” Faulkner observed. “You’re risking everything. So this is important to you.” “To me, it’s like common sense,” the coach said. “There should not be biological men playing in women’s sports. But we are here right now. And I do think this, you know, is an opportunity for me. It’s nothing that we all sign up for. But I definitely feel so strong that, you know, that moving forward with this and helping this fight and making sure we save women’s sports for the future of young women, my nieces, my grandchildren, is very important.” The coach also praised the teams that refused to play against SJSU for including a purportedly biologically male player, arguing they are standing up for women.  “So proud of those young women to stand up for what they believe in when they’re also being silenced by the Mountain West,” Smoose said. “And they’re holding their scholarships and things over their head. I think that is amazing. That’s what we need when everybody does stand up and make sure that this does not continue.” Smoose claimed that SJSU players do not speak out against transgender athletes because they fear scholarships and other benefits could be taken away."

Not long after the Buccaneers quarterback went viral Sunday for mimicking the Giants’ signal caller’s signature hand gesture during a 30-7 blowout win over Big Blue, Lions linebacker Alex Anzalone reacted to Mayfield’s touchdown celebrations in a post on X. “Ay bro, did that a little too aggressive for my liking 🤨,” Anzalone posted alongside a video of Mayfield raising his hands in the air after scoring a rushing touchdown. Mayfield, who went 24-for-30 against a listless 2-9 Giants team, told reporters afterward the move was a tribute to DeVito, the 2023 fan-favorite who was anointed starter over a benched Daniel Jones, who was released by the team last Friday. “It was a tribute. A tribute to Tommy,” Mayfield said, according to ESPN. “… “Most of the time, I don’t know what I’m going to do so … spontaneous stuff. “New York fans love Tommy here, so give ’em something they like.” DeVito, who was sacked four times in the Giants’ sixth straight loss, said he wasn’t privy to Mayfield’s revelry until after the Week 12 contest. The quarterback has previously said the celebration is tied to his Italian heritage. “They were having a good game. They celebrated,” the second-year pro said, per ESPN. “It is what it is. Kind of happened last year. It’s going to happen, I guess.” Several X users responded to Anzalone’s Mayfield take, with some calling attention to Detroit’s lone loss of the season: a Week 2 defeat to the Buccaneers. “Should’ve done something about it week 2 🤷‍♂️ you can hold that L instead,” one user replied. “Still hurting from the L huh?” another posted.  In addition to commentating on Mayfield, Anzalone — currently on injured reserve after breaking his forearm in a Week 11 win over the Jaguars— hyped up the Lions on social media after they secured their 10th win of the year, a 24-6 victory over the Colts. “Proud of the guys today!!!” he exclaimed on X. Head coach Dan Campbell confirmed last week that Anzalone would be out “six to eight weeks.” The Lions own the No. 1 seed in the NFC, while the 5-6 Buccaneers are in the hunt for a playoff spot following their thrashing over the Giants."

Brett Berard is set to make his NHL debut Monday night against the Blues, after receiving his first official call-up to the big league since the Blueshirts drafted him 134th overall out of the U.S. National Development Team Program in 2020. The 22-year-old turned out just to be the start, with the Rangers sending for Matt Rempe on Monday, as well, in order to alter all but one of their units. These slew of changes appeared to be both a want and a need. The Rangers also said Chris Kreider would not play due to an upper-body injury. “Both factored into it,” head coach Peter Laviolette said after morning skate in Tarrytown. “A couple guys not in the lineup [Monday]. That created a need. [Berard] was one of the last guys to leave camp, we like the way he plays the game. See how he does [Monday], he gets an opportunity to play some minutes. We feel like it could be a good fit for him. He does bring certain things. “He’s in your face, even the battles in the corners and the front of the net. He plays a fast style, he gets in there. He’s determined.” Filip Chytil, cleared of a concussion by specialists in New York last week, continued to practice with the Rangers on Monday morning, as he did in both Calgary and Edmonton. Since the Czech center is still not ready to play, however, Kaapo Kakko is getting an official shot in the middle. The 23-year-old Finn lined up between Adam Edstrom and Reilly Smith, which effectively bumped Jonny Brodzinski from the lineup Brodzinski had centered Kakko and Will Cuylle in the previous four games in wake of Chytil’s injury. “A little different,” Kakko told The Post of the switch before the Oilers game, reflecting on the brief stretch he played center in Calgary. “It’s been awhile, maybe last time in Finland I played center. It’s something new. I think it was kind of nice. I feel good about it.” While the Artemi Panarin-Vincent Trocheck-Alexis Lafreniere line remained intact, Cuylle was bumped up to play alongside Berard and Mika Zibanejad. After Zibanejad finished minus-four for the third time this season in Edmonton, the Swede finds himself between two youngsters who have both been playing particularly well in their respective seasons. Cuylle’s seven five-on-five goals lead the Rangers entering Monday’s contest, which is a notable statistic that doesn’t even capture how effective his all-around game has been. It has led to a bit of an expanded role under Laviolette, who has entrusted the 22-year-old with more and more shorthanded ice time in particular. This type of shakeup would have to be endorsed by the Rangers hierarchy, who have reportedly put the rest of the NHL on notice that they are open to making moves. There has been growing disappointment with the Blueshirts, and the organization has made its first act of change. Calling upon the kids could just be the first step."

In a lengthy statement released Monday, Paul, 27, vehemently denied that his unanimous decision win over 58-year-old Tyson on Nov. 15 was manipulated through their contractual agreements after both fighters faced backlash for putting on a lackluster event.  “Rigging a professional boxing match is a federal crime in the United States of America. Paul vs. Tyson was a professional match sanctioned by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulations (TDLR),” MVP said. “Both fighters in good faith performed to the best of their abilities with the goal of winning the fight.  “There were absolutely no restrictions – contractual or otherwise – around either fighter. Each boxer was able to use his full arsenal to win the fight. Any agreement to the contrary would violate TDLR boxing rules.”  MVP went on to say that it’s insulting to Paul and Tyson to suggest they didn’t go all out in the ring at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, where Cowboys owner Jerry Jones sat ringside. The company added that it wouldn’t have jeopardized what they are hoping to become a long-term partnership with Netflix.  “Trash talk and speculation are common in sports, and athletes and promoters need to tolerate nonsensical commentary, jokes and opinions,” MVP said. “But suggesting anything other than full effort from these fighters is not only naïve but an insult to the work they put into their craft and to the sport itself. “It is further illogical and inane that MVP, in the debut of a hopeful long-term partnership with the world’s biggest streamer — an organization that made its first-ever foray into live professional sports with Paul vs. Tyson — would even so much as consider such a perverse violation of the rules of competition.”  MVP co-founder Nakisa Bidarian added suggestions that the fight was rigged “is just the latest backhanded compliment to come [Paul’s] way” and that Paul has proved himself as a serious fighter.  “This event, which broke attendance and viewership milestones for a professional sporting event, is yet another example of his ability to deliver on the biggest stage,” Bidarian said. “As long as Jake continues to exceed expectations, there will always be those who try to discredit his achievements. We embrace the doubt—it only fuels Jake to work harder and achieve greater success.”  Many believed Paul and Tyson’s highly anticipated showdown was a snoozefest because both fighters didn’t appear to give it their all in the ring.  The former heavyweight champ seemed off balance and gassed in the final rounds.  After the bout, Paul explained that he didn’t want to hurt the former heavyweight champ further. “I wanted to give the fans a show, but I didn’t want hurt someone who didn’t need to be hurt,” Paul said. “I didn’t wanna hurt someone that didn’t need to be hurt.” NFL Hall of Famer Michael Irvin, who was sitting in the second row behind Jones, claimed he heard people talking about a contract containing a clause that Tyson couldn’t utilize his famous uppercut — and that both fighters couldn’t go all out in the ring. DJ Whoo Kid, who said he spoke with Paul at an afterparty following the fight, claimed there were rules for the fight.   Tyson landed 18 punches out of 97 and Paul connected on 78 out of 278 punches, according to the final results. Tyson reportedly earned $20 million for the fight, while Paul received $40 million."

Baltimore climbed to three-point favorites in the middle of last week, but has since moved back to -2.5.  An ESPN BET spokesperson tells The Post that 64.8 percent of the money is on the Ravens.  BetMGM is reporting similar figures, with 75 percent of the money coming in on Baltimore against the spread. Meanwhile, the total opened at 47.5 and has since moved to 50.5. That’s probably fair, given the Ravens’ high-powered offense and poor second-half defensive showing by Los Angeles last week against the Bengals.  “Monday Night Football” features two top-10 teams, according to defense-adjusted value over average (DVOA).  The Ravens rank No. 2 in DVOA behind only the Detroit Lions, while the Chargers are a strong team in their own right, ranking No. 8.  Baltimore has the highest-powered offense in the NFL by a longshot, averaging 7.0 yards per play on offense, despite a poor showing against the Steelers in Week 11, where it only scored just 16 points. A big issue for the Ravens this season is their poor coverage down the field.  Baltimore has allowed 3,351 yards through the air, the most in the NFL, and it has allowed 22 passing touchdowns, the second-most in the league.  We’ve seen Jameis Winston have his best game of the season against the Ravens, with Cedric Tillman going for 99 yards and two touchdowns in a season-best game.  So we know that Justin Herbert is in a position to have a big night at the office, especially if Lamar Jackson is able to lead his squad to an early lead.  What this game comes down to is the Chargers’ defense reverting back to what it had been prior to getting roasted against the Bengals’ league-best passing attack. DVOA believes they can stop the pass with the best in the league, ranking them No. 7 against the pass and No. 14 against the run. Even average run defenses will struggle to deal with Jackson and Derrick Henry.  While Herbert has played exemplary football this season, he’s relied on his legs more than any time prior in his career. Baltimore allows the fifth-fewest rushing yards to opposing quarterbacks per game (12.45) and is making life extremely difficult on rushing attacks overall.  The Ravens allow just 3.2 yards per carry, the best in the league.  PICK: Ravens -2.5 (-115, Bet365) Erich Richter is a brazilian jiu-jitsu blue belt but he has a black belt in MMA betting. During the football season he’s showcased massive profits at The Post in the player prop market the last two seasons.

During an appearance on the latest installment of the “Naked Sports with Cari Champion” podcast, Harris explained that it was her decision to end their near four-year marriage after more than a decade together because she didn’t feel loved or wanted by Krieger.   “[The biggest lie about the breakup is] that I’m constantly pegged as a cheater, which that is so far from the truth and she knows it,” Harris, who’s currently dating actress Sophia Bush, said. “And it torched me. “… She was in so much pain and rightfully so and I want to make room for her experience. I really thought she never thought I would leave. I don’t think she ever took me seriously.”  A post shared by Cari Champion (@carichampion) Harris said she and Krieger — who share custody of their two children, Sloane, 3, and Ocean, 2 — were living separately last summer before their divorce was made public in October 2023.  Harris and Bush went public with their relationship earlier this year, although they were believed to have started dating months before then.  “I had my own apartment and people were starting to recognize me, so I was like we have to come out with a joint statement, people know I live here,” Harris said. “But I think once it all blew up and it affected her last season [Krieger retired in March]. She was pissed and she was angry, and rightfully so.”  Harris filed for divorce on Sept. 19, 2023, citing the marriage is “irretrievably broken,” according to court documents obtained by Page Six.  The next month, Krieger posted about being in “my Beyonce Lemonade era,” which was a reference to the singer’s infidelity-themed album.  Harris explained that “the reality” of the situation was that she and Krieger had nothing in common after they stopped playing together.  “I just felt like I wasn’t a priority,” she said. “I didn’t feel that sense of connection whether emotional or physical. It was soccer, job, kids and somewhere down the line it was like, ‘OK, what about me?’ I decided to leave my marriage after almost four years and a decade of being together. It was the hardest thing I ever had to do in my life. And I think people miss that. People think only one person was in pain or people think you have to choose a side that you know, you have to punish this person because the idea you had through social media didn’t manage your expectations however you haven’t lived my experience. “I wanted someone to love me so bad, I caved every bit of who I was inside to try to be more lovable … I just wanted to be enough … I wanted to be able to walk through the door someone miss me, want me and need me in a way that wasn’t so business. On the field everyone thought I was this way, but at home I felt like I was living with a stranger and I just had to take my power back. And unfortunately, people were hurt in that process.” Harris and Krieger were on two World Cup-winning USWNT teams together in 2015 and 2019 — and they dated for nearly a decade before tying the knot on Dec. 28, 2019, in Miami. Harris retired from professional soccer in November 2022, and Krieger called it a career at the end of the 2023 NWSL season. “Everyone has an experience, however only one experience played out in the media, which was quite difficult … I was looking over the edge,” Harris said. “It was the first time I was like someone needs to take this nine millimeter and get it the f–k away from me.  “I was at probably the lowest … Honestly, I was like, I can’t survive this. Meanwhile, I was being torched while I was trying to raise two kids and go through this process and make sure that my storm didn’t become theirs.” Harris explained she didn’t feel loved or wanted by Krieger, who wouldn’t “touch me” or be intimate together. A year prior to their split, Harris recalled making “one last attempt” to save their marriage.  “I started trying all these things — let’s do an open marriage,” she said. “That’s not even me dude. A year before we officially called it quits, that was my last attempt. If I’m not getting what I want and we want to keep this together, which is also the strains the public eye places on you. You feel like you can’t make the brave and hard decisions because you know the impact and wave that will come and that was my biggest fear.”  Bush filed for divorce from Grant Hughes in August 2023 after just 13 months of marriage.  Krieger said in July she was dating someone new."

In the midst of a disappointing 3-8 season that’s featured starting quarterback Deshaun Watson struggle under center before suffering a season-ending Achilles injury in Week 7, Cleveland brass is looking “to add competition to the room” currently vacated by the team’s $230 million signal-caller, according to Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer. “The plan, going forward, isn’t the same as it has been,” Breer reported. “Until now, the Browns have built a quarterback room to support Watson. This year, they’ll look, through the draft and/or the veteran market, to add competition to the room. So while the likelihood—because of the injury and the contract— is Watson will be back, the Browns are going to look to do more than just stop-gap the backup spot.” The controversial union between the Browns and Watson has failed to flourish over the course of three seasons. Originally acquired by Cleveland in a 2022 trade with the Texans, Watson — facing accusations of sexual misconduct — then signed a five-year contract with the Browns worth a fully guaranteed $230 million. Watson was suspended for the first 11 games that season and threw seven touchdowns against five interceptions in six games. Although he showed flashes in 2023, throwing seven touchdowns against four picks through six games, Watson underwent season-ending shoulder surgery last fall, paving the way for veteran Joe Flacco to lead Cleveland to a playoff berth. Watson looked mediocre at best during a brief 2024 campaign, tossing just five touchdowns against three interceptions. He was also named in a lawsuit, with an unnamed plaintiff accusing the quarterback of sexual assault from an alleged 2020 incident. Watson reached a settlement with the accuser in October. The latest report from Sports Illustrated comes on the heels of cryptic comments made by Browns general manager Andrew Berry, who said earlier this month, “It’s always possible” Watson will play for the team again. The Browns have moved forward with Jameis Winston under center, with Cleveland topping the rival Steelers on Thursday, 24-19. He’s on a one-year deal with the team.

Rex Ryan and the “Get Up!” crew unloaded on the Giants on Monday morning after they no-showed in an embarrassing 30-7 loss to the Buccaneers on Sunday. “The Giants played well,” Ryan said. “Saquon Barkley went for 302 scrimmage yards, 255 rushing. Xavier McKinney leads the league, had his seventh interception (for the Packers). Leonard Williams has 2 1/2 sacks for Seattle. So, the Giants are playing great. “But the little Giants, The Little Giants, stink. Xavier McKinney, they could have used a player like that. The Giants haven’t had an interception for 10 weeks now. Is that even possible?” Ryan, who is openly campaigning to be the Jets’ next head coach, angrily suggested that Giants GM Joe Schoen be fired for the team they fielded Sunday. “I feel bad for Brian Daboll. He is a good football coach,” Ryan said. “This GM right now, that’s the one. I would just say gone, get the hell out of our building.”  Schoen’s decisions have led to a disastrous 2-9 season that seemed to hit rock bottom Sunday in a lifeless performance at MetLife Stadium against an injury-riddled Tampa Bay team that had lost four in a row heading into the matchup. Tedy Bruschi agreed with Ryan’s assessment and said he thinks the decisions to let go of team leaders has led to a “fractured” locker room. The Giants had benched starting quarterback Daniel Jones at the beginning of last week in a decision that left the locker room “confused,” according to team leader Dexter Lawrence. They ultimately released Jones on Friday after dropping him to fourth-string, which was done to ensure that they would not have to pay out the $23 million injury clause in his contract. “The Giants brass made a business decision this week. The players have returned the favor and are making a business decision today. This organization needs a reboot!” former Giants kicker Lawrence Tynes wrote on X on Sunday. The disastrous effort against the Buccaneers caused a frustrated Malik Nabers to say the team played “soft as f–k” and complained that he did not start getting the ball till they were down, 30-0. “Then you let Daniel Jones walk out, we don’t want him to play because we don’t want him to get hurt. We know you’re our best quarterback, but we don’t want to you get hurt and owe you all that money,” Ryan said.  “Great message you send to the locker room. You got exactly what you deserve. Did that team look like they had no energy, no juice? Why? You gave up on them. Don’t tell me the players gave up on you. You gave up on them when you made this move. It’s such a ridiculous thing. This isn’t one game left in the season, there’s seven games left. You know what? It’s not Daniel Jones’ fault that you gave him $40 million, it’s not. It’s not his fault you didn’t sign Saquon Barkley.  “It’s your damn fault. What are you representing? You are going to let a guy that is a once-in-a-lifetime player in Saquon Barkley walk out the door. He’s also an amazing teammate. Would you like to have that leadership in your locker room? Is he an unbelievable man in the community? Absolutely. That’s what you want to build your franchise with.”"

Burns is only 11 games into his time with the Giants and so he does not have the psychological wounds of the likes of Dexter Lawrence or Darius Slayton, products of the 2019 draft class, both well-versed in the demise of the franchise. Burns, though, has seen enough. The Giants are 2-9 and fading fast, owners of a six-game losing streak. As the players left the field and gathered in the locker room, veteran guard Greg Van Roten was starting to address the team and Burns actually got in the first words. “I spoke my mind,’’ Burns said. “I told the team I’m not excluding myself, as a whole everybody was bad today and nobody got anything done that we needed to get done and we got a short week and we need to get back to what we were doing.’’ Burns after getting up in front of his teammates proceeded to meet with the media and described the performance of his team, getting behind 30-0 after three quarters, as “ass.’’ Yes it is a short week for the Giants, who have a quick turnaround for their flight Wednesday in advance of a Thanksgiving Day game against the Cowboys at AT&T Stadium. Burns was one of several players who sounded disgusted, angry, confused and frustrated after this game.  The benching of Daniel Jones did not move the needle a millimeter, as his replacement, Tommy DeVito, operated a non-functioning offense. It looks as if Jones, who asked for and was granted his release, is the most fortunate one of all, finally rid of all this losing. Here are some thoughts on loss No. 9 of the season: Sure, Malik Nabers has a right to lose his patience. He was not targeted for one pass in the first half and he fumed that “First, second quarter, I don’t get the ball. Start getting targets at the end. I mean, can’t do nothing. Start getting the ball when it’s 30-0. What do you want me to do?” He has to understand this was a function of an offense that was not functioning. The Giants ran only 18 plays on offense in the first half. DeVito dropped back to throw eight times and he was sacked on three of them. That meant DeVito attempted only five passes in the first half. That is not a whole lot of targets. Nabers finished with six catches for 64 yards. The coaching staff needs to do everything possible to work with Nabers to make sure the rookie does not get too discouraged as the team in his first NFL season continues to deteriorate. Perhaps they can alert him that his 67 receptions in his first nine career games is an NFL record. Puka Nacua of the Rams had 64 receptions in his first nine games in 2023. Players actually sounded annoyed with the suggestion that the way the Daniel Jones saga played out last week had anything to do with the moribund showing coming out of the bye week. The Giants certainly operated as if they were distracted but that insinuation actually lets the players off the hook for how dreadfully they performed. The emotional unrest at seeing Jones get benched and then get released was real for some, but not all players, and it does feel like a stretch to link any of those feelings to missing blocks, missing tackles and avoiding any semblance of competitive football. Lest we forget, there was far too much lousy football when Jones was on the field as the starting quarterback. Are some people actually bent out of shape about head coach Brian Daboll sitting Tyrone Tracy for a few series after he fumbled early in the third quarter? Daboll went with Devin Singletary and seldom-used Eric Gray and then re-inserted Tracy to finish out the fourth quarter. The rookie running back cost his team a shot to win the game in overtime two weeks ago in Munich with a fumble on the first play of OT, handing the Panthers their winning field goal. This is what happens when a young player is learning hard lessons about ball security — he has to sit on the bench and think about it for a while. Tracy ended up with 24 snaps on offense, compared with 21 for Singletary and 15 for Gray. Tracy will get the ball again, often, this season. But he has to keep control of it when he does. This was a quiet streak that has now ended. Darius Slayton had at least one reception in 26 consecutive games. He was shut out by the Buccaneers, targeted only twice. It sure looks as if the season is getting a bit too long for a few of the rookies. Nickel back Dru Phillips and safety Tyler Nubin have been starters since Day 1 and their play has often been encouraging — especially Phillips, who usually is in the right place and gets people to the ground.  Both are not exactly soaring to the finish. Nubin did not have a strong game in coverage against the Bucs and Phillips missed a tackle on Bucky Irving and then showed his speed by pursuing the play to chase down Irving and make the tackle — after a 32-yard pickup. The danger here is that these youngsters get into bad habits or wear down and get hurt down the stretch of a losing season. The Giants are record-breakers. They have gone 11 straight games without a positive turnover differential, the longest such streak in franchise history. They also did not come up with an interception on defense for the 10th straight game, matching the NFL record held by the 1976-77 49ers and the 2017 Raiders."

He sits behind only Bills quarterback Josh Allen (+150) and Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson (+250). Barkley accumulated 302 total yards and two touchdowns against the Rams in a career-best performance during the Eagles’ 37-20 win.  The Giants’ former No. 2 pick in 2018 signed with the Eagles in free agency and is set to make $13.5 million this season and could earn an additional $3 million if he continues his excellent performances.  Barkley’s standout performance also pushed his odds to win Offensive Player of the Year from +120 on BetMGM to clear favorites status at -300 odds.  He had previously been in a tight race with fellow free-agent acquisition, Ravens running back Derrick Henry.  Barkley is now projected to run for 2,151 rushing yards and 15 touchdowns, which would break the all-time single-season rushing record.  Just eight players have run for 2,000-plus yards in a season, with the most-recent being Henry in 2020.  Eric Dickerson owns the record for rushing yards with 2,105 yards in 1984.  The MVP odds movement comes just as The Post’s Doug Kezirian advised readers to wager on Barkley to win the NFL MVP award at 75/1 odds.  Barkley claiming the award would go against history, though. A running back hasn’t won the NFL MVP award since 2012, when Adrian Peterson won after accumulating 2,097 rushing yards.  Should Barkley reach that level of success in the City of Brotherly Love, it could be quite tough to deny him the hardware. Erich Richter is a brazilian jiu-jitsu blue belt but he has a black belt in MMA betting. During the football season he’s showcased massive profits at The Post in the player prop market the last two seasons. While constantly betting long shots, his return on investment is 30.15 percent since 2022."
Sports Collectors Daily,Find of T206 Era Packs Headlines REA Sale,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/t206-tobacco-packs-find/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 02:11:47 +0000","A recent estate sale discovery of Piedmont cigarette packs from the era of T206 baseball card production is now on the market, along with a rare Ty Cobb card, a dual-signed Ruth-Gehrig baseball and other pieces of sports history.","November 24, 2024 By Rich Mueller  An estate sale discovery of a dozen packs of original 1910 Piedmont Cigarettes, possibly containing T206 baseball cards, and the original case they were stored in for more than 100 years, is on the market for the first time. According to Robert Edward Auctions, the case was discovered recently at an estate sale in Richmond, VA, located just ten miles from where the American Tobacco Company factory that made them was located. Is there a multi-million- dollar pristine copy of the famed Honus Wagner card in one of them?  Not likely, but the tantalizing possibility of a Walter Johnson, Cy Young, Christy Mathewson, Ty Cobb or Nap Lajoie is enough to make collectors swoon.  The packs date to the 1910 era when ATC was cranking out millions to serve a nation of smokers.  The estate sale find uncovered by REA’s consignor consisted of 13 packs, even of which were still sealed and while the tax stamp has been broken on the remaining six.  REA says the consignor has decided to keep one pack for his personal collection.  Piedmont packs offered to collectors are often described as dating to the three-year era of baseball card production are often inaccurately researched and the auction house description details some of those issues. The packs offered by REA appear to have a reasonable chance of containing a baseball card, but ATC also produced non-sports cards in the era and the possibility of a bird card instead of a baseball card can’t be ruled out.  Either way, most potential buyers are likely to keep the pack unopened because of the scarcity. The case they came in originally housed 50 packs and the one offered by REA is the only one known to exist.  The Piedmont packs aren’t the only new discoveries offered for sale in what is one of REA’s largest auctions each year. As was reported last week, a 1916 Morehouse Baking Babe Ruth rookie card graded PSA 3.5, and over 100 other cards from the same set, are making their hobby debut.  Brought to market by a collector who made contact with the owner while at a yard sale, the cards were distributed through a bakery in Massachusetts.  It’s the first Morehouse Ruth ever documented and presented for sale. More than a dozen other Hall of Famers and stars of the day were also part of the find.  Bidding on the Ruth card quickly topped $500,000 in the first 48 hours after the auction opened. Also on the block is a newly discovered T206 Ty Cobb with the Cobb tobacco back graded PSA 2.5 that had a high bid of $185,000 as of Sunday afternoon.   According to REA, “This card comes to us from a family outside of Greensboro, North Carolina, where the card was the centerpiece of a large vintage baseball card collection built between the 1970s and 1990s. Originally purchased at a flea market in the 1980s by our consignor’s father, the card was highlighted in an August 1990 feature story in their hometown newspaper, a copy of which accompanies the card. The collection, and this incredible rarity, was eventually passed from father to son, where the T206 Ty Cobb with “Ty Cobb” back stayed in its original ungraded state until just earlier this year.” The card’s arrival on the auction market comes just days after SC Daily reported on another new T206 Cobb back that will enter the market through dealer MINT State, which plans to sell it on consignment on behalf of the family that owns it—and hundreds of other T206 cards. Following the announcement of his third MVP Award, the auction features a 2018 Topps Transcendent Japan Autographs #TA-SO17 Shohei Ohtani Rookie Red #1/1 graded PSA 10.  Other modern card highlights include a 1996-1997 Topps Chrome Kobe Bryant rookie Refractor PSA 10 and a 1997-1998 Skybox Metal Universe Championship Precious Metal Gems Basketball #23 Michael Jordan #15/50 PSA 4.

Sports Collectors Daily,North Carolina Family’s Inherited Collection Includes Rare Ty Cobb Card,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/north-carolina-familys-inherited-collection-includes-rare-ty-cobb-card/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 03:32:46 +0000","The Lucky 7 Find is legendary.  Now, the same dealer who brought those rare Ty Cobb cards to market has latched onto another one inside a family heirloom collection worth plenty. It’s a deal 5 years in the making.","November 21, 2024 By Rich Mueller  Call it Lucky 7 Find II. Eight and a half years after he landed one of the most memorable–and valuable– finds of vintage baseball cards this century, the longtime owner of MINT State has uncovered another Ty Cobb Tobacco branded Cobb card, along with hundreds of others from the standard T206 set.  This time, the consignment deal Rick Snyder has acquired from a North Carolina family won’t bring as big of a windfall, but the story behind it is certainly worth telling. To understand it, one has to go back a few years. It was in March of 2016 when the South Carolina-based dealer received a phone call that led him to one family’s discovery of no less than seven T206 Cobb/Cobb back cards face down in a paper bag while they cleaned out their great grandparents’ crumbling home in a rural town in the south. Sold to collectors over a period of time, they netted about $3 million. The “Cobb Tobacco” card is a close cousin of the regular T206 Cobb red portrait but the back has an add for Cobb’s own brand of tobacco and proclaims it “King of the Smoking Tobacco World.” It’s believed the cards were placed inside tins of the Hall of Famer’s short lived brand of cut plug tobacco. Only about 15 were known to exist before the discovery.  After reading about what became known as the Lucky 7 find, the North Carolina family realized their own hoard of 570 tobacco cards that had been passed down through the generations was probably worth looking into. It had been hidden away for years, all but forgotten by current family members who weren’t collectors. “Like the Lucky 7 Find, one family member was ready to throw them out and another said ‘no, no, no’,” Snyder said.   That was in 2019. The family began researching the cards, including the Cobb, and came across coverage of the original Lucky 7 Find. Snyder wasn’t that far away and they reached out, offering scans, descriptions and a history of the collection. All but one of the T206s had Piedmont or Old Mill tobacco ads on the back.  The one exception featured the rarest brand of the 16 ad backs associated with the set:  the Cobb brand.  That card–if it was authentic–would take what looked like a very nice, star packed find into a doozy. An intrigued Snyder called back. “We later learned the entire household was huddled around the phone listening and hoping,” he reported.  “The family knew they had what appeared to be an authentic collection of tobacco cards more than 110 years old, and properly identified 545 of the cards from the T206 set with 370 different, more than 70% of the complete set.” Snyder, who often sells on consignment, expressed his interest in helping the family sell the collection but nothing came of it.  Their communication from 2019 remained at the bottom of his text message history. Patience, though, can pay off.  The family contacted him again not long ago and set up a meeting. “It went from nothing for five years to ‘let’s do this now’,’ Snyder told SC Daily.  He traveled to the neighboring state to determine once and for all if  the rare prize was authentic. “As I was examining the Cobb, my consignor asked me ‘Why are you smirking?’  I confessed it was because hers was only the second family I would ever tell that their T206 Ty Cobb with the ‘Ty Cobb’ ad brand was the real deal.”  Now graded 1.5 by PSA, the Cobb back card expected to bring a six-figure price by itself.  Only 21 copies are in PSA’s population report and nine in SGC’s, making it significantly rarer than the famed T206 Honus Wagner card. Earlier this year, a Cobb back graded 2.5 by SGC sold for $432,000. A PSA 1.5 sold back in 2019 for $138,000. The entire collection had remained in the family since the cards were produced. Originally pieced together by a former employee of the American Tobacco Company, presumably someone who worked at Factory No. 25 in Virginia, the cards were given to the North Carolina family as a gift in the first half of the 20th century.  Among the cards that had called the cigar box home for all those years were numerous Hall of Famers, including Christy Mathewson, Cy Young, Tris Speaker, other Cobb cards and assorted rarities.  All carry low technical grades, mostly because because of corner wear but a look at the images of some of the the 250 cards that were submitted for grading shows many to have eye appeal that’s off the charts, with white borders and bright color.     Keeping them tucked in a box and away from the light for about 115 years or so clearly paid dividends.  “They still have a freshness to them,” Snyder said. He estimates the value of what he’s dubbed “The Factory 25 Collection” to be between $300,000 and $400,000.    MINT State will soon start selling the collection on behalf of the family, individually and in groups. About 250 of the cards were graded.   The Cobb card, of course, is the star of the show. “What makes this example so special is that it has no creases or surface wrinkles, typically found on the vast majority of the Cobb with Cobb back,” Snyder remarked. “The card also displays nearly perfect centering on both the front and back.  Extraordinary eye appeal for the PSA 1.5 grade.”   Oh, and that original find from 2016?  The family from the small town later uncovered an eighth Cobb.  Of the 21 reviewed by PSA over the last 30 years or so, Snyder has now submitted nine of them. It’s safe to say the original Lucky 7 Cobb Find is one that won’t be duplicated but being able to sell a fresh copy of one of collecting’s truly rare cards in 2024 is certainly something Snyder wasn’t anticipating. “I guess lightning can and does strike the same place twice.” Rich is the editor and founder of Sports Collectors Daily.

Sports Collectors Daily,Top-Rated 1934 World Wide Gum Set Featured In Heritage Auctions Sale,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/top-rated-1934-world-wide-gum-set-featured-in-heritage-auctions-sale/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 02:40:39 +0000","Much rarer than its Goudey brother, the Canadian issue is even tougher to find in anything resembling higher grade. The set being offered by Heritage Auctions is the best one on PSA's Registry.","November 21, 2024 By Bob D'Angelo  The 1930s saw the Goudey Gum Company produce some iconic cards of baseball stars. North of the border, Canadian-based World Wide Gum produced a similar version, but with several key differences. A complete, 96-card set of the 1934 World Wide Gum set, commonly called the “Canadian Goudey,” is part of Heritage Auctions’ Winter Sports Catalog Auction that runs from Dec. 5 to Dec. 7. What makes this set  — catalogued as V354 — so special is that it is the No. 1 All-Time Finest set on the PSA registry. Bidding for the set has already reached $50,000; figure in the 20% buyer’s premium and the top bid is actually $60,000. Heritage Auctions will announce whether the reserve for this item has been met on Dec. 2.  The World Wide Gum set is much rarer than the ’34 Goudey issue.  PSA has graded fewer than 1,800 World Wide Gum cards to date, compared to more than 27,000 Goudeys.  The 1934 World Wide Gum set combines elements of the 1933 and ’34 Goudey designs. The first 48 cards in the set mirror the 1933 Goudey/World Wide Gum design on the front, while cards 49 through 96 are carbon copies of the 1934 set, complete with the “Lou Gehrig Says …” intro. The 1934 set was the final time that World Wide Gum used color on its card fronts. It had white borders and colorful, artistic renditions of the players. The card backs are bilingual, with type in both English and French. They measured 2 3/8 inches by 2 7/8 inches.  The set has some of the biggest names in baseball, and one that was missing from the 1934 Goudey issue — Babe Ruth. Although the Bambino had four cards in the 1933 Goudey set, he had none in the 1934 offering. His 1934 World Wide Gum card uses the same design of the No. 53 card in the ’33 Goudey set. The only difference is the back, with its bilingual type. In the World Wide Gum set, key cards include Ruth (No. 28), Gehrig (No. 92), Rogers Hornsby (No. 1), Dizzy Dean (No. 55) and Jimmie Foxx (No. 58). The set offered in the Heritage Auctions sale includes five cards with a PSA 9 grade, albeit one with a qualifier. Eighteen cards have PSA 8 grades, including Hall of Famers Hornsby, Earle Combs (No. 32), Jesse Haines (No. 44) and an off-center Red Ruffing (No. 48). The largest group of graded cards are 34 PSA 7s, which feature Hall of Famers Ruth,, Dean, Foxx, Rabbit Maranville (No. 4), Herb Pennock (No. 16), Tris Speaker (No. 29) and Charlie Gehringer (No. 57), which is spelled “Charley” in the set. There are 22 cards graded at PSA 6, including Hall of Famers Frank Frisch (No. 64), Leo Durocher (No. 69) and Luke Appling (No. 84). Nine cards are in EX (PSA 5) condition, with Cooperstown enshrines Mickey Cochrane (No. 59), Heinie Manush (No. 68) and Carl Hubbell (No. 71) featured. There are seven PSA 4 cards, highlighted by Hall of Famers Gehrig, Bill Terry (No. 53), Lefty Grove (No. 54), Chick Hafey (No. 78) and Ernie Lombardi (No. 82). Ruth, Gehrig, Dean and Hornsby are the most coveted cards in the set. Ruth was declining as a star but still hit 34 home runs and had 104 RBI in 1933. His numbers fell to 22 homers and 84 RBI in 1934, his final season with the New York Yankees. Gehrig was at his peak in 1934, winning the Triple Crown with 49 home runs and 166 RBI while hitting .363. Dean had his greatest season in 1934, winning 30 games and two more in the World Series as the St. Louis Cardinals soared as baseball’s best that year. Hornsby, meanwhile, was a player-manager in 1934 for the St. Louis Browns, who went 67-85 and finished in sixth place.

Sports Collectors Daily,Injury Delays but Shouldn’t Derail Market for Alex Ovechkin Cards,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/alex-ovechkin-most-watched-hockey-cards/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 01:39:30 +0000","Despite his recent injury, Alex Ovechkin's chase for the Wayne Gretzky's all-time goals record is adding excitement to the hockey card market.  Jeff Morris also takes us back to the start of his career, when he was trying to get the hang of signing autographs.","November 21, 2024 By Jeff Morris  As if the Canada Post strike that removed thousands of Canadian buyers and sellers from online auctions wasn’t a big enough blow to the hockey card market this week. The most anticipated moment of the 2024-25 NHL season took a hit when Jack McBain of the Utah Hockey Club and Alex Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals met in an ugly knee-on-knee collision that left Ovechkin in a crumpled heap on the ice. Alex Ovechkin is slow to get up after colliding knee-to-knee with Jack McBain. pic.twitter.com/gQNOiDMcPR — Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) November 19, 2024  Suddenly, the excitement of Ovie breaking Wayne Gretzky’s once-thought untouchable career goal scoring record was put into doubt. Tom Wilson of the Capitals “sorted things out” with McBain, instantly christened as the Jeff Gillooly of the NHL. Unfortunately, fans took things too far, as McBain received death threats on social media.  Ovechkin is now expected to be out 4-6 weeks with a broken bone in his leg. He was on a tear in the early season, with an NHL-leading 15 goals in 18 games. He had five in two games before he went down. It was a given that Ovechkin was going to break Gretzky’s record this season. He is 27 goals behind Gretzky’s total of 894. Because of Ovechkin’s slow start last season, there were some doubts. But then, in the second half of the season, Ovechkin was lighting it up. At every single sports card show or shop where hockey cards are sold, it has been the same conversation every day for more than a year. Clearly, the answer, even after the injury, is yes. And if he’s able to get back onto the ice is less time than we feared when he went down, the next question is can he score 1,000 career goals? It sounds unrealistic. So did the thought of him ever catching Gretzky’s 894. If he finishes this season with more than 900 goals, which he should, he might be three 30-goal seasons away from a thousand. Based on how good he is at 39, why not? There is no reason to think he can’t score 40 goals at the ages of 40 and 41. Ovechkin in the sports card market is interesting. Having talked to a number of dealers and collectors, the take on Ovie is pretty consistent. Getting an Ovechkin autograph, low serial-numbered card or memorabilia card is a premium hit. But he doesn’t really drive sales of new product. His cards will be very strong on the secondary market, but no shop owners are stocking extra product because of him. Having said that, if there is an Upper Deck product with limited Gretzky autographs, box demand will spike. Connor Bedard single-handedly made the hockey market hot last year. One question that younger collectors who weren’t around when Gretzky was in his prime will often ask is if the Great 8 is more collectible than the Great One. Simply put, no. Gretzky, Gordie Howe and Bobby Orr, are in a class by themselves in the card market. But the current hobby trifecta of Ovechkin, Sidney Crosby and Connor McDavid are knocking at the door to join that Mount Rushmore of hockey cards. Connor Bedard is an entirely different discussion. But that doesn’t mean Ovechkin isn’t hot. In fact, his cards have been scorching hot.  In the month of November, more than 2,300 of his cards have changed hands on eBay. Add in shows, shops, Facebook groups, Whatnot and every other popular selling platform and you’ve got a load of Ovie. On October 30, a PSA 10 Ovechkin 2005-06 Upper Deck Authenticated autographed RC numbered to 999 sold for $13,100. Thirteen Ovechkin cards have sold for over $4,000 on eBay in the last 30 days. You can check out a current list of the most watched auctions for his cards below. If you look at the various Ovechkin rookie cards from the 2005-06 season, you will notice that the signatures vary from card to card. The signature on the Xcitement card is significantly different that the others. Also, if you take a look at all of the autographs from that year, you will see a range of different Ovechkin autographs. There is a simple explanation for it. The first time I met Alex Ovechkin was in Raleigh at the 2004 NHL Draft. He was the number one overall pick that year. I was a VP at Pacific, and we were a sponsor of the draft and the title sponsor of the hockey card and memorabilia show at the event. I met him in the photo room we had set up. Minutes after he was drafted, he came into our photo room and we took his pictures for hockey cards that ended up never being made. The lockout would cancel the 2004-05 season, and we were eventually told by the NHLPA that when play resumed, we would not longer have a license. They were giving the Upper Deck Company an exclusive deal. Ovechkin, at that time, spoke no English. It only makes sense that if he could not speak English, he could not write English. I always thought that the Xcitement autograph was some form of cursive writing in the Cryllic alphabet. I only know a few words of Russian and am not very good with their alphabet, so it’s hard to tell. Embed from Getty Images Here is something about Ovechkin that day that you may not know. His mother was with him, and she had a lot of say in his business dealings at that time. No, he’s not a mama’s boy at all. His mother, Tatyana, is the greatest Soviet basketball player of all time. She spoke some English. I told her that I had actually met her when I was 12 years old during the 1976 Montreal Olympics. I was able to go to all of the basketball games at the Forum, as my father and uncle worked the games as a photographer. While they shot games or were in the press box, I was either sitting by myself watching the game or running film. Between games one day, I went to the McDonald’s across the street. The entire Soviet women’s team came in and they all had Big Macs. It was right in the middle of the famous Big Mac Attack ad campaign. It was the first time the women had ever been to a McDonald’s. Tatyana Ovechkina sat at the table beside me. As nervous as a I was as a 12-year-old, I smiled and said hi. I had a Soviet media guide and she signed it for me, as did a few of her teammates. That media guide was among the casualties of the 1998 ice storm that destroyed much of my childhood collection. If you are wondering why that rabbit hole I just took you on is relevant, it’s because Tatyana wore number 8 throughout her long and storied career. Alex Ovechkin wears number 8 as a tribute to him mother. Embed from Getty Images Since Alex now speaks English very well, his signature is consistent. When I see his autograph and the number 8, I always think of being a 12-year-old eating a Big Mac at the St Catherines Street McDonald’s across from the Forum and getting the autograph of Ovechkin’s mom. Hockey fans are somewhat divided. There are some diehard Gretzky collectors and fans that don’t want Ovechkin to break the record. Goals aside, it’s very unlikely Ovechkin will challenge Gretzky’s points record. The feel good part of the chase, however, is that Gretzky is supporting Ovechkin and cheering him on. Gretzky says it’s great for the game. Gretzky said in an NHL.com article written by Tom Gulitti that Ovechkin breaking the career goals record was inevitable. “It’s just a matter of time, whether it’s late this year, early next year, whenever,” Gretzky told Gulitti. “I mean, he’s a great player. He’s a great goal scorer.” Gretzky was a different player than Ovechkin is. Gretzky was a playmaker, while Ovechkin is a pure shooter. “Look at guys like Brett Hull, Mario Lemieux, Mike Bossy,” Gretzky said. “They get those opportunities. They don’t miss the net. If you miss the net you can’t score. Ovi. Bossy. Jari Kurri. Brett Hull. They never miss the net. And that separates a great goal scorer from good goal scorers, right? “And he can be in any spot on the ice, he’s going to hit the net.” Ovechkin’s rival throughout his career, Sidney Crosby, is among the many current players pulling for Ovechkin to break the record. In the same article, Ovechkin predictably said that at his age, it’s about staying healthy enough to score goals. He added that the focus is on winning another Stanley Cup, not on the goals record. But he is humbled that Gretzky is cheering him on and he might talk to him more when he gets close to the record about how to handle the pressure. “If that kind of person is rooting for me, it’s pretty cool stuff,” Ovechkin told Gulitti. “He’s the best player out there and he’s a great human. He supports me and it’s a pretty cool thing.” Clearly, in the last 20 years, Alex Ovechkin has learned to speak English and sign his autograph very well.

Sports Collectors Daily,TTM This Week: Set Hits and What Defines Success?,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/ttm-this-week-set-hits-and-what-defines-success/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 00:45:56 +0000","Drew gets a hockey card back in the mail, signed by a well-known former player but he's a set collector and this return is not all happy news.","November 21, 2024 By Drew Pelto  TTMCast Preview
Clemente Lisi joins Drew to talk about the big Toronto Expo last week and his experiences north of the border. Plus Drew and co-host Arron Littleton talk TTM successes and all the latest hobby news. You can listen to this week’s show here. TTM Successes
Sometimes a nice week at the mailbox can re-energize your pen, as this weekend I dropped 14 request letters in the mailbox. Hopefully I’ll be able to send a few more before the end of the year, though I’ll come up well short of my goal of 300. Here are some recent returns. Espen Knutsen  Almost 22 years ago, I started working on getting the 2002-03 Topps Total hockey card set signed. With Knutsen’s arrival, I am down to only three cards left on the set– Paul Kariya, Mark Messier, and Jason Allison. The light at the end of the tunnel shines just a little brighter. Knutsen signed this via his home address in Norway in two and a half months. Paul Kariya  Kariya has never been known to be a good TTMer– or even a good in-person signer. Most attempts in-person would get ignored, and for decades any attempts by mail resulted in an auto-penned photo being sent back. But a year ago I saw someone say he got a success via the Hockey Hall of Fame, so I sent one off myself. A year later, I got back this 1998-99 Pacific card signed– more on that below. This took exactly a year and a day, sent to the Hockey Hall of Fame. Jim Strickland  Any week where you get two set hits is great. Strickland pitched for the Twins and Indians in the 1970s. He shares a 1972 Topps high number card with Vic Albury and Rick Dempsey. After getting Dempsey on it, I mailed off to Strickland as well. Albury unfortunately died in 2017, so this is as complete as this one will get. Jim signed this for me in a month via his California home. Ruminations on success, failure, and areas in between
I was once asked at age 15 during a church “Coming Of Age” class (basically confirmation for the Unitarian Universalist world): what does success mean? What does it look like? What is it? I couldn’t really define it well then and at 40 I still don’t know. But in the TTM world it seems pretty cut and dried: success is sending a letter and getting an autograph back. But this week’s autograph from Paul Kariya has made me question that simple definition: are there tiers of success? As you saw above in my Espen Knutsen info, Kariya is one I have left in my Topps Total set. And I mailed that card– and only that card– in my request to him. He or whoever handles his mail sent the card back unsigned and put in a signed 1998-99 Pacific card in its place. Why players do this sometimes I don’t understand but they do.  I have never been that close to getting the card I need signed from a tough signer and just barely coming up short. I hate sounding spoiled here. After all, I got an autograph from a tough-to-get Hall of Famer, and he returned my unused SASE and paid his own Canadian postage, so I saved some money as well. But when you have a goal and you get agonizingly close and come up short, you wonder if you had a really good failure, or a bad success. It’s like asking a player to sign a ball, or a puck, or a photo and getting it smeared. Sure it’s a success, but… How close will I ever get again? Do I just need to mail off every year until it gets done or doesn’t come back at all? On the overall spectrum of success-to-failure, this is on the better end, for sure. But still… the pain! Maybe I’ll get lucky and someone working on a signed 1998-99 Pacific set needs this and has a Topps Total to trade me. It seems unlikely but hey, why not dream?

Sports Collectors Daily,"5 Early Roki Sasaki Cards to Consider, Hottest Auctions",https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/5-early-roki-sasaki-cards-to-consider/,"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 05:12:09 +0000","As MLB and collectors await his arrival, here's a look at some of the more popular early Roki Sasaki baseball cards.","November 20, 2024 By Brendan Cross  The talent pipeline between Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan and Major League Baseball continues to bear fruit. Roki Sasaki, a 23-year-old pitching phenom from the Chiba Lotte Marines, will be posted by his team and will sign a contract with an MLB team prior to the 2025 season.  Who he will be playing for is yet to be determined, but interest in Sasaki’s earliest baseball cards has been heating up with teams lining up to try and sign him.  Sasaki did not complete six seasons in the NPB, which means he is entering the MLB as an amateur and is not eligible to sign a contract to the tune of Yoshinobu Yamamoto’s 12-year $365 million pact with the Los Angeles Dodgers last December. According to a Baseball America article by J.J. Cooper, Sasaki will essentially be signing a minor league contract and will not reach arbitration until his third season in the major leagues. Shohei Ohtani also took this route when he signed with the Angels prior to the 2018 season. To call Sasaki the Paul Skenes of Japan is not the best comparison. Yes, the Japanese fireballer has a triple-digit fastball and is only six months older than Skenes. But the lanky 6’2” righthander has a great command, a filthy splitter and a wipeout slider that is more Jacob deGrom than it is Paul Skenes. Regardless of those or any other comparisons, Sasaki is on his way to the majors and is already the most talked about free agent pitcher available. Is Sasaki as good of a pitcher as Ohtani or Yamamoto, or maybe Kodai Senga or Shota Imanaga? Consider that he made his debut at the age of 19 in 2021 and was immediately a dominant pitcher. In 2022, he pitched a perfect game with 19 strikeouts, which tied the NPB record. In that game, he set a new NPB record by fanning 13 in a row. In his next start, he went eight perfect innings but was pulled before the ninth due to pitch count concerns. In 2023, the world had a chance to see Sasaki on a big stage. In the World Baseball Classic, he pitched 7.2 innings and struck out 11. In the semi-final against a strong Mexican team, Sasaki averaged 100.5 mph with his fastball. The obvious impact that Sasaki will have on the hobby is that he will be one of the most sought after rookies in 2025. He is not the only high-profile rookie who will have his Major League baseball card debut next year, but he will be in high demand. Sales of Sasaki’s Japanese cards and those produced in conjunction with the World Baseball Classic have skyrocketed since late October. Over 500 listings sold on eBay November 9 when news of his pending arrival heated up. Ten cards have sold for $1,000 or more this month on the platform. Sasaki’s earliest trading cards date back to 2020, as he was featured in several top Japanese sports card sets from brands like BBM and Calbee. Here’s a handful of Sasaki’s best NPB and pre-MLB cards. 2020 BBM 1st Version #104

Collectors seem to consider this to be Sasaki’s best NPB card to own. It’s the flagship equivalent to what will eventually be his 2025 Topps Series 1 or Series 2 rookie card and is his first professional card.  BBM began producing cards for the NPB in 1991. PSA 10 versions of the card have been selling for $400 and up while raw copies are pushing north of $100. There are facsimile autographed versions as well. 2020 Calbee #94  Another leading card brand in Japan, this 2020 Calbee base card features the high leg kick of Sasaki while the card design itself has rounded corners. It may not be as sought after by collectors when compared to the BBM counterpart, but visually it’s a must add to any budding Sasaki collection. PSA 10 copies have moved close to $200 with nice raw copies less than half of that. 2021 Topps Chrome NPB #194 
Topps got into the NPB card game with a 2021 Topps Chrome set that featured a few future MLB players such as Seiya Suzuki, Shota Imanaga and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, along with Sasaki. The 2021 Topps MLB chrome set featured the same classic chrome design. It’s Sasaki’s first true Topps card and will surely continue to be a grail card in many collections. Along with the base version, a full range of parallels from Refractor to the 1/1 SuperFractor make these some of the best Sasaki cards to consider. There are no recent sales of numbered versions of this card, but a base PSA 10 sold for $168 on November 14. 2022 Bowman NPB Chrome #133 
In 2022, Topps released a Bowman NPB product featuring paper and chrome cards. This product has an equally large parallel rainbow to build and chase as the 2021 Topps Chrome NPB product. I love the large stride that is captured by Sasaki in this card, large enough to go off the card on both sides. There is also something special about Sasaki having a Bowman card. While he is an NPB professional in this card, as far as the MLB is concerned, he is essentially a prospect. A PSA 10 version of this card sold for $73 on November 14, making it nearly $100 cheaper than its Topps Chrome NPB counterpart. 2023 Topps Series 2 World Baseball Classic #WBC-34

The World Baseball Classic subset in 2023 Topps Series 2 is a highly collectible insert set that features stars who participated in the most recent world tournament. Sasaki was overshadowed by Shohei Ohtani’s performance both on the mound and at the dish, but it was the first time the international stage got to see Sasaki pitch, and he did not disappoint. Base versions of this card are selling for between $8-$10 dollars while numbered parallels will fetch significantly more. Topps also produced a standalone set for the last WBC and you can find Sasaki there, too. Card #21 has a base card and an image variation with each having multiple parallel versions.

The Federación Mexicana de Futbol (FMF) announced on Friday, November 22, that they had extended their kit contract with German sportswear giant Adidas for another 10 years, “seeking to continue building memorable stories alongside the players; but above all, with the help of the fans,” according to a press release (translated to English by Google). “For the FMF it is an honor that adidas continues to be part of our history for 10 more years. This collaboration is based on shared values ​​to which adidas has shown a deep commitment, such as respect for our culture, traditions and passion for soccer. We are sure that the renewal will continue to inspire generations of Mexicans to proudly wear the colors of our National Team,” said FMF executive president Ivar Sisniega. “For adidas, being on the side of Mexican soccer has always been important; being part of the process of achieving success is becoming increasingly important today, and in this sense, we are happy to continue being part of this path. We are convinced that the triumphs will come and will be memories that will be close to the hearts of soccer fans forever, not just for the next ten years,” added Adidas Mexico general manager Jorge Dionne. The new contract will cover the 2026, 2030 and 2034 FIFA World Cups. The FMF first partnered with Adidas in 1984, and that contract lasted until 1990. Mexico kits were then produced by various companies like Umbro, ABA Sport, Garcis and Atletica until 2003, when the FMF signed a contract with Nike. In 2007, Mexico partnered up with Adidas once again, and that relationship that lasted ever since. The Mexican men’s national team’s next match is a CONCACAF Nations League against Canada on March 20, 2025, at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles."

The new look maintains the popular bee character, a staple in the minor league baseball landscape since 2006, while updating the typography and adding some alternate identities. The new type, which is included in the primary logo and the interlocking cap logo, is meant to allude to the sting of a bee. The interlocking SL cap logo pre-dates the Bees in Salt Lake City, with previous teams in the city like the Gulls and the Trappers using a version of the baseball custom in the 1970s and ’80s. New alternate identities pay tribute to the state of Utah, including one that features the state outline with the word Bees set in a descending staircase that evokes a classic logo from the team’s parent club, the Los Angeles Angels. Another alternate pays homage to the Beehive State with a beehive icon. If you’ve driven through Utah, you’ll know this symbol from the state’s highway signs. Yet another alternate sets pair of crossed bats within a honeycomb, with icons of a baseball and the state of Utah set opposite the letters S and L. The new Bees look pays tribute to teams from the early 20th century with a recreation of a bee illustration on uniforms from the 1920s. The team unveiled a series of wordmarks derived from their new custom typography. The Bees, affiliates of the Los Angeles Angels in the International League, played their final game at Smith’s Ballpark September 22. Next season the team will play in South Jordan, about 20 miles south Salt Lake City, at brand-new Daybreak Field."

About two weeks after the conclusion of the 2024 Korean Series in late October, the KBO League team based in Daejeon, South Korea, unveiled a new suite of logos and uniforms for 2025. While the orange remains in their colour palette from previous seasons, it is now complemented by a dark shade of navy blue instead of black.

Both identities were created by designer Matthew Wolff. The wordmarks include one in cursive script and one in all caps. Both were “developed with the motif of an eagle’s beak and talons,” the team said on social media. The cursive script—used in the primary logo and on both the white home and orange alternate uniforms—is “a modern reinterpretation of the logo from the championship days,” when the Eagles won their only Korean Series in 1999. Also included in the new suite is an eagle head logo with lightning bolts in the neck. This logo doesn’t appear on the Eagles’ new uniforms, but it is used on their website, on team merchandise, and on a flag that was used in the photo shoots for the new uniforms. The Eagles’ white home uniforms feature the scripted wordmark in one-colour orange, while the front number is navy blue. The corporate wordmark of the Hanwha Group — a worldwide conglomerate based in Korea that deals in everything from energy to finance — appears in orange on the left shoulder. A single orange stripe runs down each side of the pants. The grey away uniforms have slightly darker grey pinstripes and a navy blue all-caps wordmark on the front, along with an orange front number. A navy blue stripe runs down each side of the pants. The Eagles also unveiled two alternate jerseys, one orange and one navy blue. The orange one has a navy blue script wordmark and a white front number, while the navy blue one has a white all-caps wordmark and a white front number. The navy alternate is also the only one where the unveiling photos showed a clear view of the back; in this case, the player name is one-colour white, while the number is one-colour orange. The Eagles’ social media announcement pictured all four jerseys with the same cap or batting helmet, which has a navy blue base and an orange script “E” on the front. Along with the Eagles and Twins, Wolff has done design work for Major League Soccer’s Chicago Fire and Los Angeles Football Club; New York/New Jersey Gotham FC, Racing Louisville, San Diego Wave FC and Angel City FC of the National Women’s Soccer League; and USL clubs like Louisville City, Union Omaha and FC Tulsa. He also worked on the typography as part of the rebranding of the National Basketball Association’s Los Angeles Clippers, which was unveiled in February 2024. The Hanwha Eagles joined the KBO League in 1986 as the Binggrae Eagles, as Binggrae was the name of Hanwha’s confectionary branch. They changed their name in 1993 when Binggrae separated from the Hanwha conglomerate. They won their only Korean Series championship in 1999 but have been runners-up five times (1988, 1989, 1991, 1992, 2006)."

The Armada — based in Boisbriand, Quebec, just north of Montréal — have primarily used black and white as their team colors since joining the QMJHL in 2011. But they added blue to their palette over the weekend with the unveiling of the third jersey, which they wore at home both on Friday against the Acadie-Bathurst Titan and Saturday against the Val d’Or Foreurs. While the new third jersey maintains a black base — echoing the Armada’s “Bleed Black” motto — the squared-off shoulders are blue, as are stripes around the waist and sleeves. The front of the jersey features a new logo, with “ARMADA” in black running across a black “A”, both of which have white outlines. Blue was chosen because it “embodies the spirit of an armada that strongly cuts through the waves, weathering storms and staying on course toward a future full of promise” (translated to English by Google). Atop the “A” is a blue crown that the team says is made up of two horizontal Bs. The bottom line of the crown symbolizes Autoroute 15, which runs through Boisbriand and is part of the Trans-Canada Highway. The collar of the jersey is half blue and half black, with a blue insert at the front with a black double-B logo inside. The numbers on the sleeves and back are black with white outlines, as are the As and Cs on the front of alternate captains’ and captains’ jerseys. Names on the backs are one-color white. The new jerseys worked like a charm for the Armada, as they won both games in which they wore them over the weekend."

(&#8216;Member member berries?)","As far as old hockey logos go, the Vancouver Canucks’ “flying skate” logo might be one of the most divisive of them all. Was this actually a logo good enough to warrant a rebirth, or are we simply hitting the member berries a little too hard again? (‘Member member berries?) With its sharp lines, vibrant red-and-yellow colour palette, and a sense of speed woven into its look, it was a vast departure from the club’s previous blue-and-green hockey stick design when it was introduced in 1978. It was also the most visible element for one of the most memorable runs in franchise history when they went all the way to Game 7 of the 1994 Stanley Cup Final. Though they fell just short of ultimate glory, the love for the logo lives on, guaranteed to instantly bring back memories of that team that was just a win away. As the ’94 team celebrates its 30th anniversary—and as the flying skate continues to make its mark now as an incredibly popular alternate jersey—let’s take a closer look at the origins of the flying skate logo and that colour scheme: how they came to be, their controversial reception, and how they have cemented their place in Vancouver’s visual identity. When the Canucks decided to overhaul their look in 1978, they turned to Beyl and Boyd, a San Francisco-based design agency, to create a bold and aggressive new identity. The result was a massive shift from the team’s look up until that point—gone were the blue and green of the original uniforms, replaced by a vibrant red, orange, yellow, and black colour scheme meant to evoke energy and aggression. “The Canucks colours were all wrong,” designer Bill Boyd told the Vancouver Sun in 1978. “Blue-green is the coolest colour of all; [it] slows the pulse, reduces aggression, and promotes calmness. With the [new] Canucks uniforms, we are going from the coolest of colours—blue-green—to the hottest—red-orange. The cool colour is passive, the hot one aggressive, plus the black. It’s the contrast of colours that creates emotion.” This aggressive new palette was paired with a dynamic new logo by illustrator Mike Bull. The flying skate design replaced the stick-in-rink logo, which Boyd and his team considered too static for the fast-paced game of hockey. The skate, speeding diagonally across the word “Canucks,” embodied motion, style, and progress. According to Boyd, the new logo was specifically chosen for its positive attributes of “movement and style,” reflecting the Canucks’ desire to inject energy and aggression into their brand. The change was as symbolic as it was visual, trading one piece of hockey equipment (the stick) for another (the skate) in a way that underscored the true speed of the game. It bore the hallmarks of the pop art movement, with sharp angles and a bold, contrasting colour palette. It was part of a broader trend in the late 1970s, as sports teams experimented with their aesthetics to stand out in increasingly competitive markets. Initially, the Flying Skate’s impact on the uniforms was minimal, appearing only on the sleeves of the jersey and serving as a secondary element to the far more overpowering “V” design on the chest—a representation of the City of Vancouver. “Diagonal stripes get your attention. They’re like the crooked picture on the wall. You have to fix it, or it drives you crazy,” Boyd explained. The Canucks continued to break from tradition by wearing yellow jerseys at home instead of white, with Boyd emphasizing, “White produces no response at all, so we went for yellow… Yellow is warm, pleasant, happy, upbeat.” As with most bold design choices, the look proved polarizing. Critics mocked the new uniforms, with The Financial Post joking, “So the Canucks will go from ‘cool’ to ‘hot’ just by changing their uniforms? The rest of the teams could wear sunglasses, that is, if they aren’t already colourblind.” By 1982, the Canucks had made a surprise run to the Stanley Cup Final, providing the flying skate logo with its first big moment on the national stage. Unfortunately, the New York Islanders quickly swept aside the team and eventually the “V” jerseys. Just three years later, the Canucks updated their look, moving the flying skate logo from the sleeves to the front of the jersey while shifting the “V” to the shoulders. These changes introduced a cleaner, more traditional uniform layout, though the colour scheme of red, yellow, and black remained intact. By the late 1980s, dissatisfaction with the team’s look persisted. Brian Burke, the Canucks’ director of hockey operations at the time, criticized the jerseys on a local radio show, calling the home uniforms a shade of “puke-yellow.” His remarks inspired a 20-year-old fan named Jeremie White to propose a new uniform concept, pitching designs that replaced the colour scheme with black and blue and introducing a new design featuring a hockey stick flying through a “V.” While Burke dismissed the colour and logo change, he saw potential in White’s skills and ideas. Partnering with general manager Pat Quinn, White refined the design, resulting in a significant uniform update in 1989. The new look eliminated the shoulder “V”s, reintroduced traditional striping on the jerseys, and replaced the “puke yellow” home uniforms with a white set. The flying skate logo remained front and centre on the chest of both the home white and road black sweaters. White’s vision, combined with Quinn’s leadership, ultimately helped refine the look that became synonymous with the Canucks’ most competitive teams of the ’90s. The flying skate logo undoubtedly reached its peak during the 1994 Stanley Cup Final, where it adorned the jerseys of a gritty Canucks team led by Trevor Linden, Pavel Bure, and Kirk McLean. Though it ended in heartbreak, the flying skate became synonymous with that era of Canucks hockey and a moment when many younger fans forged their lifelong love for the team. The popularity of that team wasn’t enough to stop the radical design shift the sports world experienced in the mid-to-late 1990s. Just three years later, it was gone, replaced with a new orca-focused logo and then, eventually, a return to that cool-and-calming blue and green colour scheme. ‘Member blue and green? Despite its forced retirement, the flying skate’s popularity endured. While the orca logo ushered in a new chapter for the Canucks, many fans saw it as a corporate pivot—a sharp departure from the community-driven passion the flying skate represented. In 2019-20, as part of the team’s 50th-anniversary celebrations, the Canucks wore the flying skate jerseys for select games before bringing it back as a full-fledged third jersey during the 2022-23 season. They say sometimes you have to lose something to love something, and that appears to be the case here with the Flying Skate logo. Widely panned in its day, the Flying Skate is now more popular than ever, with fans often pleading for it to return full-time, hoping to join a handful of other NHL teams that have corrected their ’90s redesigns. As a hockey fan who grew up watching those black, red, and gold Canucks teams, I never got the appeal of that look at the time, but I can’t deny the warm-and-fuzzies I feel whenever I see them hit the ice today. It’s not just about the bold colours or sharp lines—it’s about the grit of Trevor Linden, the jaw-dropping magic of Pavel Bure, and the electric atmosphere of the old Pacific Coliseum every time the team stepped on the ice in that unforgettable outfit. ‘Member Gino Odjick?

The franchise unveiled the new identity during a ceremony at the Wilson Industrial Air Center, a historic training site for World War II aviators. The nickname Warbirds is a reference to military aircraft that continue to fly after their service days are over. More specifically, the name is a tribute to Wilson’s own Vollis Simpson, a World War II pilot who went on to become a sculptor. Simpson was best know for creating a series of large, wind-powered “Whirligig” structures, which will be visible beyond the left field wall in the team’s new downtown ballpark. “Designed to symbolize historical significance and unmatched speed, the logo celebrates community passions for baseball, aviation, and Americana,” the team said in a statement. The brand was created by Rev Pop, a design firm based in Milwaukee, the hometown of the Warbirds’ MLB parent club, the Brewers. An understated metallic color palette and an anthropomorphic, patriotic bird character in period costume evoke a distinctive 1940s vibe. “Scott Starr of Rev Pop, who led the process of developing the team name and associated logos, spent significant time researching everything about Wilson and the region,” said Milwaukee Brewers President of Business Operations Rick Schlesinger, quoted in a statement. “His travels included visits with local citizens and civic officials, and this proved to be the first big step in branding the team.” Fans of the classic Carolina Mudcats brand, which until yesterday had remained largely unchanged since 1991, will have one last season to enjoy an identity that many fans point to as one of the most definitive of this current era of Minor League Baseball.

𝐖𝐞𝐞𝐤 𝟏𝟏 𝐔𝐧𝐢𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐬 🔴⚫⚫ pic.twitter.com/Ld8bZW1Pb3 The red helmets feature Utah’s interlocking “U” logo and a tribal tattoo – known as kākau – on the right side, while the left side includes the phrase “Malama Lahaina,” an outline of the Hawaiian island of Maui and a depiction of Lahaina’s iconic Front Street, which was destroyed by wildfire in 2023. Created by Samoan artist Fred Frost of Utah-based Frost City Tattoos, the tattoo represents the islands of Polynesia and the Polynesian players and coaches who have come through the program, while the stripe down the center of the helmet is inspired by the Hawaiian tradition of lauhala weaving.  “Malama,” meanwhile, is the Hawaiian word for caring, nurturing and preserving the land and its people, an important message as the Lahaina wildfire caused more than $5 billion in damage and claimed the lives of 102 people, marking the deadliest weather-related disaster in the state’s history.

He was also tasked with creating the seven previous hand-painted designs the Utes have worn since 2016.  That includes their black “Drum and Feather” helmets in 2016, red “Throw the U” helmets in 2017, Red Tail Hawk helmets in 2018, 1966-67 throwback helmets in 2019, U.S.S. Salt Lake City helmets in 2021, “22 Forever” helmets in 2022 and “The Muss” helmets in 2023. Utah will pair the new hand-painted helmets with its black throwback uniforms, which debuted in a 23-10 loss to Arizona on Sept. 28. They feature a classic number font, as well as a traditional striping pattern and the interlocking “U” on the sleeves. Photos courtesy of @Utah_Football on X/Twitter."

The jerseys were unveiled in front of 1,500 supporters, including Gov. Janet Mills, at a special event at the State Theater in Portland on the evening of Thursday, November 21. Hearts of Pine executive creative director Burke Cherrie, who co-designed the kits with club founder Gabe Hoffman-Johnson, told SportsLogos.net in an interview just hours before the reveal that the club was aiming for a timeless design that people across Maine would be proud to wear. “Mainers, in particular, like the old ways. There’s a convergence of the old ways and the new ways here,” Cherrie said. “We don’t discard the past. That’s something that really resonated throughout the branding process. In town halls with supporters and local government officials, talking with people who run businesses, there was a desire for this to be as Maine as possible. And history and heritage are a key part of that.” The jersey features navy blue and forest green hoops all over the front, back and sleeves to represent the Atlantic Ocean and the woods that Mainers interact with every day, either for recreation or to earn a living. The sleeve cuffs and polo collar are navy blue with red trim inspired by the heart in the club’s crest. The club motto, “Lead With Your Heart,” and Dirigo heart logo — a mashup of their heart iconography and the “Dirigo star” from the Maine flag — appear on the back collar. “We’ve been working on the [kit] design for really over a year. As we were developing the crest and everything else that went into the brand, the jersey design was front and center in that process,” Cherrie said. “Gabe and I are lifelong soccer fans, and there’s a lot of nostalgia for ’90s soccer culture, from when we were growing up,” he added. “I have a lot of great memories of long-sleeved jerseys and big collars and cuffs. A soccer jersey is performance wear, but it’s also fashion in today’s world. To bring back some of those trends, we felt there was an opportunity to lean into that.” The front-of-shirt sponsor is Visit Maine, the state’s tourism office, and their logo of the state’s name with a period appears in white. The sleeve sponsor is L.L.Bean, the outdoor clothing and equipment retailer based in Maine. “I would argue we have the best front-of-shirt and sleeve sponsorship combo in American soccer, and probably the world,” Cherrie said. “I don’t think you can find a European club or a South American club that has a more unified club brand aligned with its sponsors’ brands. That’s a credit to the team that’s been working on sponsorships, the commercial side of things, to bring that to life.” The kits are manufactured by Danish sportswear company Hummel, who also produce kits for Denmark’s national teams as well as German Bundesliga team Werder Bremen; Spanish La Liga clubs UD Las Palmas, Real Betis and RC Celta de Vigo; and French Ligue 1 side AS Saint-Étienne. “It’s a small world, and I’m fortunate to have friends on the other side of the table,” said Cherrie, who has worked in sports media for more than a decade, collaborating with high-profile European clubs like Liverpool and Chelsea in the past. “I’m a huge soccer fan, and my dad was obsessed with the 1992 Danish national team that wore Hummel. The chevrons and the history that’s gone into that 100-year-old brand, that always felt like a really good fit for us. And they really align with the culture of Maine; it’s a brand that punches above its weight.” Portland Hearts of Pine will kick off its 2025 USL League One season at Fitzpatrick Stadium, a 6,300-seat facility in Portland. The club launched its crest — also co-designed by Cherrie — in April 2024, which incorporates elements from the Maine seal and other state symbols. The heart in the crest is inspired by the Valentine’s Day Bandit, whose tradition of decorating storefronts and other structures in Portland with red hearts every February 14 has carried on beyond the original Bandit’s passing in 2023. Though he grew up in Pennsylvania and went to college in New York City, Cherrie has called Maine home for the past six years. To spearhead the development of a brand for a local team and watch his designs become reality has a real thrill for him. “To walk down the street and see a crest you helped create on someone’s hat at happy hour or whatever it is, it’s special to see that,” he said. “The way Portland and much of Maine has taken to the brand has been amazing.” He adds, though, that since the crest unveiling, Hearts of Pine has shipped merchandise to 45 different U.S. states and internationally. “Once you’re a Mainer, it sticks with you.” The 2025 USL League One regular season will kick off in March. Hearts of Pine plans to reveal a second kit in February and a third kit a month or two into the season, depending on potential kit clashes with opponents. Cherrie was coy about the details of the second and third kits, but did say the team was “cooking up something pretty unique” for those. “As excited as I am about this one, I think the second and third kits are going to strike a different chord with both fans of the club and people who collect jerseys,” he said. The Woods and Water Kit is available in unisex short-sleeve, unisex long-sleeve, women’s and kids’ sizes through Hearts of Pine’s online store and at the club’s holiday pop-up shop in Portland."

This potentially would bring women’s professional basketball back to Cleveland for the first time in over twenty years. The team would be the WNBA’s 16th franchise, joining the league’s growing roster as early as 2027 or 2028. The new franchise would play its home games at Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse, which has undergone significant renovations in recent years. Additionally, the team would utilize the Cleveland Clinic Peak Performance Center, a new state-of-the-art training and business facility currently under development and set to open in 2027. “It has long been woven into our mission to utilize our platform to unite our community in ways that drive equal opportunities across the board,” said Rock Entertainment Group in a statement to Reuters. “To that end, we are actively pursuing bringing a WNBA expansion team to Cleveland.” Cleveland previously had a WNBA team, the Cleveland Rockers, one of the league’s original franchises. The Rockers played from 1997 to 2003, folding after then-owner Gordon Gund ceased operations and the league could not find a new owner. The city recently hosted the 2024 NCAA Women’s Final Four, which broke television viewership records for women’s sports. The WNBA, currently a 12-team league, is in the midst of a rapid expansion.

They have flown nine different types aircraft dating back to World War II, with the pilots of Vought F4U Corsairs racking up over 150 kills by the end of the war. Other aircraft flown by the Jolly Rogers include the Grumman F6F Hellcat, F9F Cougar, FJ-3 Fury, McDonnell F3H Demon, Vought F-8 Crusader, McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, F-14 A/B Tomcat and the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets.

As is the case with all Winter Classic games, both teams will be wearing uniforms inspired by the history of hockey in their communities. The Blackhawks, again, will reach back into the wealth of options their ninety-eight-year-old wardrobe offers. St Louis, on the other hand, has had fewer unique uniform designs over the years (and has already used up the big ones several times) and, therefore, has gone away from the franchise history a bit for their design. SHOP: 2025 NHL Winter Classic Blues and Blackhawks jerseys available now Starting with Chicago, a uniform which had leaked a couple of months ago is now confirmed as legit. We get the first time the Blackhawks have worn red for an outdoor game. Inspired by their uniforms and crests worn during the 1940s and ’50s, the Blackhawks will have several horizontal stripes across the chest in white and black with a mishmash of team logos as the main crest. The current Blackhawks’ primary logo is the centrepiece inside a roundel with four stars around the bottom, a nod to the Chicago city flag. The typeface within the roundel is a block, serif-style font, which is very close to what the crest featured on their uniforms of the late ’40s/early ’50s. You’ll note that the team name was presented as two words in those original photos; the team made their name a single word in 1986. On the back of the jersey, the player numbers incorporate a pinstripe pattern, a nod to the Chicago Cubs (perfect for a game at Wrigley Field). From the NHL: The Blackhawks’ NHL Winter Classic uniform pays homage to the franchise’s rich heritagewhile introducing distinctive new design elements. The jersey features a classic lace-neckcollar, reminiscent of hockey’s early days, complemented by a vintage cream color thatcaptures the nostalgic spirit of the Original Six era. In unique design flourishes, the frontcrest includes stars from the Chicago flag and the back numbers incorporate subtlepinstripes, a thoughtful tribute to Chicago’s deep baseball tradition. The elements cometogether to create a uniform that honours both the team’s storied past and the city’s broadersporting legacy. The St Louis Blues design looks like they’re going back to the 1930s St. Louis Flyers, a team that predates the Blues’ time in the NHL by three decades. The striping across the chest, with the team name across it, seems to be directly inspired by those Flyers uniforms. The colours blue and gold are not what the Flyers wore, but they, of course, are present here to tie this uniform to the Blues franchise. The font for the ST LOUIS name across the chest is a modified version of that prototype Blues jersey, which served as the inspiration for their Reverse Retro 2.0 uniform back in 2022-23. Something that caught my eye is a modified Bluenote logo on the shoulder, perhaps testing the waters for a future change. From the NHL: The Blues’ NHL Winter Classic uniform pays homage to the city’s hockey heritage. Thejersey’s primary wordmark represents the first time in team history that a Blue Note is notthe principal design element appearing on the chest. The font styling and numbers areinspired by an unworn prototype Blues uniform from 1966, and the jersey also includes anewly designed vintage-style “Blue Note” on the shoulder.

A retro-style pig character—much friendlier than the IronPigs metallic contemporary logo—features prominently on a red cap. A cream-colored jersey is adorned by red piping and a script wordmark across the chest—note the curly-Q on the descender of the G in Pigs, meant to evoke a pig’s tail. “What started as a focus on reimagining the full body pig characters ended up taking a nice ‘what-if’ turn,” Ryan Foose said. “2024 actually marks 140 years of baseball in Allentown. While this identity doesn’t necessarily pull all the way back to the 1880s, it was great collaborating with Lehigh Valley staff on what the IronPigs Baseball Club would look like from the golden era of baseball.” The IronPigs, who are named for the pig iron forged in the steel mills of eastern Pennsylvania, will play their first Friday home game on opening day, March 28, 2025."

The tweet was both posted and deleted on Tuesday, November 19, ahead of the Fighting Irish’s games in the Friendship Four tournament at the SSE Arena in Belfast coming up on November 29 and 30. According to screenshots taken before it was deleted, the post advised fans not to wear green or anything with shamrocks, the Ireland flag, leprechauns, or the words “Irish” or “Fighting Irish” in Northern Ireland capital as they may be “deemed offensive.” Weirdly, though, Notre Dame’s own special jerseys for the tournament — which were unveiled on November 6 — are emblazoned with a script “Irish” logo on the front, with a shamrock dotting the second I. The tweet advised Notre Dame fans to instead wear the school colors of navy and gold and items with the school’s “ND” monogram. The program was lambasted in the replies to the original tweet, with some users calling it “embarrassing.” “My kids have travelled all over Ireland in all the gear you say not to wear and received nothing but love,” the Belfast Telegraph reports one replier as saying. “As a Notre Dame graduate married to an Irish woman this is embarrassing and you should take down the post immediately.” Another user quoted by the Telegraph said: “This tweet is more offensive than any American university t-shirt abroad ever would be. If the fans of the Fighting Irish should be made to feel embarrassed of their programme, then don’t schedule the trip.” Notre Dame Hockey took down the post, then posted an apology a little while later: A statement on our upcoming trip to Belfast. pic.twitter.com/UVB8qRlOas This year’s edition of the Friendship Four tournament also includes teams from Boston University, Merrimack College and Harvard University.

Previous editions of the tournament were held from 2015 to 2019 and in 2022. Notre Dame’s special jerseys for the tournament are navy blue with the gold “Irish” script on the front. A logo on the shoulders combines a Celtic knot with hockey sticks and faceoff circles. The numbers on the sleeves and back also incorporate the Notre Dame Celtic knot and, along with the nameplate font, are inspired by illustrations in the Book of Kells."

According to Utah president of hockey operations Chris Armstrong in a recent article on NHL.com, Utah will stay close to their current jersey design. “What I would say is that, based on the very encouraging feedback that we’ve received from fans and our players alike on the inaugural season jersey design, we’ll be making some adjustments and some what we think are improvements, but we don’t want to deviate too far from what’s already been well received in our inaugural season,” he said. So what exactly does this mean? Well, we can really only speculate of course, but I’d take it to mean that the colours and striping will either be carried over exactly as they are or just slightly adjusted. Armstrong’s note about “making some adjustments … we think are improvements,” could point to fixing the discrepancies between the home and road jersey striping so they actually match each other. The graphic above gives us a peek at what consistent striping across the home and road sets would look like on a blank jersey, just pop in your favourite Utah Whateverzz logo concept on the chest and you’re good to go. Utah Hockey Club recently made their jerseys available for sale at retail both in-person at Delta Center and online at NHLShop.com, though it appears there are no longer any available online. Fans wanting the 2024-25 Inaugural Season patch must get their jersey at the arena in Salt Lake City. When the franchise was granted earlier this year, the club announced they’d use a temporary identity for their first season in the NHL due to the quick turnaround time between acquiring the franchise and their first game. Several months later, however, the team still hasn’t announced a name, nor have they even revealed if they’ll even change their name at all.

Still no reason to panic just yet in Washington, but they'll need to change something soon to avoid a second-half collapse. There's one player on the Commanders' roster that could have a new home next season, according to Bleacher Report. Dyami Brown was Washington's third round pick in 2021 and has played a backup role since joining the team. Brown has 16 catches for 171 yards and one touchdown this season while appearing in 30% of offensive snaps. To potentially earn a larger role in the future, Bleacher Report has the Buffalo Bills plucking Brown and adding him to one of the NFL's most elite offensive units. Targeting someone like Dyami Brown would give them a younger free agent who could develop into a better player. Brown has flashed some potential this season with the Commanders, but a fresh start in Buffalo could elevate his game. The Commanders will be looking for a legitimate No.2 receiver to pair with Terry McLaurin next season and Brown obviously won't fill that role. They shouldn't be affected by losing him in the offseason. Andrew Parsaud is a recent graduate of Penn State, where he studied digital journalism and media.

Antonio Pierce's squad hasn't won a game since Sept.29, when Las Vegas defeated the Cleveland Browns in Week 4. With the loss to the Broncos on Sunday, the Raiders dropped to 2-9 and are tied with the Jacksonville Jaguars and New York Giants for the worst record in the NFL. The team has clinched its third consecutive season with a losing record and will likely finish at the bottom of the AFC West for the first time since 2018.  Raiders fans haven't had much to cheer for this season, but as the team continues to lose, the franchise's draft position will become a focus. Las Vegas had the No.13 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, selecting tight end Brock Bowers, who has already established himself as one of the best players at his position. Though Las Vegas currently has the longest losing streak in the NFL, the franchise doesn't hold the No.1 overall pick after Week 12, as the Giants currently have possession of the top pick in April's draft. The Raiders own the No.2 overall pick in the draft, putting the team in a fantastic position to select a quarterback. A look at the top 10 picks in the 2025 NFL Draft with six weeks to go: pic.twitter.com/qxokCXUbN5 Though Las Vegas will have a ton of talented players to choose from with their premium draft choice in April, Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders seems like the obvious pick.

Davis also said during a press conference after Brady became a part owner of the team that the seven-time Super Bowl champion will help the franchise select a quarterback in the future. .@Raiders owner Mark Davis: ""We traded Davante Adams for Tom Brady.” (He was joking of course)Then added: “Although Tom can't play, he can help us select a QB in the future."" Though there is no official confirmation, it seems the Raiders have their sights set on drafting Shedeur Sanders in April, and holding the No.2 overall pick through 12 weeks is a promising step towards landing the talented Colorado signal caller.

Last winter, everything the Dodgers touched turned to gold. The headliner was the $700 million deal for Shohei Ohtani, but Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Teoscar Hernández, and Tyler Glasnow were marquee additions that all paid dividends as well. One savvy move they made the previous offseason made an enormous difference, too. The Dodgers had signed relief pitcher Blake Treinen to an $8 million deal with a $1 million club option for 2024. They exercised that option and the rest, as they say, is history. After Treinen served as the de facto closer on the Dodgers' World Series-winning roster, LA now has to decide whether or not to bring Treinen back. And this time, they won't have the option of offering him just $1 million. Competition could be fierce for such a proven veteran reliever on the open market, too. Recently, Zach Pressnell of FanSided named the Chicago Cubs as a team that could threaten the Dodgers' chances of keeping Treinen this winter. ""The Cubs have an opportunity to fill the gaping hole at closer with a very reliable veteran coming off one of his best seasons yet. This best season includes a 1.93 ERA, 1.4 WAR, seven wins and a World Series ring with the Los Angeles Dodgers,"" Pressnell said. ""Giving Treinen the clear-cut role as a closer would be a solid selling point, but Chicago can also keep their hands clean with a one- or two-year contract worth a lot less money than players like Tanner Scott or Carlos Estevez are rumored to get.""  Treinen, 36, is in the twilight of his career, but he's proven he still has something in the tank. He can certainly expect a raise on his 2024 salary, and though the Dodgers are bigger spenders than the Cubs nowadays, one never knows who the highest bidder will be on a one-year contract. Should the Dodgers do everything in their power to keep Treinen out of Chicago's grasp? That's a question for Andrew Friedman and the front office to ponder in the coming weeks.

These quotes can often be utilized to shift our perspective on a player's fantasy outlook.,"Michael OHara NFL coaches and players are constantly on camera, even when they're not on the field. Frequent press conferences with the media provide NFL fans with a steady stream of quotes about their favorite teams and players. These quotes can actually be used to make informed decisions about our fantasy teams. These useful quotes can pertain to injury outlooks, player usage, overall offensive tendencies and philosophy, and more. The key is to know which quotes are actionable, and which ones are just fluff that can be ignored. The vast majority of these quotes will be sourced from the interviews that beat reporters conduct with players and coaches throughout the week. The Coachspeak Index (CSI) does a phenomenal job of listening to these interviews and picking out the key nuggets. In this article, we'll be taking a look at quotes (from CSI and other sources) and analyzing their fantasy impact. Some may be more serious than others, but it's all about getting a feel for coaches and players from information that may not show up in the box score. WEEK 13 FANTASY FOOTBALL RANKINGSQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/ST | Kickers Brian Daboll says he talked with Malik Nabers after his postgame comments yesterday:""He's a very competitive individual. You want to get the ball in his hands and I've got to do a better job of getting the ball in his hands early. He's a smart young guy who's very competitive."" pic.twitter.com/jm00NZo1QS Following the Buccaneers' 30-7 rout of the Giants, Malik Nabers had some comments for the media, expressing his frustration about his lack of usage in the first half of the game. When he was asked why he did not see a target in the first half, Nabers replied, "" I don't know, talk to Dabs (Daboll) about that."" When asked about these comments, Brian Daboll noted Nabers' competitiveness, and how it's his job to get the ball into Nabers' hands. Key Fantasy Takeaway: With the Giants coming in as the No. 32 scoring offense in the league, Nabers essentially needs to command a 30-percent target share every week to be a WR1 option. We'll see what Daboll can do in terms of scheming up targets for Nabers next week, but Nabers' fantasy value has been in freefall as a part of the sinking ship that is the Giants' offense. WEEK 13 FANTASY FOOTBALL WAIVER WIRE ADVICEFull Waiver Wire List | FAAB Recommendations #Bears HC Matt Eberflus on Caleb Williams:“He’s growing in front of our eyes. And today was really good growth for him, to be able to go out there and execute the way he did” pic.twitter.com/7Xi8uYm6ft After a string of disappointing games through the middle part of the year, Caleb Williams has played some of the best football of his young career in the last two weeks. These two games have been narrow losses, but head coach Matt Eberflus has taken note of his development. Eberflus specifically noted Williams has shown growth in his ability to find space on the field and adjust the velocity of his passes in recent weeks. Key Fantasy Takeaway: Improved play from Caleb Williams has been critical for the fantasy value of Chicago's wide receivers, particularly DJ Moore and Keenan Allen. Both Moore and Allen eclipsed 23 PPR points last Sunday against the Vikings, with both setting season-highs in terms of their fantasy output. If Williams can continue to deliver quality balls to his receivers, they could emerge in the group of players you're comfortable starting every week in fantasy. #Broncos head coach Sean Payton on rookie WR Devaughn Vele:“Very quickly we’ve seen his growth. He’s got strong hands in traffic… he reminds me a lot of Marques Coltson.”“In our staff meeting 20 minutes ago I said we gotta continue to find touches for him” pic.twitter.com/m5gzfSVoNg Rookie wide receiver Devaughn Vele has been breaking out in recent weeks. In the Broncos' last two games, Vele has combined for 10 receptions and 146 yards on 14 targets. Sean Payton is well aware of his play in these games and was complimentary of Vele in Monday's press conference. He noted Vele's strong hands and even compared him to former Saints' receiver Marques Colston.  Key Fantasy Takeaway: Vele has not yet been elevated to a full-time role in the Broncos' offense, but he's drawing targets at a high rate, and now it's clear that it is a priority for this offense to get him the ball. Vele is a strong waiver wire pickup this week in hopes that his role continues to expand and he solidifies himself as the No. 2 option behind Courtland Sutton. #49ers QB Brock Purdy did some light throwing today without issue, according to Kyle Shanahan. He'll rest tomorrow and then see how it feels as the week goes on. The San Francisco 49ers have been rather cagey regarding the status of Brock Purdy's shoulder. There have been conflicting reports regarding his Week 13 availability, but at this point, we simply don't know if he'll play against the Bills. All we know is that Purdy is back on the field throwing in some capacity, and we'll get further updates later this week. Key Fantasy Takeaway: Having Brandon Allen under center was disastrous for the 49ers' offense last week. They posted their lowest yardage and point totals of the year, and George Kittle was the only 49er who delivered meaningful fantasy production. Against a talented Buffalo defense, it could be another week of disappointment for the 49ers' weapons if Allen is at the helm again. Purdy has been crucial to the fantasy success of the players in this offense, and it clearly showed last week while he was sidelined. Austin Ekeler's tests last night came back 'good', Dan Quinn said. But Ekeler will be in the concussion protocol. So, too, is Andrew Wylie. Brian Robinson is getting treatment for his ankle. Will know more later in the week. By the end of the game last Sunday, Jeremy McNichols was the only healthy running back in Washington. Brian Robinson left with an ankle injury while Austin Ekeler suffered a concussion. Head coach Dan Quinn noted that Ekeler's results were ""good"", but he's still in concussion protocol. Robinson will undergo treatment for his ankle, and his status for next week seems to be up in the air. Key Fantasy Takeaway: The Commanders' backfield has not had much stability this season. This is Ekeler's second time in concussion protocol, while Robinson has dealt with a litany of lower-body injuries. These injuries make McNichols a priority waiver target this week. There's a very real chance he operates in a featured role against the Titans, which would provide fantasy appeal for teams that lack RB depth.

However, the margin is razor thin. Washington now sits only half a game ahead of the Arizona Cardinals for the final Wild Card spot, and 1.5 games ahead of three formidable challengers in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers. With the 9-2 Minnesota Vikings and 8-3 Green Bay Packers all but locked into the first two Wild Card spots, it's going to come down to those five teams (along with the Seattle Seahawks and Atlanta Falcons, should they lose their respective division leads) for the last one. That means the Commanders can't afford to take any more losses like they had on Sunday. Their defeat at the hands of the 4-7 Cowboys was their first truly bad loss this season, and it needs to end up being their only one. Next week, the Commanders get another home matchup against a three-win team in the Tennessee Titans prior to their Week 14 bye. The Titans are riding some momentum after their own upset road win on Sunday, a 32-27 victory over the Houston Texans. That, combined with the Commanders' loss to Dallas, needs to be a wakeup call that no opponent can be taken lightly. Sunday is a must-win for Washington, and following their week off, they may need to go at least 3-1 against the New Orleans Saints, Philadelphia Eagles, Atlanta Falcons and Cowboys again to secure a playoff spot. It's very doable, but after Sunday, the Commanders are out of mulligans.  Ryan McCafferty is a die-hard sports fan from Fairfax, Virginia.

So when Marta lifted a long-awaited NWSL trophy this weekend, women's football united in the energy-emitting glow of the Brazilian GOAT. Marta has been named FIFA Women's Player of the Year six times and has won three Olympic silver medals. Her genuine love for the game and the freedom with which she plays have wowed and inspired people all over the world. The Brazilian is a special character and a generational talent, and here at Sporting News, with the dust settling on another breathless NWSL season, we are taking the chance to tip our cap to a legend and look back on some of Marta's most wholesome and awe-inspiring moments on and off the pitch. Marta grew up in an impoverished area of Brazil called Dois Riachos; she was one of four siblings born to a single mother. Now 38 years old, with eight years of playing in the US under her belt, it was only this weekend that Marta played a match on US soil with her mom in the crowd. Tereza travelled all the way to Kansas City from Brazil to watch her daughter play, and would prove to be the soccer legend's good luck charm. Marta finally had her hands on the much sought-after trophy with Orlando Pride. After full-time, Marta and her mother embraced, but the side-to-side shot perhaps illustrates the beauty of the moment best. Just look at what an #NWSL championship means to Marta and her mum, Tereza 🥹🇧🇷On Tereza's first trip to the USA to watch her daughter play, she claims her first championship after eight years of trying. Football 💜#NWSLChampionship pic.twitter.com/iEycuF8UT3 Touted as Marta's final World Cup, the 2023 Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand took on added significance for Marta and her nation, Brazil. Led by legendary Swedish head coach Pia Sundhage, who had just guided Brazil to victory in the Copa America 2022, expectations were high. Brazil were drawn into what seemed a simple group, and after a comfortable win against Panama, Brazil lost to France, meaning that only victory against Jamaica would take Brazil through to the knockout rounds. Marta's Brazil huffed and puffed, but they were unable to break through a stubborn Jamaican defence, and the match finished 0-0. Brazil were stunningly knocked out at the group stage for the first time since Marta laced up her boots for her country.  It was a crushing blow, and Marta was clearly devastated after the final whistle. While Marta exiting the World Cup was the big story, Jamaica had simultaneously become the first Caribbean team to make the Women's World Cup knockout stages after extensive disputes with the Jamaican FA over payment and funding, which at one point saw the team almost completely funded by Bob Marley's daughter Cedella Marley. After the game Marta approached Khadija 'Bunny' Shaw embracing her and congratulating the captain of the Reggae Girlz. When Shaw was asked what Marta had said to her responded ""She just said that she's watched our journey ever since we qualified, and she credits us because every time we got knocked down, we still get up and keep pushing.""   The 2007 World Cup was a seminal moment in women's football — more than anything, it represented the true arrival of one of the true greats onto the world stage. Marta had been featured at the World Cup four years earlier, where she had helped Brazil to the quarterfinals. But now she was a little more mature and was playing with a swagger, a street footballer-like magic that it seems only Brazilians have the ability to conjure up. Marta danced her way through to the semifinals with Brazil, where they would face the mighty  USA. To this day, the match is a sore spot for fans of the USWNT who may still lament head coach Greg Ryan's unexpected decision to bench Hope Solo in favour of Briana Scurry --- the famous goalkeeper for the ninety-niners who was perhaps at that stage past her best. Marta put on a show in China that night; her goals helped Brazil to a 4-0 win and a place in the World Cup final. Although defeated by Germany in the final, Marta won the Golden Ball, the Golden Boot and the hearts of millions the world over. Former England international Anita Asante recently penned a beautiful article for the BBC about her former roommate from her time playing for FC Rosengard, a certain Brazilian called Marta. Asante fondly remembers her time with Marta after joining her in Sweden in 2013, ""Marta is such a humble person. She definitely has an aura --- but she would never make anyone else feel she was higher than them. She didn't act like a superstar.""  The former Lioness also remembers Marta's penchant for bringing her guitar wherever she went, often whimsically playing and singing a tune to herself in Portuguese.  It is impossible to distil the essence of a legend into five moments. There are so many more that could have been included from Marta's UEFA Women's Champions League title for Umea IK to her player of the tournament performances at major tournament after major tournament. But part of her brilliance is her ability to inspire future generations without fail. After exiting the 2019 World Cup to hosts France, Marta gave a spine tingling call to arms for young women's footballers around the world. Staring into the camera Marta issued her rallying cry: ""It's wanting more. It's training more. It's taking care of yourself more. It's being ready to play 90 plus 30 minutes. This is what I ask of the girls. The women's game depends on you to survive, so think about that. Value it more. Cry in the beginning so you can smile in the end."" We have long known Marta as a champion, but Sunday confirmed her time in the NWSL would be complemented by more than one piece of silverware, so I will leave the final words that will warm the hearts of Marta fans everywhere, to the legend herself: “I’ve asked myself why I still play for Orlando after eight years, I’m the only player on this club since 2017. And I’ve had so many questions, but now I have the answer.”

Coming off back-to-back playoff appearances, Toronto fell well off the pace in the American League East last season, as the team's 74-88 record was good for dead last — 20 games behind the division-winning New York Yankees. However, the Blue Jays may still get one over on their divisional overlords this offseason. Bob Nightengale reports that Toronto remains one of ""only four teams that are seriously in play"" to sign the top free agent on the market: Yankees outfielder Juan Soto. Spotrac's market value for Soto points to a contract of fourteen years and north of $500 million. However, many insiders expect that dollar amount to be higher—perhaps much higher. According to multiple reports, Boras anticipates Soto landing a contract that exceeds the $700 million pact Shohei Ohtani inked with the Los Angeles Dodgers last winter.  Soto, who just turned 26, earned the fourth All-Star nod of his seven-year big-league career with the Yankees in 2024. He further enhanced his superb career numbers by batting .288 with 41 home runs, 109 RBI, and an American League-best 128 runs scored. His superstar abilities, combined with his young age, have big-market teams chomping at the bit to put him in their uniform for the long term. Nightengale names Toronto, the Yankees, the New York Mets, and the Boston Red Sox as the likely remaining contenders to acquire one of Major League Baseball's top players. However, Nightengale also sounds a word of caution that the Blue Jays ""would have to dramatically beat the Mets' offer to have a prayer"" of signing Soto.  Further complicating matters for Toronto is that it also has two superstar sluggers of their own — Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette — eligible for free agency a year from now.

After failing to acquire a pass rusher ahead of the trade deadline, the Falcons desperately need help next season. They surrendered a 2025 third round pick to the New England Patriots for Matthew Judon just before the start of the season, but he's basically been a non-factor thus far. Judon was expected to rejuvenate a dead Atlanta pass rush, but he's just continued their streak of being deceased. The Falcons have the least amount of sacks in the league with 10, as Judon actually leads the team with 2.5 along with Grady Jarrett. This is why Bleacher Report has Atlanta taking a flier on Chase Young in the offseason. The Falcons need pass-rushing help more than any other team in the NFL. They've recorded just 10 sacks through 11 games as a team and have seen no single defender record more than 2.5 sacks this season. Signing a premier pass-rusher, though, will be difficult. Atlanta is projected to be $8.6 million over the limit in terms of effective cap space. However, the Falcons might be able to pluck Chase Young away from the rival New Orleans Saints. The 2020 first-round pick signed a one-year ""prove-it"" deal with New Orleans in the offseason and has responded well. Thus far, he has recorded 3.5 sacks and 19 quarterback pressures. Chase won't completely solve their pass rush woes, but it would be a wise move for a struggling Atlanta defense looking for answers in this key area.

Sporting News RSS,Alyssa Naeher retires: Who will take over in goal for USWNT after USA women's legend bows out?,https://www.sportingnews.com/us/soccer/news/alyssa-naeher-retires-take-over-goal-uswnt-usa-womens-legend/0fc5468cd9dd73bb0bec9cdd,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 22:23:33 +0000","She may have returned the USWNT to the top of the global football hierarchy by winning the Olympic gold medal, but Emma Hayes has a significant new task on her hands as 2024 comes to a close.","Kyle Bonn She may have returned the USWNT to the top of the global football hierarchy by winning the Olympic gold medal, but Emma Hayes has a significant new task on her hands as the 2024 year comes to a close. The future of the goalkeeper position for the United States, a position of enormous strength over the decades, now faces uncertainty as 36-year-old legend Alyssa Naeher surprisingly announced her international retirement in late November. It came as a shock to USWNT fans as Naeher told the world she would hang up her international boots following upcoming friendlies against England and the Netherlands. Naeher's reveal was even more surprising given her NWSL club, the Chicago Red Stars, had just announced days prior that she would remain with the team for 2025 following a one-year extension of her contract. Now, as the calendar turns over and Emma Hayes looks towards the future, Naeher will add herself to the list of past USWNT greats like Hope Solo and Briana Scurry, while the team searches for the next great between the sticks. At 36, Alyssa Naeher retires as a legend of the international game. She made her debut in 2014 and upon her retirement, has logged 113 international caps with the potential for two more against England and the Netherlands. Naeher is the only goalkeeper in women's soccer history to keep a clean sheet in both the Women's World Cup final and an Olympic gold medal match, winning the World Cup title in 2015 and 2019 and a gold medal at the 2024 Olympics, plus the bronze in 2020. On an individual level, Naeher won NWSL Goalkeeper of the Year in 2014 and CONCACAF Goalkeeper of the Year in 2018. Thus, the former Penn State standout is one of the most decorated goalkeepers in the global game. We’re gonna miss watching Alyssa Naeher making big saves in clutch moments for the USWNT 🥹🇺🇸Congrats on retirement, Alyssa 🙌 pic.twitter.com/G7qQxWUiiu “Having the opportunity to be a part of the USWNT for the past 15 years has been the greatest honor,” said Naeher in the official press release. “When I began this journey, I never could have imagined where it would take me, and now I find myself so grateful for all the incredible teammates that I have shared the field with; teammates that have turned into lifelong friends. To all my teammates, coaches and staff, thank you all for pushing me, supporting me, and making me a better person/player every single day. A special thanks goes to my family. You have traveled all over the world and were in my corner every step of the way and I love you all. “This has been a special team to be a part of and I am beyond proud of what we have achieved both on and off the field. The memories I have made over the years will last me a lifetime. I know one chapter is ending, but I am so excited to continue to see the growth of this team going forward and what more they can accomplish.” The Sporting News looks over the top candidates to replace Naeher in goal for the foreseeable future. At 28, Casey Murphy has been the backup to Alyssa Naeher for quite some time now. During Vlatko Andonovski's tenure, the former USWNT head coach made a point to give Murphy time on the pitch, noting publicly on numerous occasions how important it was for Murphy to get time in the national team system should she need to be called upon in a competitive environment. Yet of her 20 international caps dating back to late 2021, Murphy has only been deployed in six competitive matches, and none at either a World Cup or Olympic games. She saw the field in the 2022 CONCACAF W Championship for three games and has made three other SheBelieves Cup appearances. A two-time Big 10 Goalkeeper of the Year with Rutgers and a two-time NWSL Challenge Cup winner with the NC Courage, Murphy probably has the inside track to secure the long-term spot for herself. Yet due to her relative international experience and a few talented younger possibilities on the radar, it's by no means a sure thing that Hayes will hand Murphy the job. Not listed on the November roster for the European matches, the USWNT coaching staff could be thinking elsewhere. 2024 has been a year of rising stock for 28-year-old Phallon Tullis-Joyce, who before now hadn't been on the USWNT radar. Then, two things happened to vault the former Miami Hurricane into contention for the long-term starting job with the national team. First, she moved to Manchester United in September of last year to back up Mary Earps. Then, the following summer, Earps departed for PSG. Now, Tullis-Joyce is the starter for a Women's Super League contender, which lands her squarely in Emma Hayes' sights. She's been fantastic in the job, conceding just three goals in her first eight games, and has earned her first international call-up for Naeher's European swansong in late November. She likely won't see the field with Naeher getting her final show, so can she impress enough in training to warrant future communications from Hayes? The youngest of the likely options for the immediate future, Mandy Haught has risen meteorically like the aforementioned Tullis-Joyce. Winning ACC Goalkeeper of the Year twice at Virginia Tech wasn't enough to vault her into the senior national team conversation with more experienced options available, but winning the NWSL championship last year with NJ/NY Gotham FC seemed to raise enough eyebrows. After moving to the Utah Royals this season and logging a strong xG differential on an attack-deficient team, which earned her a nomination for NWSL Goalkeeper of the Year (quite the feat for a keeper on a non-playoff team), she has finally been brought into the fold. After being called up for the first time in October and getting her first start in a clean sheet performance against Argentina, she's again been included for Naeher's swansong in Europe. A former four-year starter at a top collegiate program Stanford, Campbell was selected in 2017 by the Houston Dash and has been with the NWSL side ever since, winning the league's Goalkeeper of the Year award in 2023. She has been part of the senior national team picture since 2013 and won a bronze medal with the squad in 2020, but has only seen the field eight times, largely considered third-choice behind a mix of Alyssa Naeher, Ashlynn Harris, and Casey Murphy. With the Dash struggling to a last-place finish in the 2024 season, Campbell has fallen out of the picture, but could a seismic shift in the depth charge change things up? If Emma Hayes is looking for a younger player to mold for a longer-term solution to bring consistency to a position that has long belonged to just a few legendary players, she could turn to some young NWSL stars or even to the collegiate ranks. Beyond Haught and Campbell, the NWSL is somewhat devoid of American standout goalkeepers (German star Ann-Katrin Berger and England-born Anna Moorhouse were two of the three 2024 Goalkeeper of the Year nominees alongside Haught). Aubrey Kingsbury is the most obvious candidate, coming up just a game short of the NWSL title this season, but the former Wake Forest star is now 33 and has been behind many of the aforementioned names on the depth chart for years now. Bella Bixby of the Portland Thorns is also 29 without a USWNT senior call-up in her career. Claudia Dickey, still just 24, was a standout at UNC and has been on the fringes of the national team conversation, but her Seattle Reign conceded the most goals in the league this season. At the collegiate ranks, Mia Justus of Texas is the cousin of former USMNT standout Tim Howard and won a national championship as a backup with Florida State before transferring. She's long been a U.S. youth international and was named to the Mac Hermann Award watch list alongside Emily Puricelli, who has much less recognition at the U.S. youth level but was exceptional for St. Louis this season, logging a .861 save percentage and conceding just 11 goals in 23 games this year, putting her in the conversation for best in the nation.

They could target outfielders who can bring more power to their lineup.,"Aaliyan Mohammed The Philadelphia Phillies are expected to be aggressive this winter after a disappointing postseason in 2024. They could target outfielders who can bring more power to their lineup. While making offseason predictions, theScore predicted that the Phillies would sign Baltimore Orioles slugger Anthony Santander in free agency. ""He also inks Anthony Santander, whose 44 home runs last season matched the output of outfielders Nick Castellanos, Brandon Marsh, and Austin Hays,"" theScore wrote of Dave Dombrowski while predicting his many free agent moves. ""Santander has some warts, and the defensive fit isn't perfect with Castellanos and Kyle Schwarber also on the roster, but Philadelphia needs to add to the team to get the most out of a title window."" Santander hit 44 home runs in 2024 and was named an All-Star for the first time in his career. Spotrac projects him to sign a five-year, $88 million deal in free agency. He can play either of the corner outfield spots. The Phillies ranked 20th with a .610 OPS from center field last season. Signing Santander could allow them to move Brandon Marsh to center field full-time, allowing Santander to play left field. Even though Marsh struggled at the end of the year, he would still be an upgrade in center field. Adding Santander would ultimately give them three outfielders they can rely on every day. The Phillies ranked 22nd in home runs from the right side of the plate. Santander is a switch hitter but could bring some power from that side of the dish. He hit 12 of his home runs as a right-handed hitter last year.

The injury report was an estimation, as the Lions only held a walkthrough. The six players who did not take part are cornerback Carlton Davis (knee, thumb), left tackle Taylor Decker (knee), running back David Montgomery (shoulder), wide receiver Kalif Raymond (foot), defensive lineman D.J. Reader (illness) and wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown (knee). The only player listed on the initial injury report as a full participant was cornerback Terrion Arnold (groin), who missed the Week 12 game against the Indianapolis Colts. The estimated full session puts Arnold on track to return in Week 13. After practice, head coach Dan Campbell addressed the media and revealed that of those aforementioned six players, Decker, Davis and Raymond have a chance to sit out the Thanksgiving contest against Chicago. Dan Campbell says there may be three of the guys listed below who could miss this week: Decker, Davis, Raymond.Says St. Brown is a little banged up, too. https://t.co/Gak7b9Q1ho St. Brown was the only real surprise on the injury report, but knowing how tough he is, it would take an act of God to prevent him from playing. ""Saint is a little banged up,"" Campbell said. ""We'll see how he recovers."" Campbell also noted  he doesn't think most of the injuries will be long-term issues. After the game on Sunday, Campbell said Raymond was likely to miss time. Raymond, Davis, Decker and Montgomery all exited Sunday's contest due to injury, but Decker was able to return to the game. Montgomery said he could have returned but was held out as a precaution and he expects to suit up on Thursday. Decker was also positive about his outlook.

The Cardinals and Seahawks are both 6-5 (Seattle holds the tiebreaker) while the Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers are right behind at 5-6. There's still time for the Cardinals to make a playoff push, but there's a way they can ensure this close of a battle doesn't happen next year. Bleacher Report has the Cardinals going out and signing Kansas City Chiefs guard Trey Smith in the offseason to protect Kyler Murray. Arizona is projected to have $98 million in effective cap space next offseason, which means general manager Monti Ossenfort can splurge. He should take a long look at Kansas City Chiefs guard Trey Smith, the second-ranked player on the Bleacher Report 2025 free agent board. Smith has become a strong foundational piece of the Chiefs offense and a catalyst in the ground game. He could do the same for Arizona, which is establishing itself as a run-first team.

 STREAM:USMNT and USWNT international friendlies LIVE on Sling Hayes, a London-born coaching great who led Chelsea for years before joining U.S. Soccer less than a year ago, will take charge of two post-Thanksgiving matches starting with one in her home city. The Sporting News brings you all the info regarding the absence of the famed attacking trio as well as the fresh faces in the squad. MORE: USWNT schedule, results, highlights from matches across 2024 year Emma Hayes has called in 22 players to the U.S. women's national team squad to play England and The Netherlands in early December. There are a host of new faces thanks to the absence of a few key veterans, but captain Lindsey Horan still provides a veteran presence alongside Rose Lavelle and Naomi Girma. Goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher will make her final appearances for the USWNT in these fixtures, as she will retire from international duty after the two games. MORE: Why Lily Yohannes committed to the United States over the Netherlands The trio of USWNT attacking stars, Mallory Swanson, Trinity Rodman, and Sophia Smith are all absent from the roster for December fixtures against England and the Netherlands. Nicknamed ""Triple Espresso,"" the three world-class forwards are all dealing with ""nagging injuries"" according to U.S. Soccer, and were thus rested for this month to give them a full offseason. Rodman's injury is most well-documented, as she missed the previous trio of friendlies against Iceland and Argentina due to a back problem suffered while on club duty with Washington Spirit. She returned for club matches at the end of the NWSL regular season and playoffs, but has been given a chance to rest. Injuries to Sophia Smith and Mallory Swanson are less clear. Swanson missed a year due to a serious knee injury that kept her out of the 2023 Women's World Cup, and could be feeling the effects of wear and tear following her return. Smith, meanwhile, missed matches in September and October due to an ankle injury, and maybe has been rested due to lingering effects of such. Given the team's careful dancing around nagging injuries, it's a bit surprising that Rose Lavelle is included on the roster. The 29-year-old has dealt with a lingering knee complaint for the past few years and may have been keen to get some additional rest. Also still missing is Cat Macario, who remains less than 100% in her slow but steady recovery from an ACL tear. New Chelsea head coach Sonia Bompastor said in October that Macario was still working her way back from this exceedingly long injury issue, even though she has been a consistent option off the bench. However, Emma Hayes confirmed that both Macario and Mia Fishel, who is out with a torn ACL, are invited to the team's Thanksgiving dinner they will hold in England before the friendly. Thanks to the absences on the USWNT roster this December, a number of unfamiliar faces dot the roster. In for the first time since confirming her USWNT commitment is 17-year-old Lily Yohannes, who affirmed her decision to represent the United States back in early November. Uncapped players on the roster this international break include Manchester United goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce and Utah Royals forward Ally Sentnor. 28-year-old Tullis-Joyce, who hails from New York City and played collegiately for Miami, has been the Red Devils starter this season after Mary Earps departed for PSG. Sentnor, meanwhile, was the No. 1 overall draft pick by the Utah Royals a year ago out of North Carolina, scoring three goals and assisting four others in her first NWSL season. Alyssa Thompson is also back for another international camp after grabbing her first USWNT goal against Iceland last month, and left-back Alyssa Malonson hopes to earn her second cap after making her debut against Argentina in October. The two December friendlies for the USWNT will both be contested abroad, with a game against England at Wembley Stadium first on Saturday, November 30 followed by the match against the Netherlands three days later in The Hague. Both games will be televised in the English on TNT, with the England match also on truTV. Both channels are available to stream on Sling as well as Turner's dedicated platform Max. In Spanish, the two matches will also be televised on Universo and Telemundo. Those two channels are available to stream on Fubo, who are offering a free trial for new users. The games are also available to stream on NBC's dedicated platform Peacock.

Montverde Academy (FL) (2-0 – 2nd last week)The new-look Eagles opened the season with a 75-69 victory over Purcell Marian and cruised past Magnificat before departing Ohio. With Etiwanda going down, bumping the three-time defending Chipotle Nationals champion up to No. 1 was a fairly easy decision.  Ontario Christian (CA) (3-0 – 4th)More surprising than Ontario Christian’s upset over Etiwanda is the fact that plenty of scouts and media are still barely catching on to the Knights as national title heavyweights. Especially now that long-awaited freshmen Sydney Douglas and Tatianna Griffin have officially begun their high school careers – and are as good as promised. Douglas had 23 points, eight rebounds, and two blocks on 9-12 shooting in the 74-66 win against Etiwanda while Griffin registered a double-double.  Etiwanda (CA) (2-1 – 1st)The loss to Ontario Christian is Etiwanda’s first against a California opponent since before the 2023 state playoffs. But it was close, and there’s no need to sound the alarm – thanks largely to a second-half surge to make it close led by Grace Knox (30 points, 10 rebounds). It’s early, and Etiwanda will likely get cracks at Ontario Christian three months from now when championships are on the line. Before the loss, the Eagles posted statement wins against Corona Centennial and Sage Hill.  Princess Anne (VA) (0-0 – Bubble)Princess Anne was the last team left out of the top 25 in our preseason rankings, so they got first dibs on Legion Prep’s spot despite being yet to tip off. Fittingly, they Cavaliers are less than two weeks out from battling Thomas Dale, ranked one spot higher, for status as Virginia’s top team.Teams on the bubble:Boswell (TX)Centennial (NV)Clovis West (CA)DME Academy (FL)Loyola Academy (IL)Millard West (NE)Princess Anne (VA)Putnam City North (OK)St. Francis (GA)Whitney Young (IL)Winter Haven (FL) Lance has covered high school basketball, football and softball since 2019.

Now imagine turning that adrenaline rush into a profitable moment with in-play betting. This isn’t some mystical art reserved for seasoned gamblers; it’s a game-changer for anyone who knows football like the back of their hand. Buckle up, because you’re about to learn how to turn those live matches into serious cash with some insider hacks. First things first: ditch the pre-match bets if you want control. Pre-match betting is like throwing darts in the dark—sure, you might hit the bullseye, but it’s pure luck once the whistle blows. In-play betting, on the other hand, lets you react to real-time action. Is the underdog suddenly dominating possession? Is a star striker limping after a bad tackle? These are your golden nuggets of opportunity. Observing these micro-moments is where you gain an edge. One of my favorite hacks? Watch the live stats like a hawk. You don’t even need to be glued to the TV to spot opportunities. Possession stats climbing for a certain team? Shots on target piling up? A goal is brewing, my friend, and the odds might still be lagging behind. Jump on that next-goal market before the bookmakers catch up. Betting in real-time is like surfing—you ride the wave before it crashes. But here’s a truth bomb: emotions are your worst enemy. The moment you let a team’s colors or your undying loyalty cloud your judgment, you’re toast. Remember last season when your heart said Manchester United was going to turn it around against Brentford, but they were already 3-0 down at halftime? Yeah, that’s a mistake that cost thousands of fans money. Betting is about being cold, calculated, and ruthless. Forget your favorite team—your wallet doesn’t care about allegiances. Another killer strategy is to exploit the chaos. Injuries, red cards, and sudden momentum shifts are pure gold in in-play betting. For example, a red card changes everything. Suddenly, a team that was dominating might be scrambling to defend with ten men. This is your window to back the underdog or bet on fewer goals being scored. These moments are when the odds swing wildly, and quick decisions can net you big wins. Timing is everything. Bookmakers are quick, but they’re not perfect. Odds fluctuate in real time, and there’s often a brief delay before they adjust to a game-changing event. That delay is where savvy bettors pounce. If you can predict the shift—say, a star striker lining up for a free kick—you’ll lock in odds before they nosedive. Don’t ignore cash-out options either. Some people treat cash-out like a dirty word, but it’s a lifesaver when used right. Imagine you’ve bet on a team to win, and they’re up 2-1 in the 85th minute. The game’s heating up, and the opposition is pressing hard. Taking a cash-out here might save you from heartbreak (and an empty wallet) if the game ends in a draw. One more thing: know your limits. It’s easy to get sucked into the constant action of in-play betting. Every moment feels like it could be “the one,” but chasing losses or overloading on bets is a surefire way to crash and burn. Set a budget, stick to it, and don’t treat betting like a get-rich-quick scheme. Treat it like a calculated game of strategy, and you’ll keep your head above water. The beauty of in-play football betting is that it rewards those who know the game. It’s not about luck; it’s about being smarter, faster, and more analytical than the bookies. Whether you’re watching from the comfort of your couch or refreshing live stats on your phone, every match offers a hundred opportunities to profit. The only question is: are you ready to make every match a payday?"

The Premier League is like a treasure chest of potential winnings, but it’s also a minefield for anyone who dives in unprepared. You’ve probably heard the tales: the friend of a friend who turned a tenner into a few thousand on an outrageous accumulator, or the guy down the pub who “nearly” hit it big. For every win, there are countless losses, and if you’re not careful, you’ll end up as a statistic instead of a success story. First up, the do’s. Always—and I mean always—do your homework. Blindly betting on your favorite team is a rookie mistake that even seasoned bettors admit making early on. Sure, your loyalty to Manchester United might run deep, but if they’re up against a red-hot Arsenal side on a winning streak, you’ve got to put your emotions in a box and think like a strategist. Look at team form, injuries, head-to-head history, and even weather conditions. Yes, a slippery pitch can change everything when it comes to a fast-paced game like this. Another “do” is to shop around for the best odds. Bookies aren’t all created equal, and the difference between 3/1 and 5/1 might seem small, but over time, it can make or break your betting bankroll. Use odds comparison tools or keep tabs on multiple platforms. You wouldn’t buy a car without comparing prices—betting deserves the same attention. And speaking of bankroll, set one. It’s all too easy to keep chasing losses, throwing good money after bad. Decide how much you’re willing to lose before you start, and stick to it like glue. Now, let’s talk about the don’ts. Don’t let emotions cloud your judgment. Betting while angry after your team’s last-minute loss or overly excited because you’ve had a great week at work is a recipe for disaster. Betting should be cold, calculated, and clinical—not a reflection of your mood. And for heaven’s sake, don’t fall for the “sure thing” trap. Anytime someone promises a guaranteed win, run the other way. Upsets are as much a part of the Premier League as VAR controversies and dramatic stoppage-time goals. Betting is about probability, not certainty. One big “don’t” is to ignore smaller markets. Everyone flocks to bets like “who will win” or “first goalscorer,” but there’s value hiding in plain sight. Corners, yellow cards, and even the time of the first goal can be goldmines for those willing to dig. These markets are often less scrutinized by bookies, meaning there’s a better chance for savvy bettors to spot a weak line. Now, about the profits. Winning big on Premiership betting requires a mix of strategy and discipline. Accumulators, for instance, are tempting with their promise of massive payouts, but they’re also notoriously difficult to land. If you’re a thrill-seeker, limit your accas to smaller stakes while focusing the bulk of your bankroll on singles or doubles, where your odds of winning are much higher. Value betting is another key to profits—look for odds that don’t reflect the true probability of an event. Spotting these opportunities takes time and experience, but when you do, it’s like finding a hidden gem in the chaos of weekly fixtures. Live betting is another way to up your game, but it requires sharp instincts. Watching how a match unfolds in real-time can reveal opportunities you wouldn’t have considered before kickoff. For example, if a team’s star player goes off injured early, the dynamic changes instantly, and betting markets don’t always adjust quickly enough. The Premier League is as unpredictable as ever, which is exactly why betting on it is so exhilarating. But it’s not a free-for-all. Success comes down to discipline, research, and knowing when to walk away. Treat it like a game of chess, not roulette, and you’ll be on your way to turning your football knowledge into actual cash. And remember, the best bettors aren’t just lucky—they’re relentless in their pursuit of an edge. Are you ready to find yours?"
Sports Weez,How to Spot the Best Value Bets in Football,https://sportsweez.com/how-to-spot-the-best-value-bets-in-football/,"Sat, 23 Nov 2024 12:48:56 +0000","When it comes to football betting, there’s one golden rule: don’t chase wins, chase value.

The difference between casual punters and those who consistently come out on top lies in their ability to spot value bets. These aren’t just “good odds” or wagers that seem like sure things—they’re bets where the odds offered by the bookmaker are higher than the true probability of the outcome. It’s not about gambling; it’s about finding an edge. So, how do you do it? Buckle up, because we’re about to dive into the nitty-gritty of value betting. Let’s start with the basics. A value bet exists when the implied probability of the bookmaker’s odds is lower than your estimated probability for an event. Say you’re betting on a match between Manchester City and West Ham. The bookie might offer 2.00 (evens) for a City win, implying a 50% probability. But you’ve done your homework, analyzed form, injuries, and head-to-head stats, and believe City’s actual chances of winning are closer to 65%. That’s a value bet staring you in the face, and it’s time to pounce. Homework is everything. Forget betting with your heart—this is science. Analyze recent performances, and don’t just focus on flashy scorelines. A team may have won their last three games, but if they’ve scraped through with late goals or were dominated in possession, the stats may paint a very different picture. Injuries, suspensions, and even travel schedules can tilt the scales dramatically, too. Football betting isn’t about hunches; it’s about data. Odds comparison tools are your new best friend. Bookmakers aren’t charitable organizations—they set odds to turn a profit. But not every bookmaker sees the game the same way. A bet that’s undervalued on one site might be a steal on another. By comparing odds across platforms, you can spot discrepancies that translate into value. It takes a bit of legwork, but when you see that one oddsmaker is offering 3.50 while the rest are at 3.20, you know where your money should go. Now, let’s talk implied probability. To calculate it, divide 1 by the decimal odds and multiply by 100. For example, odds of 2.50 imply a 40% chance of that event happening (1 ÷ 2.50 × 100 = 40). Once you’ve worked out the bookmaker’s implied probability, compare it to your assessment of the event. If your probability is higher, you’ve found value. If it’s lower, move on. This step separates pros from amateurs—it’s not glamorous, but it’s the cornerstone of consistent wins. Live betting is another playground for value hunters. Watching a match unfold gives you insights that static stats can’t. Maybe the favorite looks shaky under pressure, or an underdog is dominating the midfield. Bookmakers adjust live odds quickly, but not always accurately. If you’ve got a sharp eye and a quick trigger finger, you can exploit these moments for significant gains. Avoid the “trap” bets that bookies lay out like candy. Over hyped teams and popular bets often come with inflated odds because bookmakers know the masses will back them anyway. You’re not here to bet on the popular pick—you’re here to bet smart. If a line feels too good to be true, dig deeper. It might be a sign that the value lies elsewhere, like an underdog team quietly outperforming expectations. One thing that separates the serious bettor from the dreamer is discipline. Not every match has value, and that’s okay. Some weeks, you’ll scan the fixture list and find nothing worth your money. That’s the game. The key is to stick to your strategy, even if it means sitting on the sidelines while everyone else chases flashy accumulators and “guaranteed” wins. Value betting isn’t a sprint—it’s a marathon. You’re not here for quick hits; you’re here to build long-term success. Some bets will lose even when you’ve done everything right, but over time, the math works in your favor. It’s like fishing: you might not catch anything every time, but if you’ve got the best bait in the right spot, the big one will eventually bite. If there’s one takeaway here, it’s this: football betting isn’t about who wins or loses. It’s about identifying opportunities where the odds are in your favor and capitalizing on them. Anyone can place a bet, but spotting value? That’s the art and science that turns betting from a gamble into a strategy. So the next time you’re browsing odds for the weekend’s matches, don’t ask yourself, “Who’s going to win?” Instead, ask, “Where’s the value?"

Betting live during a match isn’t just about reacting to what’s happening—it’s about spotting patterns, reading the flow, and seizing opportunities before the odds adjust. Let’s break down the best in-play football bets that can seriously tilt the odds in your favor and help you walk away with a heavier wallet. First, let’s talk about next-goal markets. These are pure gold when you’ve got an eye for momentum shifts. Imagine this: the underdog suddenly takes control of possession, forcing a string of corners. You can feel a goal coming, but the bookmakers haven’t caught on yet. Betting on that next goal for the dominant team is one of the smartest moves you can make. Even better? If you’re watching live, those tiny details—a frustrated defense, a star player in form—give you an edge no algorithm can match. Another killer bet is the over/under goals market. This one’s especially profitable when the first half is a snooze fest. A slow first half often means the odds for over 1.5 or 2.5 goals shoot up. But here’s the thing: football is unpredictable, and the second half is where teams throw caution to the wind. Managers make aggressive substitutions, players get tired, and the goals start pouring in. Betting on more goals after a quiet start is a calculated risk that often pays off big. Now, let’s talk corners. Total corners bets are wildly overlooked, but they’re perfect for live betting. Watching a match and seeing relentless attacks or scrappy defending? Corners are bound to pile up. Keep an eye on attacking teams that like to take their chances from wide areas; they’ll rack up corners quickly. The same goes for underdog teams parking the bus—shots may get deflected for corners, creating a betting bonanza. Then there’s the drama of red cards. This is where quick reactions pay off. The moment a team loses a player to a red card, everything changes. Suddenly, the opposing team is in control, and goals could be on the horizon. Betting on a goal for the team with an advantage—or fewer goals overall if the leading team goes defensive—can be a jackpot. Red cards are chaos, and chaos is where you thrive in in-play betting. Don’t ignore both teams to score (BTTS), either. This market thrives on games that are end-to-end battles. Maybe the score is 1-1 in the 60th minute, and both teams are pressing hard. Odds for BTTS could still be decent if a third goal hasn’t landed yet. Watch for teams with leaky defenses and aggressive tactics—those matches scream goals on both sides. Now, for a sneaky one: cash-out strategies. Cash-out isn’t technically a bet, but it’s an art in live betting. Let’s say you’ve backed a team to win, and they’re leading 2-1 with ten minutes to go. The other side is attacking like their lives depend on it. That cash-out button? It’s your safety net. Taking the cash-out at the right moment can save you from last-minute heartbreak, especially in unpredictable leagues. Substitutions are another underutilized clue in in-play betting. Say the match is level, and a team brings on a star striker in the final 20 minutes. That’s your signal to look at markets like next goalscorer or the next team to score. Substitutions can shift the dynamic in seconds, and those who react fastest make the most profit. Finally, remember the timing of bets. Bookmakers are quick, but they aren’t flawless. Odds take a moment to update after a big event like a goal, red card, or even a VAR check. These windows, while small, are where you can exploit outdated odds. For example, a penalty awarded but not yet taken? The odds for a goal are still climbing while you lock in your bet. The beauty of in-play football betting is that it rewards sharp minds and quick fingers. You don’t need to be a mathematician; you just need to know the game and trust your instincts. By targeting next-goal markets, exploiting red card chaos, and watching for tactical shifts, you’ll put yourself in the driver’s seat. And while no bet is ever truly guaranteed, with these strategies, you’ll feel like you’ve got the upper hand every time the referee blows the whistle."

If you’re tired of leaving your wagers to chance, it’s time to sharpen your approach with some smart tips for betting on sports and beating the odds. Let’s dive into the tips for betting on sports that can transform your bets into a more calculated and profitable endeavor. First things first: knowledge is power. Betting blindly on your favorite team because you’re emotionally invested is a recipe for disaster. You need to approach every bet with cold, hard logic. Start by researching the teams, players, and stats. Look at recent form, head-to-head records, injuries, and even the weather if it’s a factor. A bettor armed with data is far more dangerous than one relying on gut feelings. Speaking of odds, always shop around. Different bookmakers offer varying odds for the same events, and those slight differences can add up over time. Use odds comparison websites to find the best value for your bets. Remember, your goal is to get the most return for the risk you’re taking. Never settle for less when better odds are just a click away. Bankroll management is the cornerstone of smart sports betting. Set aside a specific amount of money for betting, and never exceed it. A good rule of thumb is to wager no more than 1-5% of your bankroll on a single bet. This strategy ensures you can weather losing streaks without going broke. Treat your bankroll like an investment fund—guard it with discipline and never bet impulsively. Avoid chasing losses. It’s easy to let frustration dictate your decisions after a string of bad bets. But doubling down in an attempt to recoup losses often leads to bigger mistakes. Stick to your strategy, and remember that sports betting is a marathon, not a sprint. Consistency is what builds long-term success. Diversify your bets. Sure, single bets on match outcomes are straightforward, but they’re not the only game in town. Explore other markets like over/under goals, player props, or handicap betting. These options can provide better value, especially in games where the outcome seems too close to call. And if you’re feeling adventurous, accumulators can offer big payouts—just remember, they’re high-risk and require all selections to hit. Live betting is another arena where smart bettors can gain an edge. Watching a game unfold in real time gives you insights that pre-match stats can’t provide. You might notice a team dominating possession or a key player struggling with form. Use this information to make more informed in-play bets. Just be cautious—live betting moves fast, so stay focused and avoid impulsive decisions. Know when to walk away. Sometimes, the smartest bet is the one you don’t place. If the odds don’t offer value, or if you’re unsure about an event, it’s better to pass. There’s always another game, another opportunity. Forcing bets out of boredom or desperation is a surefire way to drain your bankroll. Stay informed about promotions and bonuses. Many bookmakers offer free bets, enhanced odds, or cashback deals, especially for new customers. While these offers can’t guarantee wins, they’re great for reducing risk or increasing potential returns. Just make sure to read the terms and conditions—hidden restrictions can limit your ability to profit. Finally, keep your emotions in check. Betting is exciting, but it can also be frustrating when things don’t go your way. Remember, even the smartest punters don’t win every time. Success comes from sticking to your strategy, staying disciplined, and learning from both wins and losses. Betting on sports should be fun, but it’s also a test of patience and resilience. Smart sports betting isn’t about making reckless wagers in the heat of the moment. It’s about playing the long game, finding value, and managing your bankroll wisely. With these tips, you’ll be better equipped to beat the odds and enjoy the thrill of betting with a sharper edge."

Odds aren’t just random numbers—they reflect the bookmaker’s assessment of the likelihood of an outcome, while also determining how much you stand to win. Whether you’re a casual bettor or aiming to turn a profit, knowing how to read and calculate payouts from odds can give you a significant edge. Let’s break it all down. Betting odds serve two purposes: they indicate the probability of an event happening and determine the payout you’ll receive if your bet wins. Different regions and platforms use different formats for odds, but the underlying principle remains the same. The three most common odds formats are: To calculate profit with decimal odds, use this formula:
Profit = (Odds x Stake) – Stake Odds also reflect implied probability, which is how likely a bookmaker thinks an outcome is. The lower the odds, the higher the perceived probability. For example: To calculate implied probability, use these formulas: For example: Bookmakers often build a margin (called the overround) into the odds to ensure they profit regardless of the outcome. This means the combined implied probabilities for all outcomes in a market will usually exceed 100%. Calculating your payout is crucial for managing your bets and spotting value. Here’s how to calculate total return and profit for each odds format: Understanding odds isn’t just about payouts; it’s also about spotting value. A value bet occurs when you believe an outcome is more likely than the odds suggest. For example, if a bookmaker offers odds of 3.00 (33.33% implied probability) on a team you estimate has a 50% chance of winning, that’s a value bet. Mastering how odds work and calculating payouts is essential for smart betting. Whether you’re using fractional, decimal, or American odds, the principles remain the same: understand the implied probability, calculate your potential return, and look for value. Armed with this knowledge, you’ll have a clearer path to smarter, more strategic wagers."

<h1>Buffalo Sabres Overcome Anaheim Ducks in Tense Overtime Clash</h1>
<p>Friday night's NHL showdown saw <a href=""https://21sports.com/thrilling-shootout-victory-sabres-douse-flames-in-nhl-showdown/"">Buffalo Sabres</a>' Jiri Kulich steal the show, scoring an eleventh-hour goal with just under a minute left in overtime. This saw the Sabres rally back from trailing by two goals to clinch a 3-2 victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/thrilling-third-period-surge-propels-anaheim-ducks-to-victory-over-chicago-blackhawks/"">Anaheim Ducks</a>.</p>
<h2>Anaheim Ducks' Winning Streak Snapped by Buffalo Sabres</h2>
<p>Kulich's crucial rebound shot, off an initial attempt by Sabres' defenseman Owen Power, found the top right corner of the net. This was Kulich's second goal of the season, marking a pivotal moment that ended the Ducks' three-game winning spree. Peyton Krebs and Jason Zucker, who are both in good form, also marked their names on the scoresheet for Buffalo, contributing to their second consecutive victory and their third in the last four games.</p>
<p>Power, who aided with two assists, along with goalie Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen's 23 saves, played a significant role in the Sabres' win. In contrast, Drew Helleson and Isac Lundestrom were the goal scorers for Anaheim, with their goalie, John Gibson, managing to block 31 shots.</p>
<h2>Buffalo Sabres and Anaheim Ducks: Key Players and Moments</h2>
<p>In the Sabres' camp, center Tage Thompson, leading the team with 11 goals and 18 points, missed his fourth consecutive game owing to a lower-body injury. However, Coach Lindy Ruff is optimistic about Thompson's return in their upcoming game against San Jose on Saturday.</p>
<p>For the Ducks, Trevor Zegras has been on a roll, tallying three assists in the last two games. A crucial turning point came when Krebs and Zucker netted two goals within a span of 50 seconds towards the end of the second period, leveling the game at 2-2. This marked the sixth instance of Buffalo scoring twice within a minute.</p>
<p>Zucker, who scored the equalizer with just 33 seconds left, now has goals in two successive games. Alex Tuch, who assisted Krebs’ goal, has managed to register points in five consecutive games, including a goal and six assists.</p>
<h3>Key Statistics and What's Next?</h3>
<p>Despite their win, Buffalo saw their seven-game power-play goal streak come to an end, which was the longest of any team this season. In terms of what's next, the Sabres are set to visit San Jose on Saturday, while the Ducks are due to host Seattle on Monday.</p>

<h1>Zary Seals Flames' Triumph, Rangers Suffer Second Road Loss</h1>
<p>On a thrilling Thursday night, the <a href=""https://21sports.com/dustin-wolf-shines-bright-flames-edge-predators-in-a-goalkeepers-duel/"">Calgary Flames</a> clinched a 3-2 victory over the New York Rangers, thanks to Connor Zary's crucial goal in the third period. <a href=""https://21sports.com/calgarys-flames-ignite-in-overtime-coronato-leads-to-3-2-victory-over-canadiens/"">Matt Coronato</a> and Yegor Sharangovich contributed significantly with each adding a goal and an assist to the Flames' tally. MacKenzie Weegar demonstrated some impressive playmaking skills with three assists.</p>
<h2>Jonathan Huberdeau Achieves Milestone, Dustin Wolf Shines Between the Pipes</h2>
<p>Jonathan Huberdeau, another star for the Flames, hit a significant milestone by bagging his 500th career assist. In the net, Dustin Wolf stood tall, blocking 27 shots, marking his third consecutive victory.</p>
<p>For the Rangers, Alexis Lafreniere and Will Cuylle found the back of the net in a quick succession of just 16 seconds in the second period. Despite the loss, it's worth noting that this is only the second road game the Rangers have lost this season. Goalie Igor Shesterkin remained resilient, saving 46 shots.</p>
<h3>Key Play: Zary's Game-Changing Goal</h3>
<p>The game-changing moment came at 10:34 of the third period when Zary, who had been active on the ice throughout the game, shrugged off a challenge from Kaapo Kakko. He managed to lift the puck over Shesterkin, scoring what would be the game-winning goal.</p>
<h2>Takeaways from the Game</h2>
<p>The Flames showcased their best first period of the season, outshooting the Rangers 20-5. Despite this, they held only a slim one-goal lead heading into the second period. Their power play, which had been lackluster in November, came alive and produced an essential goal for the second game in a row.</p>
<p>The Rangers, on the other hand, relied heavily on their goalkeeper Shesterkin to keep them in the game. Their progress was hindered by four penalties within the first 29 minutes, stalling their momentum.</p>
<h3>Breaking Down the Numbers</h3>
<p>The Flames achieved a feat of 20-plus shots in the first period for the first time since October 25, 2022, when they registered a similar number against Pittsburgh.</p>
<h2>What's Next for Flames and Rangers?</h2>
<p>The Flames will be looking to continue their winning streak at home against the Minnesota Wild on Saturday. The Rangers will conclude their four-game road trip on the same day, facing off against the Edmonton Oilers.</p>

Craig Smith and Nick Foligno also inked their names on the scoreboard, enabling Chicago to halt a hat-trick of consecutive losses. This victory also bolstered their home record to 3-5-0 for the season.</p>
<h2>Mrazek's Impressive Return to Lineup</h2>

<h2>Teravainen's Power-Play Goal Sets the Tone</h2>
<p>Teravainen set the Blackhawks on the path to victory with an early power-play goal, just 2:46 into the opening period. This marked only his second goal in his recent 17 appearances.

<h2>Blackhawks' Resilient Response</h2>
<p>Blackhawks' coach Luke Richardson was on the lookout for a more spirited performance from his team following their capitulation of a 2-1 lead in the third period against the Ducks. His team did not disappoint, presenting a resilient front, particularly in the game's final stages.</p>
<h3>Key Moment of the Game</h3>
<p>A noteworthy moment of the game came when Blackhawks' defenseman Wyatt Kaiser was benched for delay of game 12:22 into the third period. Despite this setback, the Blackhawks successfully killed off the penalty, rendering the Panthers' power-play opportunities futile.</p>

<h1>St. Louis Blues Snatch Victory from Sharks, Putting an End to Home Losing Streak</h1>
<p>Jake Neighbours emerged as the shootout star, while Jordan Binnington defied all three attempts by the <a href=""https://21sports.com/robertson-shines-bright-as-dallas-stars-overpower-san-jose-sharks/"">San Jose Sharks</a>, leading the <a href=""https://21sports.com/st-louis-blues-triumph-over-tampa-bay-lightning-in-thrilling-ice-showdown/"">St. Louis Blues</a> to a 3-2 triumph on Thursday night. This win ended a four-game home losing streak for the Blues. Binnington displayed resilience by bouncing back from Alexander Wennberg's equalizing goal with only 8.8 seconds remaining, securing his 151st career victory. This tied him with Mike Liut's franchise record.</p>
<h2>Standout Performances</h2>
<p>Wennberg was the lone double-goalscorer for the Sharks, with Mikael Granlund and <a href=""https://21sports.com/macklin-celebrinis-overtime-goal-fuels-san-jose-sharks-victory-over-detroit-red-wings/"">Macklin Celebrini</a>, the 2024 NHL draft's top pick, providing assists for both goals. For the Blues, Jordan Kyrou and Nathan Walker found the back of the net during regulation time. This marked only the second victory in their last nine matches.</p>
<p>Walker's goal came just 11 seconds into the game, thanks to Radek Faksa's interception of a pass from Sharks' goalie Yaroslav Askarov. Later, Kyrou, positioned between Granlund and Timothy Liljegren, nudged home a pass from Pierre-Olivier Joseph for his sixth goal of the season, with 8:13 remaining in the second.</p>
<h2>Goalkeeper Highlights</h2>
<p>Binnington held the fort with 22 saves, contributing significantly to the Blues' victory, while Askarov managed 29 saves.</p>
<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<p>The Sharks, who have been outscored 28-10 in the season's first period, struggled from the onset, despite netting a first-period goal for the third consecutive game. On the other hand, Binnington, with 295 games under his belt, stands second among goalies in Blues' franchise history. He reached the 151-win milestone in 56 fewer games than Liut, whose record from 1979-1985 stood at 151-133, with 52 ties.</p>
<h3>Game-Changing Moment</h3>
<p>Neighbours played the hero, delivering the shootout victory with a wrist shot that outsmarted Askarov on his glove side.</p>
<h3>Key Statistics</h3>
<p>The Blues have been outscored 14-2 in the third period across their last seven games.</p>
<h3>What's Next?</h3>
<p>The Blues are set to play seven out of their next eight games on the road, commencing Saturday against the New York Islanders. The Sharks, on the other hand, will start a four-game homestand against Buffalo the same day.</p>

<h1>Werenski's Overtime Goal Brings Columbus Blue Jackets a Remarkable Comeback Victory</h1>
<p>Zach Werenski's masterstroke at 1:25 of the overtime session marked the climax of a thrilling game as the <a href=""https://21sports.com/los-angeles-kings-emerge-victorious-in-dominant-performance-against-columbus-blue-jackets/"">Columbus Blue Jackets</a> overcame a three-goal deficit to triumph over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/vasilevskiy-shines-with-stellar-saves-as-lightning-strike-devils-4-0/"">Tampa Bay Lightning</a>, in an electrifying 7-6 victory on Thursday night. Werenski, shining in the spotlight, equalized the game at 4 in the second period and contributed with three assists, helping the Blue Jackets secure their second consecutive win.</p>
<h2>Key Players in the Clash</h2>
<p>Sean Monahan and Dmitri Voronkov greatly supported their team with a goal and three assists and a goal plus an assist, respectively. Kent Johnson, returning from an injury hiatus that had sidelined him for 14 games, made his mark with a power play and a short-handed goal. Yegor Chinakhov added another goal to the tally while Elvis Merzlikins showcased his goalkeeping skills by blocking 24 shots.</p>
<p>For the Lightning, Anthony Cirelli, Mitchell Chaffee, Brandon Hagel, and Connor Geekie all performed valiantly, each securing a goal and an assist. <a href=""https://21sports.com/brayden-points-dazzling-return-sparks-lightnings-overtime-triumph-over-penguins/"">Brayden Point</a> and Cam Atkinson also added to the scoresheet, with Nikita Kucherov assisting thrice.

<p>The game's pivotal moment was undoubtedly when Tampa Bay, leading by three goals in the first period, found themselves under fire in the second period. Columbus turned the tables, scoring four times and Tampa only twice.</p>
<h3>Notable Stats</h3>
<p>Brayden Point, in his second game after a four-match absence due to a lower-body injury, scored a power-play goal just 23 seconds into a Columbus penalty, at 1:51 of the first period. Point has now netted three times in two games, tying with Nikita Kucherov for the team lead with 11.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>Both teams will return to the ice on Saturday night. The Lightning will face Dallas at home, while the Blue Jackets prepare to host Carolina.</p>

<h1>Colorado Avalanche Triumphs Over Washington Capitals in Nail-Biting Encounter</h1>
<h2>Miles Wood Fires Avalanche to Victory</h2>
<p>In an electrifying Thursday night showdown, Colorado Avalanche clinched a tight 2-1 win over <a href=""https://21sports.com/capitals-dominate-avalanche-in-thrilling-5-2-victory-a-night-of-twists-and-triumphs/"">Washington Capitals</a>, with Miles Wood playing the hero as his third-period goal became the decider. Mikko Rantanen, another Avalanche star, also found the net, marking the team's fifth victory in their last six outings.</p>
<h2>Alexandar Georgiev Continues Winning Streak</h2>
<p>Alexandar Georgiev, the formidable Avalanche goaltender, demonstrated his mettle with an awe-inspiring performance that saw him repel 29 shots. This marked his fourth consecutive win after returning from an upper-body injury that sidelined him for two games.</p>
<h2>Capitals Feel the Absence of Ovechkin</h2>
<p>For the Capitals, it was Pierre-Luc Dubois who scored, but the team's winning spree came to an abrupt end, halting at three victories. Logan Thompson, the Capitals goalkeeper, experienced his maiden regulation loss of the season with 25 saves. Earlier, the team was dealt a significant blow as Alex Ovechkin, their superstar, was ruled out for four to six weeks due to a broken left fibula, sustained during their Monday clash against Utah.</p>
<h3>Avalanche's Takeaways</h3>
<p>Despite Nathan MacKinnon failing to score for the second time in three games — both against the Capitals — Rantanen maintained his impressive form, securing points in five of his last six games.</p>
<h3>Capitals' Takeaways</h3>
<p>Without Ovechkin's presence, the Capitals found it difficult to generate momentum offensively. Their usually effective power play, often energized by their captain, went 0 for 2.</p>
<h2>Key Moment of the Match</h2>
<p>The defining moment came just 3:29 into the third period when Wood, positioned at the front of the net, deflected Cale Makar's point shot, sending it past Thompson for the lead.</p>
<h2>Crucial Statistic</h2>
<p>A telling statistic dating back to the 2021-22 season reveals that the Capitals have a dismal 4-14 record without <a href=""https://21sports.com/ovechkins-decisive-strike-propels-capitals-to-victory-over-predators/"">Ovechkin</a> in the team. At the time of his injury, the captain was leading the league with 15 goals, only 27 short of Wayne Gretzky's record.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>The Avalanche is set to square off against the reigning Stanley Cup champions, Florida, on Saturday, while the Capitals will host New Jersey.</p>

<h1>Golden Knights Prevail Over Senators in Hard-Fought Match</h1>
<p>In a hockey game that kept fans on the edge of their seats, the Vegas Golden Knights claimed victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/tkachuks-overtime-magic-propels-senators-to-victory-over-bruins/"">Ottawa Senators</a> with a nail-biting 3-2 score on Thursday night. Ilya Samsonov, who had let in 10 goals over his last two games, bounced back with a remarkable performance, pulling off 38 saves.</p>
<h2>Samsonov's Key Saves Halt Senators' Attack</h2>
<p>Despite the Senators' aggressive play, Samsonov held strong, making crucial saves against formidable players like Josh Norris, David Perron, Tim Stutzle, and Brady Tkachuk. The Senators (8-10-1) find themselves trapped in a four-game losing streak, having scored just two goals throughout their last three games.</p>
<h2>Golden Knights Gain the Upper Hand</h2>
<p>In the initial phase of the game, the Golden Knights (12-6-2) seized control when Linus Ullmark made a spectacular diving save but failed to reposition quickly enough. This left Jack Eichel with an unhindered shot to the net, marking his sixth goal this season. Brett Howden extended their lead to 2-0 in the mid-second period, slipping a goal past Ullmark, who had 29 saves in the game.</p>
<h3>Sensational Third-Period Action</h3>
<p>Adam Gaudette managed to get one past Samsonov 7:17 into the third period, narrowing the lead. However, the Senators' joy was short-lived as Pavel Dorofeyev restored the two-goal lead just two minutes later. Drake Batherson kept the Senators' hopes alive, scoring a goal off a Jake Sanderson rebound with a little over seven minutes left. Despite the Senators outshooting the Golden Knights 18-5 in the third period, they fell short of a comeback.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways and Statistics</h2>
<p>A recurring issue for the Senators has been their habit of conceding the first goal, which has led to eight consecutive losses and a dismal 1-9-1 record when they let in the first goal. On the other hand, the Golden Knights capitalized on an ill-timed Ottawa line change, delivering a swift counter-strike leading to Howden's goal. The Golden Knights have an impressive 12-1-1 track record against the Senators since their entry into the league in 2017.</p>
<h3>What's Next for Both Teams?</h3>
<p>Looking ahead, the Senators are gearing up to host the Vancouver Canucks on Saturday night, while the Golden Knights prepare to face off against the Montreal Canadiens on Saturday afternoon.</p>

<h1>A Nail-biting Victory for Detroit Red Wings against New York Islanders</h1>
<p>In a thrilling showdown, <a href=""https://21sports.com/lucas-raymond-inks-lucrative-eight-year-contract-with-detroit-red-wings/"">Lucas Raymond</a>'s incredible goal in the final seconds helped the Detroit Red Wings to a 2-1 victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/islanders-thrilling-rally-overcoming-penguins-in-post-regulation-showdown/"">New York Islanders</a> on Thursday evening. Jonatan Berggren's crucial equalizer also played a pivotal role in breaking Detroit's run of three consecutive losses. The Red Wings' goaltender, Alex Lyon, displayed a remarkable performance with 22 saves.</p>
<p>For the Islanders, the only ray of hope came from Simon Holmstrom, who managed to score the sole goal for his team, unable to reverse their pattern of losses with five out of their last six games ending in defeat. Despite a valiant effort with 29 saves, Islanders' goalie Ilya Sorokin couldn't prevent the defeat.</p>
<h2>The Turning Points of the Game</h2>
<p>Holmstrom sparked the Islanders' spirits by scoring the first goal of the match at 5:51 of the first period, marking his third goal of the season. However, Berggren, with just 4:46 left in the game, managed to level the score with his third goal of the season. The decisive moment came when Raymond, with a skillful assist from Dylan Larkin, netted the puck from the left circle, beating Sorokin's glove with just 51 seconds to spare.</p>
<h3>Key Takeaways from the Game</h3>
<p>The Islanders, despite having the league's worst penalty-kill entering the game, successfully thwarted three power plays from the Red Wings, who boast the second-best power play in the league. Sorokin was instrumental in this, making six crucial saves.</p>
<p>In contrast, Raymond, who had an impressive tally of 31 goals last season, ended his scoring drought with a game-winning goal in the final minute, providing a much-needed boost to the Red Wings.</p>
<h2>Flashback and Key Statistics</h2>
<p>Recalling the teams' first encounter last month, which saw the Red Wings triumph with a 1-0 victory thanks to Patrick Kane's first-period goal, it seemed history might repeat itself with Holmstrom's early goal. However, the Red Wings turned the tide with two goals in the final five minutes of the game.</p>
<p>A noteworthy stat from the game revolves around the Red Wings' knack for comebacks last season, boasting an 11-24-3 record when trailing after two periods. This season, however, they had a 0-8-0 record when down after two periods, a statistic they managed to overturn with their late rally in this game.</p>
<h3>What's Next for the Teams?</h3>
<p>Looking forward, the Islanders will be hosting St. Louis on Saturday, while the Red Wings will welcome Boston to their home ground.</p>

<h1>Nick Chubb Spearheads Cleveland Browns' Victory Over Pittsburgh Steelers</h1>
<p>In an intense blizzard, Nick Chubb drove his team forward, replicating the play that almost ended his career in Pittsburgh last year. Chubb's perseverance paid off with a memorable touchdown, the highlight of a game his teammates will cherish. In the dying seconds of the game, Chubb powered through for a 2-yard touchdown, leading the Cleveland Browns to a triumphant 24-19 victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/steelers-snatch-victory-from-commanders-with-wilsons-late-game-heroics/"">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> on Thursday night. This victory snapped the Steelers' five-game winning spree.</p>
<h2>Chubb's Redemption Against the Steelers</h2>
<p>Chubb's electrifying performance came in his first encounter with the AFC North leaders, the Steelers (8-3), since suffering a season-ending left knee injury in a Monday night game against the same team in Week 2 last September. After a difficult rehab and a similar knee injury in 2015, Chubb's return to the field and scoring against the Steelers was a poetic moment.</p>
<h3>Myles Garrett's Praise for Chubb</h3>
<p><a href=""https://21sports.com/cleveland-browns-myles-garrett-battles-double-foot-injury-a-look-into-his-determination-and-future-prospects/"">Myles Garrett</a>, who made three impressive sacks, expressed his admiration for Chubb, “It meant a lot to me. I know it means a lot to him,” said Garrett. ""His resilience and his comeback in this game truly exemplify the kind of man he is. We absolutely love him.”</p>
<p>In the second quarter, Chubb had scored another 2-yard run. The Browns (3-8) managed to recover from blowing a 12-point lead in the fourth quarter and being down 19-18. With 3:22 left on the clock, the Browns got a chance when Pittsburgh punter Corliss Waitman made a 16-yard blunder.</p>
<h2>The Snowy Showdown</h2>
<p>In the midst of accumulating snow, Jameis Winston of the Browns completed a crucial third-down pass to Jerry Jeudy, reaching the Pittsburgh 9. Two plays later, it was Chubb who bulldozed his way into the end zone.</p>
<p>The Steelers had one last opportunity, but their Hail Mary on the final play was deflected by Browns safety Grant Delpit, triggering euphoria at Huntington Bank Field. This win against the Steelers provided some relief for coach Kevin Stefanski in a tough season and gave Browns fans a reason to celebrate.</p>
<h3>Victory Amidst the Snowstorm</h3>
<p>With a snowstorm transforming the field into a white canvas, the Steelers managed to wipe out an 18-6 deficit, scoring two touchdowns in a little over a minute. However, the Browns rallied back to secure their second divisional win after defeating the Ravens last month.</p>
<h3>Garrett's Outstanding Performance</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, Myles Garrett outshone Steelers star T.J. Watt in a dominant display, including a crucial strip-sack of Wilson. This performance came after Garrett made comments about Watt's apparent snub when Garrett was awarded the Defensive Player of the Year over him last season.</p>
<h2>Up Next</h2>
<p>The Steelers will face the Cincinnati Bengals on Dec. 1, while the Browns are scheduled to take on the Denver Broncos on Dec. 3.</p>

Copyright: xJosephxMaioranax 20240921_nts_mb3_0009 Debate Did Ryan Day's Buckeyes just prove they're the true kings of the Big Ten? Ryan Day called it, didn’t he? Ahead of the Indiana clash, he fired up the Buckeyes fanbase with words that held weight. “We’ve gotta make sure we’re sending a message.” And boy, did the Buckeyes deliver. November 23, 2024, a date Indiana Hoosiers will never forget. Just the way Ryan Day predicted. The Buckeyes smashed the field, made a strong and clear statement, and made it clear who runs the Big Ten. Yeah, a college football analyst and an Indiana alum, Pat McAfee, just made it clear. “Justin Frye, the offensive line coach, who I think is an Indiana guy during the skill sessions, gave a speech about how, you know, normally, the loudest in the room is the one that’s the worst in the room. Someone’s quiet that you need to worry about. That was a direct shot at Cignetti.” We all remember that fiery speech from Frye. Lock the gates, the best band in the world, ready for a street fight! The remarks had all the content to galvanize not just the players but an entire fanbase. The quiet one? Of course, he’s talking about Curt Cignetti. Oh, it’s just another game. Well, how did that work out for the Hoosiers’ head coach? Maybe if they had treated it like one of the most important games, the offense could have accumulated some first downs. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Ohio State and Ryan Day made a statement on Saturday #PMSLive pic.twitter.com/8r1vBF1zIM — Pat McAfee (@PatMcAfeeShow) November 25, 2024 Expand Tweet  Moving on, McAfee acknowledge the whole team, and why not! “Shout out to their entire team going; I remember he was a lot of this. I’m sure the Ohio State fans loved it. I want to speak for not everybody in Indiana, but a majority of people in Indiana that don’t have, like, media passes and credentials. Nobody in Indiana is pissed about Ohio State doing that, because in college ba-l, that is sh-t you have to do, especially at this time of year. You have to show you.” McAfee, who’s known for being a die-hard Indiana sports fan, also played his professional NFL career with the Indianapolis Colts and lived in the same city during the early days of his media career. That’s why he knows the true emotions of Indiana’s people and how they react to such stuff. Toward the end of his remarks, McAfee also recalled his short conversation with Ryan Day the day before this game. When McAfee told the Buckeyes head coach that “The Hoosiers team is the real deal.” To that, Day swiftly replied by saying, “So are we.” And that’s what we saw on the field. A team mirroring its head coach, an offense formed in its head coach’s identity. It didn’t matter that the center was injured, or that the O-line was new. There was only one mission. The Hoosiers should remember who rules the matchup, and boy, oh, boy, the Buckeyes made sure they did. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Did Ryan Day's Buckeyes just prove they're the true kings of the Big Ten? Debate Well, Ohio’s 38-15 win over the Hoosiers will be remembered for years in the program’s history. Throughout the game, the Hoosiers barely got possession of the football, and when they finally had it, Ohio State’s defense just crushed them down. Cignetti’s boys managed to cover just 151 yards, and Cignetti’s starboy Kurtis Rourke was sacked four times! This game revealed major flaws in Indiana‘s team that were under the covers. Not only that, Rourke barely got a 44% completion rate, along with 8 completed passes out of the 18 attempts. He even didn’t score a single touchdown and barely had 68 rushing yards. The whole game, from start to end, was just wild. Though it was an unlucky game for the Hoosiers, it turned out to be a boon for Will Howard. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The guy was to the point. He rocked with two touchdowns with 22 out of 26 pass attempts and completed 201 yards. Although he threw an interception as well, that was too little in front of their big win.  Let the world know your perspective.

Alabama Crimson Tide is disappointing the fans. What went wrong after three back-to-back victories? It looks like captain Jalen Milroe was over and did not like the appreciation he received after long in week 12. The whole team struggled badly; the defeat has raised some significant questions, but who is this guy who is gaining attention for bold comments before Alabama play against Auburn?  Well, meet Auburn’s linebacker, DeMarcus Riddick, a freshman and a standout recruit. Currently, he is making headlines for his confidence and bold opinions. The 6-foot-2-inch player has a lot to say before he plays against Tide. After his Monday afternoon session, he did not hesitate to say some harsh words to DeBoer’s two key players, Ryan Williams and Jalen Milroe.  “He is a good quarterback; he’s fast, but he’s not faster than me”, he added, “He will not get out that box this week and that’s something I’m gonna have to work on all week.” Did he forget that Milroe is a dual-threat quarterback? Looks like so. Hold on! He used more hash words for Ryan Williams, who has displayed impressive plays throughout the season. But the Auburn LB thinks differently about him. You will be amazed to know that he appreciated him but compared himself to Williams just after that and said, “Ryan Williams is Ryan Williams.” “I mean, yeah, he’s electric; he’s all this and that. But in my eyes, he ain’t really nobody to me. Ryan Williams is himself; he ain’t no big-time player to me.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad     A post shared by Auburn Football (@auburnfootball) Now, his comments tell us two things: one that is confident and reflects his competitive spirit but also talks about the broader narrative of rivalry games in college football, where emotions run high, and players often engage in trash talk to boost their team’s morale. It’s easier to do that when Bama is coming off a disappointing loss. However, Riddick could have given his opponents some bulletin board material.   ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Currently, Riddick is ranked 10th on the team. He has recorded a total of 22 tackles, and over the last six games, he has tallied 20 tackles. His best performance was against Oklahoma, where he showed that he is here to stay for long and his rapid performance showcases his potential and importance to Auburn’s defensive unit as they navigate a challenging season. Will he be a threat to Alabama?  Week 13 has changed lots of dynamics in the college football playoffs Alabama’s loss has benefited their opponents. Playoffs are around the corner, and DeBoer will not want his team to lose as they dream to get out of the regular season. But Riddick is challenging them in all the ways possible. First, he had opinions about Milroe and Ryan, and now he has a message for the entire team. “Bama is a big rival team.” Riddick said, “Every rival team, I’ve never lost to, and I will not lose to Bama while I’m here.”  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Is Alabama's loss a wake-up call, or will Riddick's confidence crush their playoff dreams? Debate Now, that is a big statement, and only time will tell who wins. For now, let’s take a look at his recent performances. So far, he has played 11 games and had 22 tackles. However, the linebacker generated 5.0 tackles for loss and 3.0 sacks, which put him in the top five defensive players of his team.  According to Pro Football Focus, Riddick had 15 pressures. Coming to one of his recent performances, he was impressive against the Sooners. He recorded six total tackles and a sack. Although he has not played for too long with Auburn, he has made a huge impact on the team in the short span and emerged as one of Auburn’s most effective defenders. Is it going ton be Riddick vs. Alabama offense?  Let the world know your perspective.

Coach Prime and the Buffs faced a challenging week after a series of consecutive wins, and when everything was just going right for them, the Jayhawks successfully stopped their winning streak and defeated them by 37-21. Now the defeat has raised significant concerns surrounding Deion’s son Shilo’s performance. While the whole team looked off-color, Shilo was particularly called out on a day when the defense didn’t have any answers for the Jayhawks’ Jalon Daniels and Devin Neal. He had several penalties, missed tackles in the red zone and was hapless throughout.  Before the game, Deion tried to cheer his son and took to Instagram to motivate him and wrote, “Let’s go, baby. Proud of you, son.” Ahh! This did not go in his favor, and criticism got louder, and he again got spammed with the word Shedeur has been fighting for a long time—NEPO. However, this did not stop his mother from rooting for him, and she dropped a consoling message for her beloved son after the recent backlash.  Pilar posted an animation of Shilo, which mentioned Shilo’s career high of 13 tackles and 7 solo tackles. To encourage him, she captioned it, “Congrats son! 🎉🗣️👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽Great job @shilosanders #proudmom #bigshilo #big21 #21 #headachegang #shilosanders #gobuffs #footballmom vs. Kansas” Well, this is not the first time Pilar is defending her son.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad     A post shared by PILAR SANDERS (@pilarsanders) Will he make his parents proud next week? This season, Shilo was out of the picture in the first few games because of his injury, although he has displayed some good performance throughout the year. Talking about the stats, he has made 42 tackles and one fumble recovery.  which tells us that he is a good player at defence; it is just that he is going through a rough patch. Let’s see how the fans reacted to his performance.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Who thought that the Buffs would struggle in week 13 despite having some top players? As we mentioned, Shilo was poor. Of course, it’s such a key game, and you’re playing the legendary Arrowhead Stadium, but you can’t let the emotions get hold of you. The game saw everything from Shilo that a defender shouldn’t do. A 1st and 10, and Shilo, in trying to blitz the quarterback, crossed the line of scrimmage before the ball was snapped. An offside, and it became 1st and 5. And then Neal took over, and the whole drive became useless for the Buffs.  Is Shilo Sanders a victim of nepotism, or does he have the talent to prove critics wrong? Debate Even on occasions where Shilo did his job and stopped the play from advancing, his unnecessary acts worked against the team. Naturally, the fans were delighted when he got a targeting call from the refs. If proven, it would have meant that he would tossed out of the game. However, an official review found that it wasn’t targeting, and Shilo (unfortunately, for the Buffs) remained in the game. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The whole Nepo discourse is, to be frank, useless. It’s a stick to beat up Sanders brothers. However, as you may have noticed, that stick does not work on Sheduer. With scouts saying that he’d be the first QB picked in the 2025 NFL Draft, calling him a nepo baby is just a thoughtless exercise. However, it does work on Shilo because the elder brother on the team is yet to show why he should be in the defense every week. Moreover, we have seen Shedeur and Shilo dreaming about playing in the NFL. With performances like this, Shilo can keep dreaming.  Let the world know your perspective.

It is difficult to stay away from the track for someone who had easily won all the track events when she was in her 8th grade PE class. The same happened with the US track and field legend when she left the sport and started an advertising job—she had a master’s degree in mass communications. But the fire in her ignited when she saw her teammates on the track and winning titles for the country. Who is this track and field star we are talking about? Any idea? Mechelle Lewis Freeman is the head coach of the USA team, who left track in 2002. After a four-year hiatus from the track, she faced a pivotal moment: stick to a stable career or return to the sport. “I wanted to take a chance on myself and quit my job,” Freeman revealed. She listened to her heart and fulfilled her dream to participate in the Olympics. How did she prepare herself for the return? ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Sprinter Mechelle Lewis Freeman shared her insights about the pressure of coming back to the track and quitting her job. Freeman shared all the details in an interview hosted by Justin Gatlin and Rodney Green on a YouTube channel named Ready Set Go. When asked what made her itch, she responded, “Just seeing, I mean, everyone was still competing, you know, uh, South Carolina; all of my teammates were making Olympic teams, 2004 world championship teams, in 2005.” The decision wasn’t easy—pressure and the passage of time weighed heavily on her mind. The journey back wasn’t immediate. Inspired by the successes of her South Carolina teammates, Freeman embraced the daunting challenge of full-time training, betting everything on her raw talent and determination. “I was training with those athletes every single day, and that inspired me,” she added. The mastermind behind Team USA’s relay told herself, “You are that talented as well,” and quit her well-established job in the top advertising agency in New York after seeing her friends on the track. Does Mechelle Lewis Freeman's journey prove that true talent never fades, even after years away? Debate With that self-motivation, her journey started. Reflecting on the decision, she said, “I wanted to take a chance on myself and quit my job and actually start training full-time again… I hadn’t run in four years, and we crossed that finish line, and my name came up in the fourth spot by 100th of a second.” Just nine months later, she proved her worth by earning a spot on the 2007 World Championship team and then in the 4×100 m relay team at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Freeman’s inspiring story reminds us all to “stand up for your gift,” even when the odds seem stacked against you. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Freeman left connection from the track in 2002 as she nabbed an injury, and her dream to go to the 2004 Olympics shattered. She decided to focus on her education and got a master’s degree in mass communications from J-school. But as they say, you can’t take sports out of athletes; the same happened with Mechelle Chanai Lewis Freeman, OLY. The fire of sports was again ignited after seeing other fellow athletes’ victories. Mechelle Lewis Freeman surprised everyone with her performance after four long years with a couple of years of training. She ran for USA Track and Field and won gold in the 4×100 relay at the 2007 World Championships and silver in the 4×100 relay and 100-meter sprint at the 2007 Pan-American Games. Also represented the 4×100 relay team of the USA in the Beijing 2008 Olympics. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Later in 2015, she founded TrackGirlz to help girls succeed in track and field. After coming on track, she never left it for anything, and later in 2022, Freeman was appointed as a head coach of the USA team—her first event as a coach—the World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon. The team included Sha’Carri Richardson, Melissa Jefferson, Twanisha Terry, and Gabrielle Thomas. Freeman is considered a mastermind as her team bagged gold in the championship, that too defeating Jamaica—known for the gold standard in sprinting. Freeman gives all the credit to the team’s hard work; she said, “Every decision was about the team, not individuals.” Life is a beautiful journey and sometimes takes a sharp ‘U-turn,’ and the same happened for Mechelle Lewis Freeman. There was a point when she left the track and focused on her normal job, but today she is a head coach. What do you think of her story? Tell us in the comments below.

The PGA Tour is on the cusp of significant changes, and the implications for golfers are far-reaching. As the tour navigates its new landscape, questions arise about how these changes will impact golfers of varying levels of fame and success. Phil Landes, also known as “Big Randy” from the online golf brand No Laying Up’s YouTube channel, shared his thoughts on the matter, highlighting the potential advantages and disadvantages for golfers like Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, and Adam Scott. According to Landes, popular golfers like Spieth and Fowler will likely receive numerous sponsor exemptions due to their ability to draw in crowds. This will give them a significant advantage in securing their spots on the tour. However, Landes noted that this will harm many other golfers who are not as well-known. Landes pointed to Adam Scott as an example of a golfer who was able to play his way back into the top 50 last season by taking advantage of exemptions into signature events. “You know, guys who are outside of that top 50 now, like Jordan Spieth and Ricky Fowler, and you know, I mentioned Justin Rose, like guys who are going to get a lot of exemptions. And probably going to follow, if they have any shred of their normal form, will probably follow that, like Adam Scott’s model, what he did this past year”, he said. Landes acknowledged that Adam Scott had played well, but noted that he hadn’t started the season on a strong footing. Landes believes it’s reasonable to give popular golfers like Rickie Fowler and Jordan Spieth access to tournaments. “I do think that’s a good middle ground, where it’s like, yeah, give Ricky and Jordan and these guys who are going to put bu**s in the seats.” However, to keep their cards, they’ll need to earn their way back by competing in other tournaments.

As far as schedule goes… we will for sure see him at the Grant Thornton… pic.twitter.com/fliN0ZdmY7 — Rickie Fowler Tracker (@Rickie_Tracker) November 25, 2024 Expand Tweet  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Now, in order for Fowler to have an amazing 2025 season, the golfer will need to end this one on a good note and perhaps he is on the right path. Rickie Fowler Tracker also posted the latest information on the golfer’s status on X. According to the update, Rickie Fowler officially finished 101st in the FedExCup standings for the 2024 season and is currently ranked 70th in the Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR). His 2025 schedule is starting to take shape, with a confirmed appearance at the Grant Thornton Invitational in December and a possible invite to the Hero World Challenge next week. Well, see the reason why people think Fowler is such a fan-magent is because of  the amazing foundation he has built in the golf world over the years. And that serves as one of the reason why golf legend Tiger Woods also wants him. Are sponsor exemptions fair, or do they just favor big names like Spieth and Fowler? Debate ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Back in 2023, the six-time PGA TOUR winner had an incredible year, with a win at the Rocket Mortgage Classic and top 10 finishes at several other tournaments. He was also excited to join the TGL team, saying “The more I learn about TGL, the more excited I am to be a part of it.”Fowler’s past experiences playing team golf, including four U.S. Ryder Cup teams and three U.S. Presidents Cup teams, made him a great fit for TGL. TGL CEO McCarley was thrilled to have him on board, saying “Rickie has consistently been one of the most popular players on the PGA TOUR.  He is a fan-favorite with fans of all ages and walks of life.  We welcome him to TGL as Rickie’s dynamic personality and competitiveness will thrive in the TGL environment”.

You’d think travelling from cold Indiana in late November to pleasant southern California would loosen folks up a little bit. Seemingly not. The Notre Dame Fighting Irish take their biennial trip to the Pacific coast to face the USC Trojans for rivalry week. No love is lost between these two storied programs as ever. As if this game needed any more animosity, Fighting Irish HC Marcus Freeman has a chip on his shoulder. Notre Dame (10-1) has had a contrasting traversal through their season compared to foes USC (6-5). Marcus Freeman and co. are no.5 in the country and have one foot in the CFP. Meanwhile, the Trojans had to muster a 4th quarter comeback against UCLA on Saturday just to become bowl-eligible. However, this divergence wasn’t the case in the very recent past itself. Freeman begrudgingly remembers his first game at USC from a Notre Dame persuasion all too well. When these two schools last faced each other in the Trojans’ backyard in 2022, it was the home side that held The Jeweled Shillelagh trophy at the final whistle. Marcus Freeman had lost his first rivalry matchup. Naturally, he wasn’t thrilled and is out for vengeance. When asked about his memories of the LA Coliseum in the build-up to Saturday’s game, he said, “I remember as a player there, it was rocking. Celebrities and the crowd, it was big time.” Freeman then admitted “I think back to two years ago, they crushed those hopes. That’s one that sticks with me.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Freeman on playing at USC: “I remember as a player there, it was rocking. Celebrities and the crowd, it was big time.” “I think back to two years ago, they crushed those hopes. That’s one that sticks with me.” — Irish Sports Daily (@ISDUpdate) November 25, 2024 Expand Tweet  The 38-27 win for USC broke a 4-year winning streak for the Fighting Irish. This was garnered during the legendary run with Brian Kelly at the helm. Marcus Freeman took over Kelly’s reign quite abruptly in 2021 but held his own. A win on the weekend will go some way in warming him further to the Fighting Irish faithful. For more than just the conspicuous reasons. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Freeman leads his troops to the west coast, not just with pride riding on the game. A win would be worth more than just bragging rights. It would firmly secure Notre Dame a CFP berth. For Independent Notre Dame, being without a conference in the first year of the expanded playoff was a unique proposition. Their success in their endeavors is poetically dependent on them conquering enemy territory. “Our biggest challenge to date”, said Freeman about facing USC. Can Marcus Freeman avenge his past and lead Notre Dame to a historic CFP berth? Debate After Brian Kelly left the program for LSU, a cloud of uncertainty loomed over the school. Kelly had been in charge for over a decade and is Notre Dame’s winningest coach ever. In his very first year, he even broke an 8-year losing streak to the Trojans. These were big shoes to fill for Marcus Freeman, the defensive coordinator with no head coaching experience. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad His tenure didn’t get off to the best start, either. Freeman lost his first 3 games. After a couple of upward-trending seasons, the biggest blow came via an unexpected source. Notre Dame’s loss to Northern Illinois in Week 2 this season still reverberates deafeningly around the CFB landscape. This was arguably the biggest upset in the history of the program. For now, it seems like Freeman and his team have put that result where it belongs- the history books. Notre Dame has won 9 straight since. They are stood on the precipice of the playoffs. Their self-proclaimed biggest challenge is what stands in the way of a first playoff appearance in the Marcus Freeman era. Let the world know your perspective.

What are your thoughts? During the off-season in gymnastics, Simone Biles has been pursuing different adventures. Whether it’s decorating her local store in Houston with the festive theme or watching her husband Jonathan Owens’s NFL game, she is taking full advantage of this break. This time, she has found herself with American rapper Snoop Dogg, with whom she will be partnering as a Playoff Advisor in the reality show NBC’s “The Voice.” The pair won’t be meeting each other for the first time in their lives, as a few months ago they returned from Paris, where the rapper watched Biles get her newest set of Olympic medals. Furthermore, this surprising announcement and the gymnast’s dive into the entertainment industry have stunned many in the community, including fellow Team USA alpine ski racer Mikaela Shiffrin. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad From conquering the sport in events like the Olympic Games and starring in shows like the Gold Over America Tour, Simone Biles will be present at NBC’s The Voice, owing to her mentorship role. According to NBC Olympics & Paralympics on X, she will be joining Snoop Dogg for an episode in the reality show, which will be aired to the audience on Monday. Surely, this is a great opportunity for the gymnast to have experience in the music industry. Both of the two celebrities will be reuniting again after their endeavor in Paris for the Olympic Games, and the community is excited to see them as a duo, guiding five vocalists who will be vying for a spot in the live shows. The gymnast also gave her insight on this new adventure to the Associated Press, stating, “We’re both very mellow. But if we need to bring that energy up, then we can. For us, it was about instilling confidence going into the next week.” Biles was confident with herself and her reality show partner, Snoop Dogg, after both of them finished their shoot in Los Angeles. She acknowledged the efforts that they both made as mentors to the vocalists and had that trust in them that they would be making it to the next round. Even though she isn’t much of a singer herself, by using the same motivation that she uses during her gymnastics events, she gave the required insights to contestants of the reality show. “They all have the vocal talent. It’s about harnessing that, knowing when to bring it out and which songs to sing and which genre you fit in. And what you want your legacy to be. This is truly a special show as well as the judging. They don’t get to see the physical appearance first. It’s all off of ears, listening and putting their craft together as well,” Biles stated after going through the whole shoot of The Voice.

What are your thoughts? Debate  Since the singing competition is all about the voice of the participant, the gymnast appreciated the way the competition judges its contestants. She also guided the vocalists under her, emphasizing the importance of  that package of staying self-motivated throughout the session. The American rapper also appreciated the presence of Biles, as even if they have had different types of careers, he acknowledged both of their journeys, which have been successful due to their mindset of keeping up with the dedication in whatever they do. “She’s a performer. I’m a performer. We’ve performed under extreme conditions. We always do our best. But sometimes things happen behind closed doors that you don’t know about. So, we’re able to speak to those things and give them real reassurance,” said Snoop Dogg after he and Biles guided the vocalists throughout the shoot of the episode. Furthermore, it wasn’t only the American rapper who was all in to appreciate the presence of the Olympian in the reality show. The social media post carrying the announcement of her attending The Voice immediately caught the attention of many, and the fans rushed to the comment section. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Throughout the year, Simone Biles has done many activities that have taken aback her audience, and her appearance on the reality show was no different. Apart from her huge fanbase, it also caught the attention of Mikaela Shiffrin, who just replied to the social media post with a “star-struck” emoji. The official X profile of the LA Olympics also added a reply, stating, “The goat doing iconic things as always.” Many are aware of the gymnast’s interest in various activities. But a lot of them didn’t expect her to arrive at a reality show, that too, which is all about singing. The Olympian, though, did star in the Gold Over America Tour, which was especially her event to showcase world-class gymnastics performances on the stage with a musical vibe. So, even if she is more keen on sports, she isn’t that far from the tunes of a reality show. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Watching her appearance in The Voice, one fan stated, “Fantastic.” Another fan, who knew about Biles’ nature of donating to her community, stated, “She’s worth millions is going to give back college tuition refund she took.” There’s not a single time when Biles has forgotten to give back to her community. Especially when it comes to the athletic future of many local youngsters, Biles has stepped up numerous times, supporting them with required types of equipment for the local athletic organizations and even providing financial help with the funding she has garnered from many events. Even during this year’s holiday season, she has already collaborated with her local store in Houston to raise these donations for the young generation of the nation that has an interest in sports. While her musical endeavor will be completely new, Biles has always liked to take on a challenge, and as a mentor, this won’t be any different for her. Let the world know your perspective.

Since September 5, Aberg had been recovering, and relaxing, and also longing to come back to the course. His wish finally came through as Ludvig Aberg joined his fellow PGA Tour pros at the RSM Classic 2024. We can’t really say that it was a bad comeback. He was tied at 17, 6 points away from the top of the table. While most of the top pros will be disappointed with the performance, Aberg rejoiced every moment of it.

See, week 13 has dramatically reshaped the college football landscape as several top teams faced unexpected defeats. Big football programs, including Ole Miss and Alabama, got to taste a defeat when playoffs are just around the corner. In such a scenario, Tennessee Volunteers head coach Josh Heupel and his team had no other option but to win, and guess what? They dominated UTEP, and how? 56-0. But the same offense struggled against a top team a week ago. Yes! In week 11, the Vols played against the Bulldogs and registered their second defeat of the season, 17-31. And their biggest problem that day was their offensive performance. Joel Klatt, an analyst for Fox Sports, exposed Tennessee’s major flaws.  On November 26, Klatt discussed the big losses of week 12 and the playoffs on The Joel Klatt Show. While talking about the playoffs, he pointed out that Josh Heupel’s negligence can stop his team from entering the playoffs. He mentioned, “I think one of Tennessee’s great flaws is that they don’t have a secondary way to beat you offensively other than just like their systems. That their system doesn’t adjust; you can’t get big; you’ve got to be small all the rather to get into that.”  USA Today via Reuters Oct 12, 2024; Knoxville, Tennessee, USA; Tennessee Volunteers head coach Josh Heupel during a game against the Florida Gators at Neyland Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Angelina Alcantar/USA TODAY Network via Imagn Images Joel highlighted that lack of versatility in their offensive system. If we talk about Nico’s performance against Georgia, it looks like the Bulldogs put him to a test. Although he tried to pull the game and made some impressive throws on his opening drive, a couple of them included passes to tight end Miles. However, the major problem was that in the second half, they lost the rhythm, and Nico failed to take over the game. Now, the biggest question: are they trying to rely on what they are best at? ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Georgia completely took over the game and successfully kept the ba-l away from their guests. We saw how the Vols failed to get back in the same. Of course, one can say that it was a bad day, and Kirby Smart’s team was very good on the day. However, considering that the Vols are unlikely to get a bye in the first round, they are likely to travel again to face one of the heavy hitters. Who could it be?  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Well, if it’s a Big 10 team, Josh Heupel’s men could face a cold-weather game. SEC teams are not known to play in such a game. Add to that Heupel’s failure to throw something else at the opponent’s defense when Plan A doesn’t work. But it looks like he is happy with how his offense is performing. Let’s see how he reacted to their recent performance.   Vols got to taste their second defeat of the season in week 11. Kirby Smart and his squad took the responsibility to break their winning streak, and they also did a favour to Josh and the staff by letting them know that they needed some improvement in the offense. Now that the offense has outperformed their opponents in Week 13, here is what Heupel said about their Week 14 opponents.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Is Tennessee's offensive system too predictable to succeed against top-tier teams? Debate “They play complementary football. They’re smart. They’re tough. They’re physical. They’re disciplined. They make you earn it. Offensively, the quarterback [Pavia] is a dynamic player. It’s a quarterback-run game. He has a unique ability to extend and make plays outside of the scope of the play call, too. And defensively, they don’t give up a bunch of big plays; they play assignment sound. Special teams—you look at what they’re doing—the punt returner is dynamic. And their punt game, their punter changes the field. So, it’s a huge test for us and one we’ve got to get prepared for and get ready for and practice well and get ready to go play well on Saturday afternoon.” We all know Nico has been doing well, but there is a big difference between a ranked and an unranked team. However, the Vols can’t afford to take Vanderbilt lightly. We already saw how it panned out when Bama made that mistake. Moreover, Heupel has the added motivation of a playoff berth after multiple SEC teams faltered in Week 13.  Let the world know your perspective.

The Chiefs Kingdom has always witnessed their TE Travis Kelce and reigning Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes link up since their dominance started in 2018. Over the years, Kelce and Mahomes have connected for 55 TDs. They are considered one of the greatest quarterbacks and TE duo to grace the NFL. However, last Sunday, in their Week 12 game, something occurred that wasn’t very Kelce and Mahomes-like. Late into the third quarter, when the Chiefs were looking for a first and 10 deep into Carolina’s 30-yard line, Mahomes found his bestie open downfield. As usual, the Chiefs QB tried to throw the ball onto Kelce. But his target was a little off, which led to Kelce failing to hold onto the pass. Even though he stretched both of his hands, the ball ended up hitting the turf. This led to Kelce turning around in frustration and yelling an expletive as cameras caught him doing so. Although Kelce appeared upset on cameras with frustration boiling out of him, fans didn’t like his reaction at all. One of them called him out for blaming Mahomes while masking his mistake, “He should have caught it. No excuse! Looked like he blamed Patrick.” Going through those clips, it just looked like a moment where Kelce was upset with the play. However, his day wasn’t that bad as the Chiefs TE finished with six receptions for 62 yards. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad He should have caught it. No excuse! Looked like he blamed Patrick. — susan stowe (@tmns14) November 25, 2024 Expand Tweet  He also went on to eclipse Antonio Gates for most receiving yards by a TE in the history of the NFL. As for Mahomes, he completed 27-of-37 passes for 269 yards. But the three TDs he had on Sunday didn’t find Kelce in the end zone. Instead, the other TE, Noah Grey, racked up 2 TDs for 66 yards. Back-to-back double TD games for Grey. Well, Kelce also didn’t have Taylor Swift in attendance, as she missed two games in a row, all of them on the road. However, the Chiefs Kingdom didn’t like Kelce possibly cussing Mahomes, so they blamed him instead. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Did Kelce's frustration with Mahomes reveal cracks in their legendary partnership, or just a bad day? Debate Although a moment of miscommunication might have resulted in a heated exchange between Mahomes and Kelce, their fans didn’t like the way Kelce reacted to a simple miscalculated pass. As they went into their phones and bashed him online, “Don’t know why that on Kelce both hands on the ball got to catch it.” Well, Kelce did throw both hands on the pass but still couldn’t grasp it because of a last-second adjustment. There was another who called him out for having drops every now and then, “He has one of those drops about once every 2 or 3 games. Just inexplicable.” While people continued to throw Kelce under the bus for his frustrations. One of the fans called both of them out for equal blame, “That ball was catchable, but that throw was also off. Both made mistakes.”  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad However, for the Chiefs, they had to grind till the last moment. As Mahomes late 33-yard run and Spencer Shrader’s field goal helped them seal the victory in Carolina. Thereby helping them get back into the winning column after the Bills loss last weekend. Moreover, as fans continue to debate who was to blame for the incomplete pass, we have reports of all-around disappointment from the Chiefs locker room. Local KC media wrote about how even after the victory, the locker room wasn’t that spirited. The defensive players were particularly disheartened after a poor showing, and even Mahomes, who likes to chat with his teammates, didn’t hang around for conversations. On his part, Chiefs HC Andy Reid did try to raise the spirits, highlighting the uncertain nature of games in the NFL, and all that matters is a win. Let the world know your perspective.

   The Houston Astros’ streak of seven consecutive appearances in the American League Championship Series came to an end in 2024 after losing to the Detroit Tigers in the wild-card series. Now that the season is over, the Astros will have to make a decision on one of their longtime players who has become a free agent. Third basemen Alex Bregman has played for the Astros his entire career, dating to 2016, but they now may be hesitant to re-sign him. With that in mind, former New York Mets general manager Steve Phillips named the two big questions for the Astros this offseason. “I’m not convinced they can sustain a payroll that has Bregman and Kyle Tucker for the long term,” Phillips said, via MLB Network. Will the Astros be able to sign Alex Bregman and Kyle Tucker long term?@StevePhillipsGM isn't convinced. pic.twitter.com/noKOH8NVD1 — MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) November 25, 2024  Tucker is another big-name Astros player who will become a free agent after the 2025 season. Phillips said he doesn’t see the Astros being able to sign both Bregman and Tucker to long-term deals, so the team may have to decide on which player they would rather have. Bregman played in 145 games in 2024 and batted .260 with 26 home runs, 75 RBIs and a .768 OPS. Tucker played in only 78 games but batted .289 with 23 home runs, 49 RBIs and a .993 OPS. Phillips posed a possible strategy of signing Bregman long-term, letting Tucker go, and adding another left-handed power hitter like Cody Bellinger from the Chicago Cubs. It will be interesting to see how the Astros handle the Bregman situation this offseason, as it might give some insight into their plans for Tucker next offseason."

   During his playing career in the NFL, wide receiver Steve Smith Jr. had no problem speaking his mind, even if it would get him in trouble from time to time with the league or his teammates and peers. That no-nonsense approach and unfiltered personality have carried over to Smith’s career after football, as he continues to express his opinions and doesn’t care who does or doesn’t agree with what he has to say. The three-time All-Pro recently shared his thoughts about quarterbacks in the NFL. Smith claims he’s “very critical” of quarterbacks, but when it comes to seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady, he doesn’t have a bad thing to say. “Nothin’,” Smith said, via Games with Names. “Tom was crafty.” Steve Smith Sr. is very critical of quarterbacks:@Edelman11 @SteveSmithSr89 pic.twitter.com/5Y2UlzI9T5 — Games with Names (@gameswithnames) November 25, 2024  With Brady the most successful football player of all time in terms of his accomplishments on the field with the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, there are few who criticize what he did on the gridiron. Smith seems to be in the group that is comfortable giving Brady all the praise he deserves for being arguably the greatest player in NFL history, and he appears to have nothing but respect for what the superstar accomplished during his playing days, which came to an end before last season."

   The Major League Baseball offseason is heating up as the free agent class is meeting with interested teams. Outfielder Juan Soto of the New York Yankees is the headliner, but there is a strong crop of starting pitchers as well. Some of those big-name starters include Blake Snell, Corbin Burnes, Max Fried and Roki Sasaki. A name that is not getting talked about as much as the other starting pitcher free agents is World Series champion Jack Flaherty. MLB analyst Ryan Spilborghs recently named two teams that could be a good fit for Flaherty if they are unable to sign one of the other big-name pitchers. “I think some organizations like Detroit, possibly a team like Houston, trying to find some teams that are a little bit more short term than long term with the contract,” Spilborghs said, via MLB Network Radio on SiriusXM. Don't forget about Jack Flaherty on the free agent pitching market. 🔗 https://t.co/fGPbvbjGlC pic.twitter.com/3pWlzrVm78 — MLB Network Radio on SiriusXM (@MLBNetworkRadio) November 25, 2024  Flaherty came into the league in 2017 and has played for four teams in his eight-year MLB career. After going to the Los Angeles Dodgers from the Detroit Tigers in an in-season trade, Flaherty started 10 games and posted a 6-2 record with a 3.58 ERA and 61 strikeouts in 55.1 innings pitched. He also won one postseason game in helping the Dodgers win the championship. Spilborghs names the Detroit Tigers and Houston Astros as possible landing spots for Flaherty and suggests that a shorter contract would be a better fit for him. Though Spilborghs does think teams would prefer to go after the other big-name pitchers, he does think Flaherty would be a good option for someone."

   Throughout the 2024 NFL season, rookie quarterbacks Caleb Williams and Jayden Daniels have been two young players who have gotten a lot of attention since being taken No. 1 and No. 2 in the 2024 NFL Draft. Although Williams has shown flashes for the Chicago Bears, and Daniels has become a breakout star for the Washington Commanders, Bo Nix, who was the sixth quarterback taken in the first round of the draft, has seemingly outshined them both after Week 12. Nix has been living up to the comparisons to New Orleans Saints legend Drew Brees as he has been successful with a unique style of play under head coach Sean Payton on the Denver Broncos, resulting in seven wins thus far and a real chance to make the playoffs. Colin Cowherd of FOX Sports seems to be all in on Nix moving forward. .@ColinCowherd on Bo Nix: ""There is nothing here that doesn't look like a star franchise quarterback."" pic.twitter.com/puLs0CmNNu — Herd w/Colin Cowherd (@TheHerd) November 25, 2024  Fortunately for Nix and the Broncos, the season’s final stretch provides opportunities to continue adding wins, as they’ll take on the Cleveland Browns, Indianapolis Colts, Los Angeles Chargers, Cincinnati Bengals and Kansas City Chiefs. Even though the last five games have some challenges, especially facing the Chargers, Bengals and Chiefs in the final three games, Denver is more than capable of winning all five, and if it can pull that off, the postseason will be interesting for this better-than-expected squad led by a rookie quarterback."

With Jones getting released, teams around the league had an opportunity to pick him up on waivers, but considering the size of his contract and all the questions about whether he is a viable starter, he cleared waivers unclaimed. Jones is now officially a free agent and is expected to draw interest from teams looking to bolster the quarterback position with a player who has experience as a starter in the NFL. Former NFL player Mike Golic said he thinks that a handful of teams make sense for Jones if he’s content with being a backup moving forward, but if he’s determined to get another starting job, the Las Vegas Raiders could be where he lands. “For the rest of this year, does he back up a playoff team for the [Arizona] Cardinals, for the [Denver] Broncos, for the [Los Angeles] Chargers, for the [Minnesota] Vikings? He wants to be a starter somewhere, and there are plenty of teams out there. Say, the Raiders. Instead of going after a young quarterback in the draft, you now are putting all your eggs in the Daniel Jones basket,” Golic said, via GoJo and Golic. Which NFL team should add Daniel Jones to their Roster? The Broncos, the Cardinals, the Vikings, the Raiders 🤔👀 pic.twitter.com/EN1qOW0oDd — GoJo and Golic (@GoJoandGolic) November 25, 2024  The 2024 season has been an absolute disaster for the Raiders, as it seems as though nothing has gone right, and things got that much worse in Week 12 with the team losing starting quarterback Gardner Minshew to a season-ending injury and losing to the Denver Broncos for a second time this season. With Minshew out, the Raiders have a need at quarterback, even if Aidan O’Connell comes off injured reserve to play behind or ahead of Desmond Ridder."

   At this point in the NFL season, the playoff picture is starting to become more clear in both conferences as teams separate themselves from the pack. Every year, some teams disappoint and are unable to live up to expectations, while there are other teams that exceed expectations and show they are much further along than anyone gave them a chance to be. One of those teams this season is the Denver Broncos, who chose to part with Russell Wilson in the offseason in favor of bringing in a rookie, who turned out to be Bo Nix. Nix, who was the sixth quarterback selected in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft, has far exceeded expectations while putting the Broncos squarely in the playoff hunt in the AFC at 7-5 after defeating the division-rival Las Vegas Raiders for a second time this season. Although the Broncos have been impressive, Kay Adams said she believes the Seattle Seahawks are the most improved team in the NFL this year. “If you were getting a most improved little pin in a trophy to a team, maybe it’s the Broncos, you can make the claim, but I think I’d give it to Seattle from what they’ve looked like,” Adams said on “Up & Adams.” Are the #Seahawks the MOST IMPROVED team this season??? Hard to argue when HC Mike Macdonald's ""BEEN IN HIS BAG"" so much lately 😎📈🔊@heykayadams @Seahawks | #GoHawks pic.twitter.com/ByuF2HkKSq — Up & Adams (@UpAndAdamsShow) November 25, 2024  The NFC West has been as unpredictable as any division in the league this season, with all four teams having a record of 6-5 (the Seahawks and Arizona Cardinals) or 5-6 (the Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers). As a result of back-to-back wins against San Francisco and Arizona, Seattle is now in first place in the division and has a solid chance to win the title and reach the postseason after missing out last season."

   The Oakland Athletics have not made the postseason in the past four years with their last appearance coming back in the shortened season of 2020. The 2024 season was another disappointing campaign for the team as they finished with a record of 69-93, which left them in fourth place in the AL West. However, the biggest news surrounding the Athletics this season was that it was their last year playing in their home city. Veteran pitcher Liam Hendriks recently revealed his honest admission about the last A’s game played at the Oakland Coliseum. “I teared up, it was an emotional day, I mean, I spent five years there,” Hendriks said, via Foul Territory. Former Athletic Liam Hendriks said he teared up watching the final game in Oakland. pic.twitter.com/JTq4CwLUBP — Foul Territory (@FoulTerritoryTV) November 25, 2024  The Athletics have been based in Oakland since 1968, when they moved there from Kansas City. The team will now be transitioning to Las Vegas, which resembles the move made by Oakland’s NFL team, which moved to the city in 2020. Hendriks has played 13 seasons in MLB after coming into the league in 2011. He played for the Athletics from 2016 through 2020, with 2019 being the year that sparked a hot streak from the veteran pitcher. That season, Hendriks appeared in 75 games and posted a 1.80 ERA, 25 saves and 124 strikeouts in 85.0 innings pitched. Hendriks did take a piece of the legendary stadium for a memory, admitting he grabbed some of the mound dirt when he went there early in the season. The Athletics’ move to Las Vegas won’t happen immediately as their new stadium needs to be built, and the plan is to open that ballpark in 2028. As for the 2025 season, the Athletics will play in Sacramento."

   The Boston Red Sox play in the AL East, one of the toughest divisions in Major League Baseball. In a division that includes the New York Yankees, the Red Sox must stay active in their player signings each year to keep up. While the Red Sox have nine World Series titles in their history, they have not won one since 2018, which was also the last time they won the AL East. MLB Insider Ken Rosenthal revealed what the Red Sox need to do this offseason to get the organization back to a competitive level against the Yankees. “Ultimately, they need to find more balance,” Rosenthal said, via Foul Territory. ""Ultimately, they need to find more balance.""@Ken_Rosenthal says the Red Sox need to find a Manny Ramirez to Devers' David Ortiz. pic.twitter.com/4tkhvDXPeG — Foul Territory (@FoulTerritoryTV) November 25, 2024  Rosenthal mentions the need to add a right-handed bat who is as big a threat as Rafael Devers is from the left side of the plate. The comparison Rosenthal makes is getting a Manny Ramirez-type player to match up with Devers like Ramirez did with David Ortiz. Devers came into the league in 2017 and has played all eight years of his career with the Red Sox. Though he plays third base, there is some discussion within the Red Sox organization to move him to first base. A possible move that Rosenthal mentions is adding right-handed hitting veteran Nolan Arenado to play third base if they do move Devers to first. It is safe to say that Rosenthal believes the Red Sox need to add another big piece to their offense this offseason, whether that is Arenado or someone else."

   The Detroit Pistons still aren’t close to being championship contenders, but they are definitely better than they were last season. Devoted fans who have been through thick and thin are very excited about the team’s future, especially because of a few young players on the roster. The team’s frontcourt has been celebrated by analysts, fans, and even Detroit’s own players. Speaking with Grant Afseth, via Legion Hoops, Ivey praised his relationship with Cade Cunningham, saying, “I believe we have the talent to be one of the best backcourts ever.” Jaden Ivey on Cade Cunningham: “I believe we have the talent to be one of the best backcourts ever.” (via @GrantAfseth) pic.twitter.com/NzZtmvddsO — Legion Hoops (@LegionHoops) November 25, 2024  This is Ivey’s third season in the league after being selected by the Pistons as the fifth overall pick in the 2022 draft. This year, he is putting up 18.1 points, 4.6 rebounds, and 4.2 assists on 43.1 percent from the field. Then there is Cunningham, who is averaging 23.5 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 8.9 assists. This is definitely a special and exciting partnership, but the Pistons are still struggling to make a real impact on the Eastern Conference. They have a 7-11 record and are the 11th team in their conference. Yes, that’s much better than where they were last year, but they obviously still have a long way to go before they’re viewed as a real, sustainable, consistent threat to other teams. The Pistons are still laying the groundwork for a great future, and the backcourt combination of Ivey and Cunningham is a huge part of that. They know they have something special, and they’re ready to prove it, even if they still aren’t where they want to be right now."

   Once considered to be the next big thing in the National Football League, Trevor Lawrence has fallen from grace. He had a promising first year under Doug Pederson, but like his team, he couldn’t sustain that strong momentum. Now, with the Jacksonville Jaguars’ league-worst record of 2-9, Lawrence has been forced to watch from the sidelines as he nurses an injury. Notably, Ian Rapoport of the NFL Network reported that Lawrence could be inching closer to a return. Per Coach Pederson, Lawrence will practice on Monday, and the team will decide later in the week about his availability for Sunday’s divisional matchup with the Houston Texans. #Jaguars coach Doug Pederson told reporters that QB Trevor Lawrence will practice today and the team will make a decision later in the week about his availability. Lawrence has missed the last two games with a significant AC joint injury in his left shoulder. — Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) November 25, 2024  The former No. 1 pick has missed the past two games with an AC joint injury in his left (non-throwing) shoulder. Former New England Patriots first-rounder Mac Jones has filled in for him in the meantime, but he hasn’t exactly done much to put pressure on him with his performances. With the playoffs likely out of reach, there’s no point in rushing Lawrence back to the field. In nine games this season, Lawrence has completed roughly 61% of his passes for 2,004 yards, eleven touchdowns, and six interceptions. He’s still young, but judging by what we’ve seen, he’ll have a tough time living up to the hype and expectations."

On October 8, Williams was allegedly a passenger in a car being driven by his brother, who told police that there were two firearms in the car after they were pulled over for speeding. And while Detroit Police would later go on to probe why Williams left the incident without being arrested, a Wayne County Prosecutor told TMZ on Monday that she’d be denying DPD’s request for an arrest warrant in the case.   ‘We all agreed that this decision is the right and just one,’ Kym Worthy said. ‘And I am personally certain that the right decision has been made with these specific and unique set of facts.’      Jameson Williams won’t face charges after two guns were found in a car he was riding in      The receiver was a passenger in a car alongside his brother when it was pulled over by cops Worthy added to TMZ that ‘a team of experienced lawyers’ had reviewed the case and that Williams’ status as a receiver for the Lions did not play a role in the decision. ‘We have charged Detroit area athletes before and would not have hesitated to do so again if the facts of this case could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,’ she continued. ‘When it comes to charging decisions, we do not take into consideration who the potential defendant is, how much power and influence they have, or how beloved they may be. We deal with the facts and the law only.’ A firearm was allegedly found on the back seat and under Williams’ seat. One of the guns is said to have been registered to Williams but the NFL star allegedly did not have a concealed pistol license. Bodycam footage shows Williams pleading with officers after they warn him that he will be taken into custody. ‘I play for the Lions bro, I’m Jameson Williams,’ he is heard telling them. ‘Bro, I play for the Detroit Lions.’ Williams eventually admitted the firearm was his, after his brother had tried to claim it belonged to him.  ‘I got the gun for protection… do you guys know where I live at? Detroit!’ said Williams, who was handcuffed and put in the back of a cop car.      Police reportedly launched an investigation into why Williams avoided arrest A sergeant, who arrived at the scene, made several phone calls to higher-ranked officials to determine if the NFL star needed to be detained. He eventually handed back Williams’ gun and allowed him to go. He even appeared to tell the arresting officers ‘I’m so mad at you two’.   When the sergeant was told Williams could be released, he told a lieutenant down the phone: ‘You’re a f***ing hero. Thank you so much’.    The sergeant’s phone background was the Lions logo. According to WYZX News, the decision not to detain the Detroit star left police chiefs ‘p****d off.’ ‘I want to know if the fact that this individual was a Detroit Lions player, did that play a factor in the decision making?’ Commander Michael McGinnis is quoted as asking. Williams’ attorney previously said that Williams and his brother were ‘cooperative and respectful’ with cops and that both firearms were properly registered. Meanwhile, Williams has continued playing for the Lions – though he was recently fined $19,697 for grabbing his crotch during a touchdown celebration Your email address will not be published.

The 39-year-old former Sporting Lisbon boss was only able to fit a few days training in with United’s underachieving players prior to Sunday’s trip to Portman Road and was modest in his expectations after the match. Amorim has openly revealed he plans to stick to his favoured 3-4-3 system after inheriting a team that lost its way during the final few weeks of Erik ten Hag’s chaotic reign and the Portuguese is already trying to figure out his best XI.   An openly honest post-match assessment came after Amorim watched his United squad throw away their lead against a plucky and battling Ipswich opposition as he told supporters they will have to see the team ‘suffer’ before things get better. Some United stars fared better than others in Amorim’s first game as they were held to a draw by Kieran McKenna’s side. Here, Mail Sport analyses Man United’s key winners and losers after Amorim’s first taste of English football.      Ruben Amorim finally got his Man United reign up and running with a 1-1 draw against Ipswich on Sunday      Marcus Rashford scored United’s only goal at Portman Road with a finish inside two minutes   WINNERS Andre Onana Much has been made of Onana’s future at Old Trafford now Amorim is in charge, despite the goalkeeper being one of United’s best performers in a dismal start to the season. The Cameroonian was brought to the club last year after Ten Hag made the brutal decision to axe long-term shot-stopper David de Gea and endured a torrid start to life in Manchester. Onana admitted he needed time to adjust to the demands of the Premier League and appears to have now done so with Amorim given a first look at the shot-stopper against Ipswich – and starred with a man-of-the-match display. Make no mistake, Amorim would have been left reeling in defeat without the 28-year-old’s stunning interventions, most notably denying Liam Delap with a brilliant save in the first-half. His superb reactionary stops combined with some tidy ball-playing and willingness to step up into United’s back-three when in possession will have captured Amorim’s attention, with Onana already showing his new boss he deserves to be No 1.      Much has been made of Andre Onana’s future at Old Trafford now Amorim is in charge      Onana produced a world class reactionary save to deny Liam Delap from close range Amad Diallo United chiefs forked out £37m for a then unproven Amad in 2021 – and finally the winger is looking capable of living up to the hype that surrounded his arrival. It’s not been an easy journey to first-team starts for the Ivorian, who has endured loan spells at Rangers and Sunderland, but had still been kept on the fringes of the first-team under Ten Hag. Having shown the willingness and tenacity that will be integral under Amorim, the 22-year-old is now delivering consistently and was one of United’s top performers at Portman Road in a wing-back role. Deployed in a new position that he hasn’t previously played, Amad often came out on top in his battles with Leif Davis and showed both his determination and skill to provide an assist for Marcus Rashford’s goal after bursting down the wing. Amorim heaped praise on the rising star after the match. Amad will now be hoping the days of being left on the bench will be a distant memory.      Amad often emerged on top in his battles against Ipswich full-back Leif Davis (left) Alejandro Garnacho Loved by Cristiano Ronaldo during the icon’s second season at the club and now adored by fans, it’s no surprise to see Amorim also singing Garnacho’s praises after a strong showing against Ipswich. The left-wing position at United has been Rashford’s for years and when Garnacho first came through under Ten Hag it looked as if it would be the Argentine who would need to find a new role. But his starring performances across the past year – along with being United’s top Premier League goalscorer this season – have seen him nail down a starting position, although he was deployed in an unfamiliar role against Ipswich. Like some of his team-mates, you could at times see Garnacho trying to understand where he needed to be positioned in Amorim’s new system, but that is something that will come with time under the new manager. Garnacho still lacks some of the clinical decision-making that comes with experience but could be a player crucial to Amorim’s plans for success at Old Trafford as he fights for one of the attacking spots in the 3-4-3 system.      Amorim was singing Alejandro Garnacho’s praises after a strong showing against Ipswich      Garnacho still lacks some of the clinical decision-making that comes with experience LOSERS Christian Eriksen Statistically, Eriksen has been one of United’s best performers this season, but it was still a surprise to see him start alongside Casemiro – and it will be an even greater surprise if he keeps his place for Thursday’s Europa League clash with Bodo/Glimt. The Dane kept his place alongside Casemiro in midfield where – despite playing a few neat passes – he ultimately struggled with the intensity Amorim wants his midfielders to play with. Eriksen has never been blessed with pace but often negates that problem by being quick with his decision-making and excellent in his use of the ball. But against Ipswich the 32-year-old looked every bit his age at times and was often caught out of position when the hosts piled bodies forward, as United’s defence was unlocked on countless occasions. Hooked in the 68th minute and could benefit from a spell on the sidelines. Is likely to make way for either Kobbie Mainoo or Manuel Ugarte when they are deemed fit enough to start.      Christian Eriksen ultimately struggled with the intensity Amorim wants his midfielders to play with Joshua Zirkzee Players that are new to the Premier League are often afforded time by even rival supporters, but Zirkzee is having a seriously difficult time and a 20 minute showing against Ipswich didn’t do much for his confidence. The Dutchman scored on his debut in United’s season-opening win over Fulham, but since then has looked like a player that won’t be good enough to make the grade at one of the world’s biggest clubs. United needed pace, energy and a willingness to get in the box with the game level when Zirkzee was introduced in the 68th minute, but he failed to provide any of those measures and instead looked lost playing in the No.10 role.      Joshua Zirkzee is having a seriously difficult time and a 20 minute showing against Ipswich didn’t do much for his confidence   Amorim didn’t hide his frustration at Zirkzee’s performance and warned the former Bologna star after the game, stating: ‘You have to keep the ball and know the momentum to put the ball in front. Sometimes you feel that you can’t keep the ball and you [have to] put the ball in front. ‘Then you have like we are in the end of the game, we were around the box with two strikers. Josh [Zirkzee] has to understand that he has to go to the box to have the crosses.’ Rasmus Hojlund The young Dane has already demonstrated that he can score in the Premier League with 16 goals coming in all competitions across his debut season, but under Amorim must now show he can be United’s leading striker.      Rasmus Hojlund must now show Amorim must he can be United’s leading goalscorer      It was hoped Hojlund’s second-half introduction against Ipswich would put the hosts defence under pressure  Amorim departed Sporting with Victor Gyokeres starring as one of Europe’s most prolific goalscorers and now at United must now work the same wonders with Hojlund, who started on the bench with Rashford given the lone striker role. The two players share similar traits and it was hoped Hojlund’s second-half introduction against Ipswich would put the hosts defence under pressure but instead proved easy to manhandle. One particularly frustrating moment came when Hojlund had the ball rolled into feet with his back to goal but instead of trying to spin the defender and cut a shooting angle, opted to pass back. Admittedly, Hojlund has seen his season disrupted by injuries, but won’t be given long to prove himself to Amorim who will demand more from his only recognised striker.

And so, while they fumbled and failed to make the right connections, West Ham twice walked through an open door at the other end. It was the get-out-of-jail win that their manager Julen Lopetegui so badly needed. He had two games to save his job coming into this and the suspicion was that a bad night on Tyneside could well accelerate his departure. This, however, was a very good night, certainly his best away from the London Stadium.   Lopetegui was booked in the first half – his third of the season – meaning he will be in the stands for Saturday’s visit of Arsenal. And given how energetic and involved the Spaniard was on the touchline, his players will miss his presence at the weekend.  Now there is a statement you never imagined making with fans having called for Lopetegui to go in recent weeks. But thanks to goals from Tomas Soucek and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, the Hammers are now just three points behind Newcastle, who were expecting to march into the top six with a third straight win here.      West Ham stunned Newcastle to secure a 2-0 win during their visit to St James’ Park      Tomas Soucek wheeled away in celebration after scoring a header in the 10th minute      Aaron Wan-Bissaka then doubled their advantage with a neatly taken finish in the second-half The story of their night is becoming an increasingly familiar one. Not able to play on the break and to the strengths of speed merchants such as Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon, they had a lot of the ball but did nowhere near enough with it.  NUFC (4-2-3-1): Pope 5; Livramento 6, Schar 5, Kelly 4.5, Hall 6; Longstaff 5 (Tonali 57, 5), Guimaraes 5.5, Willock 5 (Barnes 46, 5); Joelinton 6 (Murphy 69, 5), Isak 6, Gordon 5.5 (Wilson 68, 5) Subs: Dubravka, Trippier, Tonali, Wilson, Targett, Osula, Murphy, Almiron Scorers: Bookings: Kelly Manager: Eddie Howe 5 WHUFC (4-1-4-1): Fabianski 7.5; Wan-Bissaka 8, Todibo 6 (Mavropanos 57, 6.5), Kilman 7, Emerson 7.5; Bowen 7, Paqueta 7, Soler 7, Soucek 7, Summerville 6.5; Antonio 7 Subs: Areola, Cresswell, Coufal, Guilherme, Rodríguez, Irving, Scarles, Ings Scorers: Soucek 10, Wan-Bissaka 54 Bookings: Manager: Julen Lopetegui 7 Ref: C Pawson 7 Att: 52,094 MOM: Wan-Bissaka Howe’s team are at their best with space in front of them to exploit. The truth is, they are better when they have less of the ball.  They were hardly helped by some atrocious defending for West Ham’s two goals, either. Soucek scored the first on 10 minutes, after the opening exchanges were dominated by the Magpies. Such a bad goal was it to concede, Soucek, at 6ft 4ins, was able to duck to connect with Emerson’s corner. It all seemed to happen in slow motion. From the moment of the Brazilian’s delivery, when defender Lloyd Kelly lost his man and his mind, it was obvious to all inside St James’ how this one would play out.  Soucek, from whom Kelly bizarrely stepped away, planted his feet in the ground and his free header into the bottom corner. You would not have known this was Newcastle’s first concession from a corner this season – 69 defended successfully – because this was a woeful way to fall behind. It rattled the hosts and inspired the visitors, who looked the most likely scorers in the 10 minutes that followed. The 3,600 travelling Hammers were even enjoying it, and it’s not often you’ve said that about them away from East London this season. ‘How s*** must you be, we’re winning away?’ they crowed. They were quieter come half-time, as their team were forced on the back foot and began to chance their luck. But they got lucky.  When Jean Clair-Todibo gifted Newcastle their best chance of the half, scuffing an attempted clearance inside the six-yard area, Gordon could only slam the loose ball straight into the midriff of Lukasz Fabianski. At least he found the target, unlike eight of his side’s first-half attempts on goal. Isak was the biggest culprit, even though that feels harsh given he was also Newcastle’s most dangerous player.      Newcastle had no answer to the Hammers’ resolute defence after going a goal behind      Wan-Bissaka’s strike was his first time finding the back of the net since joining West Ham   But on two occasions of note he lashed wide from good positions. With four goals in as many matches, they were the sort of chances he has been taking of late. Newcastle finished the half in control but without looking particular likely to get on terms, given the paucity of quality in their final ball. There were other openings for Lewis Hall and Joe Willock that failed to trouble Fabianski. Howe responded at the break by bringing on Harvey Barnes – the manager denies he’s a supersub, but that has been his best use in 15 months at the club – and Newcastle were still playing the majority of the football in the opposition half when West Ham went up the other end and made it two. They were aided by the home side’s casual resistance, as if they did not expect the visitors to show the ambition to go for a second.  But that they did, and their ambition was evidenced by the sight of right back Aaron Wan-Bissaka breaking into the area to score his first goal for the club.  In fact, it was his first goal in three years for any club. Never mind keeping his position to safeguard against the arrival of Barnes, he spotted a gap and went for it.  Jarrod Bowen found his run and Wan-Bissaka drew low across Nick Pope and into the bottom corner. After that, it was all relatively easy, and it’s not often been that for West Ham and Lopetegui this season. Your email address will not be published.

Amorim got his first taste of English football on Sunday away to Ipswich Town, where a new-look United in a 3-4-3 system were held to a 1-1 draw. Marcus Rashford’s early opening strike inside two minutes gave Amorim the perfect start to his reign, only for Ipswich to force themselves back into proceedings with Omari Hutchinson scoring a stunning long-range effort before half-time.    During Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football show, Carragher took the opportunity to dissect Amorim’s tactical set-up and revealed what he believes is their downfall.  He said: ‘I hear a lot of managers including Ruben Amorim saying systems don’t matter too much. I believe that they do, no matter how many times managers tell me they don’t because, well why do you play a different system? Different systems give you different things in different areas. ‘For me, the weaknesses are in these spaces here, either side of the two central midfield players. The reason why is, when you play a conventional back four, your wide man can tuck in and help.       Ruben Amorim was held to a draw against Ipswich in his first game as Man United manager       Jamie Carragher has since offered his opinion on United’s tactical set-up under Amorim   ‘But because you play a back three, when they get the ball they naturally go wider and wing backs go wider and higher. It means there’s a lot more space around these two central midfield players, especially if the two attacking 10s don’t drop back. There were the same issues on the Ipswich side as well. ‘The big problem is – is it a midfielder who should drop in to fill that space or should a centre-back step in with someone?  ‘We listened to Ruben Amorim after the game and he spoke a lot about Jonny Evans not making that jump into the space to pick up a man. Because they played the same system, it almost became a man-to-man game. Football has become that.’ Shared spoils helped United climb to 12th in the league standings and while it was a mixed showing, Amorim’s preferred 3-4-3 system did get some joy against Ipswich. The attacking formation is new for United’s stars and will take time to adjust to – as Amorim admitted – with the former Sporting Lisbon boss only afforded a couple of days training to work with his squad before his first game in charge. Amorim praised his players for trying to understand his vision after such a short period of time together. Speaking after the match, Amorim said: ‘Bruno Fernandes, I think he improved his game by playing nearer the ball, feeling the ball, so he can give us sometimes the long pass. ‘But you can not put him there all the time because he wants the long pass all the time. So we try to find things about the players, we will need a lot of time to work out these things.      The Red Devils started well against Ipswich after scoring early but quickly began to fade    ‘Sometimes people talk about the 3-4-3, that is not the concern, the system is the system but the understanding of the game is what we have to improve a lot in this area.’  Meanwhile, Diogo Dalot hailed the immediate impact of ‘big personality’ Amorim, claiming the new boss is exactly what Manchester United need to get back on top. ‘It’s gone really well,’ Dalot said. ‘He made an impact straight away, in terms of his philosophy and the way he wants us to play. ‘It suits the standards of the club. High intensity football and working hard for the team. We just need to put it into practice now.’ Your email address will not be published.

Spurs have confirmed that Vicario has undergone an operation after suffering the injury in the 4-0 win over the Premier League champions on Saturday. And Mail Sport can confirm Vicario suffered the fracture from the impact of Savinho’s challenge in the first-half.   The shot stopper required on-field treatment to treat the damage, but the Italian continued and played the rest of the match. But he complained of major pain after the final whistle and tests have flagged a break, which has required an operation. ‘We can confirm that Gugliemo Vicario has on Monday undergone surgery for a fracture of his right ankle,’ read a Spurs statement.      Tottenham goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario suffered a fractured ankle in their win over Man City      The Spurs goalkeeper faces months on sidelines after the collision with City’s Savinho      Vicario later took to Instagram to update supporters after undergoing surgery on Monday ‘The 28-year-old suffered the injury during Saturday’s Premier League victory at Manchester City. ‘Guglielmo will be assessed by our medical staff to determine when he can return to training.’ The news arrived as a surprise to Vicario’s Tottenham’s team-mates on Monday, who had no inclination of the severity of the injury after the game. Vicario is crucial to the way head coach Ange Postecoglou sets up his team given the keeper’s ability to pass from the back. Former England Fraser Forster is expected to deputise for Vicario. He later posted on Instagram: ‘Sometimes football gives you its highs, and sometimes it challenges you in ways you don’t expect. I played 60 minutes at the Etihad with a broken bone in my ankle, giving absolutely everything I had for the team. Unfortunately there was no way around this one. ‘I needed surgery. I’m disappointed I won’t be able to help the team for a while. A massive thank you to the doctors and the staff. The operation went well, and from tomorrow I’ll be working hard to come back stronger, fitter, and ready to give my all for you again. Thank you to the Spurs fans for all the love.

The stunning ring girl, 20, went viral earlier this month after stealing the show during Jake Paul’s controversial fight against Mike Tyson in Texas, with fans quickly labeling her the ‘real winner’ after the main event failed to live up to the hype. Her following on TikTok has skyrocketed to the one-million mark in the wake of Paul vs Tyson, and now Thomas has sparked a frenzy on social media once more with her latest post from Vegas on Sunday.   Sydney shared a photo of herself wearing a stunning see-through top underneath a black leather jacket in the stands at Allegiant Stadium, where she watched the Raiders slump to a 29-19 loss against the Broncos. Nevertheless, the Tuscaloosa girl still said she had a ‘great time’ in Vegas despite the home team’s latest underwhelming display. Thomas was one of five ring girls working at the Paul vs Tyson fight – along with Virginia Sanhouse, Lexi Williams, Delia Sylvain and Raphaela Milagres.       Sydney Thomas has shown off the revealing outfit she wore to the Raiders vs Broncos game  As well as seeing her TikTok popularity soar, she also now has 735,000 followers on Instagram after generating attention in Texas. ‘My DMs are just insanely flooded right now,’ Thomas recently told US Weekly. ‘There’s definitely been some pretty big names and brands that have reached out.’ ‘I woke up and saw how my followers had gone up, and then saw all the news articles that had been written about me,’ Thomas added.  ‘I refreshed my feed and it was just pictures of me and memes and everything.

Now, ex-Reds defender Carragher has spoken out and labelled the Egyptian ‘selfish’ for his comments.  Speaking on Sky Sports, Carragher said: ‘Of course there’s been discussions. Right now, there’s obvious there’s a big difference in valuation, how Salah and his agent value themselves, in terms of length of contract, and how Liverpool do.  ‘So the reason Liverpool wouldn’t have offered a contract yet is because Mo Salah will turn it down.
