The two schools, separated by just 100 miles, will play each other in a neutral-site early season tournament for the second straight year. Last season, the Hoosiers used a 13-2 run over the final 3:38 to pull out a 74-66 win in the third-place game in the Empire Classic in New York. The Cardinals (3-1) have won two straight since losing to then-No. 12 Tennessee 77-55. The last time they were two games over .500 came in late January 2022. Louisville won at home Friday, beating Winthrop 76-61 despite a season-high 20 turnovers. Coach Pat Kelsey employs a balanced attack and rotates several players throughout the game. No player averages more than 27.3 minutes per game, and five average 10 or more points per game. Louisville's top two scorers, guard Reyne Smith (14.8 points per game) and forward Kasean Pryor (12.8), have yet to start a game. This will be the second trip to the Bahamas for Kelsey's Cardinals. The team played in the Baha Mar Hoops Summer League and registered two blowout victories. After the Cardinals beat Winthrop on Friday, the first-year Louisville coach said his squad has potential but still needs work. That said, he added he's seen his team, which returned only one walk-on from last season's 8-24 team, show significant growth. ""All these guys come from parts all over the place, from different programs that have different terminology,"" Kelsey said. ""Basketball is a universal language, but everybody calls something something different. I think now they're sort of getting in the groove where they really, really know conceptually and from a terminology standpoint exactly what we do."" The Hoosiers (4-0) did not need the wholesale roster changes Louisville required in the transfer portal as coach Mike Woodson had three starters return from last season. Forward Mackenzie Mgbako, who started all 33 games as a freshman in 2023-24, leads Indiana with 18.8 points a game. Myles Rice, a guard who played at Washington State last season, ranks second with 14.8 points. Indiana last played on Thursday, beating UNC Greensboro 69-58. The Hoosiers jumped out to a 17-3 lead, but the Spartans rallied to tie the score at 40 just four minutes into the second half before Woodson's team pulled away for good. ""We've got to go and clean this game up before I start thinking about the Bahamas,"" Woodson said after the win. Despite the vastly different roster from last season, Louisville will have some experience playing against the Hoosiers. Starting point guard Chucky Hepburn played the previous three seasons for Wisconsin and earned All-Defensive Team honors in the Big Ten last season. In two games last season against Indiana, he scored 21 points, grabbed eight rebounds, dished out eight assists and registered five steals. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",Take 5: Candidates to replace Mack Brown at UNC,https://deadspin.com/take-5-candidates-to-replace-mack-brown-at-unc/,2024-11-26T18:02:45.240Z,"North Carolina will usher in a new era after announcing Tuesday that head coach Mack Brown will not return next season.,So, where do the Tar Heels tur","North Carolina will usher in a new era after announcing Tuesday that head coach Mack Brown will not return next season. So, where do the Tar Heels turn next as they move on from the winningest coach in program history? Athletic director Bubba Cunningham got a head start on the process with the Tar Heels, the first program from a power conference to part ways with their head coach this season. Here are five potential top candidates for an appealing opportunity to take over a quality ACC program: Matt Campbell, Iowa State It wouldn't be a coaching cycle if Campbell's name wasn't tied to a vacancy at a prominent program. Still just 44 years old, Campbell is already in his ninth season in Ames, where he has posted a 62-50 record. That includes a 9-2 mark this season. The Ohio native and three-time Big 12 Coach of the Year has rebuffed numerous overtures in the past to move on from Iowa State, but that won't stop other programs from continuing to knock on his door. Jamey Chadwell, Liberty The well-traveled Chadwell has had his name tied to UNC as a potential replacement for Brown for some time. He spent stints at Charleston Southern and Coastal Carolina, among other stops, before taking over at Liberty, where he has posted a 21-3 record and led the Flames to a spot in last season's Fiesta Bowl after going 13-0 in the regular season. The Tennessee native led Coastal Carolina to an 11-0 start and as high as No. 9 in the Associated Press poll in 2020 before a bowl game loss to Liberty, somewhat ironically. Chadwell was named the AP College Coach of the Year following the season -- a first for the Sun Belt Conference. Andy Kotelnicki, Penn State (OC) Kotelnicki lacks head coaching experience, but the 43-year-old is considered one of the brightest young offensive minds in college football. Before landing at Penn State this year, Kotelnicki served as the offensive coordinator at Buffalo (2015-2020) and Kansas (2021-23). A center for the University of Wisconsin-River Falls, the Minnesota native began his coaching career as an offensive assistant at Western Illinois in 2004. Alex Golesh, South Florida Another highly respected offensive mind, Golesh took over a program that went 1-11 the year before his arrival. The Bulls went 7-6 in his first season and are 6-5 so far this year. Despite being just 40 years old, he would provide UNC with head coaching experience following time as an assistant at Tennessee, Iowa State, UCF and Illinois. Golesh has a fascinating background, having attended Ohio State after being born in Moscow and growing up in Brooklyn before his family moved to Dublin, Ohio. He began his coaching career as a high school defensive line coach in 2003. Barry Odom, UNLV Odom, 47, has lifted the Rebels to arguably the best level in program history in just two seasons. UNLV is 9-2 this year with a shot at making the College Football Playoff, and is 18-7 over the past two seasons. Odom, who took over at his alma mater at Missouri following the retirement of Gary Pinkel, got his second crack at a head coaching gig after doing a remarkable job as Arkansas' defensive coordinator from 2020-22. With his track record, Odom could have his pick of multiple openings as more Power Four vacancies become available over the next several weeks. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""Played a lot of hockey for us over the years. It's good to have a guy like that in the lineup."" The Canucks are 7-1-0 on the road entering the game against the Bruins. Boeser, 27, recorded 11 points (six goals, five assists) in 12 games before the injury.

The fine stems from Brown charging the refs after a foul was not called following Colby Jones' drive to the basket in the second quarter of the Kings' 108-103 loss to the visiting Brooklyn Nets on Sunday. Brown, instead, was assessed a technical foul. Brown, 54, previously has been punished by the league for his conduct toward officials. He was fined $50,000 on Jan. 16, two days after entering the court of play while yelling at referee Intae Hwang, leading to the coach's ejection in a 143-142 overtime loss at the Milwaukee Bucks. Brown then used a laptop during his postgame press conference to point out multiple calls with which he disagreed. In 2012, when he coached the Los Angeles Lakers, Brown was suspended one game without pay and fined $25,000 for making contact with an official. A two-time NBA Coach of the Year, Brown has a 449-296 career record as head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers, Lakers and Kings. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The first back-to-back national champion head coach since Billy Donovan. An offensive mastermind whose X’s and O’s make LeBron James swoon. And a guy from Jersey with a short fuse who works the refs the way most elite college basketball coaches do. Hurley’s mind was on officiating long before his No. 2 UConn Huskies flew to Hawaii for the Maui Invitational, telling reporters last week that he was keenly aware their low-major opponents were getting to the line more than them despite obvious size and talent discrepancies. UConn got an objectively terrible whistle in its opening game Monday against Memphis. But Hurley has got to do a better job of containing his outrage in close-game situations. Because of Hurley’s technical foul in overtime, UConn’s 99-97 loss is on him. Let’s set the scene: It’s a tremendous back-and-forth game between the Huskies and Tigers that UConn’s Solo Ball sent to overtime with a last-second triple in regulation. The Huskies soon have a three-point lead erased by Colby Rogers’ 3-pointer, and on UConn’s next trip, Liam McNeeley is called for an over-the-back foul when reaching for an offensive rebound—nevermind that McNeeley has about five inches on Memphis’ guy. Hurley blows a gasket on the nearest official. His associate head coach Kimani Young has to play the role of get-back coach, but Hurley drops to the ground at one point and says just enough to get T’d up. What was going to be two Memphis free throws is now four, and PJ Carter sinks all of them. Though UConn lost by exactly two, Hurley told CBS Sports it wasn’t his technical that made the difference. “I think it was the s---y calls,” he said, adding, “I would expect to come to play in an event, and I don’t know too many back-to-back national championship teams that get that type of a whistle.” He didn’t tap the brakes at the postgame podium, either, saying the Memphis player “made a half-ass effort to rebound that basketball and Liam McNeeley high-pointed that rebound.” As for falling to the floor: “I don’t know what happened. I might have lost my balance by the absurdity of the call,” Hurley said, “or maybe I tripped.” And here’s the thing: I agree he’s right about the call! Most reasonable people on basketball Twitter (or Bluesky) do. But Hurley, of course, was letting the referees have it from the jump, sure that his blueblood Huskies were getting disrespected. There was a technical called on the UConn bench early in the game, though Hurley later said his mild-mannered medical trainer “must have said something under his breath in a huddle.” Sure, Jan. Call me a pearl-clutcher all you want, but after giving Hurley a long leash throughout the game, the referees had every right and reason to T him up late in overtime when he appears to be screaming obscenities at them. Nobody I know likes it when poor officiating takes over a game. It’s hardly unique to college basketball, by the way, and I’m 100% for holding bad refs and umpires more accountable. But from a coach who is going to go down as one of the modern greats, I’d have liked to see more accountability from him too, if only after the fact. If you’re known as the guy who’s outraged all the time, you might not be taken seriously when something truly egregious goes against you. Copyright 2024"

Should the struggling Pittsburgh Penguins follow suit and part ways wit,"The Boston Bruins fired their coach, Jim Montgomery, and won their first game under the direction of Joe Sacco. The St. Louis Blues fired their coach, Drew Bannister, and won their first game with the aforementioned Montgomery on the bench. Are the Pittsburgh Penguins desperate enough for a single win to mercifully fire coach Mike Sullivan, hoping that trend will continue? OK, likely not. At least it’s not likely the Penguins make Sullivan walk the plank because of the results elsewhere. The Penguins most likely would fire Sullivan simply because that is about the only meaningful arrow in the quiver held by general manager Kyle Dubas. The time is at hand for drastic measures in the Steel City. Even so, drastic measures will not change the destination the Penguins are hurtling toward. The Penguins are headed right where they were at the turn of the century, all the way to the basement. Crazy as it seems, it appears the trip will be full circle for Sidney Crosby, whose arrival became the turning point for the franchise when the 2004 draft lottery went Pittsburgh’s way. Since that day, the Penguins have enjoyed nearly two decades of prosperity and three Stanley Cups—no small feat in a salary cap league. But those steak and lobster days are in the past for the Penguins. If there was any need for proof, their last two games showed exactly what this team is about right now. Last Friday, the Penguins were toyed with by the Winnipeg Jets in a 4-1 loss. The follow-up performance was even more dismal, a 6-1 beatdown at the hands of the Utah Hockey Club, who are below the NHL’s version of .500. The highlight in that span was Crosby’s 600th career goal. The second most interesting aspect was Crosby fighting Winnipeg’s Kyle Connor, both a testament to his competitiveness and an indictment on the rest of the team for not showing the same gladiator spirit. Did we mention both of those Penguins losses came on home ice? That makes the picture even uglier. And unlike the Bruins and Blues, the Penguins look nothing like a team that could contend for a playoff spot. The Bruins, although not the power of the past years, were a team that a shakeup could possibly help, while the Blues are good enough to be a mushy-middle squad but could make some noise with a bunch of luck. The Penguins, however, have shown little reason to believe their fortunes can change. Offensively, the lack of talent after Crosby and Evgeni Malkin is jarring. The move to acquire Erik Karlsson has not provided near the production and made the Penguins more defensively suspect. The mess is worse thanks to the below-mediocre defense corps and downright awful goaltending, especially from Tristan Jarry, who is in the second season of a five-year, $26.9 million contract that is already appearing as an anchor on the organization. As a result, they are a team with the league’s worst goals-against average while in the bottom quarter offensively heading into Wednesday’s home clash with the Vancouver Canucks. Worse yet, there is little good news on the horizon, even though Pittsburgh has missed the playoffs the past two seasons. The Penguins have one of the league’s worst prospect pools, with only a few hopefuls who look to be more than simply depth players, namely defenseman Owen Pickering and forward Rutger McGroarty. Even so, neither of them are the next Crosby, Letang, Malkin or even Chris Kunitz.  It should surprise nobody if the Penguins are next to make a coaching change. Nor should it surprise anybody that the club will continue to slip and slide down the standings. Copyright 2024"

After all, any team that has Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard better be fighting for a top playoff spot, and it’s mainly been Antetokounmpo that has been helping the Bucks recover from a 2-8 start. Since its brutal 10-game rut, Milwaukee has gone 6-1, getting 33.4 points, 10.9 rebounds and 7.9 assists per game from Antetokounmpo during that stretch. Miami -- like many teams -- has struggled to contain Antetokounmpo, with the two-time MVP getting anything he wants against the Heat as of late. Over his past five games (regular and postseason) against Miami, Antetokounmpo has gone for at least 33 points three times, hauled in at least 10 rebounds four times and dished out a minimum of eight assists twice. Why would he ever take his foot off the gas on Tuesday?

Following a successful debut season that ended with Minnesota beating Boston in five games to hoist the Walter Cup, the PWHL will return to action Saturday with the beginning of a 30-game regular season (up from 24) for all six teams.  The upcoming campaign will feature plenty of newness, including the much-anticipated team identities, new home arenas and neutral-site games, rule changes and a new class of rookies. Here's a look at what to expect as the PWHL returns: What's new and different in 2024-25 The most noticeable difference entering Year 2 is the introduction of team names and logos, as the six squads were originally identified by their geographic locations. The new season will mark the debut of the Boston Fleet, Minnesota Frost, Montreal Victoire, New York Sirens, Ottawa Charge and Toronto Sceptres. The PWHL continues to innovate when it comes to rule changes. This season, the league will become the first in professional hockey to assess a major and game misconduct as the default penalty for illegal checks to the head, while a new ""No Escape Rule"" will require players on a penalized team, with time on the clock, to remain on the ice until after play resumes. New York will call Prudential Center, home of the NHL's New Jersey Devils, its primary venue after splitting inaugural-season home games between three venues. Toronto moves into Coca-Cola Coliseum, which hosted three sold-out playoff contests last spring. Montreal will play most of its games at another AHL venue, Place Bell.  New York also made a head coaching change, replacing Howie Draper with Greg Fargo, who spent the last 12 seasons at Colgate University. Who to watch for Reigning PWHL MVP Natalie Spooner (league-leading 20 goals, seven assists last season) returns to Toronto but still is out recovering from May surgery to repair a torn ACL after being injured in the playoffs. Kristen Campbell won a league-leading 16 games in goal, posting three shutouts, a 1.99 goals-against average and a .927 save percentage. Sarah Nurse also scored 11 goals for last season's first-place team. Daryl Watts, a free agent in the offseason, left Ottawa for her hometown Sceptres. The first captain to hoist the Walter Cup in May, Minnesota's Kendall Coyne Schofield, returns to anchor the Frost alongside leading rookie scorer Grace Zumwinkle (11 goals) and Nicole Hensley, the first-ever goaltender drafted into the PWHL in 2023. The original No. 1 overall pick, Taylor Heise, returns after earning Ilana Kloss Playoff MVP honors. Montreal returns stars such as Marie-Philip Poulin and Laura Stacey, both of whom scored double-digit goals in the inaugural season. Swedish star Lina Ljungblom, the final 2023 draft pick, joins the fold on a deeper Victoire team after finishing her contract in her native country. Boston returns the stellar Aerin Frankel in net and Megan Keller on defense but will need to increase offense from a season ago despite retaining captain Hilary Knight and the runner-up for Rookie of the Year, Alina Muller. Forward Hannah Bilka was the Fleet's top draft pick. In Ottawa, the Charge return a pair of key scorers in Brianne Jenner and Katerina Mrazova and top defenders Savannah Harmon and Ashton Bell. Drafting Gwyneth Philips gives Emerance Maschmeyer competition for the net. New York looks to climb from the basement with the help of 2024 No. 1 overall draft pick Sarah Fillier, who signed a three-year contract after a 43-point senior campaign at Princeton. Also returning are top scorer Alex Carpenter and defender Ella Shelton, a teammate of Fillier's with Team Canada at last April's Women's World Championship. Key dates Following the training camp/exhibition schedule, rosters are to be declared by 5 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday. Saturday's season-opening doubleheader features Toronto hosting Boston and Ottawa visiting Montreal, while Minnesota's title defense begins Sunday against visiting New York. After playing in Detroit and Pittsburgh last season, the PWHL Takeover Tour will bring the action to nine neutral sites in 2024-25: Buffalo; Denver; Detroit; Raleigh, N.C.; St. Louis; Seattle; Quebec City; Vancouver, British Columbia; and one to-be-announced location. The first stop on the tour will be Jan. 5 in Seattle, where Montreal and Boston will square off at Climate Pledge Arena. The regular-season slate runs through May 3. International breaks are included for the Women's Euro Hockey Tour (December), the conclusion of the U.S.-Canada Rivalry Series (February), and Women's Worlds (April). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Auburn (5-0) completed its rally from a 16-point halftime deficit and a gap of as many as 18 points against No. 5 Iowa State in dramatic fashion.  Tough defensive pressure forced an Iowa State turnover, and Auburn's Johni Broome came up with it.  On the change of possession, Broome rolled to the rim after setting a screen for Denver Jones, and Broome tipped Jones' missed shot attempt in with one second remaining. The putback broke an 81-81 stalemate to give Auburn the 83-81 victory, its second over a top-five-ranked opponent this season.  The Tigers beat then-No. 4 Houston on Nov. 9, 74-69.  ""Not since 1990 when Kansas did it has a team started 5-0 with two top-five wins,"" Auburn coach Bruce Pearl noted in his postgame press conference. ""So, to this point, we've made history. But we're not celebrating.""  The Tigers don't have much time to bask in the afterglow of their comeback victory, turning around for Tuesday's semifinal vs. a North Carolina team that rallied from 21 points down early in the second half against Dayton.  The Tar Heels (4-1) surrendered a 14-0 run in the first half, which was the catalyst for Dayton scoring 31 points in the final nine minutes before halftime. The Flyers took an 18-point lead into intermission.  Behind RJ Davis' 30 points, seven rebounds and five assists, and Seth Trimble's 27 points and 10 rebounds, North Carolina chipped away throughout the second half en route to a 92-90 win. Among Davis' assists was a driving bounce pass that found Drake Powell in the corner for what proved to be the ultimate go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:13 remaining in regulation.  Tar Heels coach Hubert Davis said his team needs to avoid digging deep holes. North Carolina previously fell behind by 15 points at halftime on Nov. 8 at No. 1 Kansas, and the team's furious second-half rally then fell just short in a 92-89 loss.  ""This isn't sustainable. You can't do this every game,"" Davis said in his postgame press conference. ""That's going to be one of the major steps with this team. Can they play with a sense of urgency on both sides of the floor? Can they start there, and can they stay there for a full 40 minutes?"" ""Those are things we'll talk about ... in preparation for playing Auburn,"" he added.    Central to being prepared to play Auburn is preparing for Broome. His closing sequence on Monday capped a 21-point, 10-rebound effort from the 2023-24 third-team All-American.  Broome carries three straight double-doubles into Tuesday's semifinal, having gone for 18 points and 12 rebounds on Nov. 13 vs. Kent State, and 30 points with 17 rebounds vs. North Alabama on Nov. 18.  Auburn has six players averaging in double-figures scoring per game, led by Broome at 20.2. Among them, Chad Baker-Mazara added 18 points on Monday, and Miles Kelly and Jones each had 12.  Baker-Mazara finished Monday's game despite coming up limping at one point after bumping knees with an Iowa State defender. His postgame comments suggest he will be ready to play on Tuesday.  ""I always say, my mama raised a warrior. If I'm not dead, I'm going out there on the court,"" he said.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Dayton (5-1) can tell a similar tale, as it surrendered a 21-point lead in a 92-90 defeat to No. 12 North Carolina.  For Iowa State (3-1), everything was going according to plan in the first half on Monday before it all came apart in an 83-81 loss to No. 4 Auburn. The Cyclones, who entered the tournament with the top scoring defense in Division I, used their suffocating on-ball presence to disrupt the Tigers' ball movement and limit their open shots as they built an 18-point lead.  But everything changed after intermission, as Auburn scored 50 points while shooting 54.5 percent from the floor. ""At the start of the second half, they were the more aggressive team,"" Iowa State coach T.J. Otzelberger said, mentioning the Tigers' 11-0 edge in second-chance points. The Cyclones had a chance to win as they had the ball in a tie game in the closing seconds. But as Keshon Gilbert drove to the top of the key while trying to split defenders, he lost possession and the Tigers' Johni Broome recovered the loose ball. At the other end of the floor, Broome tipped in the winning basket with 1.2 seconds left. On a night in which his minutes were limited by foul trouble, Gilbert had played brilliantly to that point, scoring 23 points on 8-of-10 shooting.  Iowa State also received 14 points off the bench from Curtis Jones, 13 from Dishon Jackson and 12 from Milan Momcilovic. On Tuesday, both teams will look to solve their second-half woes.  ""They got 59 points in the second half,"" Dayton coach Anthony Grant said of the Tar Heels. ""We weren't able to keep them off the free-throw line. They were able to get a rhythm."" Down the stretch, Dayton had no answer for North Carolina's backcourt. RJ Davis scored 20 of his 30 points in the second half and Seth Trimble collected 27 points and 10 rebounds. Less than three minutes into the second half, Dayton had its biggest lead of the game, 56-35, before North Carolina made a spirited rally. Dayton placed six players in double figures, led by Nate Santos (15 points) and Amael L'Etang (13 points). Enoch Cheeks had 11 points and eight rebounds while Posh Alexander contributed 11 points and six assists. The Flyers' defense, however, surrendered 59.4 percent shooting by North Carolina in the second half and 7-of-12 (58.3 percent) accuracy from deep. ""We got a quick turnaround,"" Grant said. ""We've gotta be able to quickly regroup, be resilient, be ready to go.""  Iowa State hopes to find fuel from the disappointing result in the opening round. ""We'll use the feeling that we have, the frustration and the disappointment that we have to our advantage and bounce back (on Tuesday) and play great,"" Otzelberger said. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

A night after outlasting Missouri State in an overtime thriller, the Eagles (5-1) will take on Boise State (5-1) in the tournament's championship game Tuesday in George Town, Cayman Islands. Elijah Strong's second 3-pointer of the extra session, coming with 4.1 seconds remaining, was the difference in the 76-74 victory over the Bears. Boston College is now within one win of its first multi-team event victory since 2018-19. ""Obviously, that was a ‘gritty, not pretty' (win), right?"" coach Earl Grant said. He added that in the Missouri Valley Conference, in which Missouri State competes, ""the games were always in the 50s with a few minutes to go, so I knew it would be a grinder. I'm glad we won it. We needed that for growth. ""We came here ... for an early opportunity to compete for a championship, and our hope is still alive."" Strong scored eight of his 13 points in overtime, while fellow sophomores Donald Hand Jr. and Fred Payne each had 18 for the Eagles. Payne, who had multiple injuries shorten his freshman season to five games, has scored in double digits for three straight contests. He began the trip to the Cayman Islands with 11 points in 14 minutes of the Eagles' 82-52 win over Old Dominion on Sunday. ""The game kind of presented different things with foul trouble, so other guys had to step up and make plays,"" Grant said. ""Fred did a beautiful job. ... and then Elijah delivered some huge shots late."" While Boston College's latest game featured 16 lead changes and eight ties, Boise State is coming off an 83-82 win over South Dakota State in which the score flipped 17 times and tied on 13 occasions. The second free throw of a one-and-one that rolled off the rim was the difference. ""What a heck of a game,"" Boise State coach Leon Rice said. ""When you play a team that shoots like they can, it's pretty tough. ... Our guys just hung with it."" Javan Buchanan scored a season-high 28 points to lead the Broncos, who shot 47.5 percent from the field. Buchanan went 11-of-17 from the field, including four 3-pointers and a layup with 63 seconds left in the game. Tyson Degenhart (11 points) has scored in double figures in all six games, while Alvaro Cardenas had 16 points with seven assists, and Julian Bowie was a perfect 4-for-4 from the field for 11 points. Rice has seen the team's shooting as an early-season strength. ""I know we can shoot. I know that's a big weapon, so (South Dakota State) kind of picked their poison there,"" he said. ""Javon was a big hero (Monday) and so was Julian, but we've got a lot of other guys that will step up and surprise some people."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Tigers will be back in action Tuesday against Michigan State in the Maui Invitational semifinals in Lahaina, Hawaii. Memphis (5-0) squandered a 13-point lead with four minutes to play against UConn, but regrouped in the extra session. PJ Carter made all six of his free throws in the final 40 seconds of overtime, including four following a technical foul on UConn coach Danny Hurley that broke a 92-92 tie. ""All these games have come down to us just being the toughest team,"" Hardaway said. ""Man, it's a great feeling to win this game."" Memphis recorded its first victory against a top-five team since 2023, when it beat No. 1 Houston in the American Athletic Conference tournament's championship game. ""We had to be very tough -- very tough,"" Hardaway said. ""I'm super proud of these guys. It does a lot for our program, our city. It does a lot for us. It really does."" Memphis went 12 of 22 on 3-point attempts against the Huskies. Tyrese Hunter scored 17 of his game-high 26 points after halftime and was 7 of 10 from 3-point range overall. The Tigers are shooting 47.9 percent from behind the 3-point arc through their first five games. ""I think it came down to all the preparation and the work that we put in,"" Hunter said. ""Trust in our players. I know (they) got the technical foul, send PJ right to the line. We know he's going to knock 'em down. We see him knock 'em down all the time. We trust him. ""I think we learned that no matter what happens, shake it off and quickly move on. If mistakes happen, learn from it and move on."" Michigan State (5-1) received a career-high 13 points from freshman Jase Richardson and advanced with a 72-56 victory over Colorado in Monday's second game. Richardson was the only Michigan State player who scored in double figures, but the Spartans received 40 points from their non-starters. The Spartans got seven points and eight rebounds from Szymon Zapala, and Frankie Fidler finished with nine points and six rebounds. The Spartans won despite shooting 2 of 21 from 3-point territory, including missing their first 14 tries. They survived in part because Colorado shot 37 percent from the field overall. ""Is (3-point shooting) a concern? Of course it's a concern,"" Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said. ""We've got our work cut out for us (Tuesday)."" Izzo said Memphis will present a much different challenge than Colorado did. ""Completely different team,"" he said. ""We've played so many different kinds of teams, like Samford was pressing all over the place. Memphis -- they have guards who are quicker than God.

Schieffelin and Clemson aim for the tournament title Tuesday against unbeaten Penn State in what figures to be a classic contrast in styles. The Tigers (5-1) will try to slow the game down and use their size advantage, specifically Schieffelin, to neutralize the Nittany Lions (6-0) and their pressure defense.  Schieffelin is averaging 12.8 points and 10.8 rebounds. He's the only player in the Atlantic Coast Conference to average at least 11 points, 10 rebounds and three assists. ""He is so physically tough,"" Clemson coach Brad Brownell said of Schieffelin. ""He just wills himself to rebound the basketball. We need him to score double-figure points."" Guard Chase Hunter paces the Tigers' offense at 16.3 ppg, while Cincinnati transfer Viktor Lakhin chips in 11.8. Meanwhile, Penn State will attack with a potent backcourt and constant full-court pressure. It reached the championship game with an easy 85-66 win in Monday's first semifinal against Fordham, establishing a 22-point lead with less than 10 minutes left and cruising from there. Nick Kern came off the bench for 20 points and 13 rebounds for the Nittany Lions, leading five scorers in double figures. ""Nick Kern, he's a hard-rocking dude. That's the best way to explain him,"" Penn State coach Mike Rhoades said. ""He listens, he's coachable, but in competition he's just tough."" Zach Hicks' 15.8 ppg leads five Nittany Lions in double figures. The backcourt of Ace Baldwin (15.7) and Puff Johnson (11.5) can't be overlooked. Penn State is averaging 96 ppg and entered Monday second in Division I with 13.8 steals per game. This will be the first matchup of these two programs. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

UConn (4-1) lost 99-97 after a furious rally in the last four minutes of regulation to send the game into overtime. The Huskies had not lost since Feb. 20, a span of 17 games that included winning the Big East tournament and NCAA Tournament. The Huskies will try to start another streak when they play Colorado on Tuesday in the consolation side of the Maui bracket. Colorado (4-1) fell 72-56 to Michigan State on Monday. UConn showed its championship experience against the Tigers. The Huskies trailed by 13 with four minutes left and 82-77 with 41 seconds left, but Solo Ball's 3-pointer with a second left sent it to an extra period. It was tied at 92 when head coach Danny Hurley was hit with a technical foul for arguing an over-the-back foul call on Liam McNeeley, and it proved to be costly. ""I have a lot of issues with what went on out there in the game,"" Hurley said in his postgame press conference. ""That over-the-back call at that point of the game, there was no attempt to block out. ... For that call to be made at that point of the game was a complete joke. ""For me, I don't know what happened. I might have lost my balance by the absurdity of the call or maybe I tripped. But if I made that call at that point, I would have ignored the fact that I was on my back."" Hurley has to turn the page quickly to face a Buffaloes team that held the Spartans to 2-for-21 shooting from 3-point range but still lost by 16. Colorado struggled to make shots, hitting just 37 percent from the field, and committed only 12 turnovers, five under its season average. The Buffaloes had success when they went inside to Elijah Monroe, who scored 14 points, but a swarming Michigan State defense contested nearly every shot. Coach Tad Boyle didn't think his team was aggressive enough, especially on the defensive end. ""It's soft,"" Boyle said of his team's defense. ""That gets back to that toughness factor. The number one thing on the board ... was keep the ball out of the paint. Whether it was from guarding the ball and gap help, whether it was post defense, you name it. Transition defense. We weren't able to do it. They got the ball in the paint whenever they wanted in different ways. To me, it's a matter of toughness."" Colorado will have to improve that against UConn, which averages 90.4 points a game and holds its opponents to 60.6, even after Memphis' big night. The Huskies played a soft schedule ahead of the Maui tourney. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Bailey, one of two five-star freshmen to raise Rutgers' profile this season, had 17 points but shot 6-for-17, grabbed only one rebound and threw a bad-pass turnover on Rutgers' final chance to tie the game or take the lead. Davis, a sophomore guard, had zero points, assists and rebounds in 12 minutes off the bench. ""(It's) probably a lot here, coming home for him, but Ace is a good player and he has to ... live through some of these experiences,"" Rutgers coach Steve Pikiell said of the NBA prospect. ""I have a lot of faith in him, and I want to make sure, one of the big things that he's gotta continue to do for us is rebound, and that's something that he didn't do a great job of (Sunday), but he will."" Dylan Harper, Rutgers' other freshman star, had 21 points and nine assists and leads the team in both categories (19.8 and 5.2, respectively). Notre Dame (4-1) had a solid start to the season before encountering trouble in an 84-77 loss to visiting Elon on Friday. Elon shot 57.1 percent from the floor, with 19 assists to just 10 turnovers. ""Our defense broke down,"" said coach Micah Shrewsberry, whose team was outscored 10-2 in the last 1:34. ""You can't give up two layups at the end of the game when you're itching to get stops, and that's where we gotta be better."" Markus Burton scored 25 points and Braeden Shrewsberry had 22 to power Notre Dame's offense. The duo combined for 9-of-18 shooting from distance. They are the top two scorers for the Irish this year at 21.4 and 14.8 ppg, respectively. The last time these programs met, Notre Dame defeated Rutgers 89-87 in a double-overtime game in the NCAA Tournament First Four in 2022. On Wednesday, Rutgers faces No. 9 Alabama and Notre Dame plays No. 6 Houston. Each team's Saturday opponent will be determined by results from both of the event's two four-team groups. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Bruins (5-1) have had no trouble with any of their first five opponents at Pauley Pavilion, winning each contest by at least 14 points. They have won four straight games, having rebounded from a 72-64 setback vs. New Mexico in Henderson, Nev., on Nov. 8 with routs of Boston University (71-40), Lehigh (85-45), Idaho State (84-70) and most recently Cal State Fullerton (80-47) on Friday. Five Bruins players scored in double figures on Friday, led by Kobe Johnson's 12 points. He added six rebounds and five assists. Dylan Andrews, who was recently dealing with a groin injury, finished with eight points, four assists and noteworthy praise from UCLA coach Mick Cronin. Cronin was critical of Andrews, who was the team's top returning scorer, early in the season. The junior sputtered through a four-point, six-turnover game against New Mexico, and in his return against Idaho State, Andrews had as many personal fouls as points with three. Friday was a different story, the coach said. ""All I care is that he got four assists and no turnovers, and he got four deflections, which ties his whole season,"" Cronin said. ""He has to improve, and we talked about it, and he did."" Andrews and fellow returner Sebastian Mack are integrating with a new-look lineup that includes Southern California transfer Johnson and former Oregon State forward Tyler Bilodeau taking on prominent roles. Southern Utah (6-1) underwent its own roster changes in the offseason, and they have been working out. The Thunderbirds are more than halfway to matching last season's win total of 10 games, and they opened this campaign with the first 4-0 start in program history. Among the newcomers is Jamir Simpson, a standout at Division II Wisconsin-Parkside in 2022-23, who has acclimated quickly to Division I play after sitting out last season. He is riding a streak of four straight games scoring 20-plus points. Simpson went for 28 points at Loyola Chicago on Nov. 19 and scored 21 points in Southern Utah's 82-67 win over Idaho on Saturday in San Diego. ""Staying disciplined, getting to my spots and being confident in myself to play,"" Simpson said of his fast start to the season.

It took video review for North Carolina to avoid a tie, however, as after a pair of Davis free throws, Nate Santos hit a jumper from the corner. The shot under duress was initially called a 3-pointer to tie the game at 90-90. The officials found Santos' foot was on the 3-point arc upon review. Davis sank two more foul shots, then the Tar Heels intentionally fouled Smith to avoid Dayton getting another look at a potential game-tying 3-pointer in the final seconds. Davis shot 10-for-11 at the foul line and 4-for-10 from 3-point range en route to his game-high scoring performance. He also grabbed seven rebounds and dished five assists.

The Cavaliers (3-2) were crushed by top-25 opponents Tennessee and St. John's at the Baha Mar Championship, losing consecutive games by 22-plus points for the first time since January 2008. Those setbacks nearly 17 years ago happened under then-coach Dave Leitao, whose successor, Tony Bennett, never endured what happened to interim coach Ron Sanchez's squad in Nassau. After winning their first three games under Sanchez, who took over after Bennett's sudden retirement last month, Virginia fell 64-42 to then-No. 11 Tennessee on Thursday and 80-55 to then-No. 22 St. John's on Friday. ""This is a great test,"" Sanchez said after the loss to the Red Storm, in which the Cavaliers committed 16 turnovers and allowed St. John's to shoot 52.5 percent from the field. ""You know, you go up against two of the top teams in the country, some of the warts are going to show,"" Sanchez said. Leading scorer Isaac McKneely (12.4 points per game) scored a combined 14 points on 4-of-15 shooting in the two lopsided losses. ""How they're going to handle it is TBD, you know,"" Sanchez said. ""This is part of the journey. One thing I told them is that it's a long season, and you know, the one thing that we did here is, we learned a lot about ourselves. The question is, how are we going to use that knowledge? Are we going to grow, you know, or are we going to wallow in it?"" Virginia looks to bounce back against a Manhattan squad that is 0-2 on the road but coming off an exciting 80-79 win Friday against Army. Shaquil Bender stole an inbounds pass and Wesley Robinson hit a runner as time expired to lift the Jaspers (3-2). ""There's things that really good basketball programs do,"" said Jaspers coach John Gallagher. ""One of them is you never give up. You play it to the end. ... They stayed even-keeled, so that's the first feeling. It's like, ‘Oh my God, we have something here.'""

He cleaned up Denver Jones' miss on a driving layup attempt, but as Broome was swarmed by his teammates, he lay on the court in pain, suffering a cramp in his leg.

The Cyclones hit just 31.8 percent of their shots in the second half after shooting 58.1 percent in the opening period.

Officers stated the Robinson showed ""objective signs and symptoms of alcohol impairment."" He was issued a citation before being released to ""a responsible party,"" per the CHP. The Rams did not make an immediate statement in the aftermath of the news, according to NFL.com. Robinson caught a 2-yard scoring pass in the third quarter of the Rams' 37-20 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday in Inglewood, Calif. His only other reception in the contest went for 13 yards. The 30-year-old veteran is in his ninth NFL season, his second with the Rams. He has 26 receptions for 384 yards and six touchdowns through 11 games (all starts) this year. The Chiefs selected Robinson in the fourth round of the 2016 draft out of Florida. He spent six years in Kansas City, helping the team win the Super Bowl after the 2019 season.

Celebrini also logged an assist to post his first three-point game.  Nico Sturm, Fabian Zetterlund, Alexander Wennberg and Luke Kunin also scored goals while Will Smith and William Eklund each had two assists each for San Jose, which scored five times in the third period.

David Rittich made 14 saves as Los Angeles lost for the fourth time in six games.

Wennberg scored his sixth for the Sharks on a power play near the midway point of the final period, and Kunin netted his fifth with less than two minutes remaining.

Phoenix coach Mike Budenholzer said Monday that Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal are slated to return from left calf strains after making it through consecutive days of practice without a setback. The two players are probable. Phoenix is 1-6 in the games missed by Durant and 0-5 since Beal went down. This will be the Suns' first game since losing 138-122 at home to the New York Knicks on Wednesday to stretch their skid to five games. Durant, 36, was playing superbly before the injury with averages of 27.6 points and 6.6 rebounds. The two-time NBA Finals MVP has made 24 of 56 shots (42.9 percent) from 3-point range. Beal, 31, is averaging 17.8 points, 4.0 rebounds and 3.7 assists. ""I definitely feel a lot better,"" Beal said at Monday's practice. ""I'm thankful we had the schedule we had so we had some rest days, Kev and I."" Phoenix will be happy to see the duo on the court after losing by double digits four times during the five-game slide. ""Bringing that extra firepower back to the team is going to help us out a lot,"" Suns rookie forward Ryan Dunn said Monday. The Suns will certainly be well-rested after having so much time off since the porous effort against the Knicks. ""It's pretty rare to get this amount of time,"" Phoenix guard Grayson Allen said. ""We could do a lot of teaching ... with not having to scout for another team."" The Lakers and Suns are set to meet for the third time this season. They split two matchups in late October. Durant scored 30 points in both games. Lakers big man Anthony Davis averaged 32. Los Angeles has dropped its past two games, most recently getting routed 127-102 by the visiting Denver Nuggets on Saturday. The Lakers were crushed 70-39 in the second half by Denver. ""Clearly, the spirit to compete just wasn't there,"" Los Angeles coach JJ Redick said. LeBron James scored 18 points but committed six turnovers. He has 33 miscues over the past six games. Davis was soundly outplayed by three-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic, scoring a season-low 14 points and making just 6 of 19 shots from the field. ""I just missed shots. I think all great looks,"" Davis said. ""It's a miss-or-make league. I'll make more than I'll miss, for sure. You always wish you can make every shot. I'm confident in every shot I took. They're shots that I normally make. ""All of us, to be honest. Shots that we all normally make, we just missed. But I like every shot that I took tonight. They just didn't go in."" Davis had topped 20 points in all 14 appearances this season before the poor outing against Denver. Austin Reaves scored a team-high 19 for the Lakers. He has five 20-point efforts this season and two were against Phoenix. Reaves scored 26 in a 123-116 home win on Oct. 25 and 23 during a 109-105 loss at Phoenix on Oct. 28. He made five 3-pointers in each contest. The Lakers lead West Group B Play with a 2-0 record in the NBA Cup competition after winning the inaugural competition last year. Phoenix is 1-1.

But Wagner (3-3), from the Northeast Conference, will present a different challenge for Georgetown (4-1) on Tuesday in Washington. The Seahawks, who are coming off an appearance in the NCAA Tournament, rotate 11 players who average at least 10 minutes per game, with none of them averaging double digits in scoring. The deep rotation is due in part to coach Donald Copeland still trying to discover his optimal lineup. He said injuries have prevented him from conducting full practices before and into the season. After losing to three power conference schools, including ranked teams Rutgers and St. John's, Wagner notched wins last week over Boston University (60-58) and Division III Springfield of Massachusetts (81-46). Against Boston University on Nov. 19, R.J. Greene had 19 points and eight rebounds, and he scored the winning basket on a layup at the buzzer after receiving an inbound pass. In the two victories, Zaire Williams had a combined 37 points and 10 steals. ""I like my group,"" Copeland said. ""They are bought into what we do and how we do it."" Georgetown is coming off an 82-65 victory Saturday over another Northeast Conference school, St. Francis (Pa.), as Micah Peavy had 24 points and six assists. The Hoyas trailed 57-56 before holding St. Francis to a single field goal over the final 8:50. Jayden Epps had 23 points and six rebounds for Georgetown, which escaped against a Red Flash team that was missing two of its top three scorers. ""The thing that I'm most proud of is how our team responded, particularly the last eight minutes of the game, with what we did defensively, getting multiple deflections,"" Georgetown coach Ed Cooley said. ""We shortened our rotation in the second half purposely, just to try to create a little bit more chemistry on the floor."" Foul trouble for the Hoyas' top scorer and rebounder, Thomas Sorber, limited the freshman to a season-low nine points. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

South Carolina Upstate (2-6) continues a challenging nonconference schedule that already has featured road losses to Atlantic Coast Conference schools North Carolina State, Virginia Tech and Wake Forest. The Nov. 13 game against the Demon Deacons was the closest of the bunch, as the Spartans challenged Wake Forest down the stretch of an eventual 85-80 defeat. ""They came ready to play,"" Wake Forest coach Steve Forbes said of the Spartans. ""I had explained to our players that they've already played two other ACC teams, so they weren't going to come in here and be overwhelmed by the opponent."" The Spartans, who also will visit South Carolina next month, are led by first-year coach Marty Richter. South Carolina Upstate is coming off a 98-74 neutral-court loss to Queens University on Saturday in Johnson City, Tenn.

Andre Burakovsky and Brandon Montour also scored and Ryker Evans had two assists for the Kraken, who had lost their previous five road games dating to late October. Goaltender Joey Daccord made 21 saves to post his sixth victory over the past seven starts. Trevor Zegras and Frank Vatrano tallied for the Ducks, who took their second straight loss (0-1-1). Troy Terry notched two assists, and Lukas Dostal stopped 24 of 27 shots. Trailing 2-1 entering the third period, the Kraken scored twice in the opening 1:10 to take the lead. Burakovsky tied it 46 seconds into the frame on a tip-in at the left post after taking a backhanded, back-to-the-net pass from Jared McCann. The Kraken took the lead just 24 seconds later. Wright won a faceoff in the offensive zone back to Montour, whose slap slot from the right point found its way through a screen and into the upper left corner of the net. The Kraken opened the scoring at 7:12 of the first period as Wright outmuscled a defender in front of the net and redirected Oliver Bjorkstrand's shot from the left point past Dostal. Wright, the No. 4 overall pick in the 2022 NHL draft, had been a healthy scratch the previous three games and hadn't registered a point since Oct. 17. The Ducks tied it at 15:59 of the opening period with an extra attacker on the ice during a delayed penalty against Seattle. Terry carried the puck over the line on the right wing and fired a cross-ice pass toward Zegras, who put a shot from the bottom of the left faceoff circle over Daccord's shoulder. Anaheim scored the only goal of the second period. Vatrano tapped a rebound into the open side of the net at 6:17 after Daccord made a blocker save on Olen Zellweger. Ducks forward Leo Carlsson, the No. 2 overall draft choice in 2023, was injured late in the second period when he crashed into his own net after being checked by Seattle's Tye Kartye, who was penalized for interference on the play. The Ducks announced that Carlsson, who didn't return, sustained an upper-body injury. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Cardinal (6-0) recorded their most impressive victory of the season Saturday, rallying from 11 points down for a 71-69 triumph at Santa Clara. Star center Maxime Raynaud has led the way this season for Stanford with six straight double-doubles, including a 32-point, 16-rebound effort on Saturday. He got plenty of support from Oziyah Sellers, who had 23 points, and Jaylen Blakes, who hit a game-winning shot in traffic with two seconds remaining. Grand Canyon (3-2), which is located in Phoenix, has a slight edge over Stanford in terms of campus proximity to Palm Desert, but Raynaud promises he and his teammates won't be fazed after what they experienced at Santa Clara. ""I personally love it,"" he said. ""I personally strive in this kind of environment. I really like when the crowd gets into it. I think the guys did an amazing job of resilience. I think we have really mature (players) that knew how to make the best of the situation, and we got the 'dub' in the end."" Stanford and Grand Canyon have had two opponents in common this season. Both beat Norfolk State, but while the Cardinal handled visiting UC Davis 79-65 on Nov. 17, the Lopes were toppled on their home court by the Aggies 75-68 on Wednesday. Grand Canyon, a second-round NCAA Tournament team that went 30-5 last season, rebounded with a 91-73 home win over Norfolk State on Friday. Ray Harrison led the turnaround with eight assists among the team's school-record 31. ""All of us kind of felt embarrassed after the last loss,"" Harrison said. ""We just knew we wanted to play the right way. That's really the only thing that changed -- we played the right way."" Also, Lopes center Duke Brennan made his season debut on Friday. The 6-foot-10 junior, who missed the first four games with an injured left arm, contributed 13 points and seven rebounds.

He cleaned up Denver Jones' miss on a driving layup attempt, but as Broome was swarmed by his teammates, he lay on the court in pain, suffering a cramp in his leg.  The play capped a rally after Auburn (5-0) trailed by as many as 18 points at halftime. The Tigers outscored the Cyclones (3-1) 50-32 in the second half.

Rookie Stephon Castle added 19 points, including six during a decisive late run, while Harrison Barnes racked up 22 points. San Antonio was without Devin Vassell (knee) and Keldon Johnson (hamstring). ""I think the biggest thing for us is just doing it by committee and celebrating each other's success,"" said Barnes, a veteran forward who is in his first season with San Antonio. The Spurs held sharp-shooting Golden State to just 13 points in the final period. ""It was excellent -- 13 points in the fourth quarter versus a team that has been there many times and thrives in those moments,"" San Antonio interim coach Mitch Johnson said. ""I am very happy with the physicality, with the connectivity. It was our best quarter to date, in my opinion, defensively.""

Gaudette was alone at the side of the net and had a tap-in set up by Greig's cross-crease pass. Batherson put Ottawa ahead for good with a power-play goal at 3:18 of the second period by deflecting Sanderson's waist-high point shot for his ninth marker of the campaign.

Pinellas County Court Commission Chairperson Kathleen Peters issued a letter on Monday to Rays presidents Brian Auld and Matt Silverman requesting a decision from the team. Last week, Auld and Silverman wrote a letter to the County Commission that suggested the team would not agree to a deal for a new stadium and is ""ready to work on a new solution"" in the area. The Rays wrote in the Nov. 19 letter that a new stadium would not be completed in time for the 2028 season, while opening a stadium the following year would be too expensive. The team also wrote that it has spent over $50 million toward building the new stadium, but the county has allegedly ""suspended work on the entire project."" ""As we have informed the county administrator and St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch, the county's failure to finalize the bonds last month ended the ability for a 2028 delivery of the ballpark,"" the Rays wrote. ""As we have made clear at every step of this process, a 2029 ballpark delivery would result in significantly higher costs that we are not able to absorb alone."" Peters shot back at Auld and Silverman in her letter, calling the team's claim that completing a ballpark in 2029 would be too expensive a ""fallacious statement."" She added that the Rays are responsible for covering any extra costs that may arise with the project. Peters also rebutted the Rays' argument that a completed stadium in 2028 is unattainable, noting that the county's deadline for issuing the bonds could be as late as March 31, 2025. However, no bonds will be issued in the near future. The Pinellas County Commission voted 6-1 on No. 19 to put off its final decision on whether to approve the bonds until Dec. 17. If the Rays do not provide an answer by the Dec. 1 deadline, Peters told the Tampa Bay Times she would discuss how to proceed with Assistant County Attorney Don Crowell and County Administrator Barry Burton. Regardless, the Rays will not play their home games next season at their normal St. Petersburg site after Tropicana Field was heavily damaged by Hurricane Milton in early October. The team will instead welcome opponents to Tampa's George M. Steinbrenner Field, the spring training home of the New York Yankees. While it is unclear if the Rays will stay in the Tampa Bay area for the long run, Peters asserted the city and county remained committed to finalizing a deal with the team. ""Pinellas County has operated in good faith, working toward the stadium deal while balancing the needs of our community after back-to-back hurricanes,"" Peters wrote in her letter. ""If the Rays want out of this agreement, it is your right to terminate the contract. Clear communication about your intentions will be critical to the next steps in this partnership."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Juuse Saros stopped 26 of 30 shots before being replaced by Scott Wedgewood to start the third period. Wedgewood stopped all 15 shots faced in the relief effort. Forsberg opened the scoring on the Predators' first shot of the game at 5:06 of the first period. Haula finished off a nice Devils passing play for the equalizer at the 11:29 mark. More crisp passing set up New Jersey's next tally 3:52 into the second period. Timo Meier found Hischier rushing down the right ice of the ice, and Hischier scored after pulling past Nashville defenseman Marc Del Gaizo. Nashville was 0-for-5 on the power play, while the Devils were 1-for-2 on the power play against the Predators' league-leading penalty kill. New Jersey's extra-attacker goal came from Hischier at 10:01 of the second frame. Hischier completed his dream period on a breakaway goal at the 16:57 mark. Stefan Noesen forced a turnover at the blue line and passed to an open Hischier streaking toward the net. L'Heureux scored 7:39 into the third period, but Nashville couldn't add any more offense despite a five-minute power play later in the frame when Meier got a five-minute major penalty for cross-checking L'Heureux. Dowling punctuated the Devils' victory with an empty-net goal at the 17:25 mark. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Washington's Lars Eller scored two goals, as he and teammate Ivan Miroshnichenko each logged an empty-netter. The Capitals got 20 saves from Logan Thompson, who improved his record to 9-1-1 in his first season with Washington. Eller and Thompson shared top honors on the night with Chychrun, who was born and raised in Boca Raton, just a short drive from Sunrise. The reigning Stanley Cup champion Panthers fell to 1-6-0 in their past seven games. They got a goal from Niko Mikkola and 27 saves from backup goalie Spencer Knight. Panthers center Sam Reinhart had his 13-game points streak snapped. It was tied for the longest points streak in the NHL this season, and Reinhart had 11 goals and eight assists during that span. The teams played to a 1-1 draw in the first period. Seven minutes in, Florida opened the scoring. Sam Bennett held the puck in the middle of the ice, drawing two defenders before dishing to Mikkola on the left wing. Mikkola, from the left circle, scored his first goal of the season with a shot off the crossbar. Washington tied the score with 17:49 gone as Chychrun stopped just inside the blue line and whistled a brilliant pass to Eller for a goal from point-blank range. Eller lifted the puck over Knight's blocker. After a scoreless second period, Washington took a 2-1 lead with a five-on-three power-play goal. With just 78 seconds gone in the third, Chychrun scored from the point as he used a Pierre-Luc Dubois screen to beat Knight glove side. The two penalties that set up that five-on-three were against Uvis Balinskis for tripping Tom Wilson and against Aaron Ekblad for slashing Connor McMichael. With 2:24 left in the game, Florida pulled Knight for an extra attacker, and that backfired as Washington got two empty-net goals. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Cirelli set the NHL's longest goal streak this season with a quick score from the slot with just 14 seconds left in the first period for a 5-1 lead. His ninth tally left him just two games from matching the Tampa Bay record for most consecutive games with a goal, held by Nikita Kucherov and Brian Bradley.  Hagel set a franchise record with four helpers in the first period, then added another in the second. Jake Guentzel hit the net twice, while Kucherov had a goal and two assists. Nick Perbix, Luke Glendening, Brayden Point and Michael Eyssimont collected goals as the Lightning moved to 7-2-1 on home ice. Zemgus Girgensons notched his 100th career assist, and Andrei Vasilevskiy made 23 saves.  The Lightning won both tilts in the season series by a combined score of 13-4.  For Colorado, Ivan Ivan scored twice as the club lost for just the second time in eight games (6-2-0). Goalie Justus Annunen was replaced in the first after allowing three goals and later returned. He surrendered five total on 16 shots. Alexandar Georgiev stopped 14 shots in middle relief. Defenseman Josh Manson skated in his 600th NHL game, but left winger Jonathan Drouin (upper body) was scratched after a two-goal showing Saturday.  In the teams' second meeting in less than a month, Perbix fired home the first marker, his second overall, at 5:41 with a screen from Eyssimont. Guentzel zipped in one on the power play just over two minutes later, but Ivan followed on a rebound 70 seconds after that.  Kucherov's 12th tally at the midpoint chased Annunen. Hagel soon stripped Nathan MacKinnon on a Colorado power play to lead a 2-on-1 rush that ended with Glendening popping home a shorty, his first, at 13:15 before Cirelli's last-minute goal.  In the second, Point's seventh power-play goal, his 12th overall, was set up by a pass from Hagel at 9:38. With Annunen back in the crease in the third, Ivan (fifth goal) and Guentzel (ninth) traded tallies before Eyssimont buried his first at 4:44. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Sparked by its shooting from the perimeter, Orlando turned a 62-58 hole into an 88-77 lead in the fourth and ruined a stellar outing from Hornets guard LaMelo Ball. Reserves Moritz Wagner (16 points), Cole Anthony (16), Isaac (11) and Anthony Black (10) came through in the clutch as the Magic won for the ninth time in their past 10 games. Ball racked up 44 points, nine rebounds and seven assists, while teammate Brandon Miller provided 20 points and 10 boards. Ball made 17 of 30 shots from the field, connecting on four 3-pointers (on 11 attempts).  The Hornets, who began a five-game homestand, had won their past four home games. Charlotte, which was charged with 27 turnovers, has now lost four of its past five games overall, though.  Orlando's Gary Harris, a starting guard, was done after seven minutes of action because of a strained left hamstring. Black picked up the slack in Harris' absence.  Anthony got Orlando going in the fourth with the team's first five points of the period. Then Isaac helped the Magic take over. Orlando ended up outscoring the Hornets 37-22 over the final 12 minutes, but it still shot just 39.4 percent from the field for the game. Charlotte shot 41.3 percent overall.  With 6:57 to go in the third quarter, Ball reached the 25-point mark on a pair of free throws to give the Hornets a 54-49 edge. The Magic stuck around, though, and they trailed by only four, 62-58, heading into the fourth.  Ball hit a late 3-pointer to send the Hornets into halftime with a 46-42 lead. He had 19 points before the break, while Miller added 11. No Orlando starter had more than six points in the first half. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Blues earned the win a day after firing coach Drew Bannister and replacing him with Jim Montgomery. The Boston Bruins fired Montgomery last week, and he signed to a five-year deal with St. Louis on Sunday. Schenn scored his fourth goal this season 72 seconds into the final period thanks to a heads-up play in the St. Louis defensive zone during four-on-four action. After his teammates prevented the Rangers from cycling the puck in the zone, defenseman Scott Perunovich slid a cross-ice pass through the neutral zone into the offensive zone, and Schenn got by Mika Zibanejad and defenseman Braden Schneider and scored for a 3-2 lead. Zack Bolduc recorded his first career two-goal game, Jordan Kyrou also scored and former Ranger Pavel Buchnevich added an empty-netter as the Blues scored five goals for first time since Oct. 24. Schenn also assisted on Kyrou's goal and Dylan Holloway collected two assists as the Blues finished with a season-high 43 shots on goal. St. Louis backup goalie Joel Hofer made 27 saves, including a sprawling pad save on Kaapo Kakko about four minutes in. The Blues had gone 2-6-1 in their previous nine games. Will Cuylle registered his first career two-goal game but the Rangers dropped a third straight game for the first time this season. New York, which played without Chris Kreider (upper-body injury), fell to 7-7-0 since opening the season on a six-game points streak (5-0-1). New York goalie Igor Shesterkin stopped 38 shots. Cuylle opened the scoring with 11:13 left in the opening period when he redirected a left point shot from Kakko with his skate during a scramble in front. Kyrou scored nearly three minutes later on a shot from between the circles after Schenn intercepted a pass behind the net by Zibanejad. Bolduc gave St. Louis a 2-1 lead 4:30 into the second period by lifting a loose puck into the net during a scramble in the crease when the Rangers could not clear. Cuylle tied it about three minutes later by cutting to the net and putting Zibanejad's pass into the vacated right side of the net while falling to the ice. After Schenn scored, Bolduc beat Artemi Panarin to a rebound in the slot and sent a one-timer by Shesterkin for a 4-2 lead with 11:35 remaining. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

He was struggling. There's a lot of pressure on him, obviously, being a home-state kid that came back,"" Crimson Tide coach Nate Oats said of Sears. ""He's the (Southeastern Conference) preseason player of the year, and he's trying to do well. Teams are gearing their defense toward him.""

Nelson leads the Crimson Tide with 14.2 points per game and ranks second in rebounds per game (7.0).

Tugler is averaging 8.5 points after contributing just 3.8 per game last season as a freshman. Houston coach Kelvin Sampson bluntly said Tugler will not shoot this well again all season. ""Someone's going to say this ridiculous statement: ‘If Jojo shoots like that for the rest of the year,'"" Sampson said. ""Jojo will never shoot like that the rest of the year, that's a once-in-a-blue-moon night. The best shooters miss six out of 10. Well, he's not one of the best shooters.

The F1 grid will expand to 11 teams that year. It had been 10 teams since 2017. F1 previously rejected a bid by Andretti Global to partner with GM for an 11th team, but that didn't mean F1 was against expansion in general. ""Formula 1 has maintained a dialogue with General Motors, and its partners at TWG Global, regarding the viability of an entry following the commercial assessment and decision made by Formula 1 in January 2024,"" a statement on F1's website said. ""Over the course of this year, they have achieved operational milestones and made clear their commitment to brand the eleventh team GM/Cadillac, and that GM will enter as an engine supplier at a later time. Formula 1 is therefore pleased to move forward with this application process and will provide further updates in due course."" There had been tension between F1 and Michael Andretti, who aggressively campaigned for a team and called F1 ""greedy"" for not accepting his bid. But he has stepped back from his role in Andretti Global this year, and his father, famed F1 driver Mario Andretti, was named a director on the GM/Cadillac team's board. Mario Andretti, 84, said in a statement that he is ""absolutely thrilled"" with the development: ""To still be involved at this stage of my life -- I have to pinch myself to make sure I'm not dreaming."" ""As the pinnacle of motorsports, F1 demands boundary-pushing innovation and excellence,"" GM president Mark Reuss added in a statement. ""It's an honor for General Motors and Cadillac to join the world's premier racing series, and we're committed to competing with passion and integrity to elevate the sport for race fans around the world.

And that's exactly what Tuesday's matchup between No. 1 Kansas and No. 11 Duke on the,"Las Vegas is certainly no stranger to a heavyweight prize fight. And that's exactly what Tuesday's matchup between No. 1 Kansas and No. 11 Duke on the Strip is shaping out to be. Kansas will arrive in Las Vegas with a 5-0 record, already having won marquee matchups against North Carolina and Michigan State this month. Duke enters at 4-1 but has arguably been more convincing in their winning efforts despite slipping up against Kentucky 77-72 on Nov. 12. The Blue Devils boast the nation's most highly-touted freshman, 6-foot-9 Cooper Flagg from Newport, Maine. Flagg leads the team in all major statistical categories with 17.8 points, 8.8 rebounds and 3.8 assists per game. Defensively, he carries Duke with 1.8 steals and 1.8 blocks per game. Flagg is coming off his second-highest scoring total of the season in Friday's 69-55 win over Arizona. He scored 24 points on 10-of-22 shooting while grabbing six rebounds and dishing out three assists. He scored a season-high 26 points in the loss against Kentucky while grabbing 11 rebounds in what was a statement performance despite the loss. ""He presents problems to anybody that plays him,"" Kansas coach Bill Self said. ""I mean, he's terrific. He has talent, athleticism, skill. But there's another element to him that's what makes him different, (which) is that he is so competitive and tough. ""In my opinion, (I) thought he had as big a chance to have as big an impact in his short time in college as anybody that I have ever coached or recruited. You know, LeBron obviously didn't go to school."" Duke's other three wins have come in blowout fashion against Maine, Army, and Wofford. Flagg has been aided by guards Kon Knueppel and Tyrese Proctor, who average 14.4 and 11.8, respectively. Both players are shooting over 40 percent from beyond the arc and they are each averaging four or more rebounds per game. Blue Devils coach Jon Scheyer isn't backing down from Tuesday's challenge, but he's also not making it bigger than it needs to be. ""We want to make sure they're as ready as possible, while still building up their strength and their physicality,"" Scheyer said. ""Understanding what these games are going to present. We've worked really hard on attacking every game, no matter the situation, no matter the ranking, no matter (the location) the same way, like how can you approach it and be better than you were in the last game?"" Kansas has been led by a player college basketball fans are well familiar with. Hunter Dickinson is tops on the team in points (17.8), rebounds (10.4), steals (1.8) and blocks (1.8).  Dajuan Harris Jr. has been the chief facilitator for the Jayhawks, leading the team with 5.2 assists per game. Zeke Mayo averages double figures as well, ranking second on the team with 12.6 points per game. Kansas has seven players averaging seven-plus points per game. In addition to their marquee victories over North Carolina and Michigan State, Kansas has won with convincing efforts over Howard, Oakland and UNC Wilmington this season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Michigan State (5-1) overcame another rough game from 3-point range to move into the semifinals, where it will face Memphis on Tuesday. The Tigers beat No. 2 UConn, 99-97, in overtime earlier Monday. Colorado (4-1) will face the two-time defending national champions in the consolation bracket. The Spartans missed their first 14 3-point attempts before Richardson hit one with 13:39 left in regulation. They finished the day 2-for-21 from deep but used a strong defense to hand the Buffaloes their first loss. Julian Hammond III scored 15 points and Elijah Malone had 14 points for Colorado, which shot 37 percent from the floor and was held 28 points below its season average. Frankie Fidler had nine points and six rebounds, while Szymon Zapala paired seven points with eight boards for the Spartans. Both teams started strong on offense before the defenses settled in. Neither squad led by more than three points for the first 11 minutes before Michigan State started to pull away. Tied at 21, Coen Carr hit a hook shot, Jaden Akins made a pullup jumper, Richardson hit a driving layup and Tre Holloman converted a three-point play in a 13-2 run that gave the Spartans a 34-23 lead. Michigan State extended the advantage to 38-25 at halftime. The Buffaloes opened the second half on an 8-2 run to get within 40-33 and had a chance to get closer but committed three straight turnovers. They trailed 44-36 after Sebastian Rancik split a pair of free throws, but Richardson hit the Spartans' first 3-pointer and a driving layup, and Fidler hit a corner 3-pointer to make it 52-37 with 12:18 left. Colorado missed a couple of shots out of the timeout and Carson Cooper scored on two hook shots to stretch the advantage to 56-39. Malone's layup and a short jumper by Hammond helped cut the deficit to 15, but Jeremy Fears Jr. fed Carr for a lob dunk, Fidler hit a bank shot and Fears made two layups to make it 66-46 with 4:58 left. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The availability of Steven Ashworth is in question after the senior guard sustained a right ankle injury during the Bluejays' 74-63 setback to in-state rival Nebraska on Friday.  Ashworth matched his scoring average by totaling 16 points against the upstart Cornhuskers. He trails only Big East Preseason Player of the Year Ryan Kalkbrenner (21.4) for top honors on the team, while Ashworth's 6.4 assists lead the club.  ""We have no idea how long Steven's going to be out,"" Creighton coach Greg McDermott said. ""I think it's going to be a while."" The timing of the injury is troublesome for the Bluejays (4-1), who have a busy slate ahead. Creighton will square off against No. 23 Texas A&M on Wednesday at Las Vegas and another opponent in the tournament on Saturday before facing top-ranked Kansas on Dec. 4. Nebraska clamped down on Kalkbrenner, forcing the Bluejays to navigate away from the 7-foot-1 star center and try their luck from the perimeter.  ""Great defensive plan to keep the ball out of the paint,"" McDermott said. ""When they do that, we've gotta take advantage and make some 3-point shots, and obviously we didn't shoot it very well."" The Bluejays made just 12 of a program-record 42 attempts from 3-point range. Texas Tech transfer and Las Vegas native Pop Isaacs highlighted his season-high 25-point performance by connecting five times on 12 shots from beyond the arc.  Kalkbrenner, who erupted for a career-high 49 points in the season opener, finished with a paltry four points -- all free throws -- for his lowest scoring output since Christmas 2022 against DePaul.  ""I think that what this team has shown so far is not what its ceiling is,"" Kalkbrenner said. ""I know we have a lot more in us than what we've shown."" San Diego State (2-1) is well rested since dropping an 80-67 decision at home to Gonzaga on Nov. 18.  Nick Boyd collected 23 points and nine rebounds before exiting with 13 minutes to play due to muscle cramps.  ""I started cramping in the second half when I was about to check back in,"" Byrd said, per the San Diego Union-Tribune. ""That's why they held me out the rest of the game. It was just probably that I didn't really do anything on my ankle all week. It was just getting a little dehydrated. I'll take (responsibility) for that one."" Boyd averages a team-leading 14.7 points per game for the Aztecs, who will need all hands on deck considering they face Oregon on Wednesday at Las Vegas and another foe on Saturday. ""We have a tall task ahead of us,"" San Diego State coach Brian Dutcher said. ""This is all good for us, in November. We want to find a way to win these games.

He also pulled down 10 rebounds, three boards shy of his best total this season, for his first double-double in a Kansas State uniform. The Illinois transfer also had five assists, two blocks and two steals. Kansas State (5-2) had four players in double figures. Besides Hawkins, the Wildcats got 16 points from Brendan Hausen, 11 from Dug McDaniel and 10 from David N'Guessan. The Lancers (6-2) were led by Kyrell Luc with 15 points. Colby Garland added 13 points and Johan Nziemi had 11. Longwood's two leading scorers, KJ McClurg (14.3 ppg) and Michael Christmas (10.9), were held to a combined three points, all of those by McClurg. Kansas State gradually pulled away in the second half, eventually leading by 21 points twice in the last 5:07. Once the Wildcats stretched the lead to double figures early in the half, the closest the Lancers got was nine points. It was a sloppy start to the game, with the teams combining for 13 turnovers and nine fouls by the second media timeout. The teams combined for 18 turnovers in the first half. K-State also struggled with foul trouble. N'Guessan picked up the team's 10th foul to send Longwood to the double bonus with 8:37 left in the half.

Houston will try to maintain the truth of that statement when it visits the Minnesota Timberwolves on Tuesday night in Minneapolis. The Rockets are coming off a 104-98 loss against the Portland Trail Blazers, which marked only their second loss in the last nine games. Rockets coach Ime Udoka said his team's half-court offense stalled too often. Houston has won 12 of 18 games on the season but it has run into recent trouble when opposing defenses switch off on Rockets players. ""We do have some off-ball actions that we've got to get better at,"" Udoka said. ""And reading the defenses instead of (having) guys just floating around."" The contest is an NBA Cup West Group A encounter. Houston (2-0) leads the group while Minnesota (1-1) is one game back. The Timberwolves also are focused on improvement as they return home from a bumpy two-game road trip. They lost 110-105 at the Toronto Raptors on Thursday, then fell 107-105 at the Boston Celtics on Sunday. After 16 games, the Timberwolves sit at .500. Minnesota coach Chris Finch said he liked the effort he saw from his players against the Celtics even if the result was not what he wanted. ""I thought we'd come out and have a response, no doubt about it,"" Finch said. ""I know the chemistry and the makeup of our team, and we're just kind of going through a tough patch. We've got to figure it out. But I thought we took a good step forward (against the Celtics)."" Timberwolves guard Donte DiVincenzo agreed. ""There's no such thing as moral victories, but ... we're staying together right now,"" DiVincenzo said. ""We like how we fought. We don't like how we dug ourselves a hole. But we like our fight, like our togetherness, and we had a chance to win it at the end of the game."" Anthony Edwards leads the Timberwolves with 27.9 points per game on 47.2 percent shooting from the field, including 43.8 percent shooting from 3-point range. Julius Randle (21.8 points per game) and Naz Reid (13.8) round out the top three scorers. Houston is led by Jalen Green, who is averaging 18.7 points despite shooting 38.2 percent overall and 30.7 percent from beyond the arc. Alperen Sengun is next with 18.3 points to go along with a team-high 10.6 rebounds per game, and veteran Fred VanVleet ranks third with 14.5 points per game. The NBA fined VanVleet $50,000 on Monday for confronting officials during Saturday's loss to the Trail Blazers. He was ejected from the game for the tirade. One specific area Udoka wants to see the Rockets improve on Tuesday is defending the 3-point line. He said part of the reason Houston lost its last game was because Rockets players were not aggressive enough out near the arc. ""We showed it at half that they had way too many comfortable walk-up threes or workout shots,"" Udoka said. ""We were too low (with our) pickup points. ... We wanted to increase our pickup points and get into them a little bit better."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Whittingham, 65, said he will decide on his future after the season. The Utes finish Friday at UCF. ""My decision will be made on what's best for the program, not what's best for me,"" Whittingham said during his Monday press conference. ""So, it'll be completely determined on how I feel this program is best served going forward."" Utah has struggled mightily in its first season in the Big 12 and has dropped its last seven games. The Utes were preseason favorites but sit 4-7 overall and 1-7 in Big 12 play. This marks just the third losing campaign in Whittingham's 20 seasons as head coach. The other two were in 2012 and 2013 when the Utes were in the Pac-12. Whittingham has recorded seven seasons of 10 or more wins and has a 166-86 record with the Utes since replacing Urban Meyer late in the 2004 season. The school has been preparing for the future by announcing prior to this season that defensive coordinator Morgan Scalley would become head coach whenever Whittingham chooses to retire. ""I'll sit down and evaluate everything,"" Whittingham said. ""I can tell you right now that Coach Scalley will be involved in decisions going forward because it's only right that he does that because he's the coach in waiting and when that time comes we need to make sure that he's had input on big decisions. So it'll be a team effort in that respect going forward as far as hiring and recruiting and that type of thing."" Whittingham said not many coaches get to pick their timing in terms of their tenure ending. ""Like I said, it's what's best for the program that ... my decision will be dictated based on,"" Whittingham said. ""To time it just right so you go out at just the right time, I mean, there's a very, very small percentage of people that are able to do that. ""And so again, I'm not saying, 'Well this was a bad year so for me I got to come back and have a better year.' I mean everyone wants to have a better year next year regardless of who the coach is."" Part of Utah's slide is due to losing standout quarterback Cameron Rising to a season-ending leg injury. Rising is weighing whether to seek a medical waiver that would allow him to play in 2025 for an eighth college season. ""That's on Cam's timeline and obviously we've got to at some point make our own decisions on what's going to happen if there is still indecisiveness, but I think that should be cleared up in the next week to 10 days,"" Whittingham said. Freshman Isaac Wilson replaced Rising but sustained his own leg injury in Saturday's 31-28 loss to then-No. 22 Iowa State. Wilson will miss the finale but is expected to recover in time to compete in spring football drills. Luke Bottari will start for Utah against UCF.

The Canadiens surrendered five goals in the second period, eliciting boos from the home crowd. ""We're a young team and that comes with the territory, but the guys know that games like this are unacceptable for where we're at,"" Montreal coach Martin St. Louis said. ""I don't think it was a work ethic thing. It was bad decision-making and a lot of individual mistakes, but we deserved those boos."" Montreal seemed to have recovered from a six-game losing streak by winning three of four and the team had a four-day break between games before hosting Vegas, but everything unraveled in the second period. ""You can't really get worse, in my opinion, than tonight's second period,"" Montreal left wing Juraj Slafkovsky said. ""So, you can only play better and make better decisions with the puck because that was just stupid."" On the positive side, the Canadiens blanked the Golden Knights in the first period and held them to one late goal in the third. ""We played a pretty good game in the first and third, and just let it slip away in the second,"" Canadiens forward Nick Suzuki said. ""Some bad turnovers cost us and they're a good team and they took advantage, so if we clean that up, we're right in and it's probably a closer game."" Utah will be wrapping up a four-game road trip when they visit Montreal. Utah has lost four of its past five, most recently 3-2 at the Toronto Maple Leafs on Sunday. Utah coach Andre Tourigny liked his team's compete level against Toronto, but said they need to learn how to manage the game better. ""Learn to make sure we have short shifts, especially on back-to-backs, and play the right way,"" Tourigny said. ""It's a big issue. You get on the road and you repeat the same mistakes, same guys, stick penalties. That's tough."" Utah killed five of six penalties against the Maple Leafs, but had 18 giveaways and went 28-for-61 in the faceoff circle. ""Our game management, our game in the game, cost us a lot (against Toronto),"" Tourigny said. ""From bad changes to getting in penalty trouble, it costs you at some point. We were playing a team that was playing well, who had won three in a row. They're not easy to play against."" Utah managed to cut it to one early in the third on a goal by Jack McBain, but couldn't get another one past Joseph Woll before the final horn sounded. ""I think we showed a lot of resilience in the third,"" McBain said. ""I thought we played really well and dominated in the third. Too bad we couldn't get it done, but a lot to build on."" Karel Vejmelka is expected to start in goal for the sixth time in seven games for Utah, which will likely need Connor Ingram to start one of the back-to-back games this weekend. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Nittany Lions (6-0), who will play either San Francisco or Clemson for the tournament title on Tuesday, put four other players in double figures. Zach Hicks scored 16 points, while Puff Johnson added 15. Ace Baldwin and Yanic Konan Niederhauser each chipped in 12 points. Penn State sank nearly 53 percent of its field goal attempts and earned a 38-30 advantage on the boards, more than enough to offset missing 12 of its 32 foul shots. Four players reached double figures for the Rams (3-4), led by 15 points apiece from Jackie Johnson III and reserve Joshua Rivera. Romad Dean and Jahmere Tripp each added 13. Fordham was as close as 56-49 after Tripp made a layup with 14:25 left in the game. But the Nittany Lions responded with a 16-1 run, capped with a layup by Kern for a 22-point lead at the 9:33 mark, and they never looked back. The main storyline prior to tipoff was whether Penn State could continue its torrid early start that saw it come into the day leading Division I in steals and ranked second in scoring at 98.2 points per game. The Nittany Lions certainly played to their billing for most of the first half, establishing a 21-8 lead at the 10:08 mark via Hicks' three-point play. Fordham predictably struggled early with the pressure defense, committing four turnovers in the first four minutes. But the Rams got their bearings over the last 10 minutes and made some shots. They got as close as four on two occasions late in the half before Penn State pushed the lead to 42-34 at the half.

There are positive offensive signs as well. Captain Brad Marchand netted the latter game-winner in the third period against the Red Wings, which was Boston's first at 5-on-5 in a three-game span. The first goal in Detroit came from Justin Brazeau and the second power-play unit. ""We need contributions from everybody right now,"" Sacco said. Entering a busy stretch that continues Wednesday with a visit to the New York Islanders, Marchand likes the team's current direction. ""We seem to be a little bit more comfortable right now. Effort seems higher,"" he said. ""I like the way we closed the last couple of games, being tight, playing very well defensively."" After giving up 12 goals in his previous two starts, Jeremy Swayman -- who signed an eight-year, $66 million contract last month -- returned to the net following Joonas Korpisalo's shutout of Utah and stopped 19 of 20 shots in Detroit. The beginning of the season has been a struggle for Swayman (3.30 goals-against average, .887 save percentage), but the coach affirmed that ""he's still (the Bruins') guy"" following their latest victory. ""I am happy for his response,"" Sacco said. ""I'm sure that he's starting to feel better about himself. It's only a matter of time before ‘Sway' starts to find his groove consistently."" Meanwhile, Korpisalo has gone 3-0-1 in November. The Canucks have gone just 3-4-0 since beginning this month on a three-game win streak, but they arrive in Boston for the second of a six-game trip after beating Ottawa 4-3 Saturday. It was their seventh victory in eight road games this season. It was a key team win after center J.T. Miller was added to Vancouver's list of absentees due to an indefinite personal leave last Wednesday and defenseman Quinn Hughes was ejected in the first period for a major boarding penalty. ""That's a lot to throw at the team, and I thought we handled it well,"" coach Rick Tocchet said. ""I'm proud of the guys. We hung in there and grinded out the win. ... In an 82-game schedule, you're going to go through a lot of adversity and it's about the way you handle it."" Brock Boeser (upper-body injury) has missed the previous seven games, but returned to practice Monday in a regular jersey. In the absence of aforementioned stars, the top line of Jake DeBrusk, Elias Pettersson and Kiefer Sherwood stepped up for a combined seven points against the Senators. DeBrusk scored two of the trio's three goals and added an assist. A Bruin for his first seven NHL seasons, DeBrusk scored his first three goals of the season in consecutive games before entering Saturday on a six-game drought. The winger will look to ride the momentum into his first game in Boston since moving to Vancouver as a free agent in July. ""I think it's more so my game is kind of building,"" DeBrusk said. ""I knew I was going to break through."" The Canucks also recalled Max Sasson from AHL affiliate Abbotsford for his first NHL game on Saturday. He recorded an assist. ""I really liked his game,"" Tocchet said. ""To just get called up out of the blue, he seized the moment."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Minshew suffered the injury when he was sacked and landed on his left shoulder late in the fourth quarter of Las Vegas' 29-19 home loss to the Denver Broncos. Former starter Aidan O'Connell, who was sidelined by a thumb injury in Week 7, could return off injured reserve in time for the Raiders (2-9) to face the two-time reigning Super Bowl champion Chiefs (10-1) on Friday in Kansas City. ""We'll see if Aidan is good to go,"" Pierce said. ""He's been ramping up."" O'Connell entered the 21-day practice window on Monday as the Raiders determine when to activate him. ""Seeing him able to grip the ball comfortable, hopefully, no pain there, and just being able to be efficient,"" Pierce said. ""To put a player out there that's hurting or injured still, that's not to the benefit of the player or our team."" O'Connell, 26, has played in four games this season, starting two (both losses). He is 52 of 82 (63.4 percent) for 455 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. As a rookie last season, O'Connell started 10 of 11 games, going 5-5, and completed 213 of 343 passes (62.1 percent) for 2,218 yards, 12 TDs and seven interceptions. The Raiders selected O'Connell in the fourth round of the 2023 NFL Draft. ""Obviously at the quarterback position, you've got to be smart,"" Pierce said. ""I think with Aidan, his future's much brighter looking ahead. ... I'll have to really rely on our doctors and medical staff."" Desmond Ridder replaced Minshew and went 5 of 10 for 64 yards. Ridder, 25, has appeared in three games this season for Las Vegas and is 16 of 26 (61.5 percent) for 138 yards and one TD. Ridder played the previous two seasons for the Atlanta Falcons, who selected him in the third round of the 2022 draft. For his career, he is 338 of 529 (63.9 percent) for 3,682 yards, 15 TDs and 12 interceptions in 22 games (17 starts, 8-9 record). Minshew, 28, completed 25 of 42 passes for 230 yards with one touchdown and one interception against the Broncos. He finished his first season with the Raiders with 2,013 yards, nine TDs and 10 picks on 66.3 percent passing. He joined the Raiders in free agency after stints in Jacksonville (2019-20), Philadelphia (2021-22) and Indianapolis (2023) and won the starting job in camp. But he was benched multiple times for O'Connell as the Raiders struggled as a team. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Wildcats (5-0) are ranked No. 8 in the latest Associated Press poll and are setting impressive offensive milestones even for a program as tradition-rich as Kentucky, which includes eight national championships. The Wildcats have scored 97 or more points in their first four home games for the first time in program history and eclipsed the 100-point mark in three of those games. Their lone trip out of state was a solid 77-72 victory over Duke in a matchup of top-10 teams in Atlanta. Kentucky has also made at least 10 three-pointers in each of its first five games of a season for the first time ever. ""I think Kentucky attracts good people,"" Kentucky coach Mark Pope said after the Wildcats' 108-59 win over Jackson State on Friday. ""It's the one place in all college basketball where you represent just a fanbase in a different, unique way."" Otega Oweh and Koby Brea have led the Wildcats' early scoring outburst. Oweh, who is averaging 16.2 points per game, had 21 points on 8-for-12 shooting against Jackson State. ""He gets us off to unbelievable starts every night,"" Pope told reporters after that game. ""He's probably been our most consistent guy in games."" Brea, who scored 22 points against Jackson State and is averaging 16.0 points per game, is leading the nation in 3-point accuracy at 74.1 percent. As a team, the Wildcats are shooting 42.3 percent from beyond the arc. And the few times they miss, Amari Williams has been doing the dirty work on the glass, averaging 10.8 boards in addition to 9.6 points per game. Kentucky faces a different challenge than it's had to contend with so far in the Hilltoppers (3-2), who have won three in a row after losing their first two games to Wichita State and Grand Canyon. Their up-tempo play hasn't exactly resulted in great offensive output, but in the Hilltoppers' 79-62 win over Jackson State on Wednesday, they shot 45.2 percent from 3-point range (14 for 31). ""I was happy to see a lot of different guys contribute tonight and, hopefully, get their feet under them a little bit and get some confidence,"" said Western Kentucky coach Hank Plona, who is in his first season as head coach. ""Obviously, Tuesday will be quite a test and challenge for us and we'll need them to be at their absolute best."" Western Kentucky has an experienced group, which returned mostly intact from last season. The team is led by Conference USA first-team selection Don McHenry, who is leading the team with 17.2 points and 2.2 steals per game. McHenry is one of four Hilltoppers with scoring averages in double figures. Julius Thedford (11.4 points per game) and Babacar Faye (15.0) are each shooting 40 percent or better from 3-point range. Western Kentucky also figures to challenge the Wildcats on the boards as it enters the game ranked in the top 25 in defensive rebounding (30.4 per game). Faye leads the Hilltoppers in that department, averaging 7.8 rebounds per game and figures to battle Williams inside. ""We're not the biggest team in the world, but our depth and our quickness are our strengths,"" Plona said. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Jones was released at his request by the Giants on Saturday after the former first-round pick was benched last week. He reportedly wants to join a contender, and there are expected to be multiple teams interested. The two teams reported to have the most initial interest in Jones are also being offered as the most likely to sign him by one sportsbook. The Baltimore Ravens currently have journeyman backup Josh Johnson behind starting quarterback Lamar Jackson. Jones would potentially provide a third option, and one whose mobility could make him an intriguing fit in offensive coordinator Todd Monken's system The Ravens were installed as the 2/1 favorites to land Jones ahead of the Minnesota Vikings (5/2), who have veterans Nick Mullens and Brett Rypien behind starter Sam Darnold. They would likely view Jones as an upgrade. ""I really can't get into too much about any short-term or long-term,"" Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell said Monday when asked about Jones, per ESPN's Adam Schefter. ""I can just say that I've been a big fan of Daniel's for a long time and I hope wherever his next step takes him, it's a good opportunity for him."" The Las Vegas Raiders (5/1) don't fall into the category of contenders after falling to 2-9 amid a seven-game losing streak. However, they could provide the most immediate opportunity to play with Gardner Minshew suffering a season-ending broken collarbone on Sunday that is expected to end his season. Second-year quarterback Aidan O'Connell is close to returning from a thumb injury, but coach Antonio Pierce acknowledged after Sunday's game that, ""We're going to need somebody, right?"" If O'Connell isn't ready to face the Kansas City Chiefs on Black Friday, Desmond Ridder is expected to get the start. The Dallas Cowboys (7/1) would fall into a similar category, with Dak Prescott out for the season following hamstring surgery and being replaced by Cooper Rush.  Another intriguing possibility lies with Detroit, where the 10-1 Lions' offense is rolling with Jared Goff at the helm. However, should he go down to injury the only other quarterback on the roster is rookie Hendon Hooker. That has contributed to the Lions having 7/1 odds to sign Jones.

Hunter, who played at Iowa State and Texas before transferring to Memphis, made eight field goals with 7-of-10 3-point shooting. The Tigers (5-0) connected on 12 of their 22 3-point attempts in the win. UConn's Hassan Diarra made a free throw to cut the Memphis lead to 99-97 with 2.2 seconds left. He intentionally missed the second free throw and collected the loose ball, but his desperation shot was off the mark. It was 92-92 when UConn's Liam McNeeley was called for an offensive foul with 40.3 seconds left. UConn coach Dan Hurley received a technical for arguing the foul call, and PJ Carter made all four free throws to give the Tigers a four-point lead. Memphis, which squandered a 13-point lead with four minutes to play in regulation, received 22 points from PJ Haggerty, 19 from Colby Rogers and 14 from Dain Dainja. Memphis will play the winner of Monday night's game between Colorado and Michigan State in Tuesday's semifinals. UConn will face the loser of that contest. Tarris Reed Jr. had a team-high 22 points and a game-high 11 rebounds for UConn (4-1) before he fouled out with 3:18 to play. He made 10 of his 13 field goal attempts. Alex Karaban added 19 points for the Huskies. Jaylin Stewart scored a career-high 16 points, Diarra had 12 and McNeeley added 10. UConn trailed 82-79 after Diarra made two free throws with 24.2 seconds to play in regulation. The Huskies then forced a turnover and tied the game on a 3-pointer by Solo Ball with 1.2 on the clock. Although Memphis shot 56.5 percent from the field (13 for 23) and 50 percent from 3-point territory (5 for 10) in the first half, the game was tied 40-40 after 20 minutes. Neither team led by more than six points in the half. UConn received 29 points from its bench in the first half.

Both teams are in the ""Power"" group of the eight-team event. All eight teams are receiving $1 million for their name, image and likeness (NIL) collectives, but placing fourth or higher in the tourney in order will net them anywhere from $1.1 million to $1.5 million. The Aggies (4-1) opened the season with a three-point loss at UCF, but since then have won four straight, all in convincing fashion. Texas A&M upset then-No. 21 Ohio State 78-64 on Nov. 15 at home in College Station, Texas. Then the Aggies crushed Southern 71-54 last Wednesday, when Wade Taylor IV led the way with 17 points and six assists. All of Texas A&M's wins have been by double digits. The Aggies and Ducks (5-0) have split the two previous meetings against each other. Until March 2022 in an NIT second-round game, they had not met since the 1970-71 season. Texas A&M tied the overall series with a 75-60 win at home in 2022. The only player on the Ducks' current roster who played in that game was 7-foot senior Nate Bittle, who has been one of Oregon's best players so far this season. Bittle's 16.2 points and 10.2 rebounds per game lead the Ducks so far this season, and the big man also averages two blocked shots per game. Texas A&M guard Zhuric Phelps, a transfer from SMU, leads the Aggies in scoring at 16 points per game. Taylor adds 14 points per game. The Aggies could be the best defensive team the Ducks will have seen this season. A&M is allowing teams to shoot only 36.6 percent in games. Head coach Buzz Williams and his staff are hoping the team gets better at taking charges on defense, as the Aggies have just one so far this season. ""I guess the thing that you work on most is verticality around the rim,"" Texas A&M assistant coach Steve Roccaforte told KBTX television. ""‘Hey, once you get there, if you try and take a charge, it's going to be a block. Just jump as high as you can, stay vertical, try to go chest-to-chest. Make it a hard shot.'"" Oregon is coming off a 78-75 win at Oregon State, the Ducks' first road game of the season. The Ducks trailed by 10 points at halftime but, as they have in several games this season, they found a rhythm on offense in the second half and came up with a comeback win. Bittle's 23 points and 14 rebounds led the way. Jackson Shelstad had 15 points and Jadrian Tracey and Keeshawn Barthelemy both added 10. ""We started rebounding the ball a little better. Nate really got it going inside and our guys got him the ball,"" Oregon head coach Dana Altman told the school's athletics website. ""He had a heck of a game."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Jamarii Thomas, a senior transfer from Norfolk State, had 19 points and swished 4 of 5 shots from behind the arc. ""Thomas got some good, clean looks,"" Paris said. ""It was good to see those guys make their shots. Hopefully it gets those guys going in the right direction."" On the season, the Gamecocks are making 7.8 3-pointers per game and shooting 32.5 percent from deep.

Xavier is allowing eight makes from deep per game and is letting opponents shoot 38.5 percent from behind the arc, which ranks 337th in the country. And despite an undefeated record so far for the Musketeers, third-year coach Sean Miller is worried about his players developing bad habits. ""We have a virus that everybody is looking at the stat sheet, trying to get as many points as they possibly can,"" Miller said after the win over Siena. ""They want to win, but they really want to win and score. We need a couple of guys that are willing to rebound, defend, make the extra pass, play at a high level defensively and understand what makes a team great.""

Lillard is second on Milwaukee in scoring (25.2) and leads the Bucks in assists (7.4). ""When you have your scorers passing,"" Rivers said, ""it's hard to stop you."" Lillard, after missing three games due to a concussion, has come back strong. He has three double-doubles in his past four games, and he is averaging 9.3 assists during that span. ""He is driving to pass,"" Rivers said, ""and that's not something he was doing earlier in the year."" Antetokounmpo, who has missed just one game this season, is shooting 62.4 percent on 2-pointers and averaging 11.9 rebounds. Antetokounmpo said he never lost belief in himself, even when the Bucks were 2-8 to start the season. ""My confidence has always been high because I work,"" he said. ""I trust myself. ""But the beginning of the season was miserable for everybody. We don't want to go back to that. Right now, we are clicking."" Meanwhile, the host Heat beat the Dallas Mavericks 123-118 in overtime on Sunday. Miami's Jimmy Butler scored a season-high 33 points, including the score-tying dunk with 4.1 seconds left in regulation, sending the game to overtime. After the game, Butler praised his coach and teased teammate Duncan Robinson, who made the perfect pass for the assist on the dunk. ""(Heat coach Erik Spoelstra) was locked in,"" Butler said. ""He studies like nobody I've ever seen. He drew up something incredible, and I hate to say it but Duncan made an incredible pass."" Butler, off to a bit of a slow start this season, now has two straight 30-point-plus games. He ranks second on the team in scoring (19.2), second in assists (5.0) and third in rebounds (5.7). Miami's Pelle Larsson, a rookie second-round pick from Sweden who is starting to get more playing time, put into perspective the ""Butler Effect."" ""It's easy to play with Jimmy because he demands so much attention from a defense,"" said Larsson, who scored 14 points in 37 minutes off the bench on Sunday. ""I get to shoot open shots."" With Heat starting guard Terry Rozier sitting out for the Dallas game due to a right foot injury, Larsson and other reserves came through. Rozier is probable for Tuesday. Miami's current bench brigade includes veterans Alec Burks and Kevin Love as well as youngsters Larsson, Jaime Jaquez Jr. and Nikola Jovic. Larsson, though, earned special praise from Spoelstra on Sunday. ""Pelle plays so hard,"" Spoelstra said. ""He throws his body around."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Rodgers is ""absolutely"" the starting quarterback for the Jets (3-8) against the Seattle Seahawks (6-5), Ulbrich confirmed. Responding to questions centered around reports Rodgers was bypassing medical tests for minor leg injuries -- a swollen knee and a tender ankle -- Ulbrich said there has been no discussion about shelving Rodgers. ""All I can say -- and you'd have to ask Aaron if he's fully healthy -- but he's better off today than he's been as of late,"" Ulbrich said. ""So he's definitely feeling healthier than he has for probably the last month, and a healthy Aaron Rodgers is the Aaron Rodgers we all love. So, excited about what that looks like."" Ulbrich, named interim coach in October, said coming back from the team's bye week he wasn't aware of Rodgers skipping scans or X-rays. ""That's news to me,"" Ulbrich said Monday. The Jets have lost seven of their last eight games and Ulbrich said Monday one area of focus after a bye week is keeping players focused regardless of playoff chances. Rodgers turns 41 on Dec. 2 and said he is planning to return for the 2025 season despite disappointment over the results to date of what he framed as a redemption season. Rodgers, acquired in a trade from the Packers in 2023, was lost for the entire season when he ruptured his Achilles on the first possession of his debut with New York. He has 17 touchdowns and seven interceptions in 2024 but hasn't thrown a pick since the Oct. 20 loss at Pittsburgh. The Jets are making plans to move forward with front office interviews for general manager and a permanent head coach. Owner Woody Johnson's relationship with Rodgers has been questioned publicly, but a contradicting report emerged Sunday stating the two recently dined together in New York. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Bulls look to get back on track in an NBA Cup East Group C game on Tuesday night when they visit the nation's capital to face the Wizards, who have lost 11 in a row. While Washington routinely has found itself on the wrong side of the scoreboard of late, Chicago is keeping the scoreboard operator busy given the generosity of its defense. Case in point: The Bulls dropped a 142-131 decision to the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday, marking the third time the team has allowed an opponent to reach 140 points in the last six games. Chicago is permitting an NBA-worst 123.9 points per game this season -- just ahead of the Wizards (122.9) -- heading into play on Monday. ""At some point, we've got to hold our ground,"" Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. ""I said before the season even started that defense was going to be a challenge, and it is. I think there are times that we have to look at the controllables. ""Is it fixable? Defense is a talent. It's no different than offense, in my opinion. There are guys that are talented defensively.

He is averaging a team-best 22.7 points per game this season. Nikola Vucevic added 26 points and eight rebounds against Memphis. He is averaging a team-leading 9.7 boards per contest to go along with 20.5 points. Rookie Matas Buzelis added a career-high 14 points on Saturday for the Bulls, who were unable to overcome the Grizzlies shooting a robust 57.3 percent from the floor and 45.2 percent from 3-point range. The Wizards' woeful streak started after they recorded a home-and-home sweep of the Atlanta Hawks in late October. Rookie Alexandre Sarr collected 14 rebounds and matched Bilal Coulibaly with 17 points in a 115-103 setback to the Indiana Pacers on Sunday. Malcolm Brogdon, who scored 15 points, provided a calming influence given the team's considerable troubles. ""When things go awry or things are feeling sticky ...

In addition to claiming his maiden PGA Tour victory at the season-ending The RSM Classic on Sunday, McNealy claimed the top spot on the Aon Next 10. That means along with the $1.4 million winner's check and a two-year PGA Tour exemption, the former Stanford star also secured a spot in the Masters, The Players and the first three signature events of 2025.

""I've played (Augusta National) twice, but never been there for the tournament.""

Yu was among three players who moved into the top 60 during the course of the fall, along with Echavarria (started No. 108) and Griffin (started No. 61). Those 10 will join the top 50 as automatic qualifiers for the first two limited-event fields with increased prize money in 2025. There were multiple layers of drama that unfolded during the course of the fall. The second layer was the race to finish inside the top 125 and secure fully exempt status for 2025. Daniel Berger, who finished a shot behind McNealy on Sunday, vaulted from No. 127 to No. 100 this week. It was also the seventh start of the fall for the four-time PGA Tour winner, and Sunday marked his best finish since his most recent title at Pebble Beach in 2021. He had returned in January from a back injury that kept him away from the tour for about 18 months. Meanwhile, Henrik Norlander of Sweden tied for 17th at The RSM Classic to move from No. 126 to No. 120. Fan favorite Joel Dahmen made the cut on the number on Friday to keep his hopes alive and then shot a 64 on Sunday to secure a T35 to finish No. 124. That was one spot ahead of Sam Ryder, who held onto the 125th spot. That bumped Zac Blair to No. 126 and into conditional status next year along with those who finished Nos. 126-150. Just missing that group was former United States Ryder Cup star Ryan Moore, who failed to reach the weekend in Georgia for his fourth missed cut in six fall starts. Dahmen, who sank a 5 1/2-foot putt on Friday to make the cut, played in all eight events and spoke openly about the emotional drain of working so hard to keep his fully exempt status. ""This is my eighth year out here, I probably made it longer than I ever thought I would,"" he said. ""You take it for granted a little bit.

According to Front Office Sports, at least a dozen Mountain West conference players, including San Jose State's Brook Slusser, filed suit against the conference, its commissioner Gloria Nevarez and San Jose State administrators, as well as Spartans coach Todd Kress. Multiple teams elected not to play against San Jose State this season amid claims the team had a transgender player. Mountain West schools Utah State, Nevada, Boise State and Wyoming refused to play the Spartans, resulting in forfeits. Nonconference opponent Southern Utah also elected to forfeit. The Utah State program joined as a plaintiff in the lawsuit, according to the Front Office Sports report. An unidentified San Jose State player, who has been with the program since 2022, was named in the filing. That player has not said she is transgender. Neither San Jose State nor the Mountain West Conference have said anything about the player's gender. Judge Kato Crews cited NCAA Title IX policy that prohibits discrimination against transgender people. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the Mountain West Conference had already implemented a policy that transgender women can compete if tests show levels of testosterone normal for females. The schools that forfeited to the Spartans had already agreed on the rules pertaining to trans players' eligibility, the judge noted. The judge also questioned the timing of the emergency injunction, which was filed just before the conference tournament regarding a matter that had been established at the start of the season. According to the Chronicle report, an appeal could be heard by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

McCarty, 37, announced his decision to retire in August. He departs after 523 career appearances including the postseason, third in league history behind Nick Rimando (553) and Kyle Beckerman (535). ""I'm really grateful for these last 19 years,"" McCarty said. ""If you were to tell the little kid in me that I would have made it this far, I wouldn't have believed you. It's been a hell of a ride and I'm just really grateful."" McCarty had one assist in 22 matches (10 starts) during his lone season with Atlanta. He recorded 22 goals and 72 assists in the regular season with FC Dallas (2006-10), D.C. United (2011), New York Red Bulls (2011-16), Chicago Fire (2017-19), Nashville SC (2020-23) and Atlanta. An MLS Cup eluded McCarty, a two-time Supporters' Shield winner with the Red Bulls (2013, 2015). He was an MLS All-Star in 2015 and 2017 and made the MLS Best XI in 2015. ""It's been one of the most memorable months of my career,"" McCarty said of the playoff run with the Five Stripes. ""Frustrating season, but we ended it with pride and we ended it fighting. That's all you can ask. We gave it a good go. We gave it everything we had. ""The magic just ran out a little bit here in Orlando."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Daboll said he invited conversation about the end result against the Buccaneers, which dropped the Giants to 2-9 this season before a short week and holiday showcase game at Dallas on Thanksgiving, but said he doesn't see effort as the issue. ""I mean we went back, we evaluated the tape this morning. Look, we didn't play well enough,"" Daboll told reporters Monday. ""Some things, whether it's execution stuff, call stuff, that we just didn't get the job done. But in terms of running to the football, giving effort at the line of scrimmage, those didn't stand out.  ""What stands out was three sacks early on in the first half, 0-for-4 on third down, a variety of missed tackles that caused some big plays. And the missed tackles weren't a lack-of-effort missed tackles. Give Tampa Bay credit. They did a good job, and we didn't do a good enough job. ... But the guys played hard, they played with effort."" Daboll said he was leaving the press conference Monday to make some of the same teaching points to the entire team at their usual day-after group breakdown. ""Look, we have good communication. We'll talk about what Jermaine sees,"" Daboll said in reference to offensive tackle Jermaine Eluemunor's comments after the loss. ""And we'll talk about what we see. We'll watch it. It's right on tape. But again, I have confidence in the guys in the locker room."" The loss came six days after the Giants demoted, then waived, starting quarterback Daniel Jones. The defeat stretches the Giants' losing streak to six games and was the fourth time this season New York failed to score more than seven points. After the game, rookie wide receiver Malik Nabers, defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence and veteran offensive lineman Eluemunor separately said the effort against the Buccaneers wasn't there. ""Look, these guys put a lot of work into this, as does everybody involved, and certainly not something that we wanted yesterday. We work hard every week to not have that happen, and that was a tough one,"" Daboll said. ""So, there's frustration that comes with it, understandable. And we communicate, I think we have good leadership in our locker room. I think we communicate on a daily basis. But certainly, a frustrating game, no question about it."" DeVito took multiple hard hits and was sacked four times. Perhaps the most jarring was in the first quarter when DeVito stepped up on the pocket to evade pressure coming from his right and met speedy defensive tackle Calijah Kancey, who delivered a de-cleater upon impact. DeVito miraculously held onto the ball on the third-down sack.  Kancey hit DeVito again in the fourth quarter as he was releasing a pass with enough force to bring his feet well off the ground for a second time. ""I have not talked to the training staff yet. So, I'll wait until they give me the update, then we'll see where we're at. But I'm anticipating he'll be ready to go,"" Daboll said. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The original timetable for his return from his surgery in late June was five to six months. The torn medial retinaculum injury, considered ""rare,"" occurred during the NBA Finals against the Dallas Mavericks, which the Celtics won in five games. In recent weeks, Porzingis, 29, has participated in scrimmages during practices with the Celtics and their NBA G League affiliate in Maine.

""He got through good, and came out OK, so he's just continuing to wrap it up and is getting better and better,"" Mazzulla told reporters Thursday. ""All I know is he's getting better every day. He's working really hard at coming back as fast as he can, and he's in the next phase of ramping."" Comments from Porzingis and general manager Brad Stevens in recent months also indicated that the Latvian native's rehab was going very well. ""The expectation is sometime in December,"" he told ESPN in late September. ""But I'm feeling really good and I'm working towards hopefully playing earlier than that."" Stevens expressed optimism at Boston's media day in late September, saying, ""As far as how he feels and the progress that he's made, I'd say we're very, very pleased with where he is and maybe a little surprised."" The 7-foot-2 Porzingis averaged 20.1 points, 7.2 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.9 blocks in 57 games (all starts) in his first season with Boston in 2023-24.

The company, which partnered with Netflix for what was the most-streamed global sporting event in history, insisted they complied with all appropriate regulations for a match that was sanctioned by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulations (TDLR). ""Both fighters in good faith performed to the best of their abilities with the goal of winning the fight,"" MVP's statement said. ""There were absolutely no restrictions -- contractual or otherwise -- around either fighter. Each boxer was able to use his full arsenal to win the fight. Any agreement to the contrary would violate TDLR boxing rules."" Paul (11-1, 7 KOs) earned a unanimous decision against former heavyweight champion Tyson (50-7, 44 KOs). The judges scored it 80-72, 79-73, 79-73, with the former YouTube star winning the striking battle 78-18 across eight two-minute rounds.

Netflix saw the fight peak at a record 65 million concurrent streams. However, reaction to the fight came with questions about its authenticity from big names in the sport, including Hall of Famer Oscar de la Hoya, who posted on social media, ""Everybody is talking about how staged this fight was. I do believe it was scripted and I believe that Tyson was certainly held back. ""Look, I'm a fighter and I can see it. It goes on their record and it was sanctioned.

Who's next? Joe Biden? You have to fight real fighters."" Paul himself fueled some of the rumors when asked in the post-match press conference whether he took his foot off the gas in round three. ""Yeah, definitely. Definitely a bit,"" he told reporters. ""I wanted to give the fans a show, but I didn't want to hurt someone that didn't need to be hurt."" MVP said it was ""illogical and inane"" to suggest the company would risk a new and potentially lucrative partnership with Netflix by breaking the rules. ""Trash talk and speculation are common in sports, and athletes and promoters need to tolerate nonsensical commentary, jokes and opinions. But suggesting anything other than full effort from these fighters is not only naive but an insult to the work they put into their craft and to the sport itself."" MVP's co-founder, Nakisa Bidarian, defended Paul, a YouTube millionaire-turned-pro athlete. ""From day one in this sport, people have doubted his abilities -- unable to reconcile how someone with his background has accomplished so much in such a short time,"" Bidarian said Monday. ""Jake has not only proven himself repeatedly, but he has continuously set historic records that speak for themselves. ... As long as Jake continues to exceed expectations, there will always be those who try to discredit his achievements.

Who will rise from the mediocrity to claim the","It’s not exactly NFC West-level chaos in the South.  But with six weeks left in the regular season, Atlanta, Tampa Bay, New Orleans and Carolina have everything to sort out. There are signs of life and unexpectedly heartening play suddenly behind the division-leading Falcons.  While Atlanta enjoyed its bye week, the Bucs broke out of a four-game losing streak, and the once-lowly—maybe still lowly, but spunky—Panthers showed promise in a gritty loss to the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs.  Becoming kings of the South is not just about prestige. Once again this season, it’s highly likely that only the division winner will secure a playoff spot.  Entering Week 13, the 6-5 Falcons are the fourth seed in the NFC, with a 71% chance of reaching the postseason, according to NFL.com projections. The second-place Bucs (5-6) are currently ninth-seeded behind 6-5 Arizona and given a 52% chance of reaching the playoffs. The odds get incredibly long for the division behind the top two. The Saints are 4-7 at 4% playoff chances and the 3-8 Panthers at less than 1 percent. Even so, all four of these teams will be a factor in which one is left standing in the end. Here’s a team-by-team outlook for the rest of the season. ATLANTA: The Falcons’ main asset is a 4-1 record in the division, having swept the Bucs, splitting with New Orleans and taking the first matchup on the road against Carolina. The remainder of Atlanta’s schedule is a mixed bag, with tough dates against the Chargers at home this week and at Minnesota in Week 14. But there’s also manageable games against the Raiders and Panthers and a fading Washington. Oddly, Atlanta is the only current division leader with a negative net points figure, at a staggering minus-30. TAMPA BAY: Tampa Bay is 1-2 in the South, its victory coming at New Orleans. The Bucs looked explosive and playoff-worthy, albeit against the Giants, in a 30-7 blowout win on Sunday and quarterback Baker Mayfield appears to have his team playing loose and confident. Their remaining schedule seems amenable to a playoff run: two dates with Carolina, hosting Las Vegas and at Dallas. All told, Tampa Bay has three huge division games left in its final six. Crucially, though, none with Atlanta. NEW ORLEANS: The Saints, incredibly, are just two games off the pace after two straight wins, including a 20-17 triumph over Atlanta two weeks ago. The Saints have been an oddity at 2-3 in the division. They’ve split with the Falcons (good), but split with the Panthers (bad). The seven-game losing streak that defines their season included all three division defeats, and there’s tough home matchups ahead against the Rams and Packers.  CAROLINA: The Panthers are incredibly interesting for a last-place team. Benched, then reinstated, quarterback Bryce Young is suddenly playing like a number one draft pick, orchestrating a comeback from an 11-point halftime deficit against Kansas City on Sunday and setting up... a heartbreaking last-second defeat. Carolina is 1-2 in the division, having split with the Saints and lost at home to Atlanta. And it represents a real variable in determining the outcome of the South. Carolina had won two in a row—against the Saints and Giants—before Sunday’s 30-27 loss to the Chiefs. If the last three weeks have been more about a young team and quarterback growing up and less about playing one of the worst teams in the NFL (New York) and another with a flare for making life hard on itself (Kansas City), then the Panthers could go as far in deciding the NFC South as the two teams with a real chance to capture it. It begins in Week 13 when Carolina hosts Tampa Bay. It continues on Dec. 29 with the Panthers at Tampa Bay. Carolina visits Atlanta in the final game of the regular season. Copyright 2024"

For the first time since Super Bowl XLVII, the Harbaugh brothers meet again almost 12 years later as John leads his Baltimore Ravens (7-4) into California to test the Chargers (7-3). Already dueling for wildcard position in the AFC, this matchup finds two teams in good standing for the playoffs win or lose. But a potential tiebreaker in seeding the top seven from the conference comes out of this head-to-head fight for the No. 5 seed and first wildcard position. No team currently on the bubble has better than a 20% chance to reach the postseason, so a loss isn't a death knell to either side. --Pressure is modest on Monday night The Ravens are currently the No. 6 seed in the playoff picture, one spot behind the Chargers. The Chargers have played one fewer game due to a bye in Week 5. Remarkably, none of the nine teams currently outside the AFC playoff picture have up to six wins on the season. Even with a loss on Monday night, the Chargers and Ravens will still have no worse than an 85% chance of making the playoffs.  Those circumstances should allow both teams to play at their best.  We already know the Ravens have one of the most potent offenses in the league. They rank first in the FTN Fantasy Defense-adjusted Value Over Average (DVOA) metric. And it's a good thing. Because their defense can be particularly vulnerable, ranking 25th in allowing 362 yards per game.  --Prop Stop: RBs raised by Ravens Five times the Ravens have allowed 320-plus passing yards in 11 games. Third downs are a problem, and a defense asked to be on the field more than 65 snaps seven times is staring down the barrel at a grind-em-down offensive philosophy that spells doom for the secondary in the second half. A rotation of J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards, former Ravens backs now leading the Chargers' productive running game (121.6 yards per game) is ample enough to force the Ravens to play to defend the run.  But Baltimore's big-play woes in the secondary multiply when they have to commit a safety to slow down an opponent's running game.  Six of QB Justin Herbert's 13 TD passes this season were on pass plays of more than 25 yards. He is thriving in play-action with more than 700 yards and three touchdowns off of run fakes since Week 6, which is No. 1 in the NFL. Big plays are there vertically and in the short screen game to push Herbert across the 300-yard passing mark for the second time this season. Prop pick: Herbert over 300 passing yards (+220, Fan Duel) --Chargers can hurt Ravens by air According to Pro Football Focus, the Ravens' secondary has the lowest grade (63.0) of all three levels of its defense. Moreover, their explosive passing plays allowed of 20 or more yards are the league's second-highest (50). As a result, there's no question that the Chargers can get after this Ravens defense through the air. Quarterback Justin Herbert is known to push the ball down the field. The Oregon product ranks ninth in intended air yards, averaging 8.6 per attempt.  This metric is particularly crucial because it shows the average distance of his passes from behind the line of scrimmage even before the throw reaches the intended receiver. There aren't a ton of check-downs in this Chargers offense, and Herbert has been extremely precise with his accuracy, having thrown just one interception the entire season.  While they generally like to play a more controlled game, the Chargers are more than capable of holding their own in a shootout like last week in their 34-27 victory over the Bengals. Herbert completed only 17 of his 36 pass attempts but still threw for 297 yards. That stat line shows the aggressiveness of the Chargers' downfield strategy, which could be pretty effective against the Ravens' pass defense. The Chargers offense intrigues me the most because of their chances of putting up some points -- everyone does against the Ravens this season. Their team total of 23.5 points is available at DraftKings and well within my projection. Pick: Chargers team total over 23.5 (-125) --Michael Nwaneri, Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Graham, who previously said this would be his final year in the league, moved into third place on the Eagles' all-time sacks list with a second-quarter takedown of Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford but left the game injured in the second half. ""I trust God, so I'm just enjoying myself,"" Graham said. ""I'm about to enjoy this little rehab and I'm about to enjoy leading this team the rest of the year. As soon as I can be out there I'm going to be out there. ""Man, boy, man, boy, I was having fun out there. And we're still gonna have fun. But I'm out for the year."" Graham posted career sack No. 76.5 to move ahead of Clyde Simmons behind only Trent Cole and Reggie White on the Eagles' all-time sacks list.

Graham will be placed on injured reserve but said his daily duty to the Eagles as a captain and voice in the defensive line meeting room will not change. As for where he goes from here, he wasn't ready to say Sunday night. But Graham did appear to prop the door open for a 16th NFL season. ""I was feeling good,"" Graham said. ""I hated it to go like this, but at the end of the day I don't have any regrets. I put it all in today like I do every week. We'll go from here. I'm hoping we're holding that trophy regardless. ""I don't wanna go out like this but if it's pointing toward that, we'll see. I don't know what the team will be feeling at that time, but for me, I don't wanna go out like this.

Graham had 3.5 sacks in 2024 after posting 3.0 in 17 games last season.

Needing 2 yards for a tying two-point conversion late in the fourth quarter against first-place Pittsburgh, the Ravens kept star running back Derrick Henry on the sidelines and subsequently came up short. The Steelers took over, ran off the final 1:06 and secured an 18-16 home win on Nov. 17 that dropped Baltimore 1.5 games behind them in the AFC North. Plenty of questions lingered from the two-point loss, but the biggest one of them all was obvious: Why wasn’t Henry on the field with the game on the line.  Nobody from the Ravens gave an insightful answer, but Baltimore’s decision to sideline Henry encapsulated a dynamic that has hampered the team over the past few seasons.  The Ravens are seemingly afraid of how good they can be. You have Henry, a two-time rushing champion, and Lamar Jackson, a two-time MVP, leading an offense that entered the Pittsburgh contest putting up a league-leading 31.8 points per game. So why is only one of them on the field for the biggest play of the game? Wasn’t this why you signed Henry in March? For moments like this? The guy’s averaging 6 yards a carry and only needs to gain a third of that to tie the game against the lone team that separates you from first place. Put him on the field!  You don’t need to give Henry the ball—I agree that doing so could be a bit too predictable—but at least make the Steelers think. Baltimore didn’t, and instead of having to worry about stopping either Henry or Jackson, Pittsburgh knew the game was in the latter’s hands. The Steelers appropriately sent the house and forced an incompletion on an awkward play that looked doomed from the start. I’m not saying the Ravens would have converted the two-point attempt with Henry on the field, but you have to figure whatever play they ran would have at least been more competent.  How could it not have been? Deploying your bruising running back with your electrifying quarterback is bound to keep a defense—even one as sturdy as Pittsburgh's—on edge.  It was almost like Baltimore chose to make the moment harder than it needed to be. And that’s really nothing new. The Steelers deserve credit, of course, but Sunday’s game was another instance where the Ravens did plenty to beat themselves. This time it was 12 penalties, three turnovers and two missed kicks on top of the questionable call on the two-point attempt. Frankly, that’s how most of Baltimore’s losses in recent seasons have played out. Untimely mistakes and unexplainable lapses that flip a winnable game into an inexcusable defeat. Last Sunday’s game was a bit different in the sense that it didn’t involve a blown fourth-quarter lead. The Ravens have plenty of those losses, including two this season. Baltimore coughed up a 10-point lead at home to Las Vegas in Week 2 and couldn’t hold a one-point edge over the final 2:36 at Cleveland in Week 8. And there could have been more. The Ravens nearly blew a 22-point advantage at Dallas in Week 3 and allowed Tampa Bay to score twice in the final 3:46 of a less-than-comfy 41-31 road win in Week 7. In those cases, it’s almost like Baltimore gets bored and eases up just to make things more interesting, only for it to sometimes backfire in the end. No team has done it more as of late—the Ravens have lost a league-high 10 games over the last four seasons after leading by at least seven points in the fourth quarter. It has to be especially frustrating for Baltimore fans considering that the Ravens are rarely flat-out beat. Baltimore’s last loss by more than eight points came in Week 18 of 2022, a 27-16 defeat at Cincinnati that Jackson missed with a knee injury. With Jackson starting, the Ravens haven’t lost a game by more than eight since Nov. 10, 2021. It’s like Baltimore has no killer instinct. The Ravens have perhaps the deepest roster in the league and are essentially impossible to dominate, yet they can’t stop stubbing their own toe. Whether it’s letting up too soon in the game or—as was the case Sunday—not taking advantage of their weapons when it’s most appropriate, Baltimore has cost itself far too many times. As they chase their first Super Bowl title in 12 years, the Ravens don’t need to look at Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Buffalo or Detroit to find out who their biggest threat is. All they have to do is look in the mirror. Copyright 2024"

No matter. The guys and gals in charge of our favorite teams often hold sway with their fashion choices, even when being more bland than bold. Mention Los Angeles Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh, for example, and it’s likely at least part of the free association would steer one to reference his trusty khakis. Harbaugh also will wear a little-brother complex into today’s “Monday Night Football” matchup against the visiting Baltimore Ravens. It’s the third time he’ll face his older brother, John, who, like Jim, has his team positioned for an AFC playoff spot. John has bested Jim in both previous meetings, including a 34-31 Ravens victory against the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII. The Chargers are off to a 7-3 start in Jim’s first season at the helm, with the Ravens (7-4) among the teams on their heels for a wild card. Let’s look more closely at Harbaugh Bowl III and an NHL contest with coaching intrigue of its own. Baltimore stands just one game behind Pittsburgh for the AFC North lead after the Steelers’ snowy loss in Cleveland on Thursday night. Elements won’t be an issue at SoFi Stadium, which doesn’t bode well for Baltimore. The Ravens have allowed 3,351 passing yards, most in the NFL, and only five teams yield more than Baltimore’s 7.7 yards per attempt against. Enter Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert, whose 7.9 yards per attempt are tied for ninth among the league’s regular passers. After a slow start to the season, Herbert has passed for at least 279 yards in three of four games since going for a season-high 349 in Week 7 at Arizona. That includes 297 in last week’s 34-27 home thriller over Cincinnati. Another AFC North foe in town, another Chargers air show.

The Ravens complement that with a rushing attack that leads the league with 5.8 yards per carry and is facing a Los Angeles defense that’s in the bottom third of the league in defensive yards per carry against.

He skated for 67 games for St. Louis as a rookie in 1993-94 and spent 2020-22 as an assistant under Craig Berube. On Monday, St. Louis will be more interested in its new coach’s familiarity with a foe. Just one day after swooping in to hire Montgomery following last week’s dismissal from the Boston Bruins, St. Louis visits Boston’s Eastern Conference counterpart, the New York Rangers. Out of the playoff field the past two seasons, St. Louis entered this campaign eager to snap that drought. Instead, the Blues have been stagnant. At 9-12-1, they’re tied for fifth in the Central Division with 19 points and are 2-6-1 over their past nine games.

Noah Clowney hit five 3-pointers among 18 points and Shake Milton chipped in 10 as the Nets, getting 44 points from their reserves, opened a four-day, three-game Western swing with a 108-103 win at Sacramento on Sunday. Jalen Wilson added seven points, including a key late free throw, and Keon Johnson had six among the Brooklyn reserves, who spelled their starters for a total of 101 minutes on the front half of the back-to-back. Brooklyn won the battle of the backups 44-9. Trusting the second-stringers is one reason the Nets have been able to adjust quickly to new coach Jordi Fernandez's up-tempo style, starter Cameron Johnson pointed out. ""We're gonna pick up and guard; we're gonna ball-pressure. We're gonna shoot threes and we're gonna run,"" Johnson said. ""We've done a good job of that so far. Not perfect. Room for improvement. But I'm excited about the direction this team is headed."" The Nets, who recorded just 32 victories a year ago, have won two of their past three, including Sunday's hard-earned triumph in Sacramento after blowing an early 19-point lead. They will be seeing the Warriors for the first time this season. Golden State has won five in a row at home, including victories over the Dallas Mavericks and Memphis Grizzlies that propelled them to first place in the West: Group C of the NBA Cup. The Warriors have assured themselves of a spot in the tournament's Western semifinals. Golden State clinched that spot with a 112-108 win at New Orleans on Friday. The Warriors didn't respond well to a back-to-back of their own Saturday, falling 104-94 at San Antonio. Afterward, Warriors coach Steve Kerr insisted a fourth loss in 16 games wasn't about to carry over to a three-day, two-game homestand. Golden State hosts Oklahoma City on Wednesday. ""Keep on keeping on. You move forward,"" he said. ""It's been a great start to the season. Disappointing loss. You learn from it."" The Warriors have lost two of their past four, a stretch in which Stephen Curry has seen his point production drop from 26 to 23 to 19 to 14. Meanwhile, Andrew Wiggins has picked up his pace, scoring 20 or more in all four games, hitting 34 of his 59 shots (57.6 percent). Winning Monday's opener of the season series could carry a little more weight than usual if the clubs continue a recent trend. Each of the teams' two-game series since the 2015-16 season have ended in a sweep, with Brooklyn taking a pair in 2022-23 and Golden State getting even last season. Brooklyn's Cam Thomas and Curry put on quite a show in the most recent meeting in San Francisco last December, with Thomas going for 41 points and Curry 37. Golden State got the better of the bench play that night. The Warriors' reserves outscored their Brooklyn counterparts 30-13. -Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Kansas State will have trouble finding any silver lining in Sunday's loss. Trailing by two points, the Wildcats had three chances to tie or take the lead on their final possession. Dug McDaniel's 3-pointer caromed off the rim into the hands of David N'Guessan, who misfired on his putback attempt. McDaniel's 3-pointer at the buzzer also was off target. Head coach Jerome Tang tried to put a positive spin on it following the loss. ""At the end of the game, we got a score to cut it to two, and we did it quick so they had to get a shot up,"" he said. ""Then we got a stop. Then Dug McDaniel had an open 3, and I'll live with that every day. David N'Guessan got a chance at a putback and we missed. ""Tough people do the next right thing so we're going to rehydrate, eat, get some rest. The staff will have a game plan put together and we'll be ready to rock and roll (Monday)."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",Thunder's Isaiah Hartenstein aims to make impact vs. Kings,https://deadspin.com/thunders-isaiah-hartenstein-aims-to-make-impact-vs-kings/,2024-11-25T12:57:29.575Z,"Isaiah Hartenstein's return to action came at a good time for the Oklahoma City Thunder.,With star center Chet Holmgren out with a fractured pelvis, H","Isaiah Hartenstein's return to action came at a good time for the Oklahoma City Thunder. With star center Chet Holmgren out with a fractured pelvis, Hartenstein is a pivotal player for the Thunder. Hartenstein will look to follow a strong season debut when Oklahoma City visits the Sacramento Kings on Monday night. Hartenstein missed the Thunder's first 15 games due to a broken left hand. But he excelled Wednesday against the Portland Trail Blazers when he had 13 points, 14 rebounds and four blocked shots in 29 minutes off the bench during his team's 109-99 victory. ""He's still a little bit rusty out there,"" Oklahoma City star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said of Hartenstein. ""But he changed the game for sure. He's an anchor. He sees everything, lets you know early and loud. And it's great to have that behind you. It allows you to adhere to the ball, be aggressive, and be decisive defensively. Yeah, he was special."" Hartenstein was scooped up as a free agent in the offseason with a stunning three-year, $87 million contract offer. The big money came after he started a career-best 49 games with the New York Knicks last season. He averaged 7.8 points and a career-best 8.3 rebounds. He was signed to be a supporting frontcourt player, but his role will grow with Holmgren out approximately two more months after being injured against the Golden State Warriors on Nov. 10. Jalen Williams, who has been playing in the interior with Holmgren and Hartenstein out, also had a strong first impression of his new teammate. He said Hartenstein was putting in the work while waiting for the hand to heal. ""I think just coming in there day in and day out, knowing you have to condition and work on your game without your dominant hand, is tough,"" Williams said. ""He made the most of it, and now he's coming back. ""I didn't really see the ramp-up, obviously. We've been on the road or gone when he got the cast off. I assume he was working just as hard when he got the cast off."" Monday's game will be the first of a stretch in which the Thunder play 10 of 12 games on the road. Sacramento, meanwhile, has dropped a season-worst three straight games after falling 108-103 to the visiting Brooklyn Nets on Sunday night. The Kings allowed 19 3-pointers -- 13 in the first half -- and committed 16 turnovers leading to 24 Brooklyn points. ""To give up 13 made 3s the way we did in the first half is tough to live with,"" Sacramento coach Mike Brown said. ""On top of that, we turned the ball over. We had 16 turnovers for 24 points. Somehow, someway, we have to do a better job of taking care of the basketball."" De'Aaron Fox scored 31 points on 10-of-16 shooting from the field and has topped 30 points in three of the past five games. He is averaging 39.4 points during the stretch, including a franchise-record 60 against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Nov. 15. But during the fourth quarter against the Nets, Fox took just three shots (missing each) and scored only one point. Sacramento was outscored 20-15 in the period and was 6 of 23 from the field and missed all seven 3-point attempts. DeMar DeRozan (18 points) was 3 of 8 in the quarter, and Domantas Sabonis (13 points, 18 rebounds) was 1 of 6. ""These guys have a lot of freedom out there to do what they want out there ...,"" Brown said of DeRozan and Sabonis. ""I would not say those guys were in his way. But we would rather see Foxy stay aggressive, too."" The teams split four matchups last season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

To advance in the winner's bracket, the Eagles (4-1) cruised to an 82-52 win Sunday over Old Dominion.  Missouri State (4-1) topped previously undefeated High point 71-61. Donald Hand Jr. posted a 12-point, 10-rebound double-double and Fred Payne added 11 points in 14 minutes off the bench to lead Boston College in its opener in the Cayman Islands, while the eight other scorers for fourth-year coach Earl Grant's team scored between six and nine points. ""I thought the players really won the day,"" Grant told WEEI. ""I felt good before we came to the Cayman Islands because of the way we practiced. ... I think today was just a carry-over of the fruits of our labor."" A complete effort from the Eagles featured a season-high 18 assists and saw freshman Luka Toews nail two 3-pointers. ""You want (the young players coming off the bench) to grow up,"" Grant said. ""Specifically in a tournament like this, with three games in three days, you need to use the bench. ... Hopefully (our starters) understand that and have a lot of energy for (the next game)."" Boston College has never faced Missouri State, just as it hadn't met Old Dominion. Led by a career-high 27 points and 10 rebounds from Vincent Brady II, Missouri State used a 40-26 advantage on the glass -- including 16 offensive boards -- and 17-of-21 free-throw shooting to hold off High Point. Coach Cuonzo Martin's Bears, who were picked 11th out of 12 teams in the Missouri Valley Conference's preseason poll, have won four straight since a 72-65, season-opening loss at Butler of the Big East.  ""This was a great win against a very talented, well-coached team,"" Martin said. ""We knew we had to get great guard play and fight hard to the final buzzer, and it was a great game between two very talented teams."" Dez White, who spent his freshman season at Austin Peay, remains the team's top scorer with an average of 16.4 points per game after a 13-point Sunday. Brady, a transfer from IU Indianapolis, was last week's Valley Newcomer of the Week. He contributes 15.4 points and 5.6 rebounds a contest while shooting 42.1 percent from 3-point range. In the Cayman final on Tuesday, the winner of the Boston College-Missouri State game will meet the winner of the earlier game Monday between South Dakota State and Boise State. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Each team will enter Monday's matchup with a five-game winning streak. The team that wins Monday's game will own the NBA's longest winning streak.   Both teams will be playing their second game in as many days.   Boston extended its streak with a 107-105 victory over Minnesota on Sunday. Jaylen Brown tossed in 29 points for the Celtics, who improved their home record to 6-2. ""I haven't shot the ball to start off the season as well as I would have liked,"" Brown said. ""I feel like I'm due for a lot of makes. I feel like my shots were good. I feel like I'm a great shooter, but also feel like I'm great at other things as well -- getting to the basket, getting to the paint, drawing opportunities for my guys. So it's just a balance. It's a long season and I'm just focused on trying to rack up wins.""   Brown was 10 of 18 from the floor and 7 of 10 from 3-point range. He scored Boston's first 15 points on five 3-pointers.  Boston coach Joe Mazzulla also praised Brown for his defensive effort, particularly his defense on Minnesota's Anthony Edwards on the game's final possession.   ""Yeah, it's great to have a player of his caliber take defense to another level and take matchups,"" Mazzulla said. ""When your best players are some of your best defenders, it can kind of set the tone for your team in the locker room defensively. So, he takes pride in individual matchups, and he did a great job defensively.""   The Clippers received 23 points and eight assists from James Harden in beating Philadelphia 125-99 Sunday night. The Clippers raised their road record to 4-3.    Ivica Zubac added 16 points and 12 rebounds for the Clippers.   ""We run plays for him just to try and get him touches and establish Zu on the low block,"" Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said of Zubac. ""When he's the anchor of your defense you gotta keep him happy. Having him block shots, having him blitzing pick and rolls, having him be the anchor and talking on the back side, you have to reward him with some touches, and so we've been able to do that.""   Los Angeles has held each of its past four opponents -- Golden State, Orlando, Sacramento and Philadelphia -- under 100 points. The Clippers are 6-0 on the season when the other team scores fewer than 100.   ""You know right now we're just working hard, playing together, trying to do the right things on the floor and right now it's paying off,"" Kris Dunn said.   Norman Powell missed his third consecutive games Sunday while dealing with a sore hamstring. Powell leads the Clippers in scoring (23.3 points per game). Boston center Luke Kornet didn't play Sunday because of a hamstring injury. Al Horford did play against Minnesota, but he likely will sit out Monday's game since he typically doesn't play in both games when the Celtics play on consecutive days. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

On Jan. 26 of last season, superstar Luka Doncic scored 73 points in the Mavericks' 148-143 win. Doncic, who was traded for Atlanta point guard Trae Young on draft night in 2018, will miss Monday's game with a wrist injury sustained in last Tuesday's win over the New Orleans Pelicans. Fortunately for Dallas, the injury shouldn't sideline Doncic for extended time. Monday's contest will serve as the Mavericks' final game of a three-city road trip. Dallas saw its four-game winning streak end with a 123-118 overtime loss to the Miami Heat on Sunday. Dallas was nursing a two-point lead before Jimmy Butler's dunk with 4.1 seconds remaining in regulation. The Heat held the Mavericks without a point for the final 3:21 of overtime. For Dallas coach Jason Kidd, understanding how to play without Doncic could benefit the team in the long run. ""You never know who's gonna have foul trouble or an injury,"" Kidd said. ""The bench has been in the positive since Luka's been out, but unfortunately that wasn't the case tonight. You just never know who's going to be able to play, and this is a great lesson learned for all of us."" Doncic's average of 28.1 points per game ranks eighth in the NBA. Kyrie Irving, who led the way on Sunday with 27 points, is second on the team with 24.1 points per contest. The Hawks haven't played since Friday, when they lost 136-122 to the Chicago Bulls. Young and Jalen Johnson each scored 25 points for Atlanta, which allowed the Bulls to shoot 57 percent from the field and 44.2 percent on 3-pointers. In an all-around effort, Chicago also made 19 of 21 free throws in the offensive barrage. Atlanta's 120.5 points per game allowed are third most in the league, an area of concern for the club. ""When you play a team that puts up 50-40-90, those are Hall of Fame numbers,"" Hawks coach Quin Snyder said. ""That's not to say you can't do more. We could have contested better, we could have kept them out of the paint more. I thought that was a big part of the game, as well as our inability to score at times."" Following a 2-0 start to the season, the Hawks haven't been able to reach the .500 mark since Oct. 28. Atlanta is vying to avoid dropping three in a row for the first time since that stretch. Young paces the Hawks with 22.1 ppg and an NBA-best 11.7 assists per game. Johnson follows with 19.4 points per contest and a team-high 10.4 rebounds. Dyson Daniels, one of the lone bright spots for a struggling defense, leads the league with 3.2 steals per game. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Pacers will try to extend New Orleans' skid to five games Monday night when they face the Pelicans in Indianapolis. Indiana, which had lost straight three games on a winless road trip to Toronto, Houston and Milwaukee, shut down the Wizards' offense after allowing 130, 130 and 129 points during the losing streak. The Pacers allowed just 16 fourth-quarter points to the NBA-worst Wizards. ""We got better defensively,"" Indiana coach Rick Carlisle said. ""We were better at keeping their drivers square in front of us, and we made some good things happen offensively."" Pascal Siakam scored 22 points and Tyrese Haliburton had 21 to lead seven double-figure scorers for Indiana. The Pacers improved to 5-2 at home even though they played without three key injured players - Andrew Nembhard, Aaron Nesmith and Ben Sheppard. ""Right now, we're looking for anybody with energy that will run and will give the best possible effort defensively,"" Carlisle said. The Pelicans are hopeful of ending their losing streak because they slowly are getting injured players back on the floor. Leading scorer Brandon Ingram (ankle) returned from a one-game absence and Jordan Hawkins (back) came back from a seven-game absence in a 112-108 home loss to the Golden State Warriors on Friday.  ""I had a minute restriction on me, but I felt like I got up and down a lot,"" said Hawkins, who scored six points in 20 minutes. ""Still trying to get my conditioning right but it felt good.""  Ingram, who also leads New Orleans in assists for the season, finished with 18 points and seven assists in 36 minutes. ""He's battling through some bumps and bruises right now,"" Pelicans coach Willie Green said. ""We're putting a lot on his shoulders. He's been doing a really good job of coming in every day and getting his work, getting his treatment, and keeping himself available to get on the floor and help his team.""  Trey Murphy III has sat out the back end of two recent back-to-back sets as he manages a hamstring injury that sidelined him for the first 10 games of the season. He has started all five games in which he has played, and his point total has gone up in each game, topping out at 24 against the Warriors. Green praised his team for having ""game-plan discipline and execution"" at ""a high level,"" against Golden State, but added that, ""Unfortunately, in the NBA, there are just no moral victories."" Pelicans guard CJ McCollum said he hopes to return from a 13-game absence due to a strained adductor to play Monday. Dejounte Murray, Zion Williamson, Herbert Jones and Jose Alvarado remain sidelined indefinitely. The Pelicans have won just one of the 11 games they have played since defeating the visiting Pacers 125-118 on Nov. 1. Williamson had 34 points and 10 assists in that game, and Ingram added 26 and seven, respectively. Sheppard scored 20 points, Bennedict Mathurin 19 and Siakam 16 to lead seven Pacers in double figures. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

His absence on Saturday served to reinforce that. With Cunningham sidelined by a hip injury, they lost at Orlando 111-100.  Detroit is unlikely to have its franchise player again when it hosts Toronto on Monday night. Cunningham was listed as doubtful by the team on Sunday. Cunningham suffered the hip injury on Thursday when he took a hard fall late in the fourth quarter of an overtime loss to Charlotte. ""Obviously those injuries are tough when you take a blow to the tailbone-ish area,"" coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""That's the core of where your movement starts."" The Pistons' offense predictably suffered without their floor leader, who is averaging 23.5 points and 8.9 assists a game. They committed 17 turnovers against the Magic -- which Orlando converted into 29 points -- and racked up only 16 assists. ""It's hard to overcome that, and a lot of them were preventable and then too many of them came in bunches,"" Bickerstaff said. ""Between the turnovers and offensive rebounds we gave up, it's difficult to overcome. That's where we keep talking about winning the possession battle."" The Pistons, who have lost three straight games, allowed 17 offensive rebounds. They didn't have a 20-point scorer to pick up the slack for Cunningham. ""Let them get too many easy baskets, let them get on the glass and things of that nature, get second chance points,"" forward Tobias Harris said. ""Didn't take care of the basketball well too, offensively. Just a little bit too lax with our execution as well. When we do play and Cade's not out there, it's a chance for us to come out and really just exploit other teams, like the Magic, some of their defensive schemes. ""We didn't get enough ball movement in that second half to do that, and that hurt us -- turnovers and lack of ball movement. We didn't make many shots as well."" The Raptors, meanwhile, will play the second game of a back-to-back set on Monday. Toronto lost to league leader Cleveland on Sunday, 122-108. A poor first quarter doomed the Raptors. They were down 38-22 after the first 12 minutes. Toronto had defeated Indiana and Minnesota -- teams that reached the conference finals last season -- in its previous two games. RJ Barrett scored a combined 70 points in those victories but was held to 16 points on 6-of-18 shooting by the Cavs. ""To be honest with you, I wish we could play this team every week because we could learn a lot,"" Raptors coach Darko Rajakovic said. The loss dropped the Raptors to 0-9 on the road. They'll need a win on Monday to avoid matching the worst road start in franchise history, set in 1997-98. They are in the midst of a four-game road swing. Bruce Brown is expected to make his season debut during the trip. Brown has been rehabbing a knee injury that hampered him last season. ""I was on one leg,"" he said. ""You could watch, first half I was pretty much fine, once the second half started and it got really stiff."" Detroit recorded a 99-95 victory over Toronto on Nov. 15 behind Malik Beasley's 20 points. That game was part of the NBA Cup.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Stafford operated under constant pressure and was sacked five times. Chiefs 30, Panthers 27 Patrick Mahomes threw three touchdown passes and Spencer Shrader kicked a 31-yard field goal on the game's final play as Kansas City topped Carolina in Charlotte. It was a bounce-back effort for the Chiefs (10-1), who lost for the first time this season a week earlier against the Buffalo Bills.

Bryce Young threw for 263 yards and a touchdown for the Panthers (3-8), who had a two-game winning streak snapped. Eddy Pineiro kicked field goals from 30, 32, 29 and 33 yards out.

Stafford operated under continuous pressure and was sacked five times. Philadelphia owned a six-point lead when the third quarter started, but Barkley expanded the advantage on the first play of the frame, ripping off a 70-yard scoring jaunt for a 20-7 cushion. Stafford responded with a 2-yard touchdown toss to Demarcus Robinson to slice the Eagles' lead back to six. But the game's remainder belonged to the Eagles. Kenneth Gainwell made it 27-14 at the 6:17 mark of the third quarter with a 13-yard scoring run, and Jake Elliott connected on a 26-yard field goal with 10:30 left in the game. Barkley capped the victory in style by busting a 72-yard touchdown run off the left side with 2:44 left, blazing through a hole between the guard and tackle and going untouched to the end zone. Stafford added a meaningless score with 1:07 on the clock, connecting with Cooper Kupp for a 27-yard TD.  Elliott gave Philadelphia a 3-0 lead with a 21-yard field goal at the 5:13 mark of the first quarter, capping a drive that lasted nearly 7 1/2 minutes. However, the Rams took their only lead of the game via a 1-yard touchdown run by Kyren Williams with 1:02 remaining in the first. Elliott made a 31-yard field goal with 6:17 left in the second quarter, followed by Hurts' 6-yard scoring strike to A.J. Brown 1:27 before halftime.

But Tyler Nickel, who scored 24 points in Vanderbilt's win over Seton Hall on Friday, went scoreless on Sunday, missing all three of his shots. In the first half, Drake had gone 0-for-4 on 3-pointers until Mascari drained two of them in the final three minutes.

Over the past decade, teams that are in playoff position on the U.S. holiday have a better than 75 percent chance of making the postseason. That statistic makes the home-and-home series between the Seattle Kraken and Anaheim Ducks -- Monday night in Anaheim and Wednesday in Seattle -- of greater importance. The Kraken (10-10-1) and Ducks (8-8-3) sit fourth and fifth, respectively, in the Western Conference wild-card chase. The Kraken are three points behind wild-card leaders Colorado and Edmonton and the Ducks are five back. This could be a big week for the Kraken, who also have a home-and-home set against the San Jose Sharks, who are last in the Pacific Division. ""Teams are so close in the division; we're going to need to beat these guys to get in at the end,"" Kraken defenseman Brandon Montour said. ""It seems like it's going to be tight. The first 20 (games) were tight. ... These games we have got to be up for. Anaheim is up next. We got to come with that desperation and get those points."" Despite a 2-1 road loss Saturday afternoon against the Los Angeles Kings, the Kraken have won five of their past seven games. But their play on the road hasn't been strong, as they've lost five in a row away from Climate Pledge Arena and been outscored 17-5 in those contests. Montour scored Seattle's lone goal against the Kings with 1:34 remaining and Kraken goalie Joey Daccord pulled for an extra attacker. ""All around, every guy in our room knows he has to be better and can play better, myself included,"" Kraken forward Matty Beniers said. ""We just didn't play our game, didn't get to our game fast enough."" The Kraken will be without forward Jordan Eberle, their captain, for the next three months after he underwent surgery on his pelvis Friday. The Ducks lost 3-2 in overtime Friday at home to the Buffalo Sabres, ending Anaheim's three-game winning streak. ""The first period we were a little bit slow,"" Ducks coach Greg Cronin said. ""We didn't have the same snap we had the last few games and I thought the second and third period we played the way we wanted to play."" Drew Helleson and Isac Lundestrom scored to give Anaheim a 2-0 lead before the Sabres rallied. Despite making 30 saves, goalie John Gibson suffered his first loss in four starts this season. The Ducks' Frank Vatrano couldn't convert two scoring chances late in the second period that would have extended the lead. Vatrano has just two goals in 18 games after tallying a career-high 37 times last season. ""Last year was a breakthrough year, so the expectation that he's going to be a 30-plus goal scorer has been set,"" Cronin said. ""I'm not worried about him scoring goals. ... I do believe that his shooting percentage will go up. It's really low right now, but the worst thing he could do is stop shooting the puck."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Porter and Metheny, who both stand less than 6 feet tall, had 17 points in the second half against a much taller Wildcats team. Porter's 17 points led Liberty (6-1). Isaiah Ihnen added 16 and Metheny had 13. Kansas State (4-2) was led by Brendan Hausen with 14 points. Coleman Hawkins added 11, and David N'Guessan and Achor Achor chipped in 10 apiece. The Flames built their biggest lead at 41-33 at the 16:06 mark of the second half. They led 50-44 before Hausen hit back-to-back 3-pointers from almost the same spot to tie the game. Liberty kept grabbing the lead and K-State answered. When Achor hit a baseline turn-around jumper, K-State led 63-62, their first lead since 29-27. But Porter's contested 3-pointer allowed Liberty to regain the lead on the next possession. With the Wildcats trailing 65-63 in the final minute, Hausen missed a 3-pointer and Owen Aquino was fouled on the rebound. He hit both free throws, giving the Flames a 67-63 lead. Hawkins hit a driving layup to trim the deficit to two points. After an empty trip for Liberty, the Wildcats had three chances to tie or take the lead on their final possession. Dug McDaniel's 3-pointer caromed off the rim into the hands of N'Guessan, whose putback missed. McDaniel's 3-pointer at the buzzer was off target.

The Kings are in third place in the Pacific Division, with the second-best goal differential (plus-six) among their regional rivals, while sitting 5-5-2 in road contests. They now head to the Bay Area to face the Sharks, who are bringing up the rear in the division. Los Angeles' attention to detail while on the road had paid dividends during a strong start to the season, but two defeats on a recent trip to Calgary and Colorado proved that more work is left to be done. The Kings were outscored by a combined 7-3 in those games. A return home got them back on track. They got the best of the Seattle Kraken 2-1 on Saturday when Adrian Kempe and Quinton Byfield scored second-period goals for a 2-0 lead that withstood a Kraken onslaught in the third period. David Rittich had 19 saves. The Kings are finding success without defenseman Drew Doughty (ankle) and forward Arthur Kaliyev (collarbone), while goaltender Darcy Kuemper also is on injured reserve. Byfield's goal on the power play was his third of the season and came in his 200th career game. ""A lot of challenging moments in those 200 games, but to come across it still 22, so still young and hopefully a lot more (to come),"" Byfield said. Already with his 11th start this season, and third consecutive, Rittich has allowed just one goal in each of his past three starts, as well as four of his last five going back to Nov. 5. He made 22 starts all of last season, his first in Los Angeles. ""We've got a pretty deep team and that's all that matters if somebody gets hurt,"" Rittich said. ""Obviously, Drew is a huge, huge part of this team and it's an opportunity for other guys to step up."" The Sharks are on a three-game losing streak after a 4-2 defeat to the Buffalo Sabres at home on Saturday. San Jose has won just once in its last seven games (1-3-3). The Sharks had two separate leads Saturday, the first on a goal from Fabian Zetterlund in the first period and again for a 2-1 advantage when Luke Kunin scored in the second period. It got away when Buffalo scored three times in the third, including the go-ahead goal that came short-handed. ""We had 10 scoring chances on the power play but obviously the short-handed goal really hurts and stings. It's a kick in the gut, really,"" Sharks head coach Ryan Warsofsky said. ""I think (the power play) is starting to come. We've gotten some better looks at it and they're starting to see a little more chemistry."" As it stands, San Jose is 26th on the power play (16.4 percent), but it's still better than the Kings (15.6, tied for 28th). The teams have split two meetings this season, with the Sharks earning a 4-2 victory over the Kings at home on Oct. 29. Former Los Angeles forward Tyler Toffoli scored for San Jose in that game and has 16 points on the season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Those good feelings evaporated in a loss against the h,"The Knicks left for their five-game road trip on a winning streak and brimming with confidence. Those good feelings evaporated in a loss against the host Utah Jazz on Saturday night, and now New York moves on to Denver to face the Nuggets on Monday. New York's four-game winning streak stopped an up-and-down start to the season, but poor shooting and leaky defense led to the loss against the lowly Jazz. The Knicks nearly overcame a 19-point deficit before Utah pulled away for a 121-106 win. ""We've been struggling on the defensive side for the whole season. When you're not making shots and you're not playing well defensively, that's a recipe for disaster,"" Knicks guard/forward Josh Hart said. ""We've got to figure it out on the defensive end."" New York will have to figure it out quickly against a Denver team that is scoring at a high rate. The Nuggets are tied for fifth in the NBA in scoring average at 117.5 points per game despite not having Aaron Gordon for three weeks and having Nikola Jokic miss three games for the birth of his second child. The burden of trying to stop Jokic, the three-time and reigning MVP, will fall on Karl-Anthony Towns, who is familiar with Denver from his nine seasons with the Minnesota Timberwolves. If the Knicks can't stop the Nuggets defensively, they will need to compensate with better offense, which didn't happen against Utah. ""There's going to be nights that you don't shoot it great,"" New York coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""What you can't do, you can't allow missed shots to take away from the energy that you need from your defense. You have to win games different ways."" Denver is coming off a back-to-back set that started with disappointment and ended with a dominant 127-102 win against the Lakers on Saturday night. The Nuggets blew a late lead at home against the Dallas Mavericks on Friday night but bounced back to win at Los Angeles. That victory was No. 433 for Nuggets coach Michael Malone, passing Doug Moe for the most in franchise history. It was a welcome sight after Denver's NBA Cup loss to the Mavericks, where it was outscored 15-7 in the final three minutes of the 123-120 Dallas win. The Nuggets miss Gordon, but Peyton Watson has filled in nicely in his absence. Watson is averaging 10.0 points per game and has been a strong defensive presence in the starting lineup. He had three blocks in Friday night's loss and is averaging a team-best 1.1 blocks per game. He's also seen the benefit of sharing the court more with Jokic, who leads the NBA in rebounds per game (13.9) and is second in assists per contest (11.3). ""I'm just more comfortable, more game experience. Simple as that. Being able to play with one of the best players to ever pick up a basketball, he demands a lot of attention and I get some looks at the rim in the halfcourt,"" Watson said. ""In transition it's all about being confident, attacking the rim with conviction and just trying to get two points down every time."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Donald Hand Jr. posted his third double-double of the season with 12 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Eagles (4-1) to their third straight victory. Fred Payne added 11 points, while the eight other Boston College scorers recorded between six and nine points. Hand, Chas Kelley III, Luka Toews and Joshua Beadle each knocked down a pair of 3-pointers. Roger McFarlane paced the Eagles with 11 points and five assists along with his six points. Boston College advanced to play Missouri State in the semifinals on Monday evening. Old Dominion (2-4) was led by Robert Davis Jr., who scored 19 points with three of his six field goals coming from distance. The Eagles shot 43.3 percent from the field, hit 10 3-pointers and outrebounded the opposition 46-34. After trailing 4-0 and 9-7 early, Boston College went on a 9-0 run that Payne concluded with a driving layup and a 3-pointer off the bench. Chad Venning's layup with 8:50 left before halftime increased the Eagle advantage to 11, and it continued to grow during a 7-0 spurt during which Dion Brown scored five straight points, including a lay-in for a 3-point play. Toews banged down his first career three at the 3:42 mark and Payne capped the period with a last-minute jumper as Boston College went on to lead 43-24 at halftime. Old Dominion responded to Venning's layup out of halftime with seven points, including a Davis catch-and-shoot triple. An Elijah Strong three with 16:32 left stopped the run, but the Monarchs hung within 15 under near the halfway mark as Davis continued his high-scoring night. A 16-2 run across just 3:57 helped the Eagles break the game wide open. The stretch included a triple from Hand before he set up Jayden Hastings for an alley-oop dunk, while Brown finished his second three-point play with 10:38 left. McFarlane's turnaround shot with 6:02 to go made it a 30-point Boston College lead. Beadle and Toews knocked down treys in the final 4:05. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Musketeers (5-0) are coming off an 80-55 victory on Wednesday over Siena, while the Gamecocks (3-2) beat Mercer on Thursday 84-72. Against Mercer, South Carolina sank a season-best 12 3-pointers -- tied for the fourth-most in a single game under third-year coach Lamont Paris. Jamarii Thomas, a senior transfer from Norfolk State, had 19 points and swished 4 of 5 shots from behind the arc. ""Thomas got some good, clean looks,"" Paris said. ""It was good to see those guys make their shots. Hopefully it gets those guys going in the right direction."" On the season, the Gamecocks are making 7.8 3-pointers per game and shooting 32.5 percent from deep. Senior guard Jacobi Wright makes a team-best 1.8 3-pointers per game and shoots 37.5 percent from behind the arc. At 13.0 ppg, he is second on the team behind Collin Murray-Boyles (15.8). Xavier is allowing eight makes from deep per game and is letting opponents shoot 38.5 percent from behind the arc, which ranks 337th in the country. And despite an undefeated record so far for the Musketeers, third-year coach Sean Miller is worried about his players developing bad habits. ""We have a virus that everybody is looking at the stat sheet, trying to get as many points as they possibly can,"" Miller said after the win over Siena. ""They want to win, but they really want to win and score. We need a couple of guys that are willing to rebound, defend, make the extra pass, play at a high level defensively and understand what makes a team great."" Marcus Foster did a decent job of doing a little bit of everything for Xavier against Siena, piling up 12 points, five rebounds, five assists and a steal. It was the first double-digit scoring outing for Foster -- a grad transfer from Furman -- in a Xavier uniform. Since 2008, Xavier is 25-11 against teams from the Southeastern Conference, but it hasn't played South Carolina in that stretch. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Take Monday night's contest between the Minnesota Wild and Winnipeg Jets in Saint Paul, Minn. The game between the top two teams in the Western Conference provides an early measuring stick for players as well as fans. ""It's a chance to showcase yourself against the best,"" Wild forward Marcus Foligno said. Winnipeg enters the game with an NHL-best 34 points. The Jets have won 17 of their first 21 games, and they have outscored opponents 85-51 this season. After winning back-to-back games against the Florida Panthers and Pittsburgh Penguins, the Jets lost 4-1 on the road against the Nashville Predators in their most recent contest. They will try to avoid suffering back-to-back losses for only the second time this season. The task for the Jets will be more difficult because of the injury absence of defenseman Dylan Samberg, who broke his foot in the loss against Nashville. Samberg was placed on injured reserve and is out indefinitely. The 25-year-old is averaging more than 20 minutes of ice time per game this season. He has six points (three goals, three assists) and a plus-12 rating in 21 games. ""He does so much for us,"" teammate Dylan DeMelo told the Winnipeg Free Press. ""Not just shot blocking, but having a good stick and breaking up a lot of plays."" Jets captain Adam Lowry agreed. ""It would be a big loss if he's out for any length of time,"" he said. Minnesota also is dealing with injuries to key players. The Wild will be without forward Mats Zuccarello, who is sidelined with a lower-body injury after being hit by an opponent's shot. The same could be true for top scorer Kirill Kaprizov, who sustained a lower-body injury after absorbing a knee-on-knee hit against Edmonton Oilers forward Drake Caggiula on Thursday. Kaprizov reportedly avoided a significant injury, but he missed Minnesota's game Saturday against the Calgary Flames and his status for Monday is unclear. He leads the team and ranks second in the NHL with 34 points (13 goals, 21 assists) in 19 games this season. Jets goaltender Connor Hellebuyck is expected to get the start in net. He is 14-2-0 with a 2.13 goals-against average and a .924 save percentage. In 28 career games (27 starts) against Minnesota, Hellebuyck is 13-10-2 with a 2.64 GAA and a .916 save percentage. The Wild are expected to counter with Filip Gustavsson in net. He is 9-3-3 with a 2.13 GAA and a .924 save percentage. Gustavsson has faced Winnipeg six times in his career. He is 4-1-1 in those matchups with a 1.76 GAA and a .943 save percentage. Wild coach John Hynes praised his team heading into Monday's matchup. ""I just like our demeanor,"" Hynes said, per the Star Tribune. ""Our focus is there. It's what's next, what we can control, keeping our energy and mindset in the right place. That's what ultimately gives you the opportunity to be successful."" Minnesota is 4-2-1 at home this season. Winnipeg is 8-3-0 on the road. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Mavericks star Kyrie Irving had 27 points and six assists, while P.J. Washington added 21 points and 10 rebounds. Naji Marshall had 19 of his 20 points after the first half and Dereck Lively II had 14 points, 13 rebounds, four assists and two blocks. Klay Thompson, who went 0-for-8 from the floor in Dallas' 123-120 win at Denver on Friday, bounced back with 15 points on 5-for-12 shooting. The Mavericks played without reigning NBA scoring champ Luka Doncic (wrist). Miami, which had been off since Monday, had double-doubles from Bam Adebayo (19 points, 11 rebounds) and Tyler Herro (18 points, 10 boards). The Heat went ahead for good on Adebayo's 3-pointer that made it 120-118 with 2:54 left in overtime. Dallas missed its final seven shots after Lively's dunk put the Mavericks up 118-117 with 3:21 remaining. Adebayo finished 3-of-6 from 3-point range for Miami, which shot 34.1 percent (14-of-41) from distance. Dallas hit 10 of 40 threes (25 percent) and shot 41.9 percent overall. The Mavericks took their first lead since the opening quarter on Irving's 3-pointer that made it 106-103 with 4:34 left in regulation. Dallas clung to a one-point edge as Irving stepped to the free throw line with 8.2 seconds left, but he made just 1 of 2 to leave the door open for the Heat. Butler capitalized with a dunk off a Duncan Robinson feed with 4.3 seconds remaining, and the game went to overtime after Spencer Dinwiddie's long 3-point attempt at the buzzer went in and out. Dinwiddie finished with 7 points after shooting 1-for-12 overall, including 0-for-9 on 3-pointers. There were three lead changes in the first quarter that ended with Miami on top 33-28. The Mavericks missed their last six shots in the quarter, allowing the Heat to close the period on a 9-0 run. Miami shot just 28.6 percent in the second quarter - including 1-of-10 on 3-pointers -- but still entered halftime leading 56-51. Just like the second quarter (23-23), the third period was played to a draw (33-33), leaving the Heat with an 89-84 lead heading into the fourth. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Agbo knocked down a pair of 3-pointers, part of a 4-of-9 shooting night from beyond the arc for him, during the surge. Grambling (1-4) responded with an 13-3 run that brought the Trojans lead back to a one-possession margin. A P.J. Eason dunk with 4:36 remaining in regulation brought the Tigers within 68-66. Desmond Claude responded with a layup on the other end, and Agbo forced a turnover on the ensuing Grambling possession to set up his own score at the rim. The four quick Trojans points gave USC a cushion it maintained down the stretch. Claude finished with 14 points, five rebounds and five assists. His swipe from Mikale Stevenson in the final minute and transition lay-in put the game away for USC, which closed its season-opening, six-game homestand with a pair of wins after last Sunday's loss to Cal. Grambling led for more than 13 minutes of game time and took a 38-37 lead into halftime, but the Tigers' advantage never grew beyond five points. Grambling matched USC in both overall field goals made, with each knocking down 25, and 3-pointers, with seven apiece.

The Chippewas are coming off back-to-back wins against George Mason and Division II Central State. ""(On Wednesday), it was our defense,"" Central Michigan coach Tony Barbee said after his team's 86-52 win over Central State. ""Our defense was terrific today, holding them to 26 percent from the floor, 20 percent from 3-point range. ... ""We want to play off of our defense and get guys out in transition and share the ball. ... Now, we're being better stewards with the basketball and not being as reckless as we were earlier in the year."" Anthony Pritchard leads Central Michigan with 13.8 points per game to go along with a team-high five assists and 3.4 steals. Jakobi Heady is next on the scoring list with 13 points and a team-high 7.2 rebounds, and Kyler Vanderjagt is averaging 11.4 points while shooting 47.4 percent from beyond the arc. Minnesota leads the all-time series 5-0 against Central Michigan. The schools most recently faced one another Nov. 17, 2022, when the Golden Gophers held on for a 68-60 victory. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",Injuries aren't slowing Grizzlies ahead of visit from Trail Blazers,https://deadspin.com/injuries-arent-slowing-grizzlies-ahead-of-visit-from-trail-blazers/,2024-11-25T01:27:21.784Z,"The Memphis Grizzlies return home Monday night to play the Portland Trail Blazers with a momentum boost powered by exemplary teamwork.,The Grizzlies a","The Memphis Grizzlies return home Monday night to play the Portland Trail Blazers with a momentum boost powered by exemplary teamwork. The Grizzlies are among the league leaders in assists per game (29.8) and their 38 in Saturday's lopsided win at Chicago tied a season-high. Memphis ranked third behind Denver (30.3) and Golden State (30.2) in the category entering Sunday's games. Scotty Pippen Jr., the Grizzlies' starting point guard until star Ja Morant returns from a hip injury, had 10 assists in the 142-131 victory over the Bulls to go along with a career-high 30 points. Pippen Jr. produced the double-double in the arena his father, Scottie, rose to stardom during the 1990s with the Michael Jordan-led Bulls. Pippen Jr. called his outing ""a dream come true"" in an arena where his father's jersey number hangs in the rafters. He made 13 of his 16 shots. Memphis also has benefited from rookie forward Jaylen Wells' strong early season play. He scored a career-high of his own, finishing with 26 points on 10-of-14 shooting. Pippen's steady play has allowed the Grizzlies to stay above .500 during the absence not only of Morant, but Marcus Smart and rookie big man Zach Edey. Morant, Smart and Edey have been out for various injuries and ailments. Morant injured his right hip in a Nov. 6 game against the Lakers and appears closer to returning. He was listed as doubtful before Saturday's game in Chicago and questionable for Monday's contest. Smart, battling an illness, missed his fourth straight game. Edey remains sidelined by an ankle injury he suffered in last weekend's game against Denver. Despite the injuries that have kept starters Morant, Smart and Edey inactive -- and, briefly, Desmond Bane with a strained oblique -- the Grizzlies have been productive offensively and defensively. They are averaging 120.3 points per game, second in the NBA entering Sunday, and their 7.2 blocks per game lead the league. The Grizzlies surpassed 140 points for only the sixth time in franchise history on Saturday. Memphis shot 57.3 percent (55-of-96) in the win over Chicago, including 45.2 percent (19-of-42) from 3-point range. The team made 19 3-pointers for the second straight game. ""We had a great run by scoring some 40-plus points (45) in the third (quarter),"" Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. ""Our game plan was pretty well executed."" Portland will bring momentum, too. The Trail Blazers defeated Houston 104-98 on Saturday, rebounding from a 28-point loss to the Rockets on Friday in an NBA Cup game. Portland was led on Saturday by Anfernee Simons (25 points) and Shaedon Sharpe (24 points) in a game in which the Trail Blazers made 18 3-pointers. In addition to Simons and Sharpe, the Trail Blazers got a solid defensive performance from Deni Avdija, who had four blocks. Avdija spent most of the game making things difficult for Houston's Alperen Sengun in the paint. ""It's amazing to see Anfernee make some shots and carry us down the stretch,"" Portland coach Chauncey Billups said. ""And Deni was incredible. We depended on him a lot. He's been begging for that opportunity for quite some time."" Avdija said Simons played a key role in the win. ""I'm proud of him,"" Avdija said. ""He showed what he's made of and, hopefully, he'll continue to be aggressive."" Portland rookie center Donovan Clingan will not play on Monday due to a left knee sprain. He went scoreless on 0-for-4 shooting from the field on Saturday but grabbed a career-high 19 rebounds. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

McKeon is tied with American legend Katie Ledecky for the most Olympic medals (14) won by a female swimmer. McKeon has won six golds, three silvers and five bronzes. ""Today I am officially retiring from competitive swimming,"" McKeon wrote on Instagram. ""Leading into Paris, I knew it would be my last Olympics, and the months since have given me time to reflect on my journey, and think about what I wanted my future to look like in swimming. ""I am proud of myself for giving my swimming career absolutely everything, both physically and mentally. I wanted to see what I was capable of -- and I did."" McKeon earned seven medals (four golds, three bronzes) at the 2021 Tokyo Games. That haul included winning the 50 and 100 freestyle events. At the Paris Games last summer, McKeon won one gold, one silver and one bronze, all in relay events.

Playing at Sea Island's Seaside Course, the 29-year-old sank a 5-foot, 5-inch birdie putt on the par-4 18th hole to finish at 16-under 266, just ahead of amateur Luke Clanton (66 on Sunday), Nico Echavarria of Colombia (65) and Daniel Berger (67). ""My mind's gone blank, honestly,"" McNealy said. ""It was an unbelievable adrenaline rush there, especially on 18. ... It was a moment I will never forget getting to celebrate with my friends, my family, my wife, my team."" Berger had a shot to force a playoff with McNealy, but he missed his birdie putt after his approach landed about 20 feet from the hole. Despite the loss, Berger finished inside the top 125 of the FedEx Cup Fall standings to secure his full tour status for 2025. Sunday was the final day of the fall series. McNealy, who opened the week with a red-hot round of 62, entered Sunday tied with Vince Whaley for the 54-hole lead. McNealy had two birdies at Nos. 5 and 8 but missed a par putt at the par-4 14th, the bogey dropping him out of the lead and briefly leaving Echavarria all alone at 16 under. Echavarria, however, flew his second shot at No. 18 over the green, chipped up to about 9 feet and could not save par, sliding to 15 under for the event after making six birdies. Clanton also started the final hole at 16 under and went on to finish with a bogey after finding a bunker. That opened the door for McNealy's big finish. Unlike his competitors, his approach at No. 18 was pure. ""I told (caddie and brother Scout McNealy) 195 6-iron,"" McNealy said of his final approach. ""A 6-iron is like a 200 club, so I didn't need to kill it, but I just needed good solid one. He told me compress it, just smash down, take a divot. Scout's coaching has been pretty simple lately, he says swing left and take a divot. So I just swung left, took a divot, all came out right online dead center of the clubface and it couldn't have been a better time for it."" Meanwhile, Clanton's T2 finish earned him another point in the PGA Tour University Accelerated program. With 17, the Florida State athlete needs three more points to secure a PGA Tour card. But Clanton said he was ""really not at all"" focused on qualifying through the accelerated program. ""I'm trying to win, that's it,"" Clanton said. ""I think it's a great system, of course, to have this opportunity to give us our card and it's amazing. Again, I think every time we step out here, the one goal we have is to win. I think PGA Tour U's been a great opportunity for all of us as college players who have these kind of talents and go pro sooner, so it's awesome."" J.T. Poston tied for the round of the day with a 7-under 63, forging a tie for fifth with Lee Hodges (67) and Canada's Mackenzie Hughes (68) at 14-under 268. Eric Cole also had a 63 and finished 11 under. Whaley finished T8 after shooting 71 on Sunday. Michael Thorbjornsen (69) and Patrick Fishburn (69) also tied for eighth at 13-under 269. One another player who will go home happy is Joel Dahmen. A fan favorite, Dahmen entered the week No. 124 in the fall standings, right on the cusp of losing his PGA Tour card. He fired a 6-under 64 on Sunday to finish T35 at 7 under and earn just enough points to retain his tour status for 2025. Dahmen's bogey-free round featured a hole-out eagle at the par-4 13th and four birdies. ""This is my eighth year out here, I probably made it longer than I ever thought I would,"" Dahmen said. ""You take it for granted a little bit. It's been relatively easy, cruise between 50 and 90 on the FedEx Cup every year and enjoy it, and our best friends are out here. Yeah, this is different. Makes you appreciate things a little more when times are tough. I thought a lot about everything. It came down to the last putt this week."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Islanders will aim to establish some momentum Monday night, when they host the Detroit Red Wings in a battle of Eastern Conference rivals in Elmont, N.Y. Both teams were off Sunday after playing at home Saturday night, when the Islanders beat the St. Louis Blues 3-1 and the Red Wings fell to the Boston Bruins 2-1. The win snapped a three-game losing streak (0-2-1) for the Islanders, who squandered a third-period lead in each defeat -- including Thursday night in Detroit, when the Red Wings scored twice in the final 4:46 to earn a 2-1 win. The final 20 minutes began in familiar fashion Saturday night for the Islanders, whose 2-0 lead was cut in half when Jake Neighbours scored a power-play goal for the Blues just 45 seconds after the opening faceoff. But goaltender Sorokin stopped the final eight shots he faced, including Neighbours' wrister with 1:39 left after the Blues pulled goalie Jordan Binnington. Nelson helped ice the win with 37 seconds left, when he fed Kyle Palmieri for the empty-netter. ""Obviously, the way the last couple games have gone, our goalies have given us a chance to win and we haven't found a way to get the insurance,"" said Palmieri, who also scored in the first period in his first multi-goal game of the season. ""So it felt good to do that tonight."" Nelson, 33, who scored the Islanders' second goal in the second period, finished with three points Saturday to increase his career total to 544 points and move into a tie for ninth place on the Islanders' all-time list with John Tonelli. The win was the 100th for Sorokin, 29, who is the sixth New York goalie to reach the century mark. The loss to Boston dropped the Red Wings to 2-5-1 since their most recent stretch of back-to-back wins over the Buffalo Sabres and Chicago Blackhawks from Nov. 2-6. Detroit has scored two goals or fewer in five of those games. Offense has been a season-long problem for the Red Wings, who have scored just 49 goals, the second-fewest in the NHL ahead of only the Anaheim Ducks (48). Detroit recorded 20 shots on Saturday and has 20 shots or fewer in three of its last four games and five times overall in 20 games. The Red Wings were outshot 16-15 in the first two periods Saturday and managed just five shots in the third period, when Bruins left winger Brad Marchand scored the tie-breaking goal with 8:30 left. Boston finished the period with 13 shots. ""I didn't like the way we managed the puck in the third period -- we just couldn't get out of our zone,"" Red Wings coach Derek Lalonde said. ""It didn't hurt us a ton until it did. We had a pretty good game going through the first two periods."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Raiders (2-9) have now lost seven games in a row, last winning on Sept. 29 against the Cleveland Browns. The Broncos (7-5) completed the season sweep of the Raiders with the win after entering the season with eight consecutive losses to the Silver and Black. They also beat Las Vegas 34-18 on Oct. 6 in Denver. Will Lutz didn't miss a kick, connecting on five field goals of 38, 53, 54, 45 and 33 yards for Denver. Las Vegas countered with four field goals in four tries from Daniel Carlson of 34, 34, 53 and 22 yards. The game flipped shortly after halftime, as Gardner Minshew threw an ill-advised interception to Broncos safety Brandon Jones on the Raiders' opening possession of the third quarter and Jones returned it to the Las Vegas 18-yard line. Nix found receiver Courtland Sutton in the end zone for a highlight-reel touchdown catch that put Denver up 16-13 with 10:49 remaining in the third quarter. The Broncos did not relinquish the lead. Nix found Sutton again from 2-yards out with 5:30 remaining in the fourth quarter to put Denver ahead 26-16. The score was set up when Marvin Mims II took a short pass from Nix 37 yards to the 2 on Denver's previous play. Sutton finished with 97 yards and two touchdowns on eight catches. Devaughn Vale added 80 yards on six catches as nine different players made receptions. The Raiders led 13-9 at halftime. Ameer Abdullah scored the only touchdown for either side in the first half, hauling in a 6-yard reception from Minshew with 13:36 left in the second quarter. The touchdown capped a seven-play, 40-yard drive that was kickstarted by a 59-yard kickoff return by Dylan Laube after the Broncos had taken a 3-0 lead. Minshew finished with 230 yards through the air, throwing a touchdown and an interception while completing 25 of 42 passes. Backup Desmond Ridder was 4 of 10 for 64 yards. The Raiders' run game struggled as it was held to just 69 yards total on 16 carries. The Raiders' desperation led them to trickery with 7:45 remaining in the second quarter. Punter AJ Cole executed a fake to perfection, finding linebacker Divine Deablo for a 34-yard first-down completion. In turn, Deablo was the Raiders' leading receiver in the first half. Abdullah finished the game with five receptions for 37 yards including the touchdown, while rushing for 28 yards on eight carries.

Seattle's Jason Myers kicked a 50-yard field goal with 1:56 remaining to help clinch the victory. Kyler Murray was 24-of-37 passing for 285 yards with one interception for the Cardinals (6-5). Tight end Trey McBride established career highs of 12 catches and 133 yards. Trailing 7-3, the Cardinals reached Seattle's 40-yard line on their opening possession of the second half. They decided to go for it on fourth-and-1, with Murray rolling to his right in an attempt to run for the first down. But Murray's path was blocked and he lofted a pass for Michael Wilson that was picked off by Bryant and returned down the left sideline. The Seahawks took the lead for good on a 3-yard touchdown pass from Smith to Jaxon Smith-Njigba with 1:14 remaining in the second quarter. The key to the seven-play, 61-yard drive was a screen pass to Smith-Njigba that he turned into a 46-yard gain to Arizona's 4. Smith-Njigba had six catches for 77 yards. The Cardinals opened the scoring on a 35-yard field goal by Chad Ryland with 9:43 left in the second quarter. That came two plays after Murray found Wilson with a 7-yard pass in the front right corner of the end zone, a touchdown that was nullified by a holding penalty on Paris Johnson Jr. Ryland also booted a 22-yarder early in the fourth quarter to pull the Cardinals within 13-6. The Seahawks appeared to take the lead with 1:33 left in the first quarter when Leonard Williams hit Murray's arm and Tyrice Knight recovered the ball and rumbled 33 yards to the end zone. But a video review determined Murray's arm was coming forward and the call was changed to an incomplete pass. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Jordan Love passed for 163 yards and two touchdowns, helping the Packers to a season high in points. Green Bay scored the first 17 points, moving the ball efficiently against a San Francisco defense whose inactives included defensive end Joey Bosa (hip, oblique) and cornerback Charvarius Ward (personal matter). Injuries on offense also took a toll. Brandon Allen started at quarterback for San Francisco in place of Brock Purdy, who was out with a sore right (throwing) shoulder, while left tackle Trent Williams also missed the game. Love hit Tucker Kraft for an 11-yard touchdown pass on the opening drive. The Packers made it 10-0 on Brandon McManus' 51-yard field goal late in the first quarter and surged ahead 17-0 on Jacobs' 1-yard TD run with 6:33 left in the second. Jacobs struck again with 4:28 remaining in the third quarter on another score from a yard out. Green Bay capitalized on a short field after Xavier McKinney intercepted Allen and returned the ball to the San Francisco 26. Following a Jake Moody field goal for the 49ers, the Packers scored another touchdown off a takeaway. Jacobs sealed the third three-TD effort of his career with 10:59 left in the game, shortly after Allen fumbled on Lukas Van Ness' sack and Kenny Clark recovered at the Niners' 16. The 49ers punted on their first two possessions but the attack began clicking before halftime. San Francisco collected its initial first down on an Allen pass to fullback Kyle Juszczyk, which proved to be the first play of a 11-play, 65-yard touchdown drive. Allen capped the possession with a 3-yard scoring pass to George Kittle. Green Bay racked up a 218-95 edge in total yards in the first half. Allen was 17-for-29 passing for 199 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Christian McCaffrey gained 31 yards on 11 carries while Kittle had six catches for 82 yards and a TD.

Coming off a 4-3 loss on Saturday to the Vancouver Canucks -- a game in which two late goals made it a respectable final result -- the Senators have dropped five straight games, the last four in regulation time, heading into the final date of a four-game homestand. The Senators, who have failed to make the playoffs in seven consecutive seasons, the third-longest current drought behind the Buffalo Sabres (13 seasons) and Detroit Red Wings (eight seasons), must right the ship. Ottawa is ahead of only the Montreal Canadiens in the Eastern Conference standings, although only six points out of a playoff position and with two games in hand on the Boston Bruins, who currently hold the final spot. ""I think we're going to turn this around,"" forward Claude Giroux said. ""I strongly believe that. And you know, it's got to be everybody. It just can't be a few guys having good games. We need everybody to be dialed in. The guys are working hard, but we've got to play a little smarter, and it's going to turn around."" The Senators did not play a smart game against the Canucks, a recurring issue for the past few seasons. Costly giveaways have been the norm, without the necessary top-shelf goaltending to survive those woes. ""In the NHL, you can't gift goals,"" coach Travis Green said. ""Look at all four goals, a couple of turnovers, we make a mistake. Those are gifts. You're going to make mistakes. In the NHL, there are a lot of mistakes made. You have to play better."" The surging Flames arrive in the Canadian capital to kick off a four-game road swing while riding a four-game winning streak. Calgary ended a perfect homestand with a 4-3 shootout victory over the Minnesota Wild on Saturday. ""It gives us a lot of confidence,"" said defenseman Rasmus Andersson, who scored the deciding goal. ""We should've won in regulation, but it is what it is and we end up getting two points."" Calgary surrendered a two-goal, third-period lead before regrouping and earning the win, which gives it points in eight of nine games. ""I liked a lot of our game,"" coach Ryan Huska said. ""The part that I didn't like probably, was the last seven or eight minutes, where I felt for the first time this year, we sat back a bit and let them come at us. A lesson for us, we can make sure we're better in that situation next time."" As they kick off the trip, the Flames are finally boasting some power-play prowess. After a lengthy swoon with the man-advantage, in which they scored only twice in 13 games, they have scored a power-play goal in three consecutive games posted a 4-for-8 mark. ""We're just moving the puck well,"" Andersson said. ""When we have shooting opportunities, we shoot, and we try and work the puck back as quickly as possible after we shoot it. ... It's a good thing, now we've just got to keep it going."" Despite battling for top spot in the Pacific Division, the Flames remain one of the lower-scoring clubs. In fact, Calgary has scored three or fewer non-shootout goals in 18 consecutive games, and posted a 9-6-3 mark in that span. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Carolina has just lost once in eight home games this season, tied with the Winnipeg Jets for fewest home defeats at the quarter-pole of the NHL season. But that home mark figures to be tested this week with games against the Stars, the New York Rangers on Wednesday and the defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers on Friday. A big key for the Hurricanes could be the health of goaltender Pyotr Kochetkov. Kochetkov (10-2-0) is third in the NHL in wins to go along with a solid 2.42 goals-against average and a .904 save percentage. He assumed the No. 1 role in place of veteran Frederik Andersen, who underwent knee surgery Friday and is expected to miss at least two months. But Kochetkov had to leave Saturday's loss in overtime with an upper-body injury after being run into by his own defender, necessitating the services of backup Spencer Martin. Martin made one save in overtime but gave up the winning score to Sean Monahan in the shootout. ""Obviously, we're already one goalie down. This is not ideal for sure,"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""I don't know where we're at with that, we'll see. It didn't look great."" Martin, claimed off waivers from Columbus last January, is 1-2-1 in five games (three starts) this season with a 3.21 GAA and an .870 save percentage. He did have a 24-save shutout at Ottawa, his first in the NHL, on Nov. 16. Monday's contest with Dallas, which has won five of its last six games, kicks off a stretch that sees the Hurricanes play nine of their next 11 games at home. This week ends with a very challenging home-and-home back-to-back against Florida on Friday and Saturday. ""We've got some tough games coming up and we should take it as a challenge,"" said Carolina center Martin Necas, third in the league with 33 points (11 goals, 22 assists). ""It's always fun to play against these teams and we'll show our best."" Dallas, third in the Central Division with 26 points, opened up a three-game road trip with a 4-2 victory over Tampa Bay on Saturday. The contest was tied 2-2 entering the third period when Matt Duchene and Roope Hintz scored 58 seconds apart. Duchene scored his team-leading 11th goal with a tight-angle wrist shot past Andrei Vasilevskiy's glove side at the end of a 3-on-1 rush, while Hintz followed with a power-play goal. ""We got better as the game went on, and the third period was our best,"" Dallas coach Peter DeBoer said. ""We talked at the end of the second (period) that we didn't feel we had played our best yet, but we were in a 2-2 game and had a chance to really find another level there in the third and win an important game to start a road trip against a real good team."" Jake Oettinger made 27 saves for his 11th win, second only to the Winnipeg Jets' Connor Hellebuyck, the reigning Vezina Trophy winner, who has 14 victories. ""We've won a lot of games when we're tied going into the third,"" Oettinger said. ""Guys needed to step up and make plays, and we had a few of those."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Rangers allowed a combined 41 shots on goal in the opening periods of the final two games of a four-game trip. They will attempt to produce an improved start and avoid their first three-game losing streak this season Monday night when they host the St. Louis Blues, who will play their first game under new coach Jim Montgomery. The Rangers are actually outscoring opponents 20-16 in the opening 20 minutes this season, but recently are experiencing struggles right from the start. New York outscored opponents 12-3 in six opening periods when it started 5-0-1, but since then the Rangers are getting outscored 13-8 in their opening periods. The past two were especially difficult for the Rangers, who ended a 2-2-0 four-game road trip by getting outshot 41-14 in first periods. In a 3-2 loss to the Calgary Flames on Thursday, Igor Shesterkin made 19 of his 46 saves when the Rangers escaped the first with a 1-0 deficit. Two nights later, they could not overcome their defensive struggles in a 6-2 loss to the Edmonton Oilers. Backup goalie Jonathan Quick stopped the first 18 shots before allowing two goals in the final 2:26 of the first. The Rangers never recovered, allowing two goals in the second and two more in the third to superstar Connor McDavid. ""We're leaving our goalies out to dry right now in the first period especially,"" New York's Vincent Trocheck said. ""And we've got to come out with a little bit more -- a lot more urgency. And we've got to dig, dig deep here and look ourselves in the mirror before next game."" ""These last two games, first period's been just flat-out terrible,"" defenseman Adam Fox added after the Rangers committed 23 giveaways vs. Edmonton. ""And I mean, you're never gonna win a game when you're putting yourself in that big of a hole early."" The Blues are hoping to avoid falling further into a hole in the Western Conference after replacing coach Drew Bannister with Montgomery on Sunday morning, less than a year after firing Craig Berube. Bannister replaced Berube after 28 games last season and was 30-19-5 the rest of the way as the Blues finished six points out of the final wild-card spot. With St. Louis off to a middling 9-12-1 start and 4-9-1 in its past 14 games, president of hockey operations and general manager Doug Armstrong fired Bannister and signed Montgomery to a five-year deal Sunday morning. Montgomery spent two seasons as an assistant under Berube and was fired by the Boston Bruins on Monday after two-plus seasons that included NHL regular-season records of 65 wins and 135 points in 2022-23. Armstrong admitted that was the reason for the change. ""This was more of an opportunity to get someone of Jim's caliber than anything else,"" Armstrong told reporters on a conference call. ""When I talked to Drew (Sunday) I told him this was more of a decision based on the availability of someone I think is a top NHL coach, someone that we have experience with, someone I really do believe can coach this team and also coach the team when it reaches its ultimate level of competitiveness."" The Blues were held to one goal or fewer for the fifth time in their past 13 games when they took a 3-1 loss to the New York Islanders on Saturday. St Louis gave up the first two goals before Jake Neighbours scored on the power play 45 seconds into the third, but the Blues were held to 25 shots on goal, marking the 11th time they were held to 25 or fewer. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Fresh off his second overtime goal in the last five games, Michkov leads the Flyers into Monday's home game against the Vegas Golden Knights. Philadelphia's first-round pick in 2023, Michkov joined the NHL prior to this season and has made a major impact on the young Flyers. He ranks second on the squad in goals (seven) and assists (nine) and has been earning more playing time under coach John Tortorella. Michkov scored in overtime Nov. 14 against the Ottawa Senators and turned the trick again Saturday, netting the decisive tally in a 3-2 win over the Chicago Blackhawks. ""There's not many moments you're going to get,"" Michkov said through an interpreter. ""When you get the moment, you have to be cold-blooded and finish it."" Saturday's OT goal was particularly notable as it capped a late-game comeback for the Flyers, who trailed 2-0 in the third period. Sean Couturier and Noah Cates scored down the stretch to set the stage for Michkov's goal off a perfect feed from Travis Konecny. ""We kept our patience,"" Tortorella said. ""I don't think we played poorly by any means, but when we're down 2-0, we had chances, we couldn't finish. ... I appreciate how the guys just stayed together, kept on playing."" Philadelphia has spent the last month digging out of a 1-5-1 hole to begin the season. The Flyers can get back to .500 with a win Monday in the finale of their five-game homestand. ""We got frustrated at times, but we stuck together and stuck to the same style of play,"" Couturier said. ""We came back, showed some character in the third and capitalized on our chances and found a way to get the two points."" Vegas earned two points in its most recent contest, as well, riding a five-goal second period to a 6-2 victory over the Montreal Canadiens. Ivan Barbashev and Jack Eichel each registered a goal and two assists for the Knights, who have been consistently up-and-down over the last 10 games. During that stretch, the team has won two in a row, lost two consecutive games, then won two straight before losing two straight and then winning two in a row again. That inconsistency was on display against the Canadiens, as the Knights dominated the second period before allowing two goals in a third period that disappointed coach Bruce Cassidy. ""Let's face it, in the third period we got off our game, they pushed us,"" Cassidy said. ""I know it's late, but at the end of the day, good on (the Canadiens) to make a play."" Still, Vegas finished with its highest goal total since scoring seven times Oct. 26 against the San Jose Sharks. ""It's just our style of play,"" forward Keegan Kolesar said. ""We wear teams down. We were able to capitalize on a couple of mistakes they made and we sent our nose to the net. ... That results in some goals for us."" The Flyers and Knights have split 12 all-time meetings. The teams will meet again in Las Vegas on Jan. 2. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The No. 1 Gamecocks fell Sunday in Los Angeles as Lauren Betts posted a double-double effort to lead No. 5 UCLA to a 77-62 triumph. The Gamecocks (5-1) suffered their first defeat after 43 consecutive victories, dating back to the loss to Iowa 77-73 in the NCAA Tournament semifinals. South Carolina defeated Iowa last season for the national championship. Betts finished with 11 points, a game-high 14 rebounds, four assists and four blocks to power the Bruins (5-0) to a historic victory. UCLA also got 15 points from Londynn Jones on 5-of-5 shooting from 3-point range, 13 points from Elina Aarnisalo and 11 each from Kiki Rice and Gabriela Jacquez. It's the first time UCLA has beaten South Carolina since 1981. The Bruins lost twice to the Gamecocks in the 2022-23 season, including in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament. Te-Hina Paopao had 18 points for South Carolina on 4-of-4 3-point shooting, while Tessa Johnson had 14 points. UCLA won the rebounding battle 41-34, marking the second time this season the Gamecocks have been outrebounded. South Carolina also got outscored in the paint 26-18. It's rare that a Dawn Staley-coached team -- units that typically revolve around dominant centers from A'ja Wilson to Aaliyah Boston to Kamilla Cardoso -- gets beat in the paint and on the glass, but with 6-foot-7 Betts, UCLA had the recipe to outmuscle the Gamecocks in those areas of the game. South Carolina never led after UCLA began the game with an 18-5 run, capped off by back-to-back 3-pointers from Jones. The Gamecocks cut the deficit to nine points in the second quarter, but the Bruins responded with a 17-5 run and entered halftime ahead by 21 points. Aarnisalo scored seven points during that run. From there, the Gamecocks never got within single digits of the lead in the second half. It's the first time in 21 tries that UCLA has beaten an AP-ranked No. 1 team. And it's the first time South Carolina lost a true road game since 2021, a streak of 33 games. The schedule doesn't get any easier for South Carolina. While UCLA faces UT Martin next on Friday, the Gamecocks play No. 8 Iowa State on Thursday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Wilkinson finished with 16 points and Rytis Petraitis 13 for the Golden Bears (5-1), whose only loss this season was at Vanderbilt. Jacob Holt went for a season-high 25 points for the Hornets (1-4), who dropped their fourth straight after a season-opening win over Cal State Maritime. Seeking a fourth straight home win, Cal led by as many as 12 points in the first half and 40-33 at halftime before Sacramento State rallied. The Hornets used a 14-5 burst out of the gate following the intermission to grab a 47-45 lead. Julian Vaughns had a 3-pointer and three-point play in the run. But Cal dominated pretty much the rest of the game, taking the lead for good on a Petraitis 3-pointer with 14:50 remaining. Stojakovic, a transfer from rival Stanford, went 11-for-15 at the foul line en route to his third 20-point game of the young season. Cal outscored Sacramento State 26-17 on free throws to more than account for the margin of victory. Coming off a 23-point explosion in his first extended action of the season, Wilkinson hit five of his 10 shots Sunday. The Golden Bears outshot the Hornets 47.2 percent to 43.1 percent. Joshua Ola-Joseph contributed 10 points and six rebounds, Mady Sissoko also had 10 points and Petraitis found time for a team-high five assists. Holt complemented his 25 points with a game-high eight rebounds. He made four 3-pointers, as did Vaughns en route to 18 points, helping Sacramento State outscore Cal 30-21 from beyond the arc.

Carter's make sparked a 5-0 spurt for LSU (5-1), which mounted a ferocious second-half rally that began after Darius Johnson drilled a 3-pointer to put the Knights up 52-34 with 12:57 to play in regulation. UCF (4-2) got back within two in the third overtime, but it never found a way to draw even. Vyctorius Miller and Jordan Sears sealed the victory, combining for three buckets down low that gave the Tigers a 106-99 cushion with 17 seconds remaining. Carter was the late-game hero for LSU, scoring the final four points of regulation to forge a 70-70 tie. He also knocked down a go-ahead 3-pointer with 3:19 left in the first extra session to give the Tigers a 76-75 advantage. Sears gave LSU a four-point edge with a triple of his own with 2:10 to go, but the Tigers failed to stay in front, and UCF's Keyshawn Hall kept the game going by sinking two free throws with six seconds remaining to make it 82-82. Neither team led by more than three in the second overtime, with Hall again coming to the Knights' rescue. He made two layups in the final 52 seconds of the frame to knot things at 93 and send the teams to a third OT. Few could have predicted 15 minutes of extra basketball after UCF put together a 25-3 first-half run that lifted it to a 38-18 advantage with 2:12 left until the break. LSU responded with seven unanswered points, but the Knights still led comfortably, 40-25, at intermission.

The Panthers, who are set to host the Washington Capitals on Monday night in Sunrise, are 1-5-0 over their past six games. ""We're struggling right now,"" Panthers coach Paul Maurice said. ""We have a structure we need to play, and we're not far off. But we have some execution challenges."" Panthers winger Matthew Tkachuk said Florida needs to impose its will on teams in much the way it was done in the drive for the 2024 Stanley Cup. ""There shouldn't be any more waiting around,"" he said. ""We have to commit to doing it, and it's not an easy style. It's hard to do for 82-plus games, but that's what makes us successful."" On the positive side, the Panthers have center Sam Reinhart, whose 13-game points streak is the longest this season by any NHL player. It's also tied for the second-longest streak by a Panthers player, and it's just four games away from tying Mike Hoffman's franchise record, set in 2018-19. Reinhart has 11 goals and eight assists during this streak, and he's tied for the NHL lead with 16 goals this season. However, Panthers goalie Sergei Bobrovsky allowed a season-high six goals on Saturday in a 7-4 loss to Colorado. For the season, Bobrovsky is 9-5-1 with a 3.18 goals-against average. That is not up to his standards, which include a 2.60 career GAA and a 2.37 GAA last season. Backup goalie Spencer Knight is 3-3-0 with a 2.72 GAA. Florida's first-round pick in 2019, Knight has made 64 NHL appearances in four years, including 55 starts, and he is 35-20-6 with a 2.89 GAA. But even with all of that, the Panthers are still in second place in the Atlantic Division with 25 points, and the Capitals -- despite two straight losses -- are in third in the Metropolitan Division with 27 points. The Capitals are coming off a 3-2 home loss on Saturday to the New Jersey Devils. ""It's frustrating to lose back to back,"" Capitals goalie Charlie Lindgren said. Lindgren is 5-5-0 with a 2.64 GAA. Co-starter Logan Thompson, acquired in a trade in June with Vegas, is 8-1-1 with a 2.58 GAA. Both are undrafted players making $1 million or less this season. Three of the higher-paid Capitals players are all on injured reserve -- forwards Alex Ovechkin (leg); Nicklas Backstrom (hip); and T.J. Oshie (back). Backstrom and Oshie haven't played this season, but Ovechkin has 15 goals and 10 assists in 18 games. Dylan Strome leads Washington in assists (22) and points (28). Last season, the Capitals ranked 31st in the NHL in goals by defensemen (20). This season, they already have 11 in 20 games thanks in part to the additions of Jakob Chychrun (five) and Matt Roy (one). Roy was given a six-year contract, and Chychrun was acquired in a trade with Ottawa. They join two-time All-Star John Carlson and former first-rounder Rasmus Sandin in a suddenly improved defense. Offensively, Washington, which ranked 28th in scoring last year, added forwards Pierre-Luc Dubois, Andrew Mangiapane, Brandon Duhaime and Taylor Raddysh. Those four have combined to score 13 goals so far this season, and Washington is tied for first in the NHL with 4.05 goals per game. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

UMass (1-5) dropped its fifth in a row following a season-opening win over New Hampshire despite a strong game on Sunday from Jaylen Curry, who scored 17 points.

FSU closed the half on a 13-3 run to lead 37-27 at halftime. A 15-4 surge to open the second half helped the Seminoles break the game open. Florida State's defense frustrated UMass shooters throughout the contest, especially on the perimeter, limiting the Minutemen to 3-for-24 shooting (12.5 percent) from 3-point range and 18-for-58 (31 percent) overall. The Seminoles finished with 22 points off 17 UMass turnovers. On the flipside, Florida State had one of its best shooting games of the season. The Seminoles moved the ball well throughout the game and finished with 25 assists while only turning the ball over 10 times. The Seminoles shot 33 for 58 (57 percent) from the field and made 9 of 18 three-pointers to put together a season-high scoring output. Once again, Florida State shined thanks to its depth as 10 players scored and four scored in double figures. The Seminoles were able to have 16 players participate in the game as well.

With a shutout of ninth-seeded Atlanta -- which won both these teams' regular-season meetings -- No. 4 seed Orlando reached its first conference final since the club began MLS play in 2015. The Lions will host the seventh-seeded New York Red Bulls, who defeated New York City FC in Saturday's East semifinal. Pedro Gallese kept his third clean sheet of the postseason, this time without having to make a single save against an Atlanta side that had scored eight goals in its first four playoff matches. Atlanta's season ends with the club's best postseason finish since reaching the 2019 Eastern Conference semifinals. Atlanta midfielder Dax McCarty played his final MLS game, finishing a career that began in 2006 with 488 league appearances and 35 more in the postseason. The visitors won back-to-back matches just to qualify for the playoffs, then pulled off one of the biggest MLS Cup playoff upsets of all time in a three-game series triumph over Lionel Messi and Supporters' Shield winners Inter Miami in Round 1. But Orlando was the superior side throughout the first half Sunday and took a deserved lead through a set piece, an area that has given Atlanta trouble this season. Enrique helped create the corner kick when he pressured goalkeeper Brad Guzan into spilling the ball over his own endline when trying to catch a high cross. Martin Ojeda's ensuing outswinger dropped to the turf after deflecting off at least one body in the box, and Enrique was first to the loose ball to poke home a finish past Guzan from close range. Interim Atlanta manager Rob Valentino removed injured striker Jamal Thiare -- who scored twice in the Game 3 win over Miami -- moments after Orlando's goal. His replacement Daniel Rios then also had to exit after taking a ball to the head early in the second half. The attackers that remained had more opportunities in the second half than the first, but rarely made Gallese work. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Devils have won their last two games and are 7-2-0 in their last nine games. This impressive stretch includes two wins over the reigning Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers, as well as other wins over last season's Stanley Cup finalists, the Edmonton Oilers, and two division rivals in the Carolina Hurricanes and Washington Capitals. ""We've had to be on our toes,"" said Devils defenseman Brenden Dillon following Saturday's 3-2 road win over Washington. ""We've had to kind of take in a little bit of water at certain points, and kind of bend but don't break. ... A tough stretch of hockey here against some really good teams, and I think we've found ways to win in a tough league."" Despite the 13-point gap between the Devils and Predators in this season's standings, recent history is on Nashville's side. The Predators have a dominant 11-1-1 record in their last 13 games against New Jersey, dating back to the 2016-17 season. Though the struggling Predators find themselves near the bottom of the NHL standings, they're also coming off a victory over top-tier competition. In perhaps Nashville's best overall performance of the season, the Predators scored three unanswered goals in the third period of Saturday's 4-1 win over the league-leading Winnipeg Jets. ""I thought that was a pretty good recipe of what we have to do and understand we've got to continue this,"" Predators forward Steven Stamkos said. ""The story of this year has been we have efforts like this and then we don't follow it up. So let's follow it up and get on a little roll here."" Nashville began the season with a five-game (0-5-0) losing streak but has shown signs of life with a 3-2-2 record in its last seven games. The battle between two elite special-teams units could decide Monday's game. The Predators lead the NHL with a 91.7 percent penalty-kill percentage, while the Devils' 31 percent power-play percentage is second to Winnipeg's 33.9 percent. New Jersey is 7-for-17 on the power play in its last four games, while Nashville has killed 20 of 21 penalties over its last seven games. Since goaltender Jake Allen started Saturday against the Capitals, Jacob Markstrom should face Nashville if New Jersey sticks to its usual rotation of having Markstrom start two of every three games. Markstrom is 9-5-1 with a .907 save percentage and 2.54 goals-against average in 15 starts this season. Juuse Saros has started 17 of Nashville's 21 games, but the workhorse goalie should be back between the pipes on Monday. Saros has an outstanding .937 save percentage and 1.90 GAA over his last nine games, though with just a 4-4-1 record in that span due to a lack of help from the Predators' lackluster offense. Filip Forsberg (eight goals, eight assists) and Roman Josi (four goals, 12 assists) share the Predators' team points lead with 16 apiece. By comparison, the Devils have five players who have 17 or more points this season. Jesper Bratt leads New Jersey with 28 points (10 goals, 18 assists). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

They get a chance to do so again to start Thanksgiving week when the Lightning play host the Colorado Avalanche on Monday night. While Tampa Bay did get past the Stars to win the title in 2020, coach Jon Cooper's team was unable to fight through injuries in the 2022 Final that slipped away to the Avalanche in six games. Offensive spark plug Brayden Point missed most all of that postseason. The 13th-year Lightning coach is combatting new enemies these days. ""One team tried to make six passes and put the puck in the net and turned it over, and the other team made two passes and threw it in the net,"" Cooper said after Saturday's 4-2 home loss, while comparing his team to the Stars. ""One team waited for the other team to make a mistake, they did, and that team capitalized on it. That was it. ""We blinked first and we lost."" The Lightning's Anthony Cirelli scored twice and extended his goal streak to five games, but Dallas forward Matt Duchene broke a 2-2 tie in the third period and Roope Hintz scored 58 seconds later to sink the Lightning and drop them to 3-4-2 in November. Cooper's frustrations in his group's pass-first play have been noted, but they seemed to reach a boiling point after a second straight setback. ""It's almost like the goals don't count unless they make the highlight reel,"" Cooper said. ""We haven't quite figured out that if the puck just crosses the goal line in between the pipes, it counts. It doesn't have to be an all-world play."" As they get healthier, the Avalanche demonstrated Saturday against the defending Stanley Cup champions that they have no problem scoring. Mikko Rantanen notched a goal and three assists as Colorado powered past the Florida Panthers in a 7-4 victory. Wingers Valeri Nichushkin (suspension) and Jonathan Drouin (upper-body injury) were playing their fourth games since returning from season-long absences and had their best showings so far. A power forward, Nichushkin notched a goal and two assists, while the slick Drouin scored twice, the first tallies for each this season. Drouin was injured six weeks ago on opening night while playing left wing on the top line against the Vegas Golden Knights and missed 16 games. He said he and his teammates followed the lead of the champion Panthers. ""I thought we played well after giving up that first goal,"" Drouin said. ""We tried to play a little how they do: Put the puck in deep, try to make them come 200 feet to our net. I don't think we made many mistakes in that game."" The Avalanche are on a three-game winning streak and are 7-3-0 this month. That surge has them in fourth place in the Central Division behind the first-place Winnipeg Jets, Minnesota Wild and Stars, respectively. Colorado turned defense into offense in the win. ""We shut down the rush attack and that is important to get above them because they are a dangerous rush team,"" Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said. ""They push north hard. For most of the game, we did a real good job of that. Our defensive play led to good offense."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Sanders helped the Wolfpack (6-1) earn a second win following one-possession games against Vanderbilt and VCU. After hitting the decisive 3-pointer with five seconds left in Friday's 64-61 win over VCU, Sanders made 7 of 10 shots, hit three 3s and sank 10 of 13 free throws Sunday.

The Wolfpack took a 24-15 lead on Chuck Bailey's jumper in the paint with 8:28 left but the Cowboys inched back, getting within 33-31 on a dunk by Avery with 4:11 left. Another Bailey jumper staked Nevada to a 40-33 lead by halftime. Nevada began pulling away early in the second half as it scored eight in a row for a 52-40 lead on a basket by Love with 16:44 left.

After Nevada made eight straight shots, the Cowboys countered with 11 straight points and trailed 62-54 with 11:19 left on a 3-pointer by Avery. Thompson made his first basket by sinking a jumper with 10:37 left to get Oklahoma State within 64-56 left, and Keller's triple cut the margin to 70-64 nearly three minutes later. The Cowboys were within 78-72 on a basket by Avery with 3:56 remaining, but he fouled out about a minute later and the Wolfpack outscored Oklahoma State 12-6 the rest of the way as Sanders sank five free throws. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

As Sanders was brought down near the sideline after a 10-yard reception, he was flipped upside down and landed directly on the top of his helmet as he went out of bounds on the tackle by cornerback Trent McDuffie. After receiving attention from the team's medical staff, Sanders was strapped to a backboard and taken off the field on a cart with 40 seconds remaining in the half. He was taken to Atrium Health Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte for observation and later released Sunday afternoon, according to the team. On the CBS broadcast following halftime, Panthers head coach Dave Canales said Sanders had movement in all his extremities, while extreme precaution was taken because of back tightness. CBS reported he was being examined for a concussion before later amending that to a neck injury. The 21-year-old rookie out of Texas had a team-leading three receptions for the Panthers at the half for 49 yards. In 11 games this season, Sanders has 29 receptions for 302 yards and a touchdown.

Tony Pollard rushed for 119 yards and one touchdown and Nick Westbrook-Ihkine caught a scoring pass as Tennessee (3-8) won for just the second time in its last seven games. Levis was 18-of-24 passing for 278 yards, two touchdowns and one interception for the Titans. Houston had a chance to force overtime but Ka'imi Fairbairn missed a chip-shot 28-yard field goal with 1:53 remaining, sending the kick wide left. The Texans got the ball back with 1:29 left. Three plays later, Harold Landry sacked Houston's C.J. Stroud in the end zone to make it a five-point margin with 1:13 left. Stroud completed 20 of 33 passes for 247 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions for Houston (7-5), which lost for the fourth time in the past six games. Jimmie Ward returned an interception for a touchdown for the Texans. Nico Collins and Cade Stover caught scoring passes for Houston. Houston sacked Levis eight times. Danielle Hunter had three and Will Anderson Jr. notched two. Ward traveled 65 yards on his pick-six to give the Texans a 24-23 lead with four seconds left in the third period. The Texans moved ahead by four when Fairbairn kicked a 56-yard field goal with 9:46 remaining in the game. It was Fairbairn's 12th field goal of 50 or more yards this season, surpassing the NFL record of Daniel Carlson (11 in 2022 for the Las Vegas Raiders). But on Houston's next offensive play, Okonkwo caught a pass from Levis near his own 40-yard line and raced up the middle and sped past multiple Titans to turn it into a 70-yard scoring play to give Tennessee a 30-27 lead. The game began great for Houston as Dameon Pierce returned the opening kickoff 80 yards and Stroud followed with a 19-yard touchdown pass to Stover. The Titans recovered with the next 17 points. Nick Folk kicked a 51-yard field goal and Levis threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to Westbrook-Ikhine in the first quarter. Pollard scored on a 10-yard run to boost the Titans' lead to 17-7 with 11:03 left in the first half. Stroud tossed a 5-yard scoring pass to Collins with 6:17 left in the quarter and Fairbairn tacked on a 28-yard field goal to knot the score at 17 with 1:47 remaining. Folk booted a 56-yard field as time ran out to give Tennessee a 20-17 halftime lead.

Tagovailoa completed 29 of 40 passes as Miami (5-6) continued to dominate the Patriots at home. New England has now dropped 10 of its past 12 games at Hard Rock Stadium.   Jaylen Waddle hauled in eight receptions for 144 yards and a touchdown and former Patriot Jonnu Smith had nine catches for 87 yards and a TD for the Dolphins, who have won three straight games. Running back De'Von Achane was on the receiving end of a pair of scores.   Drake Maye finished with 221 yards, one TD and one interception on 22-of-37 passing for New England (3-9), which punted five times, missed a field goal and lost a fumble before finally putting up points with 13:43 left in the game.   With nothing to lose on fourth-and-15 from the Miami 38, Maye lobbed up a deep ball that Austin Hooper snagged near the 3. Hooper then spun around and crossed the goal line to get the Patriots within 31-7.   After Joey Slye missed a 45-yard field-goal attempt at the end of New England's second drive of the game, the Dolphins completely took over.   Miami scored three straight touchdowns, with the first coming with 14:10 remaining in the second quarter. Tagovailoa got the Dolphins on the board by finding Smith for a 7-yard score.   Tagovailoa then connected with Achane for two touchdowns -- from 9 and 11 yards out -- in a six-minute span later in the quarter to make it 21-0.   Following Achane's second trip to the end zone, New England went three-and-out, allowing Miami to get a 21-yard field goal from Jason Sanders with two seconds left in the first half.   Neither team scored following the break until a Maye fumble led to Tagovailoa's 23-yard TD pass to Waddle with 1:37 to go in the third quarter.   Christian Gonzalez made the score more respectable by scooping up a fumble and taking it 63 yards to the end zone with 10:10 left in the game to cut the Patriots' deficit to 31-15.   Sanders closed the scoring with a 51-yard field goal with 3:33 to play.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Coming off a bye week after a brutal stretch of losses against Baltimore, Atlanta, Kansas City and San Francisco, the Bucs improved to 5-6 as they attempt to stay close to the Falcons (6-5), leaders of the NFC South. New York fell to 2-9 with its sixth consecutive defeat. Second-year pro and local boy Tommy DeVito was ineffective in his seventh career start and first of this season after the surprise benching and then release of veteran quarterback Daniel Jones. Pressured mercilessly -- and sacked four times -- DeVito finished 21-for-31 for 189 yards, much of it after the Bucs had settled the issue. The Bucs led 23-0 at the end of the first half and outgained New York 290-45 in total yardage. DeVito lost not only the booing home crowd but his signature ""pinched fingers"" touchdown celebration. Mayfield vigorously brandished the gesture after clattering into the end zone from the 10-yard line with 12 seconds left in the half. Sean Tucker's 1-yard run gave the Buccaneers a 7-0 lead on an opening drive of the game that consumed 14 plays and nearly nine minutes. Chase McLaughlin's 23-yard field goal increased the margin to 10-0 with 12:03 left in the half. Bucky Irving added a 6-yard scoring run about six minutes later for a 17-0 cushion. The Giants began the second half with a promising drive to the Tampa Bay 5, but running back Tyrone Tracy fumbled on a first-and-goal rush. It was the Giants' seventh red zone turnover this season. Tampa Bay then drove 95 yards, culminating with Rachaad White's 1-yard touchdown run for a 30-0 lead. The Giants responded with Devin Singletary's 1-yard score to make it 30-7 with 11:28 remaining. Star wide receiver Mike Evans returned after missing three games with a hamstring injury to lead the Bucs with five receptions for 68 yards on six targets. Irving rushed 12 times for 87 yards and a score, and caught six passes for 64 yards. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Lions' streak is their longest since their first season in Detroit in 1934 when they won 10 straight games. Jared Goff passed for 269 yards for the Lions (10-1), completing 26 of 36 passes. David Montgomery had a combined 73 yards rushing and receiving and ran for a touchdown. Montgomery came away with a shoulder injury during the second half and did not return. The Lions' Amon-Ra St. Brown caught six passes for 62 yards but his streak of scoring a receiving touchdown ended at eight games. Anthony Richardson passed for 172 yards and rushed for 61 more for the Colts (5-7). Michael Pittman caught six passes for 96 yards but Jonathan Taylor was held to 35 rushing yards. Indianapolis was penalized 10 times for 75 yards. Detroit led 14-6 at halftime. The Colts drove 66 yards on the opening possession of the game but had to settle for Matt Gay's 27-yard field goal. Detroit got on the board early in the second quarter by finishing off a nine-play, 60-yard drive. Gibbs scored on a 1-yard run after Indianapolis was penalized for unnecessary roughness. Andrew Ogletree dropped a potential touchdown pass during the Colts' ensuing drive, and Indianapolis had to settle for another Gay field goal, this one from 29 yards. The Lions answered with a touchdown. Montgomery gained 13 yards on 3rd-and-6 to keep the drive going and he scored two plays later from 6 yards out. Detroit came up empty in the red zone during the opening possession of the second half as Montgomery was dropped for a loss on 4th-and-1. The Lions extended their lead to 21-6 with a 10-play, 79-yard drive in the third quarter. Gibbs, who had a 16-yard run during the drive, finished it off with a 5-yard carry with 2:19 remaining in the quarter.

Roddy Gayle Jr. led the Wolverines with 16 points, Sam Walters and Tre Donaldson added 13 each and Vladislav Goldin finished with 12. ""It's nice to finish our homestand with a win, another game I feel we learned something about ourselves,"" Michigan coach Dusty May said. ""This was a game we needed.

Virginia Tech (3-2) is looking to bounce back from a 74-64 home loss to Jacksonville last Wednesday. The loss snapped a 24-game home nonconference win streak. The Hokies had not lost to an opponent from a non-power conference at home by 10-plus points since 1993. ""I'd like to tell you that it's really good in practice; it hasn't been,"" Hokies coach Mike Young said. ""We don't play with the best basketball IQ and that's on me.

The availability of Steven Ashworth is in question after the senior guard sustained a right ankle injury during the Bluejays' 74-63 setback to in-state rival Nebraska on Friday.  Ashworth matched his scoring average by totaling 16 points against the upstart Cornhuskers. He trails only Big East Preseason Player of the Year Ryan Kalkbrenner (21.4) for top honors on the team, while Ashworth's 6.4 assists lead the club.  ""We have no idea how long Steven's going to be out,"" Creighton coach Greg McDermott said. ""I think it's going to be a while."" The timing of the injury is troublesome for the Bluejays (4-1), who have a busy slate ahead. Creighton will square off against No. 23 Texas A&M on Wednesday at Las Vegas and another opponent in the tournament on Saturday before facing top-ranked Kansas on Dec. 4. Nebraska clamped down on Kalkbrenner, forcing the Bluejays to navigate away from the 7-foot-1 star center and try their luck from the perimeter.  ""Great defensive plan to keep the ball out of the paint,"" McDermott said. ""When they do that, we've gotta take advantage and make some 3-point shots, and obviously we didn't shoot it very well."" The Bluejays made just 12 of a program-record 42 attempts from 3-point range. Texas Tech transfer and Las Vegas native Pop Isaacs highlighted his season-high 25-point performance by connecting five times on 12 shots from beyond the arc.  Kalkbrenner, who erupted for a career-high 49 points in the season opener, finished with a paltry four points -- all free throws -- for his lowest scoring output since Christmas 2022 against DePaul.  ""I think that what this team has shown so far is not what its ceiling is,"" Kalkbrenner said. ""I know we have a lot more in us than what we've shown."" San Diego State (2-1) is well rested since dropping an 80-67 decision at home to Gonzaga on Nov. 18.  Nick Boyd collected 23 points and nine rebounds before exiting with 13 minutes to play due to muscle cramps.

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation published a story Saturday quoting players who read the AP reporting in 2020 about Oregon State's Mark Barnard and, according to one, felt ""it was like reading one of our own training sessions.” “I just started shaking, my heart started racing,” one player, Selina Scoble, told ABC. Scoble said her difficulties on the team “snowballed into depression and bulimia, and I have a lot of shame and guilt around that.” The AP investigation cited more than a dozen players who told of an abusive culture at Oregon State. Among their allegations were that Barnard, who left the program in 2022, pitted players against each other in team meetings while he was there and pushed them past health warnings in practice as punishment. The so-called coach-on-one drills the Oregon State players described — in which coaches make players dive after difficult-to-retrieve balls they throw — were the same drills Barnard ran as both an assistant, then later the head coach at what was then Australia's nascent women's volleyball program being run by the country's Institute of Sport. “On any given day, we were fearful for our physical being, for our emotional being,” Elizabeth Brett, one of the first players recruited to the Australian team, told ABC. Brett quit volleyball after the 2000 Sydney Olympics, where the Aussie women finished ninth. “I still don’t sleep on Sunday nights,” Brett said. “That physiological response stayed with me and the anxiety around it.” ABC said the day after the AP report came out, Volleyball Australia, which oversees elite and Olympic volleyball in the country, published a letter of support for Barnard on its Facebook page, and that the letter galvanized the players and motivated them to speak up. “That post itself was infuriating for the group, because it was without any consultation with any of the past players,” said one of the players, Rowena Morgan. Morgan described Barnard as a coach who could diffuse situations when he served as an assistant but said his personality changed once he became the man in charge. “He would yell abuse and nothing was good enough,” Morgan told ABC. “You know: ‘You’re (expletive) useless. You’re weak. If you played any other sport, you’d never get anywhere. You’re pathetic. You disgust me.’ That sort of thing.” The players' outpouring triggered a review by Sports Integrity Australia, which included interviews with 27 participants, including medical staff, and 16 written submissions. The review, completed in 2022, found the program from 1997-2005 fostered a culture of fear and punishment, unacceptable training practices, an inadequate complaints-handling procedure, a lack of coach accountability and limited athlete support. It took two more years for Volleyball Australia to issue a public apology to the players. Without mentioning Barnard or Brad Saindon, who served as head coach of the Aussie program before him, with Barnard as his assistant, the apology acknowledged the former players suffered through “an environment of fear."" As part of the AP reporting, Oregon State disputed allegations that players were pushed past their physical limits as punishment and said “appropriate action was taken” after an internal investigation into Barnard's program. The OSU players said they never felt heard by the university and that their complaints were either swept under the rug or not looked into appropriately. Two of the players who spoke to the AP said they considered suicide. One of them, upon reading the first AP story in the series, said she “genuinely thought the article was written about me,” even thought it was about a different player. Both those players were among more than a dozen who quit or transferred from the Oregon State program during Barnard's tenure, with some saying they were forced out. The coach, who came to Oregon State as an assistant in 2005, then went 70-132 over seven seasons as head coach, left the school after the 2022 season. The school thanked him for his “long-time commitment to our athletic department” but made no mention of the abuse allegations. Barnard did not immediately return messages left by the AP seeking his comment about the ABC report. Saindon told ABC, “I’m not that kind of a coach, I’ve never done that in my whole coaching career, let alone to the young women on the national team in Australia.” After the first two AP stories were published, Oregon State went to court to fight the AP's efforts to obtain documents related to Barnard's case. The AP received a favorable ruling from the local district attorney when it first pressed for the documents, but the university spent more than two years fighting the disclosure. Oregon State ultimately paid the AP’s legal fees in exchange for AP agreeing to drop the request. During the legal wrangling, Oregon State spokesman Steve Clark said the school fought the disclosure because if records were released, it ""would have a chilling effect and potentially stymie people with concerns from ever reporting allegations of wrongdoing.” ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

""M-V-P! M-V-P!” the lone fan chanted. Down on the floor, Donovan Mitchell noticed. However, it wasn't directed at the five-time All-Star, but a teammate shooting free throws. Later, Ty Jerome wanted proof it happened. ""Did you get it on video?” the reserve guard asked. Cleveland's unexpected start has produced an unexpected rising star. After missing all but two games last season with a severe ankle injury that dragged on and required surgery, Jerome has not only become an invaluable piece for first-year Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson but is emblematic of the team's early-season success. This wasn't expected — not by the Cavs and certainly not by Jerome. “He's in this zone,” Atkinson said of the 27-year-old Jerome, already with his fourth NBA team. “It's phenomenal.” While he's been good from the jump this season, Jerome has taken his game to another level this past week. One night after the Cavs lost in Boston after 15 straight wins, Jerome made seven 3-pointers — two on Steph Curry-like heat checks just inside the halfcourt logo — in the first half and finished with a career-high 29 points in a win over New Orleans. For an encore on Sunday, he matched Mitchell, his longtime friend and boyhood teammate in New York, with 26 points and six assists as the Cavs downed Toronto. That performance prompted the MVP chant from the fan who once reserved the somewhat sarcastic salute for popular Cavs sub Cedi Osman. Jerome has a been a marvel since the beginning of training camp, when he made a first impression on Atkinson that has only grown stronger. “Since the moment he stepped in our gym,” Atkinson said when asked how long he knew Jerome would be a major contributor this season. “He’s been phenomenal every day. I mean, (general manager) Koby (Altman) jokes about MVP of August, September, October. We're all expecting, not expecting, but when is it going to start dipping? ""OK, it’s open gym. OK, it’s training camp. OK, first five games. He just keeps going and it's a real, real credit to him. He’s just in a state of grace right now. It’s beautiful to watch.” The same could be said for the Cavs, whose burst from the gate under Atkinson is one of the league's best stories. The 57-year-old Atkinson, an affable, fast-talking hoops junkie from Long Island, has made Cleveland an offensive powerhouse. The Cavs lead the league in virtually every statistical category — points, field-goal percentage, 3-point percentage, point differential and offensive rating. It's a system based on pace, ball movement and fundamentals and it's hard to defend. “A chaotic environment with standard principles,” Atkinson said. Atkinson is getting the best from Cleveland's core four of players — Mitchell, Darius Garland, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen — while also developing his bench, something predecessor J.B. Bickerstaff struggled to do. Jerome, who played on Virginia's national championship team in 2019, gives Atkinson a multi-skilled player capable on both ends of the floor. He's come off the bench to provide points or a key assist, and Atkinson deploys him defensively to pester point guards. “It's hard to take him out of the game,” Atkinson said. ""He’s in every conversation at all times. ‘Do we need Ty in there?’ He’s playing phenomenally.” Mitchell isn't surprised. He's goes way back with Jerome, playing with him on a Riverside (N.Y.) Hawks youth team coached by Jerome's dad. “His dad used to cuss us out at 8 years old,” Mitchell said with a smile. “I tell people all the time that I don’t like positive reinforcement. I think it’s just PTSD from my AAU days with his pops. Getting chewed out at 9 a.m. definitely is something that you don’t forget.” Mitchell also finds it funny that Jerome's comeback is getting such attention. “Y’all be saying that like he died and came back to life,” Mitchell said. ”For him to come back, not only be a solid player, but be dominant, be a special player for us, it kind of gives us life. He’s just done so much for us on a nightly basis, and I have no doubt he’ll continue to keep this up.” The Cavs figure to come back to the pack at some point. But a season that began with them considered a contender has turned into become something more. “17-1,” Atkinson said Sunday, reminded of his team's record. ""It's like, wow. I’ve been in his league 17 years and it just doesn’t happen. You should have six, seven losses. You could be .500 at this point. Even in a game like tonight, you lose these games. ""We’re not exactly on top of our game and we still come up with a ‘W.’ It’s pretty shocking where we are, and that’s not to disparage anybody. It’s more about how hard this league is to do that.” ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Haliburton's tiebreaking 3 with 3:06 to go and Bennedict Mathurin's alley-oop dunk off Haliburton's pass with a minute left finally secured the win. Myles Turner added 17 points, including seven straight during a fourth-quarter flurry that swung the momentum back to the Pacers.  Trey Murphy III led the Pelicans with 24 points, matching his season high. CJ McCollum added 23 points in his first action in nearly a month, and Elfrid Payton dished out a career high 21 assists — the most in an NBA game this season. The Pelicans have lost five straight, this one with WNBA star Caitlin Clark watching inside Gainbridge Fieldhouse to the delight of some girls dressed in Clark's Indiana Fever and Iowa jerseys. Pelicans: With four projected opening day starters sitting out because of injuries (Brandon Ingram, Herbert Jones, Dejounte Murray and Zion Williamson), it's hard to read much into Monday's result. McCollum's return could be a promising sign. Pacers: Indiana also has been less than full strength with Andrew Nembhard (knee) and Aaron Nesmith (ankle) out again. Still, it's used the first two games of a four-game home stand to pull within two games of .500. With the score tied at 104, Haliburton knocked down a 3, followed with a layup and then fed Mathurin for the dunk that brought the crowd to its feet. The Pelicans didn't recover from that flurry. Haliburton has scored 73 points in his last three games, his top scoring output over a three-game stretch this season. His previous high was 58.

Somebody is going to get injured or sick, guaranteed. How those stretches are handled can make or break a season. Orlando and San Antonio are finding a way right now. New Orleans and Philadelphia are among the teams that aren't. The Magic have gone 9-1 in their last 10 games, all without an injured Paolo Banchero — the team's best player and an All-Star last season. They are behind only Cleveland and Boston, another pair of teams that haven't let injury issues keep them from sizzling starts, in the Eastern Conference. The Spurs have gone 7-5 since Gregg Popovich had a stroke that left assistant coach Mitch Johnson serving as acting coach. Those two teams might be the best examples early on of how not to let adversity impede winning. “Mitch is really smart, great teammate in the coaches room,"" said Golden State coach Steve Kerr, a close friend of Popovich and someone who spent time with Johnson through USA Basketball in recent summers — including camps in Las Vegas before the 2023 World Cup and this year's Paris Olympics. ""He was a big part of all of our conversations pre- and post-practice. He’s a really good coach, good guy. I know Pop loves him and feels very strongly what a good coach he is."" It's showing. The last time the Spurs — who have also been without starting forward Jeremy Sochan in recent weeks and played a couple games without star center Victor Wembanyama — had a better record through 17 games was in the 2017-18 season. Johnson has done an impressive job of holding things together through a tough time. “You look across the league, there’s a lot of injuries and guys out, so it’s just something where you’re trying to prepare everybody and it’s the next man up,"" Johnson said. ""But it’s nice to see everybody embrace that, not only for themselves but for their teammates.” The Magic, predictably, went through a struggle phase after Banchero got hurt: They started 0-4 without him, losing those games by an average of 14.3 points. And then Franz Wagner — who should be headed to San Francisco for the All-Star Game — took an enormous leap forward, averaging 27.6 points in his last 11 games. “I think he’s found another level of confidence, and we need it,” Magic forward Jonathan Isaac said. “You know, obviously with Paolo going down, he’s stepped up and he recognizes what this team needs. We need him to be aggressive and just score the basketball. I think he’s just stepped into that role, and he’s been dominant, he’s been confident, and doing his thing.” The Magic have made playing without a star look easy. It's not. Take the Phoenix Suns — they're 8-1 with Kevin Durant, 1-6 without him. Durant is probable to return Tuesday night from a calf strain when the Suns take on the Los Angeles Lakers. Memphis is an example of weathering the storm: The Grizzlies went 5-3 in Ja Morant's eight-game absence that ended Monday night. The Pelicans aren't missing just one big name. They've been decimated by injuries: Dejounte Murray missed his 17th game Monday night with a broken left hand and three other Pelicans — Zion Williamson, CJ McCollum and Herb Jones — have all missed at least 12 games while being hurt. It's why New Orleans is 4-14, one of the worst starts in the league. “We're going to figure it out, and fight and claw like we normally do,” Pelicans forward Trey Murphy said. The 76ers say they'll do the same, but they've been missing plenty of their best fighters — with Joel Embiid, Tyrese Maxey, Paul George and Kyle Lowry among those all missing time because of injury. The result is a 3-13 start, the second-worst record in the NBA. The only silver lining for Philadelphia right now is that it's in the East, where only four teams have winning records right now.  “We're 16 games in. It's a long season,"" Maxey said. “Either we're going to lay down and let teams come in here and have field days against us, or we're going to go out there and play with some pride and go out there and win some games. “We get it,” he added. ""I got hurt. Jo got hurt. Kyle got hurt. P got hurt. Guys are in and out of the lineup. Yes, we understand that. That's not ideal. But all of us can do one thing every single night, 1 through 15, go out there, know the game plan and play extremely hard, every single night.” Such is the adversity part. The Spurs and Magic seem to have figured it out. The Pelicans and 76ers are among those still searching for answers.  ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

An assistant with the Blues from 2020-22, Montgomery is overjoyed to be back with St. Louis. “Crazy — there’s no other word for it,” the 55-year-old said less than a week after he was fired by the Boston Bruins and hired by St. Louis to replace Drew Bannister. “I have worked with over half this lineup already, and I know how committed they are. For me, this was a no-brainer for me to come back home."" The Blues — who missed the playoffs last season after Bannister took over for 2019 Stanley Cup-winning coach Craig Berube in December — have work to do. They started the season 9-12-1, only two teams have scored less than their 2.36 goals a game and they rank in the bottom third of the league on the power play and penalty kill. Montgomery guided the Bruins to a record-setting 65-win, 135-point season in 2022-23 and was named coach of the year. When he became available, Blues president and general manager Doug Armstrong pounced. “When you get a phone call and you hear Doug Armstrong’s plan and how you’re a big part of it, that makes you feel it is the right place to go,"" Montgomery said. “The best line that put his hooks into me is, ‘When something delicious falls on my plate, I eat.’ I don't know. I guess I was a T-bone that day."" Every NHL team Montgomery has coached for a full season has qualified for the playoffs, and his .659 points percentage ranks among the best in league history. “I believe in this group,"" Montgomery said. “It’s not easy to make the playoffs in this league. Half the teams miss it. But I do think that in time this is a caliber playoff team.” Blues players reacted positively to the coaching change. “He’s detailed and structured, but at the same time he lets guys play hockey,"" captain Brayden Schenn said. “He’s a guy you want to play hard for who has had success in this league.” Robert Thomas, a first-round draft pick by St. Louis in 2017 now in his seventh season with the Blues, said he was sorry to see Bannister go but happy the energetic Montgomery was back as head coach. “He was a huge help for me and someone I really relied on a couple of years ago,"" Thomas said. “He’s someone a lot of us have a ton of respect for. He's got a big personality.” The Bruins fired Montgomery last Tuesday after losing 12 of their first 20 games. Boston won 120 of 184 regular-season games with Montgomery behind the bench, though its playoff success was limited to a first-round series win over Toronto last spring. His first NHL coaching job, with the Dallas Stars, ended when was fired in December 2019 for unprofessional conduct. Armstrong hired Montgomery in September 2020 to serve on Berube's staff. Now he gave his new coach a fresh, five-year contract and the expectation of trying to help St. Louis get back into the league's elite tier. “He’s one of those coaches that I really do believe can be with this team now and as it grows,” Armstrong said Sunday. “The proof of that is the five-year commitment. One of the things I think is the next part for Jim’s career is to get that longevity in one spot.” Leaving the Bruins after success in Boston wasn't easy, but Montgomery said he immediately chose a positive mindset. “I’m a firm believer that when one door closes, another one opens if you do the right thing,"" he said. “It’s about your relationships in life. ... The five-year deal shows the commitment of Tom Stillman and the ownership group, that we are in this together.” ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
ABC News: Sports,Judge rejects request to sideline transgender college volleyball player,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/judge-rejects-request-sideline-san-jose-state-volleyball-116213995,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 20:49:52 -0500",The ruling comes in a suit filed by nine players challenging league policies.,"The ruling comes in a suit filed by nine players challenging league policies. A judge on Monday rejected a request to block a San Jose State women’s volleyball team member from playing in a conference tournament on grounds that she is transgender. The ruling by U.S. Magistrate Judge S. Kato Crews in Denver will allow the player, who has played all season, to compete in the Mountain West Conference women’s championship this week in Las Vegas.  The ruling comes in a lawsuit filed by nine current players against the conference challenging league policies for allowing transgender players to participate. The players argued that letting her compete poses a safety risk and is unfair. While some media have reported those and other details, neither San Jose State nor the forfeiting teams have confirmed the school has a trans woman volleyball player. The Associated Press is withholding the player’s name because she has not commented publicly on her gender identity. School officials also have declined an interview request with the player.  Crews' ruling referred to the athlete as an “alleged transgender” player and noted that no defendant disputed that the San Jose State roster includes a transgender woman player.  San Jose State will ""continue to support its student-athletes and reject discrimination in all forms,"" the university said in a statement, confirming all its student-athletes are eligible to participate under NCAA and conference rules. “We are gratified that the Court rejected an eleventh-hour attempt to change those rules. Our team looks forward to competing in the Mountain West volleyball tournament this week."" The conference said it was “satisfied” with the judge's decision and would continue upholding policies established by its board of directors, which “directly align with NCAA and USA Volleyball.”  “We are excited to proceed with the Mountain West Conference Women's Volleyball Championship,” its statement added. The players filed a notice for emergency appeal with the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Crews said the players could have sought relief much earlier, noting the individual universities had acknowledged that not playing their games against San Jose State this season would result in a loss in league standings. He refused a request to re-seed the tournament without the forfeited losses. The judge said injunctions are meant to preserve the status quo. The conference policy regarding forfeiting for refusing to play against a team with a transgender player had been in effect since 2022 and the San Jose State player has been on the roster since 2022 -– making that the status quo. The player competed at the college level three previous seasons, including two for San Jose State, drawing little attention. This season’s awareness of her reported identity led to an uproar among some players, parents and also politicians in a major election year. Crews' ruling also said injunctions are meant to prevent harm, but in this case, he argued, the harm has already occurred. The games have been forfeited, the tournament has been seeded and the participants have confirmed they're playing. The tournament starts Wednesday and continues Friday and Saturday. Colorado State is seeded first and San Jose State, second. The teams split their regular-season matches and both get byes into Friday's semifinals.  San Jose State will play the winner of Wednesday's match between Utah State and Boise State — teams that forfeited matches to SJSU during the regular season. Boise State associate athletic director Chris Kutz declined to comment on whether the Broncos would play SJSU if they won their first-round tournament game. Utah State associate athletic director Doug Hoffman said the university is reviewing the order and the team is preparing for Wednesday's match. The tournament winner gets an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. San Jose State coach Todd Kress, whose team hasn't competed in the national tournament since 2001, has said they've been getting “messages of hate” that have taken a toll on the players. Several teams refused to play against San Jose State this season, earning losses in the official conference standings. Boise State and Wyoming each had two forfeits while Utah State and Nevada both had one. Southern Utah, a member of the Western Athletic Conference, was the first to cancel against San Jose State this year. Nevada’s players stated they “refuse to participate in any match that advances injustice against female athletes,” without elaborating. Nevada didn't qualify for the conference tournament. The nine current players and others now suing the Mountain West Conference, the California State University Board of Trustees and others include San Jose State senior setter and co-captain Brooke Slusser. Slusser says the player is transgender and hits the volleyball with more force than other teammates, raising fear during practices of suffering concussions from a head hit, according to the complaint. The Independent Council on Women’s Sports is funding a separate lawsuit against the NCAA for allowing transgender women to compete in women’s sports. Both lawsuits claim the landmark 1972 federal antidiscrimination law known as Title IX prohibits transgender women in women’s sports. Title IX prohibits sexual discrimination in federally funded education; Slusser is a plaintiff in both lawsuits. Several circuit courts have used a U.S. Supreme Court ruling to conclude that discriminating against someone based on their transgender status or sexual orientation is sex-based discrimination, Crews wrote. That means case law does not prove the “likelihood of success” needed to grant an injunction. An NCAA policy that subjects transgender participation to the rules of sports governing bodies took effect this academic year. USA Volleyball says a trans woman must suppress testosterone for 12 months before competing. The NCAA has not flagged any issues with San Jose State. The Republican governors of Idaho, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming have made public statements in support of the team cancellations, citing fairness in women’s sports. President-elect Donald Trump likewise has spoken out against allowing transgender women to compete in women’s sports. Crews was a magistrate judge in Colorado’s U.S. District Court for several years before President Joe Biden appointed him as a federal judge in January. ___ Gruver reported from Cheyenne, Wyoming, and Hanson from Helena, Montana.  24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Jaxon Smith-Njigba had six catches for 77 yards and the first offensive touchdown against the Cardinals (6-5) in three weeks. But it was the defense that made the difference for the Seahawks (6-5) against their division rivals, who had their four-game winning streak snapped. “I thought he was dominant,” Seattle coach Mike Macdonald said of Williams. “I knew he played great and then I looked at the stat line and I realized he played out of his mind.” Williams finished with six tackles and four quarterback hurries for Seattle, which has beaten Arizona six straight times. The teams play again in two weeks. The Cardinals averaged more than 29 points per game in their previous three, but the Seahawks held them to 298 total yards and 49 yards rushing while sacking Murray five times. Williams said the team has been coming together since a leadership meeting following their bye week two weeks ago. He said the Seahawks declared the remainder of the season a playoff run and he woke up Sunday feeling positive about the team. “I think that made it just crunch time for us,” Williams said. “We just understood the urgency of getting the job done.” Geno Smith threw for 254 yards with a touchdown pass and an interception for Seattle. Murray threw for 285 yards, and tight end Trey McBride had 12 catches for 133 yards. Seattle led 7-3 midway through the third quarter when Arizona went for it on fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks 40. Murray was flushed right, then threw the ball over defender Devon Witherspoon and his own receiver into the arms of Bryant, who dashed to the end zone for a 13-3 lead. “I don’t think I’ve ever run that fast,” said Bryant, who finished the score with a dive into the end zone that resembled Marshawn Lynch's “Beast Mode” celebration. “I know I’m going to get fined, so hopefully Marshawn saw it.” Murray drove the Cardinals to the Seattle 4 early in the fourth quarter, but Arizona settled for a 22-yard field goal by Chad Ryland. Arizona had converted 16 straight touchdowns in goal-to-go situations coming into the game. Ryland missed a field goal with about 40 seconds remaining that would have set up an onside kick try. “Obviously, it's a hostile environment,” Murray said. “We just didn’t execute, did not execute at a high enough level to win that game.” Smith-Njigba set up his touchdown when he took a pass on a shallow cross and sprinted downfield for a 46-yard gain to the Arizona 4. He scored two plays later on a 3-yard pass from Smith to the right side of the end zone, with a clear-out by DK Metcalf, for a 7-3 halftime lead. It was the first touchdown allowed by the Cardinals' defense since the fourth quarter against Miami three weeks ago. Arizona's James Conner, who entered with 697 yards rushing, was held to 8 yards on seven carries. It was Seattle's best defensive performance of the season under first-year coach Macdonald, who had lost his previous four home games. “Coach was in his bag this week,” Witherspoon said. The Seahawks prepared this week while dealing with the effects of a storm that knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of residents and team facilities. Some fans were still without power as more rain began to fall Sunday. “We were happy for the hot shower, I’m not gonna lie,” Witherspoon said. “Boy, it felt so good.” Both teams had apparent touchdowns overturned. Late in the first quarter, Williams appeared to complete a strip-sack of Murray that Tyrice Knight recovered and returned for a touchdown. A review determined Murray's arm was moving forward when Williams hit him, making it an incomplete pass. Murray hit Michael Wilson for an apparent 7-yard TD midway through the second, but Paris Johnson Jr. was flagged for holding. Later in the drive, an apparent completion to Marvin Harrison Jr. in the left front corner of the end zone was overturned because officials determined that he only got one foot down. Arizona settled for a field goal on that drive. Cardinals: Murray received trainers’ attention after he appeared to injure his shoulder on a hard hit in the fourth quarter, but never left the game. … DL Roy Lopez was helped off the field late in the fourth quarter.

Bam Adebayo had 19 points and 11 rebounds, Tyler Herro had 18 points and 10 rebounds, Alec Burks scored 15 and Pelle Larsson added 14 for Miami. Kyrie Irving had 14 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter for Dallas, which had its four-game winning streak snapped. P.J. Washington scored 21, Naji Marshall had 20, Klay Thompson scored 15 and Dereck Lively II had 14 points and 13 rebounds for Dallas. The Mavericks played without Luka Doncic, still sidelined with a sprained right wrist. The Heat were without Terry Rozier, who was expected to play but wound up being scratched with a recurrence of right foot discomfort. Mavericks: Dallas has played 17 games this season — and 11 of them have been decided by eight points or less. The Mavericks are 4-7 in those close games, 5-1 in all others. Heat: Butler has scored at least 30 points in back-to-back games. It's the ninth time — including playoffs — that he's had a multi-game streak of scoring at least 30 since joining the Heat. Butler's dunk tied the game with 4.4 seconds left in regulation and the Heat unsuccessfully argued he was fouled by Lively on the play.

Jackson threw two touchdown passes and ran for a score, and Henry rushed for 140 yards as Baltimore beat Jim Harbaugh's Los Angeles Chargers 30-23 on Monday night. John Harbaugh improved to 3-0 in the Harbaugh Bowl. “It means a lot. With me being a big brother, I can’t lose to my little brother. That’s what I believe going into the game he was thinking about that a lot. We came out victorious today,” Jackson said. It was the first matchup between the Harbaughs since Super Bowl 47 in February 2013, when John's Ravens beat Jim's San Francisco 49ers. Jim Harbaugh returned to the NFL this year after nine seasons at Michigan, where he won a national title. The brothers shared a quick hug and handshake at midfield after the game. “I just told him, ‘You’re a great coach and you have a great team. And I love you.’ And he said, ‘I love you and congratulations.’ It was good,” John Harbaugh said. Justice Hill ran for a 51-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter to put it out reach for the Ravens (8-4), who have won three of four. Justin Herbert completed 21 of 36 for 218 yards ran for a 5-yard touchdown on a scramble up the middle on the Chargers' opening drive. The Chargers went 54 minutes between touchdowns. Gus Edwards went 1 yard off left guard to get them within 30-23 with 45 seconds remaining. Baltimore's Isaiah Likely recovered the ensuing onside kick. Cameron Dicker had three field goals as the Chargers (7-4) had their four-game winning streak snapped. “I thought we did a good job of limiting turnovers and keeping the ball. We’ve just got to score more points,” Herbert said. The Chargers had to rely more on Herbert and the passing game after running back J.K. Dobbins suffered a knee injury in the second quarter. Meanwhile, the Ravens finished with 212 yards rushing and outgained the Chargers 389 yards to 285. Henry didn’t score a touchdown for the first time this season but had a productive night with 24 carries. “They ran the ball real well. We need better block destruction just across the board, but you’ve got to give them credit. They did a heck of a job,” Jim Harbaugh said. The Ravens trailed 10-0 but scored on five straight drives to take control. They also converted three fourth downs, including a 2-yard gain by Mark Andrews on a direct snap late in the second quarter on fourth-and-1 at their own 16 on what ended up being the go-ahead drive.  “This is a big win for our guys. I’m proud of the way they came out and responded. We were down 10-0 and our guys stepped up,” John Harbaugh said. “They really didn’t flinch and kept fighting. They locked in on the details and played good, winning football.” Jackson, who leads the league in total yards, completed 16 of 22 passes for 177 yards. He also had 17 rushing yards, including a 10-yard keeper off right end early in the second quarter to get the Ravens within 10-7. Henry was held to 13 yards on three carries on the Ravens' first two drives, but got back in gear on the team's third possession with three carries for 44 yards. “It definitely added a spark, you know, got us some momentum on our side and be able to get in there and get in the end zone,” Henry said. “It just happened that we were able to get a drive together and finish a drive with points and get us going.” Five plays after Andrews' fourth-down conversion, Jackson threw a deep ball to Rashod Bateman, who made a contested catch in the end zone for a 40-yard touchdown, giving the Ravens a 14-10 advantage. “Just giving him an opportunity. I believe my receivers have great hands and he made a terrific catch,” Jackson said. Baltimore extended its lead to 23-16 when Andrews caught a 6-yard pass in the back of the end zone. The Ravens' 2-point conversion attempt was no good. Hill put Baltimore up by two scores midway through the fourth quarter with his run off right end on third-and-3. It was the third TD run of at least 51 yards at SoFi Stadium in a 24-hour period after Philadelphia's Saquon Barkley had scoring runs of 72 and 70 yards en route to a 255-yard rushing night against the Rams Sunday night. “I feel like some of my passes early were off and I was ticked off. But we have a great running back, offensive line and helped them get in the groove and we kept our foot on the gas,” Jackson said. Jackson improved to 7-2 in Monday night games, including 6-1 on the road. He has a 124.3 passer rating on Monday nights, the best in NFL history, with 22 touchdown passes and no interceptions. Ravens: LB Roquan Smith (hamstring), who leads Baltimore with 110 tackles, was inactive. Chargers: In addition to Dobbins, CB Eli Apple (hamstring) was injured in the first half and did not return.

It's too good of a game not to play,” said Dan Neil, a former Texas All-American offensive lineman who played in the rivalry from 1992-1996.  Neil called the breakup a “shame.” Former Texas quarterback Case McCoy, whose crazy-legs scramble set up the Longhorns' game-winning field goal in 2011, was more blunt about the lost years of a treasured rivalry. “I feel like it was stolen from the last generation of football players,” McCoy said. The split came amid a tumultuous period of conference realignment across the country that had Texas in the middle of it all. The Big 12 had already lost Colorado to the Pac-12 and Nebraska to the Big Ten. Texas had also flirted with joining the Pac-12 and taking longtime rival Oklahoma and other Big 12 schools with it. Texas A&M meanwhile, briefly looked eastward toward the SEC. The boat was still rocking a year later when Texas and ESPN effectively flipped it over with a 20-year, $300 million deal to launch the now-defunct Longhorn Network. Big 12 rivals bitterly complained the swaggering Longhorns were stomping over the rest of the league. The Aggies had enough. The two schools played in the same conference since 1915, but A&M saw a chance to strike out on its own. The SEC was the most powerful football conference in the country and promised more money and more respect and a big leap out of Texas' shadow. When Texas A&M informed the Big 12 it was leaving, then-President R. Bowen Loftin called it a “100-year decision” the school had addressed “carefully and methodically.” Years later, he described a simple desire to get away from Texas. “A&M had to do something, something bold and something that was really meant for A&M,” Loftin told the Houston Chronicle in 2021. “Something that did not necessarily link us in the future to that school in Austin.” The result ripped apart a deeply-rooted state tradition. The game was as much of a Thanksgiving staple as turkey, stuffing and pecan pie. “I went to Texas to play in the A&M game,” said McCoy, whose family has deep roots in the rivalry. His older brother Colt was one of the greatest quarterbacks in Longhorns' program history. “My dad was a (Texas) high school football coach. My grandparents, uncles, brother, everyone has a part,” of the rivalry, McCoy said. “If you were a kid growing up in Texas, it meant a lot.""  The Aggies left the Big 12 knowing a split could be coming, and said they told Texas they wanted to keep playing. Texas said its non-conference schedule was already full for several years. So as the Texas fight song says, “goodbye to A&M.” For spite or schedule, a tradition was about to be lost. “It was a travesty,” said former Texas running back Ricky Williams, who won the Heisman Trophy in 1998 and set the NCAA career rushing record against the Aggies. “I thought it was dumb to get rid of that game because to me that game is deeper, it’s more powerful than conferences,"" Williams said. The 2011 game before the breakup was an instant classic. In a tense, back-and-forth matchup in front of a frenzied crowd in College Station, McCoy's frantic, 25-yard scramble through the heart of the defense set up Justin Tucker's 40-yard field goal as time expired. Texas' 27-25 victory on the scoreboard hung over the stunned home crowd that was unsure if it would ever be avenged.  “It parted like the Red Sea,” McCoy said of the A&M defense. “Thank God we won that game ... I married into a family that, other than my wife, is all Aggies. I live it all the time.” There were passing mentions of resuming the rivalry over the years. Then in 2021, Texas and Oklahoma were officially invited to join the SEC.  Texas A&M, thinking it had permanently split from the Longhorns, was stunned. The loss in 2011 was like a kick in the teeth. Texas' move to the SEC was a gut punch. Texas was initially approved for entry in 2025, then it was moved up to this year. The Aggies at least get home-field advantage and a nighttime kickoff at raucous Kyle Field for the reunion.  “I’ll be there at the game and my kids and family will be there,” former Texas A&M All-American linebacker Dat Nguyen said. “I want them to experience it and absorb it because we don’t want to take it for granted. Because you never know. Hopefully, (a breakup) won’t happen again.” Former Texas A&M coach R.C. Slocum is ready for the reunion. He summed up what it should mean to the players who are part of it. “I always told our guys that in the tall buildings in Dallas and Fort Worth, and Houston and San Antonio, and in the deer blinds out in West Texas, this will be the most talked about subject this week,"" Slocum said. “And when you get older and for the rest of your life, people are gonna be talking about this game,"" he said. “So, you need to make it turn out the way that you will enjoy talking about it.” ___ Vertuno reported from Austin, Texas ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

ABC News: Sports,"Injured Joel Embiid, Paul George watch from the 76ers' bench once again",https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/injured-joel-embiid-paul-george-watch-76ers-bench-116187482,"Sun, 24 Nov 2024 22:18:15 -0500",All-Stars Paul George and Joel Embiid both missed Sunday's game against the Los Angeles Clippers with knee injuries,"All-Stars Paul George and Joel Embiid both missed Sunday's game against the Los Angeles Clippers with knee injuries PHILADELPHIA -- James Harden was about booed out of the arena each time he touched the ball, a sound of contempt not heard in Philly since — well, since Ben Simmons was razzed with much the same vocal voraciousness two nights earlier. The 76ers turned back the clock — “way back,” the public address announcer noted — wearing uniforms Sunday night designed to pay homage to their old home, the Spectrum. Their old players? Well, they hit Philly, too. Simmons, a former No. 1 pick once deemed a franchise cornerstone, returned Friday night with Brooklyn while Harden, now banging 3s with the Los Angeles Clippers, had his unceremonious homecoming Sunday night. Simmons and Harden each raised the promise of deep playoff runs — yes, even a championship — before their sensational starts with the Sixers disintegrated into toxic tenures full of ill will and, ultimately, a feeling of good riddance from all parties involved. Simmons and his shooting woes; Harden and his contract demands; no matter the symptoms for seasonal dysfunction through the years, the headache still pounds in Philadelphia. The malady these days: bad knees. Joel Embiid and Paul George, who signed $405 million worth of contracts in the offseason, remained pinned to the bench with knee injuries. George, a left knee bone bruise. Embiid, swelling in his left knee. Heck, even six-time All-Star Kyle Lowry (hip strain) sat out against the Clippers, left to watch the game wearing one of those goofy, oversized Philadelphia Eagles hats. “It’s certainly not ideal and not that easy to manage,” coach Nick Nurse said. “But it is part of the game. Guys come and go all the time. There’s guys in and out, both sides of the ball. Again, I’m always disappointed for the player.”  The public address announcer ran down the injury report — “Joel Embiid, Paul George and Kyle Lowry are out” — to a muted response from 76ers fans accustomed to sitting stars. If these walls could shrug. It’s easy for Sixers fans — and the front office — to wonder what could have been the franchise’s ceiling had Simmons or Harden stayed happy and healthy while they teamed with Embiid. George was just the latest star expected to help Embiid chase the 76ers’ first championship since 1983. Yet, the early returns have been dismal. George has played in just eight of 16 games; Embiid only four. Without them, the 76ers fell to 3-13 following a 125-99 loss to the Clippers.  Embiid, wearing an all-blue 76ers sweatshirt and sweatpants, shared a few quiet conversations with his teammates in the locker room. “Kept trying to keep his spirits high,” All-Star guard Tyrese Maxey said. “He loves basketball. He wants to play basketball every single day. If he could play all 82 games, every single game of the playoffs, I promise you, he would.” He doesn't, so Nurse, in his second season, does what he can and trotted out a starting lineup that included Kelly Oubre Jr. and Guerschon Yabusele in front of a crowd dotted with empty seats. The good news, Nurse said Embiid and George were both “progressing OK.” George, the nine-time All-Star, got in some work on the court on Saturday. Nurse said Embiid’s swelling was “looking better” ahead of more exams this week. Embiid’s season was a disaster since training camp. The 30-year-old Embiid skipped the entire preseason, was suspended for scuffling with a columnist, called out by teammates in a closed-door team meeting and has fallen out of favor with fans that have tired of his will-he-or-won’t-he-play melodrama. “As things go up and down, we’re all trying to keep things level,” Nurse said. “I think he has kept things pretty level. He’s been very communicative and seems to be OK. He understands that we’re trying to figure this out as we go here. He also understands the team’s not getting good results. So there is a lot to talk about.” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue was an assistant coach on the U.S. team that won gold in Paris and declined to enter the fray over Embiid's health at the Olympics. “I don’t know if he was supposed to be healthy or not,” Lue said. “He helped us win a gold medal, it’s all I know.” At least the Sixers announced Friday night that Embiid would miss the Clippers’ game, allowing fans to try and dump a pair of tickets on the secondary market for the price of a couple of coffeehouse chain drinks. Of note, rookie Jared McCain has about been worth the price of admission on those discount ducats. The Clippers, coming off a 4-0 homestand, played without Kawhi Leonard and other teams missing their All-Stars for reasons both fishy and fair are the norm around the league. The 76ers have no choice — much as they have since Embiid was drafted in 2014 — but to find a way around the absences. “Almost all the time,” Nurse said, “we need to try something.” ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
ABC News: Sports,Bo Nix sets Broncos rookie TD record as Denver beats reeling Raiders 29-19,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/bo-nix-sets-broncos-rookie-td-record-denver-116187089,"Sun, 24 Nov 2024 23:14:29 -0500","Bo Nix passed for 273 yards and had two touchdown passes to break the team&rsquo;s rookie record, and the Denver Broncos finally won in Las Vegas with a 29-19 victory over the reeling Raiders on Sunday","Bo Nix passed for 273 yards and had two touchdown passes to break the team’s rookie record, and the Denver Broncos finally won in Las Vegas with a 29-19 victory over the reeling Raiders on Sunday LAS VEGAS -- The music could clearly be heard outside the doors to the Broncos' locker room, the players inside truly enjoying finally getting to experience a victory in Las Vegas. Bo Nix passed for 273 yards and had two touchdown passes to break the team's rookie record Sunday, and Denver beat the reeling Raiders 29-19. The Broncos (7-5) took another step toward an unexpected playoff spot with their second victory in a row. “A year ago, we don't win that game,” Broncos coach Sean Payton said. “It wasn't our best, but it was good enough. We're on to the next one, so we have a lot to clean up, but it was good to handle these guys for a second time.” The Broncos won the first meeting 34-18 in Denver on Oct. 6 to end an eight-game losing streak to the Raiders. Las Vegas (2-9) has lost seven consecutive games, its longest skid since the 2017-18 seasons. “I never doubt the mindset of everybody in that locker room,” Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby said. “Everybody shows up every day with the mindset to get better, so that's all you can ask for.” Nix finished 25 of 42, and his 18-yard touchdown pass to Courtland Sutton in the third quarter broke the club rookie record of 14 TD passes set by Marlin Briscoe in 1968. Nix and Sutton later hooked up for a 2-yard TD with 5:30 left to give the Broncos a two-possession lead. Those plays helped erase a 13-9 halftime deficit. The Broncos outscored Las Vegas 20-6 in the second half after adjusting to the Raiders' willingness to repeatedly bring more pressure than anticipated. “We had to shift that mindset,” Nix said. “We went into the game expecting (some). We had some calls for it, so now we had to get to those and adjust to them. I thought we did a good job handling the pressure, getting some more 1-on-1s.” Denver lost its previous four games at Allegiant Stadium. This also was the Broncos' first road win in this series since defeating the then-Oakland Raiders on Oct. 11, 2015. “I think the tide is turning,” Sutton said. “The Broncos are in a spot where we want to be back in the AFC West, and I think that's a really exciting spot to be in. Job's not finished.” Sutton caught eight passes for 97 yards and two touchdowns to extend his streak of 70-yard games to five. That's the longest streak by a Broncos player since Demaryius Thomas' eight straight in 2014. Raiders quarterback Gardner Minshew landed hard on his left shoulder late in the game and was replaced by Desmond Ridder. Minshew will miss the rest of the season with a broken collarbone, according to multiple reports. Minshew completed 25 of 42 passes for 230 yards, with a touchdown and interception. The best passing play, however, came on a fake punt when AJ Cole completed a 34-yard pass to linebacker Divine Deablo to set up a second-quarter field goal. That was one of four field goals by Daniel Carlson, whose duel with Broncos counterpart Will Lutz kept Las Vegas in the game. They combined to make all nine of their attempts, including three from more than 50 yards. Jakobi Meyers caught 10 passes for 121 yards. That’s his best game since 2020, when Meyers played for the New England Patriots and caught 12 passes for 169 yards against the New York Jets. Crosby recorded his 100th tackle for loss in the second quarter, becoming the fourth player to reach that number since at least 1999 in his first six seasons. The others were J.J. Watt, Aaron Donald and DeMarcus Ware. The Raiders are a shell of themselves. They played this game without their top two running backs as well as two starters at cornerback, two on the defensive line and one at safety. “Credit Vegas,” Payton said. “They came out and had some fire about them, but they lost.” Raiders special teams coordinator Tom McMahon did not coach, but no reason was provided. Derius Swinton II handled those duties. Broncos: CB Riley Moss (knee) left the game late in the first half. DE Zach Allen (heel) didn't play. Raiders: RBs Alexander Mattison (ankle) and Zamir White (quadriceps) and CBs Nate Hobbs (ankle) and Jakorian Bennett (shoulder) did not play. Broncos: Host Cleveland on Monday, Dec. 2.

Jaden Hardy had a season-high 23 points in his first start of the season for Dallas, which has won five of six. Naji Marshall and Spencer Dinwiddie had 22 points each.

However, when you're coaching against your younger brother on the opposing sideline, sometimes you have to be aggressive and go all in. In the case of John Harbaugh and the Baltimore Ravens, it ended up paying off big time. Mark Andrews' 2-yard gain on a quarterback sneak not only allowed the Ravens to continue their drive, it ended up later turning into a touchdown that gave them the lead against the Los Angeles Chargers on Monday night. It also was the turning point in the Ravens' 30-23 victory that allowed John to remain unbeaten in three meetings against younger brother, Jim Harbaugh. “The downside is you give them the ball at the 16-yard line. That’s the downside. But the upside, or the thought, is I really thought we could get it,” John Harbaugh said. ""It led to a 93-yard drive and got us seven points; that was a big turning point in the game.”  Five plays after Andrews’ sneak, Jackson connected with Rashod Bateman on a contested catch for a 40-yard touchdown to give the Ravens a 14-10 lead with 24 seconds remaining in the first half. “I think it was just discussions of what we were going to do, and I think the decision came down to just believing in the guys to go for a big fourth down,"" Andrews said. ""It was a great play. There was a lot of great plays made on critical downs like that, and it’s a credit to the guys.” John Harbaugh admitted after the game that playing his brother did factor into the decision. “I’m not saying we’ll go for it all of the time either, but the overriding thing was who we were playing and the idea that you just have to try to hang on to possessions as long as you can, because they’re so good,"" he said. The Ravens ended up converting the three times they went for it on fourth down. The other two came during a nearly seven-minute drive late in the third quarter and early in the fourth where Andrews caught a 6-yard pass in the back of the end zone to extend the Ravens' lead to 23-16. The brothers shared a quick hug and handshake at midfield after the game. They also hugged at midfield and talked for a couple minutes during pregame warmups. It was the first time since Super Bowl 47 in 2013 that the Harbaugh brothers faced off as NFL coaches. The Ravens beat the San Francisco 49ers 34-31 in New Orleans. The other regular-season game was a 16-6 Ravens victory over the Niners on Thanksgiving night in 2011.  Jim Harbaugh left San Francisco after the 2014 season to take over at his alma mater, the University of Michigan. Harbaugh coached at Michigan for nine seasons and won the national title last season before being hired by the Chargers. “It’s just cool to be at this level, to be at the highest level in these competitive environments,” Jim Harbaugh said. “I congratulated him on the victory, and then, love you.” Players on both teams last week tried to downplay the hype surrounding the Harbaugh Bowl, but the Ravens were reveling in the victory when it was over. “I just know our Harbaugh is 3-0,” said linebacker Kyle Van Noy, who played for the Chargers in 2022. John Harbaugh after the game also noted trying not to get caught up in the hype, while trying to reiterate that the game was determined by the players. “It’s an amazing thing to look back to where we are from where we came. We had different paths. We grew up in the same room and have always lived our life side by side, but that’s not what the game is about,” he said. ""The game really is about the players, and the players are always going to win the game or lose the game or whatever. I have so much respect for the players. Jim is the same way. We both try to treat our players with great respect, admiration and love, because that’s how we feel about them.”  Their parents, Jack and Jackie Harbaugh, celebrated their 63rd wedding anniversary on Monday. They attended the first two games between the brothers, but are spending Thanksgiving week in Bradenton, Florida, at their daughter Joanie’s house. “I called and wished them happy wedding anniversary. I know Jim did the same. Jim and I texted back and forth before the game a little bit,” John said. ""When you’re blessed enough to have parents who get along so well, love each other and are married for 63 years it gives you a good idea how it is supposed to work. “It’s tough. They’re 100% happy and 100% disappointed at the same time. If you can imagine that, that’s how they feel right now.” ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

She also gave him $200 to get a lesson. The lesson wasn't anything he didn't already know, it was more symbolic of being dedicated. Three years later, Dahmen had his card. “This is my eighth year out here,"" he said. “I probably made it longer than I ever thought.” And that's what can make keeping a PGA Tour card even more stressful. Dahmen knows that feeling, too. He was living it. Dahmen was a 5-foot par putt away from missing the cut at Sea Island and making it virtually certain he would fall out of the top 125 in the FedEx Cup, losing a full PGA Tour card at a time when opportunities are about to shrink. His voice choked with emotion talking about the putt that kept alive his hopes. The pressure he felt was never more evident. “It's like you're sleeping on the lead of a major every night ... but a little more stressful than that,"" Dahmen said. So imagine the relief when Dahmen, projected outside the top 125 when he teed off in the final round of the RSM Classic, holed out a sand wedge from 113 yards for eagle, rolled in birdie putts and then held on for three nervy pars and a 64 to lock up his job. He came into the week at No. 124. He finished at No. 124. It was a lot more complicated, and far more stressful, than numbers on a points list. Dahmen long ago nearly lost his card. His first year on the PGA Tour in 2017, he had to face four weeks of Web.com Tour Finals, and his tie for sixth in the penultimate event was enough to get the 49th out of 50 cards offered that year. But it was different then because he didn't really know what he was missing. And he didn't want to lose that. That's what made Sunday so special. He shared tears with Lona and beers with his buddies on tour. “You take it for granted a little bit,” he said. ""It’s been relatively easy, cruise between 50 and 90 on the FedEx Cup every year and enjoy it, and our best friends are out here. We all have kids now and it is one of the coolest things. We get to go to like camp every week out here 25 weeks a year. We rent houses together, we stay together, our kids are playing together, they’re all the same age. I didn’t want to miss out on that. “As much as playing golf for a living is really cool and making a bunch of money is really cool, this has been our life,” he said. ""So I thought a lot about not being able to do that as much, and that would stink.” Dahmen has endeared himself to the golf world for being more everyman than journeyman, and he has become a popular figure on the Netflix “Full Swing” docuseries. But the struggle was real this year, never more so than the final two days. He took a double bogey on his 16th hole Saturday, wasting a solid round and leaving him outside the top 125. He described the mood that night as somber, “funeral effect.” Driving to get his son Riggs, who turns 2 in January, Dahmen wondered if he'd still be getting him from tour daycare next year. But he showed something to himself, perhaps even more than when he won his only PGA Tour title in the Dominican Republic in 2021. In his two biggest rounds of the year — Friday on a cold, vicious wind to make the cut and Sunday to keep his card — he delivered. He kept preaching on Friday when he made that 5-footer that the job was not finished. He had two more days to stay in the top 125. It's a good reminder going forward. Because while his 64 on Sunday was money in so many ways, now the hard part begins. The big changes to the PGA Tour next year mean only the top 100 keep a full card, down from the top 125. The field sizes will be smaller. Getting to the PGA Tour is still hard. Staying there figures to be harder than ever. “Do I get a year at 125 or do I go to 100 next year? It goes to 100 next year? Are we confirmed on that?” Dahmen said. “I thought I had another year of freedom.” He was joking. Vintage Dahmen. But his thoughts soon turned to next season — seven weeks away — at the Sony Open. Celebrate this now. He earned it. And then try to make more putts because he'll need them to avoid missing out — on the beer with Mark Hubbard, the congratulations from J.T. Poston waiting behind the last green, on that drive to get Riggs from daycare, on a PGA Tour that feels very much like a village he doesn't want to leave. “Two of the biggest pressure moments of my career I show up, and I can take that going forward,” he said. “Might as well start at Sony.” ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

For some teams (hello, Philadelphia!), that’s a Super Bowl win. For some teams, it’s a new quarterback. For some teams, it might be sticking with the same quarterback. We’re also trying to be thankful for such an interesting season while trying to keep our sanity sorting out this league’s muddled middle. Advertisement Last week: 1 Sunday: Beat Indianapolis Colts 24-6 Best-case scenario: Statues The Lions last won a championship in 1957. It was not the Super Bowl because that was still a decade away from being invented. This team absolutely can break that drought. Detroit leads the league in scoring (32.7 ppg) and point differential (plus-177) and is second in points allowed (16.6) after dismissing the Colts. Barry Sanders’ statue outside of Ford Field is eight feet tall. How tall would Dan Campbell’s be?

Barkley rushed for a franchise-record 255 yards and took over the league rushing lead with 1,392 for the season. He outgained the Rams by himself (302-290). The Eagles haven’t lost with A.J. Brown in the lineup and haven’t lost at all since September. Up next: at Baltimore Ravens, Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET Saquon Barkley recorded 26 carries for 255 yards and 2 touchdowns, resulting in the 2nd-most rushing yards over expected by a player in a single game since 2018 (+150). Barkley reached 21+ mph on two touches in the 2nd half and has now reached 21+ mph 6 times as a ball carrier… pic.twitter.com/pBpC3OunOC — Next Gen Stats (@NextGenStats) November 25, 2024  Last week: 2 Sunday: Bye Best-case scenario: Super Bowl Buffalo has the second-best point differential in the league (plus-106) behind only Detroit. It also has Josh Allen, who has become the betting favorite to win MVP at most sportsbooks. Buffalo’s goal right now should be taking playoff home-field advantage away from the Chiefs. The Bills already own the tiebreaker thanks to their Week 11 win, and they have the 16th-toughest remaining schedule, according to The Athletic’s projections. Up next: vs. San Francisco 49ers, Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET  Last week: 3 Sunday: Beat Carolina Panthers 30-27 Best-case scenario: History The Chiefs can become the first team in NFL history to win three straight Super Bowls. The Green Bay Packers won three straight titles from 1966 to 1968, but only two of those were Super Bowls because that game didn’t start until 1967. Kansas City fans might not survive the road to the three-peat at this point. After beating Carolina on a walk-off field goal, Kansas City has gotten half its wins on the final snap of the game. Up next: vs. Las Vegas Raiders, Friday, 3 p.m. ET Last week: 6 Sunday: Beat San Francisco 49ers 38-10 Best-case scenario: Super Bowl Green Bay announced itself as a legitimate NFC contender Sunday by demolishing the reigning conference champions. If Jordan Love can be efficient (two touchdowns and a 107.7 passer rating against the 49ers) and Josh Jacobs keeps running like this, the Packers can be a threat to the Lions in the playoffs. Jacobs, who had 106 yards Sunday, is third in rushing yards (944) and has the sixth-best avoided tackle rate among backs with more than 150 carries, according to FTN Fantasy. Up next: vs. Miami Dolphins, Thursday, 8:20 p.m. ET GO DEEPER Packers' free-agent tandem of Josh Jacobs, Xavier McKinney fuels blowout of 49ers Last week: 7 Sunday: Beat Chicago Bears 30-27 Best-case scenario: NFC Championship Game The Vikings had a 300-yard passer, two 100-yard receivers and a 100-yard rusher in the same game for the first time since the 2000 season, and Justin Jefferson was not part of that. Sam Darnold got the passing yards. Jordan Addison and T.J. Hockenson got the receiving yards and Aaron Jones got the rushing yards. Darnold’s 330 passing yards were the fifth-most of his career, but his lack of playoff experience makes it hard to pick this team as a Super Bowl contender. Up next: vs. Arizona Cardinals, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET Advertisement Last week: 8 Monday: Beat Los Angeles Chargers 30-23 Best-case scenario: Super Bowl After a one-week slump against the Steelers, Baltimore put 30 points on the league’s best scoring defense, and that’s why this team is still a frontline Super Bowl contender despite its warts — which include being the most penalized team in the league (97) and being 29th in the league in defensive EPA against the pass (minus-.14). Derrick Henry had 140 more rushing yards Monday and now has 1,325 on the season, second only to Saquon Barkley. Up next: vs. Philadelphia Eagles, Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET Last week: 4 Thursday: Lost to Cleveland Browns 24-19 Best-case scenario: AFC Championship Game Mike Tomlin hasn’t won a playoff game since the 2016 season, so ending that drought is the first order of postseason business. This team has a higher ceiling than that, though. The Steelers defense, better known as T.J. Watt and Friends, is fourth in points allowed (16.9) and top 10 in yards per play allowed (5.2), defensive success rate (60.9 percent) and EPA (9.0 per 100 snaps). The offensive limitations (23rd in yards per play, 5.0) put a ceiling on things. Up next: at Cincinnati Bengals, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET Last week: 9 Monday: Lost to Baltimore Ravens 30-23 Best-case scenario: AFC Championship Game The Chargers didn’t allow an opponent to top 20 points in the first 10 weeks of the season. Cincinnati and Baltimore have each gone over 26 in the last two weeks. They still lead the league in scoring defense (15.9 ppg allowed), but they still have something to prove against elite offenses if they want to be a real contender. The Ravens rushed for 214 yards Monday night, and the Chargers had only 70. Up next: at Atlanta Falcons, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET Advertisement Last week: 11 Sunday: Beat Las Vegas Raiders 29-19 Best-case scenario: Playoffs The Broncos have beaten only one team that currently has a winning record (the Falcons in Week 11,) but they’ve done enough to earn the seventh playoff spot in the AFC for now. In the last three weeks, rookie quarterback Bo Nix is second in passer rating (118.6), third in EPA per dropback (.32) and has thrown eight touchdowns versus no interceptions. In that same time frame, Courtland Sutton is fourth in catches (21) and fifth in receiving yards (245). Up next: vs. Cleveland Browns, Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET GO DEEPER Bo Nix, Courtland Sutton and a budding bromance steering Broncos toward playoffs Last week: 10 Sunday: Lost to Dallas Cowboys 34-26 Best-case scenario: Playoffs Washington has lost three straight and four of its last seven with the three wins coming over the Panthers, Bears and Giants. The Commanders, whose only win over a team with a winning record came in Week 4 against Arizona, are now three games back in the loss column in the NFC East. Jayden Daniels was shaky again Sunday, throwing multiple interceptions (two) for the first time in his career, and Washington’s top running backs on the day — Austin Ekeler and Jeremy McNichols — had 22 yards. Up next: vs. Tennessee Titans, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET Last week: 14 Sunday: Beat Arizona Cardinals 16-6 Best-case scenario: Playoffs Despite losing five of six games at one point this season, Seattle now essentially leads the NFC West because it owns the tiebreaker against the Cardinals. The Seahawks were outgained by Arizona and rushed for only 65 yards. Newly acquired linebacker and former Ram Ernest Jones has helped transform the Seattle defense, but it’s not enough to give this team a lot of playoff potential. Up next: at New York Jets, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET GO DEEPER The Seahawks are finally playing contender-level defense. When will the offense catch up? Last week: 12 Sunday: Lost to Tennessee Titans 32-27 Best-case scenario: Playoffs There was a time this team seemed like a conference title contender, but that time feels further and further away. Titans quarterback Will Levis outplayed Houston quarterback C.J. Stroud on Sunday, and Stroud is 32nd in passer rating (70.3) and 30th in EPA per dropback (minus-.09) in the last month. For the season, Stroud has been sacked 39 times, more than any quarterback other than Caleb Williams. That’s not a recipe for playoff success even if they do make it. Up next: at Jacksonville Jaguars, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET Advertisement Last week: 13 Sunday: Lost to Seattle Seahawks 16-6 Best-case scenario: Winning NFC West The Cardinals still own a piece of the NFC West lead even after losing to the Seahawks on Sunday, but with Minnesota and then Seattle again in the next two weeks, that position will be tested. Especially if Arizona doesn’t get its run game going. The Cardinals are 10th in the league in rushing EPA and sixth in rush yards (1,543), but they gained only 49 yards on 14 carries against the Seahawks. Up next: at Minnesota Vikings, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET Last week: 17 Sunday: Bye Best-case scenario: Playoffs Atlanta leads Tampa Bay by one game in the NFC South and owns the head-to-head tiebreaker against the Buccaneers. That means the Falcons are still in pretty good shape to make the playoffs despite losing two straight and three of their last five, but a defense that ranks 25th in points allowed (24.9) and last in sacks (10) means the ceiling for this team is low. Up next: vs. Los Angeles Chargers, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET Last week: 18 Sunday: Beat New York Giants 30-7 Best-case scenario: Winning NFC South Mike Evans returned Sunday, and Tampa Bay snapped a four-game losing streak. The Buccaneers play only one more team with a winning record (the Chargers) while the Falcons, who are one spot ahead of them in the division, play three. Tampa Bay gained 450 yards, including 156 on the ground, against the reeling Giants. Up next: at Carolina Panthers, Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET Last week: 20 Sunday: Bye Best-case scenario: One playoff win Yes, this would take quite a run, but the Bengals are capable of quite a run because they have Joe Burrow and one of the easiest remaining schedules in the league. Burrow is second in passing yards (3,028) and sixth in EPA per dropback (.16), and Cincinnati has the 25th-toughest remaining schedule. The Bengals are the favorites in each of their next five games, according to The Athletic’s projections. As for doing any damage in the postseason, this defense is not good enough to expect multiple playoff wins. Up next: vs. Pittsburgh Steelers, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET Advertisement Last week: 21 Sunday: Beat New England Patriots 34-15 Best-case scenario: Playoffs Miami is still alive despite starting the season 2-6, and Tua Tagovailoa gets the credit. The Dolphins quarterback missed Weeks 3-7 because of another concussion, but since Week 9, he has 10 touchdowns and one interception and leads the league in EPA per dropback (.36) and completion percentage (77.3). “The guy is Magic Johnson,” Jason Garrett said on “Sunday Night Football.” “When you take this guy out of the lineup, no one can replace him. He’s playing as well as anyone in the league right now.” Sunday was Miami’s third straight win. Up next: at Green Bay Packers, Thursday, 8:20 p.m. ET Last week: 15 Sunday: Lost to Philadelphia Eagles 37-20 Best-case scenario: Playoffs The NFC West standings make it impossible to rule out anyone in the division, but Sunday proved this team doesn’t have a lot of potential against the NFC powers. Matthew Stafford was sacked four times and hit another 11 against the Eagles. Puka Nacua had nine catches for 117 yards, but Los Angeles lost for the second time in the last three games. Up next: at New Orleans Saints, Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET HAVE A NIGHT, MILTON WILLIAMS!@miltonw_12 | #FlyEaglesFly pic.twitter.com/TEU0fhbTRw — Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) November 25, 2024  Last week: 16 Sunday: Lost to Green Bay Packers 38-10 Best-case scenario: Playoffs The boost provided by Christian McCaffrey’s return didn’t last long. San Francisco won its first game with McCaffrey back in the lineup but has now lost two straight. McCaffrey has averaged only 3.5 yards per carry since his return, including 2.8 Sunday against the Packers. Brock Purdy missed the game with a shoulder injury. As long as he’s back soon, we can’t count out the 49ers yet because they’re only one game back in the division. Up next: at Buffalo Bills, Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET GO DEEPER 49ers fall apart in blowout loss to Packers: ‘The worst I’ve been a part of' Last week: 19 Sunday: Lost to Detroit Lions 24-6 Best-case scenario: Developing Anthony Richardson The Colts aren’t out of the playoff picture, but this season won’t be remembered for making the postseason or not. It will be remembered as the year their second-year quarterback either worked or didn’t. Richardson was 11-of-28 passing for 172 yards and led Indianapolis with 61 rushing yards against the Lions. Indianapolis should think about protecting him better. He was 3 of 13 when pressured, according to TruMedia. Up next: at New England Patriots, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET Advertisement Last week: 23 Sunday: Lost to Minnesota Vikings 30-27 Best-case scenario: Protecting Caleb Williams The Bears lost their fifth straight game Sunday, but the rookie quarterback is showing development, which is all this season is about. Williams was 32 of 47 for 340 yards and two touchdowns against Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores, which is a feather in any quarterback’s cap. Flores’ defense gave up an EPA per dropback of .04 in Weeks 1-11. Williams posted a .16. Up next: at Detroit Lions, Thursday, 12:30 p.m. ET Last week: 26 Sunday: Beat Washington Commanders 34-26 Best-case scenario: Not getting fooled The Cowboys have a less than one percent chance of making the playoffs, according to The Athletic’s model, and a wacky win over an old rival shouldn’t convince this team it’s in decent shape. Dallas is 29th in scoring margin (minus-98) and 31st in points allowed (29 ppg). The good news is KaVontae Turpin is fun to watch. He leads the league with 906 return yards, including an electric 99-yard kickoff return Sunday.

However, winning a lot more games may not be in New Orleans’ best interests. The Saints, who are a projected $62 million over the 2025 salary cap, need to be stocking up on young talent. They’re probably already out of the No. 1 pick conversation, but the higher this team picks in April the better. Up next: vs. Los Angeles Rams, Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET GO DEEPER Are the Giants less ‘clown show’ than the Jets? It’s getting harder to tell: Sando’s Pick Six Last week: 30 Thursday: Beat Pittsburgh Steelers 24-19 Best-case scenario: A time machine This season is over, and the most likely outcome for 2025 is that Deshaun Watson (and his $72.9 million cap hit) will be starting at quarterback. The Browns could be stuck with Watson for a couple more years, so the best-case scenario (remember, we’re not doing most-realistic scenarios here) is for Watson to return somewhere near his Houston form. Up next: at Denver Broncos, Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET Advertisement Last week: 31 Sunday: Beat Houston Texans 32-27 Best-case scenario: Building some confidence There’s a lone Titans fan out there screaming that this team still has four games left against AFC South teams, including two against the Jaguars, and could still get into the division race, but let’s be serious here. Will Levis outplayed C.J. Stroud on Sunday (123.3 passer rating to 78.7), and that might be something first-year head coach Brian Callahan can build on down the stretch. Up next: at Washington Commanders, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET Last week: 22 Sunday: Lost to Miami Dolphins 34-15 Best-case scenario: Keeping Drake Maye healthy New England’s rookie quarterback is the team’s only real bright spot this season, but he’s taking some punishment. Maye is fourth in the league in sacks taken (19) and hits taken (39) since taking over as the starter in Week 6, according to TruMedia. He leads the league in scrambles (28) and has 274 rushing yards, which is second among quarterbacks, in that same stretch. Up next: vs. Indianapolis Colts, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET Last week: 27 Sunday: Lost to Kansas City Chiefs 30-27 Best-case scenario: That Bryce Young is the answer Carolina had given up on its second-year quarterback six weeks ago, but since being thrust back into the starting role because of an injury to Andy Dalton, Young has been better. He passed for 263 yards and no interceptions against Steve Spagnuolo’s defense Sunday. Buffalo and Cincinnati are the only other teams to score more than 24 points this year against the Chiefs. The offseason decision about Young will be interesting. Up next: vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET Bryce Young’s numbers today aren’t going to blow anyone away, but his performance against a very good Chiefs defense does speak to the argument for letting young players develop and grow before making an ultimate judgement on them. — JJ Watt (@JJWatt) November 24, 2024  Last week: 25 Sunday: Bye Best-case scenario: A fresh start Aaron Rodgers is 26th in EPA per dropback (minus-.02). His passer rating (88.9) and yards per attempt (6.4) are his lowest in any full season. And still there’s the thought he might come back in 2025. Nobody needs that, particularly the new head coach, whoever he may be. The 2025 quarterback draft class is a tricky one and the looming free-agent list at the position doesn’t provide any obvious answers, either, but anything is better than this Jets season. Up next: vs. Seattle Seahawks, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET Advertisement Last week: 29 Sunday: Lost to Denver Broncos 29-19 Best-case scenario: The No. 1 draft pick If the season ended today, Las Vegas would pick No. 3, but the Raiders are closing in on the top spot fast. Las Vegas lost its seventh straight Sunday and lost starting quarterback Gardner Minshew for the season. This isn’t the draft to be in the quarterback market, according to most experts, but having the first shot to draft one still is the best option for the Raiders. Up next: at Kansas City Chiefs, Friday, 3 p.m. ET GO DEEPER Raiders were a mess at QB before Gardner Minshew's injury and need a fix this offseason Last week: 32 Sunday: Bye Best-case scenario: Bill Belichick Hiring the third-winningest coach in league history would immediately give Jacksonville relevance. Pairing Belichick with Colorado’s Travis Hunter, whom the Jaguars could select at No. 1 if they continue their current ways, would make for one of the most interesting player-coach dynamics in the league. Hunter might be as versatile in the league as was his current college head coach (Deion Sanders), and Belichick could figure out fascinating ways to deploy him. Up next: vs. Houston Texans, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET Last week: 28 Sunday: Lost to Tampa Bay Buccaneers 30-7 Best-case scenario: This season ending Malik Nabers called out the play calling Sunday. Dexter Lawrence definitely called out his team’s toughness. And the Giants lost their sixth straight while former Giant Saquon Barkley continued his MVP-caliber season. The Giants, who were outgained by 205 yards Sunday, already have cut one-time franchise quarterback Daniel Jones. Coach Brian Daboll and general manager Joe Schoen may be next.

NYT > Sports,Predicting the College Football Playoff After a Week Full of Upsets,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5915596/2024/11/12/college-football-playoff-rankings-predictions-indiana/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 17:28:20 +0000",Losses by Georgia and Miami are expected to create movement in the rankings.,"NCAAF Two top-five teams lost just days after the first College Football Playoff rankings of the 2024 season were released, so there should be a Top 25 shake-up by the selection committee with the second rankings on Tuesday night. Just how much they change after Georgia and Miami lost is the question. My College Football Playoff projections model predicts what the committee is likely to do with its rankings each week. Last week, my projected rankings had 24 of the top 25 teams (the only non-ranked team was Missouri, which I had 26th), so it did a pretty good job of identifying the Top 25. What about precision? The model predicted all of the top 17 teams’ rankings within two spots. The first big miss came when it projected Clemson and Army at 18th and 19th, respectively, while the committee had them at 23rd and 25th. Overall, 22 of the 25 teams were within two spots, 16 were within one spot and nine were exactly right, including seven of the top 12. GO DEEPER College Football Playoff 2024 projections: Will Miami, Georgia make it after losses? This is a new week and a new test, as teams are going to be moving around a bunch at the top. So let’s take another stab at projecting what the committee will do with the rankings. Next five: Arizona State, Pitt, Tulane, UNLV, Illinois Indiana is fresh off a victory over Michigan, easily one of its best wins of the season but also its closest. For the first time in 10 games, the Hoosiers won by single digits, hanging on to win 20-15 despite having just 18 yards of total offense in the second half. Indiana has already crashed the AP top five for the first time since 1967. It is 10-0 for the first time ever and will be in the mix for a top-five ranking Tuesday after it was eighth in last week’s CFP rankings. The reason it’s not a surefire top-five team is because its strength of schedule, in my projections, ranks 81st. How much will that matter?  GO DEEPER Why No. 8 Indiana is the 12-team College Football Playoff's ultimate test case The Hoosiers’ Playoff positioning will ultimately be determined by how they perform against Ohio State in Columbus on Nov. 23 after they’re idle this week. If that’s a competitive game, you can almost guarantee the Hoosiers a spot in the CFP. But if it’s a blowout, some think they don’t have the resume to deserve or guarantee an at-large bid. And while I won’t defend their schedule strength, I don’t think enough attention is brought to some other CFP contenders. Advertisement According to my projections, Texas has played the 80th toughest schedule and Tennessee the 70th. Now, there are some differences across strength of schedule metrics from various sources, but Tennessee’s best win is Alabama and its second best win is arguably Kentucky (and it lost to Arkansas). Texas’ best win is probably Vanderbilt or Michigan. Indiana will likely finish the season with the easiest schedule among the contenders, but I don’t think it’s as egregious as some have been making it out to be. A good performance against Ohio State should give the Hoosiers not only a Playoff bid, but an opportunity to host a game in the first round. GO DEEPER Indiana edges Michigan to reach 10 wins, likely Playoff and wants more: What is this world? The bracket below is based on the projected selection committee rankings for Nov. 11.

In a three-minute video posted to X, Bissonnette said the altercation took place inside and outside of Houston’s restaurant after he observed a group of guests cause issues with the restaurant manager. The 39-year-old Bissonnette said he is a regular diner at the establishment and attempted to intervene after a member of the group laid his hands on the manager. Advertisement “You could tell he was a little shocked and surprised and stunned,” said Bissonnette. “It’s a family restaurant. I don’t think there was anybody in there who could go maybe like help him out. I went over, I just grabbed the guy’s arm that was on him. I said, ‘Sir, if you continue to harass and assault the staff, we’re going to have problems.’ “And then they just started chucking, so it escalated extremely quickly.” Bissonnette said he fought with seven people in total. Six of those men were arrested and charged with assault and disorderly conduct, according to the Scottsdale Police Department. Police confirmed Bissonnette’s account in a statement to The Athletic, describing an altercation that “escalated to the men assaulting Paul Bissonnette both inside and outside of the restaurant.” That group knocked the former NHL tough guy to the ground on a couple of occasions, according to Bissonnette, but he didn’t lose consciousness. He thanked police and hospital staff for their quick response and care. “All is good, guys,” said Bissonnette. “It sucks. I got (kicked) in the face a couple times, but it could have been a lot worse.” Bissonnette is part of the “Spittin’ Chiclets” podcast and detailed his experience on an episode scheduled to be released Tuesday. He’s also a panelist on TNT’s national television coverage and indicated that he would be in the studio for Wednesday’s doubleheader. The veteran of 202 career NHL games with Pittsburgh and Phoenix was clearly shaken by the altercation with a group of men he believed had been golfing earlier in the day. “Just bad dudes,” said Bissonnette. “Way too drunk, and I don’t know what else they had in their system. Yeah, I’m very, very angry at these guys and kind of want their names out there and want them to pay the piper. Just unacceptable behavior at a family restaurant just because they couldn’t grab another cocktail and didn’t want to hear ‘No’ for an answer.” Police have not identified those arrested. As scary as the situation was, Bissonnette felt he held his own in an outnumbered situation. “Took some,” he said. “Gave more.” (Photo: Cliff Hawkins / Getty Images for The Match) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,An N.B.A. Player Broke Down in Tears on the Bench. It Told a Deeper Story.,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5941499/2024/11/26/jalen-suggs-wendell-carter-jr-magic-friendship/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 17:28:20 +0000","Wendell Carter Jr.’s emotion, and Jalen Suggs’s reaction, was emblematic of what makes the Magic different from other N.B.A. teams.","NBA Over the past four years, the Orlando Magic have been aware of a budding friendship between point guard Jalen Suggs and big man Wendell Carter Jr. “Those two have a great relationship,’’ forward Paolo Banchero said. “Ever since I’ve got here, they have that best-friend type of thing, where they are always joking, always messing with each other, always showing love for one another. It’s been dope to see.’’ Advertisement On Nov. 3, in a game at Dallas, the rest of the NBA saw just how deep that bond runs between Suggs and Carter. Overwhelmed with frustration after suffering another injury, Carter broke down in the second quarter and cried on the Orlando bench. He not only cried but sobbed, his chest heaving, his eyes swollen. And there beside him was Suggs, covering his friend’s head with a towel, wrapping an arm around his shoulder to comfort, and whispering advice in his ear. “Just love,’’ Suggs said. Added Carter: “He’s a guy you want on your team, but even more so, he’s a guy you want as your friend.’’  What happened in Dallas went deeper than a friend consoling a buddy who was down. There is history behind the emotions and meaning behind the reaction. The scene on the bench was emblematic of what has made the Orlando Magic perhaps the most different culture in the NBA, one that trumpets caring about one another while stressing mental-health awareness, togetherness and transparency. “We can’t talk about being special if we don’t treat each other special,’’ coach Jamahl Mosley said. “We can’t talk about being unique and doing something different if we are not unique and different. And what you saw there … that’s who this team is.’’ The closeness of the Magic, Mosley believes, is part of the reason Orlando is 12-7 despite injuries causing All-Star Banchero to miss the last 14 games, and Carter the last 12 (Carter is nearing a return). Sure, it helps that Franz Wagner is the NBA’s biggest breakout star, that Suggs is an All-NBA defender and that second-year guard Anthony Black is becoming a reliable burst off the bench. But inside the Magic locker room, they talk about how their communication, compassion and care form an invaluable intangible. So while the scene in Dallas, with Carter sidelined and distraught, was a setback because the Magic were losing their center who entered the game averaging 10.4 rebounds, it also was empowering because it showed the unspoken power inside this roster. Advertisement Arnie Kander, Orlando’s vice president of player performance and wellness, said he could feel that power at the moment. As he approached the emotional Carter being consoled by Suggs on the bench that night in Dallas, he said his heart swelled. “I remember thinking, the healing is starting … the healing is literally starting right here in this moment,’’ Kander said. It is fitting the spotlight of relationships between Suggs and Carter comes from a moment of despair, with an injury as the backdrop. The seeds of their friendship were planted while both were injured during Suggs’ rookie season in 2021. With Suggs rehabilitating a thumb injury and Carter sidelined with a hamstring injury, the two spent much of December and January in the training room. They did more than just rehabilitate their bodies. They found a connection that also healed their minds. Suggs said he was spiraling emotionally after his injury. He felt the weight of being the fifth pick and not delivering on expectations. Carter could relate. After a variety of injuries held him back early in his career, the Bulls traded him to Orlando two and half seasons after drafting him seventh in 2018. So as the Magic practiced, Suggs and Carter would be in the training room, working on their bodies and minds. They would talk about their anxieties. Their fears. They talked about solutions. Dreams. And, they talked about their faith in God. “I will always hold our relationship close to my heart because of the time it came,’’ Suggs said. “It was a really vulnerable time for me … I was just not in a good mental space. I was worried about making it in the league, whether this was for me, if I wanted to be here … I just had a lot of struggles those first two years in terms of finding myself, not only in basketball but as a human. But I knew, every day I got to wake up and go to work and see Wendell. He was a bright spot that I had in my day.’’ GO DEEPER The Orlando Magic have a superpower, and it's love (for each other) Suggs found that Carter was a great listener, and always chose the right advice and the right time to deliver it. Carter found that Suggs, who is two years younger, was exceptionally grounded for his age, and he liked that Suggs was more drawn to family and faith than money, fame and cars. “At the end of the day, this is a job, and having someone you can talk to, relate to, it makes coming to work easy,’’ Carter said. “It’s special to have that.’’ Advertisement Added Suggs: “I think the best part about Wendell is that we can go from laughing and joking to having a really intimate conversation about life, hardships and the obstacles we’re each facing. And it’s really authentic. It’s not him sharing clichés. I can tell he is listening to me. “So in my time of need, he was there for me,’’ Suggs said. “And when people are there for you, it means a lot.’’ In Dallas, it was time to reciprocate. It was midway through the second quarter in Dallas on Nov. 3 when Carter leaped to deflect a lob pass at the rim. When he landed, he instantly felt pain, like a thousand pins piercing his foot. He knew immediately it was a case of plantar fasciitis. It was a particularly deflating development because Carter had worked so hard to squash the injury bug that had defined his first six NBA seasons. With injuries to his knees, feet, eye, back, hand, hip and hamstring,  Carter has missed more than one-third of his games over his career because of injury. “I’ve been battling injury my whole career, and most of it is stuff I can’t control,’’ he said. “It was frustrating because I went into that game already banged up (knee soreness) …and when it happened, I knew exactly what it was.’’ Incidentally, on the play Carter was injured, Suggs soared behind him and made a spectacular block of Daniel Gafford, who had caught the lob pass over Carter and was attempting to dunk. Suggs was substituted out of the game after the play, but as he took a seat on the bench, he noticed Carter was limping heavily. “He wasn’t moving well … I could tell something wasn’t right,’’ Suggs said. “But because the way Wendell is, he doesn’t want to show weakness on the court, he won’t let you know he is hurting. But seeing his movements, he didn’t look comfortable.’’ Carter played for another minute, but Suggs couldn’t take it anymore. He went to Mosley on the sideline and urged him to take Carter out. Advertisement As Carter limped to the sideline, he knew his injury was serious. All of his hard work over the summer, all of his goals … they were washed out, flooded by the pain. As he looked for a seat on the bench his mind was reeling. “I was getting super emotional … like, not again,’’ Carter said. “One of my goals was to play all 82 (games), and to be stopped so early in the season was frustrating.’’ By the time he plopped on the bench, his emotions were winning. Suggs could tell by Carter’s face that he was about to cry. So he got a towel and covered his friend’s head to give him some privacy as his body heaved and his tears flowed. “I’m glad he cried, glad he let out tears,’’ Suggs said. “I think it’s important to have those moments. In those moments you know you are still human. And it shows he is one with himself. In that space, in front of 17,000 fans, he was still authentically him.’’ That moment of vulnerability, was in part, fostered by the culture Mosley is forging in Orlando. In the past couple of seasons, Mosely has used a team-building tactic introduced to him by veteran Magic guard Cory Joseph: A player brings in a photograph that means something to him, and he talks to the team about why the person in that photo is special, or why the picture means something to him. “I just think it’s beautiful because it’s helps your ability to get to know the people you are around, beyond the surface level,’’ Mosley said. “Everyone says, ‘This is my guy … you are my guy …’ but I don’t want that to be lip service.’’ In conjunction with the photo sessions, Mosley harps to his players about the team being a family, and about the importance of that family communicating when things are awry. “I tell them all the time, if you have something going on, let’s talk about it,’’ Mosley said. “My door is open, your teammates’ door is open. If it’s enough to put on the table, we’ll put it on the table and talk about it.  We’re human beings, and we all go through things, so why not be able to address it and say, ‘I’m not any less if I address this and say I can’t handle it …” Advertisement Communication is at the center of the team’s push to foster an environment where mental health is not only addressed but also valued. They also do meditation and breathing exercises, all while stressing their mantra: this is bigger than basketball. “We talk about mental health, spiritual health, but I don’t think it gets seen enough,” Kander said. “Because that’s what these guys represent. They’ve been taught to have this bravado, be macho, but strength as we know it is the complete package. It’s about who we are as a human being.” In that vein, Carter said he didn’t hesitate to show his hurt, to express his frustration, and to release his tears, no matter that it was in front of 17,000. Surrounded by his friend, and his team, he felt comfortable. “Coach and the front office has created an environment where we can be like that,’’ Suggs said. “We can be authentic, exactly who we are and show exactly what we are feeling. It’s such a freeing feeling, honestly. When you can do that, and be that, and not put on any front or facade, it’s comforting. You can just be yourself, be a human being and know that the man next to you will take care of you in those moments.’’ As Carter sobbed on the bench, his face buried in the towel Suggs provided, his friend leaned in and comforted him. “He made it all make sense,’’ Carter said. It was like they were back in the training room three years ago, confronting their fears, easing their anxieties and leaning on each other. “The main thing in that moment I wanted Wendell to know was that not only is he strong, he is so much more than a basketball player,’’ Suggs said. “I told him, the things he has done as a human being — not only for myself, but for his family, for the people in Orlando, for his foundation … he’s been amazing.’’ Every Thanksgiving in Orlando, Carter provides meals for families. This year, he expects to feed 300 families. And for Christmas, he is rewarding standout students at Orlando high schools with iPads and gaming consoles. His foundation also has a program to help inspire students to consider a career in aviation, spawned from his childhood infatuation with flying after a visit to a cockpit. Advertisement “I’ve done about four off-the-court community service events with him,’’ Mosley said. “He has one of the best hearts of anyone.’’ As Carter began to regain his composure on the bench, Suggs continued to lean in and speak into his ear. He knew how obsessed Carter had become over the summer working on his body, and how much emphasis he had put on being healthy the entire year. “I told him this is an amazing opportunity to slow down and really center yourself,’’ Suggs said. “Injuries are such a hard thing. They often cloud your judgment … they make you ask the question why?’’ Carter said the words began to calm him. “And as he comforted me, he prayed over me,’’ Carter said. “Then he started talking about our faith, a lot of spirituality stuff, and it made me look at it differently in that moment.’’ Said Suggs: “I told him it’s hard to see God’s plan in the moment. And while you feel heavy in the moment, you are going to look back at this time and you are going to realize God was teaching you the whole time. It really turns into a beautiful thing when the process is over. So I just told him that. You are going to see what He is teaching, you are just going to have to trust Him.’’ Three games later, the roles were reversed. Suggs was ailing, and Carter was there for him. When the Magic returned home, they faced New Orleans. Suggs felt off. He was exhausted, sluggish, and his mind wasn’t moving as fast as the action on the court. During a timeout, Suggs was on the back edge of the huddle and Carter approached. “He was like, ‘Hey bro? You OK?’’’ Suggs said, lowering his voice to mimic Carter. “It may seem like a subtle thing, that question, but because Wendell and I have that relationship, we can really have a conversation.’’ As Mosley talked X’s and O’s inside the huddle, Suggs and Carter were on the outskirts, talking about Suggs’ headspace. Advertisement “I told him exactly what I was going through,’’ Suggs said. “I told him, ‘No, I’m not OK. I’m tired. My energy is low. My spirit is down and I’m not exactly sure what to do. It feels like a time when I’m not really in control.’’’ Carter flipped the advice Suggs gave him in Dallas back at him. He told him to take the time to figure it out, that not everything has to be accomplished at this moment. He told him that the team knows who he is as a player, and that he didn’t have to do everything himself. They were all here for him. Even though Suggs had a subpar game against the Pelicans with seven points, six assists and five turnovers, the Magic won 115-88. “Instead of trying to answer questions from within and battling my own mind, I was able to release them to Wendell and put those feelings on his shoulders a bit and get some insight and love,’’ Suggs said. “Just to have that release … that’s really comfortable.’’ On a recent trip to Los Angeles, Suggs and Carter continued their rivalry of playing online games. Their favorites are Connect Four and Mancala. On this day, Carter delivered three consecutive beatdowns in Mancala, prompting him to text Suggs a dancing Hulk emoji. “That wasn’t funny,’’ Suggs deadpanned. “I know he got a great laugh out of that, but I was not laughing. Three straight L’s. I needed time to simmer down after that.’’ By nightfall, Suggs had cooled, and the two went to watch the horror/suspense film “Heretic.” “Verrrrry interesting, I will just say that,’’ Carter said of the movie. The next morning, as the team met to go over the game plan against the Clippers, assistant coach Dale Osbourne was giving his report when he used a phrase that Suggs and Carter found humorous. “I’m looking straight ahead, and I can feel Jalen’s presence,’’ Carter said. “I turned and looked and he’s just staring at me. We both started laughing.’’ Advertisement Around the Magic, one thing is almost certain: If Carter is laughing, then almost assuredly, so is Suggs. “You know how you have those people when you look at them, you just want to laugh?’’ Suggs said. “Wendell is one of those people. And he has one of the funniest laughs I’ve ever heard. It’s high-pitched and his whole face cracks up … so when he laughs, I laugh, and that energy just feeds off each other.’’ Their friendship rolls on, one laugh at a time, one crisis at a time, one moment a time. Along the way, they are unafraid to confront their fears and be themselves, knowing that they have someone who will be there for them if they waver. “Those two for sure have a very special, unique relationship,’’ Kander said. “Both guys are soul-searchers, they want to dig a little deeper.’’ Perhaps that is why Carter recalls fondly a set of 30 cards that Kander has players blindly select each day. The cards have symbolic/spiritual sayings … something along the thoughts of the day. On the night he was injured in Dallas, Carter selected his card. It read: “I’m safe.” (Top photo: Benny Sieu / USA Today) Get all-access to exclusive stories. Subscribe to The Athletic for in-depth coverage of your favorite players, teams, leagues and clubs.

NYT > Sports,"When Brain Cancer Struck a Baseball Family, a ‘Village’ Provided Shelter",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5947027/2024/11/26/ned-rice-phillies-family-brain-cancer/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 17:28:20 +0000","One year ago, the daughter of an M.L.B. executive received a diagnosis that changed her family members’ lives.","MLB Ten months ago when the nights were longest, Ned Rice emailed total strangers to share his family’s unthinkable dilemma. These were doctors across the country who had not met and did not treat his 3-year-old daughter. Wynnie had brain cancer. This was how Rice, a Phillies assistant general manager, coped. Advertisement He had to gather as much information as he could. “I have still to this day never googled medulloblastoma,” said Cary Rice, his wife. “Because I can’t handle it. And I’m an analytical thinker, too. But if it’s too emotional, I can’t do it.” Everything about this felt impossible. Wynnie had lost her balance a few times — and now her parents faced a sudden and critical decision. Doctors at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) told the Rices they could not treat Wynnie with radiation; she was too young. The neurocognitive damage from radiation would prevent her from having an independent adult life. But her chances of survival were better with radiation. Ned Rice sought a second opinion from another leading children’s hospital. They told him it would be reckless not to use the treatment known to be the best — radiation — no matter the long-term effects. Rice had negotiated player contracts worth hundreds of millions — a high-stakes process that blends objective valuations with a subjective hand. But this was so different. It was a parent’s worst nightmare. Then Rice saw an email. A neuro-oncologist at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital named Richard Graham sent a lengthy reply to one of Rice’s cold calls. “I was really panicking,” Rice said. “He doesn’t even know who I am. He has his own patients and his own life.” Graham shared his advice. He became a frequent resource for Rice. These small, thoughtful moments accumulated. An unexpected gift at the doorstep. A video from Wynnie’s classmates. More responses from out-of-town doctors who would never meet Wynnie. Family members and friends who dropped everything to care for her two siblings. More gifts. Nurses who did not just look after Wynnie — but her parents, too. “It hits you over and over again,” Rice said. “There’s so many people that want to help. Everybody does it in their own way.” Advertisement Rice called his former boss. These weren’t like the late-night talks Matt Klentak and he often had while they ran baseball operations for the Phillies. But it felt normal, even though Klentak worked for the Milwaukee Brewers and Rice was on leave from the Phillies. The phone calls were cathartic. They could dive right into whatever was on Rice’s mind because Klentak knew the latest on Wynnie through an Instagram account the Rices created to chronicle her fight against cancer. It’s grown to more than 700 followers. Friends of friends of friends now reply to posts with, “Go Wynnie go!” The account is a raw look into life with pediatric cancer. It’s become a way for Ned and Cary to express complicated feelings. More than anything, it’s opened a door. “Caregiver burnout is a common phenomenon,” said Jane Minturn, Wynnie’s neuro-oncologist at CHOP, “and (Ned and Cary) have worked together to limit this.” Wynnie knows she is sick, but she does not understand what brain cancer is. The burden is shared by everyone around her. It is immense. Klentak could sense it, at times, during those late-night conversations. It is isolating. But Rice started to carry the goodness of those who had entered Wynnie’s universe. “I couldn’t really relate to what he was going through,” Klentak said. “And I think very few people could. But that doesn’t stop people from wanting to help.” The first sign of distress wasn’t alarming. Wynnie was a happy and healthy 3-year-old learning to move faster. That meant an occasional stumble. But Ned and Cary noticed their daughter’s balance wasn’t improving; it looked a fraction worse every week. They scheduled an appointment last December with their pediatrician. He threw cotton balls across the room to Wynnie, who was content to play the game. She had to bend over and fetch them. She wobbled. The pediatrician agreed something seemed off. He wanted her to see a neurologist at CHOP. The next appointment wasn’t for five months. He suggested the Rices go to the CHOP emergency room — not because it was urgent, but to assuage any immediate concerns. Advertisement They took Wynnie on Dec. 21, 2023. “Sure enough,” Rice said,” we had five neurologists in our room in a few minutes.” Wynnie didn’t have any other symptoms. The doctors scheduled an MRI in three weeks. It could be a muscular disease. Maybe it was vertigo. The Rices visited family for Christmas and Wynnie vomited twice. CHOP rescheduled the MRI for Dec. 29 and, that morning, Wynnie threw up again. She stumbled a few more times. A doctor summoned Ned and Cary during the MRI. He pointed to a screen. There was a large tumor in Wynnie’s brain. Wynnie was sedated for the MRI. The doctors wanted to do immediate surgery to remove the tumor. It was 4 p.m. on the Friday of a holiday weekend. The procedure lasted four hours; it would take a week to know whether the tumor was cancerous. Everything had spiraled so fast. “It’s a long process, but that was definitely a low point,” Rice said. “Those first few days — you took a mostly happy, healthy, sweet girl in for an outpatient MRI. She wakes up and you’re just like, ‘Will we ever see that girl again?’ That was really hard.” Then Wynnie was diagnosed with medulloblastoma. During that first trip to the E.R., before everything escalated, Rice was on the phone with Dave Dombrowski. Yoshinobu Yamamoto’s camp had instructed teams to make their last and best offers for the star free agent. Dombrowski communicated the number to Rice, who relayed it to Joel Wolfe, Yamamoto’s agent. Yamamoto signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers that night. Rice did not mention where he was. The day Wynnie underwent surgery, Rice called Phillies general manager Sam Fuld. He told him what was happening. Dombrowski was out of the country for a rare vacation; Rice talked to the Phillies’ president of baseball operations soon after New Year’s. “We’ll see you when it’s over,” Dombrowski told him. “Take everything you need. We’ll completely cover it. Don’t worry about anything.” Advertisement John Middleton called a few hours later. The Phillies’ principal owner offered to connect the family with doctors. Cary is a lawyer and her firm, Hangley Aronchick Segal Pudlin & Schiller, told her to take as much time as she needed. The Rices were fortunate; they had the means to pay for treatment and ample time to direct attention toward Wynnie. Acquaintances offered to help with whatever the family needed, but what they needed was a cure for cancer. All they wanted was normal. It was an uncomfortable situation that didn’t always have to be uncomfortable. “We just have this wonderful sort of village that kept showing up,” Cary said. “Kept calling. Kept texting. Even when I couldn’t respond. We’re just really grateful for that because we are still the same people. We still want to talk about things and do things that have nothing to do with cancer. We want to feel normal. We want to have hope for a normal future. The worst thing you can do or say is nothing.” Wynnie lived on the third floor at CHOP for almost eight months. The Rices opted against radiation. But her treatment — alternating cycles of chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplants — was so grueling that most of it was inpatient. Ned and Cary would take 24-hour shifts with Wynnie. They were ships passing in the night without much interaction. They found a community inside the hospital. “These nurses, I mean, they’re not just nurses,” Cary said. “They’re therapists. They’re friends. They’re cheerleaders.” Heidi Turner, one of Wynnie’s nurses, worked only overnights. That meant a lot of late-night bonding. Wynnie was discharged Aug. 23. The last night at CHOP, Turner handed Cary a letter to Wynnie. “I’m going to miss you so much,” Cary said to Turner. “We’ll stop by and hopefully I’ll see you.” She stared at Cary. The nurse replied she hoped to never see them again. “And,” Cary said, “it just stuck with me because it’s such a weird feeling to have.” Rice, who has been with the Phillies since 2016, stayed in contact with player agents and rival team executives last offseason but no longer served as the team’s main point of contact. The Phillies had started negotiating Zack Wheeler’s three-year, $126 million extension with B.B. Abbott, Wheeler’s agent at Wasserman. By January, Rice and Abbott had regular talks that started with 30 minutes about Wynnie and progressed to Wheeler’s contract. Advertisement “You’re never what you want to be for these families that are trying to talk about this,” Abbott said. “Because you just can’t be. It’s so all-consuming when you think, ‘My 3-year-old daughter has to go through this.’ It’s hard for parents and families to get their heads around exactly what’s getting ready to happen. The days and nights and hospitals. Watching their little girl lose her hair and be sick. All of this stuff that I knew was getting ready to come.” For years, Abbott has raised awareness for pediatric cancer research through the Rally Foundation and the National Pediatric Cancer Foundation. “I just wanted to be more of a sounding board for him,” Abbott said. The Rices weren’t keeping Wynnie’s illness hidden; it was more of an open secret. Abbott decided to help subtly. He asked Wheeler if he’d lend his name to a fundraiser for the National Pediatric Cancer Foundation near the end of spring training at the Phillies’ complex in Clearwater, Fla. Everyone knew it was for Wynnie, but no one had to say it. Word spread to the team’s front office and support staff. Dozens of Phillies employees had their heads shaved or orange streaks painted in their hair. Players made donations to the foundation. Reliever Matt Strahm’s wife, Megan, organized a present from the Phillies’ wives and girlfriends. “An unbelievable, huge, outrageous gift wagon for Wynnie,” Rice said. He had not met Strahm’s wife until later that summer at the team’s family day. “You’re amazing,” Rice said to her. With Wynnie in the hospital, Rice watched from afar this year as the Phillies sprinted to first place. “The Banatic!” Wynnie said to her dad whenever the furry green mascot appeared on the screen. There are certain rhythms to the baseball season. It is monotonous but contains specific checkpoints. The Rices had none of that with Wynnie. There were no regular updates on her prognosis. They will not know how successful her treatments were until a scan sometime in December. Their focus was singular. Get through today. “Wynnie, she’s something,” Cary said. “She has this tiny little voice and she’s so sweet and gentle with everything she does. We always kind of considered her this little delicate flower. But she’s a beast.” Two weeks ago, Wynnie had a birthday party. The Rices held it outdoors, at a playground by the Schuylkill River Park, because Wynnie’s immune system remains at risk. They had bagels and coffee and a face painter. Cary handed every kid a stuffed fox as a party favor. “Mr. Fox” was Wynnie’s constant companion in the hospital; Cary had so many at the house because people kept sending them when Wynnie would throw up on hers. Advertisement This was a celebration of Wynnie and the village that formed around her. “We were surrounded,” Cary said, “by about 85 of the friends who have been there for us in so many different ways this year.” Wynnie’s hair has started to grow back, although she wore a purple knit cap that covered her head at her party. Everyone could see the three purple flowers painted on her forehead. But Wynnie felt sick near the end of the party. She went to the emergency room with croup. Another challenge. But she was 4 and she was here. She wore her face paint to the E.R. (Top image: Dan Goldfarb / The Athletic. Photos: Ashley Blair Photography)  Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Perhaps the expectations were never realistic. Rodgers is coming off a torn Achilles, and he’s also dealt with knee, ankle and hamstring injuries this season. As such, he’s on pace for one of the worst seasons of his career, and he might lose double-digit starts for the first time since 2008 when he took over for Brett Favre. Advertisement So, has it been due to bad injury luck, skill deterioration, organizational issues or a little bit of everything? “(Rodgers is) trying to play as if he’s 10 years younger, and he’s not close to the same player,” a defensive coach, granted anonymity so he could speak freely, told The Athletic. “He can still throw it in a clean pocket with the best of the best, (but his) mobility is not the same. He’s jumpy and has missed some throws I’ve never seen him miss.” A couple of coaches who have studied Rodgers said his footwork has been out of whack, and he’s made some mistakes that would have been out of character from his time with the Green Bay Packers, notably much of his performance in London against the Minnesota Vikings and that late first-half interception against the Pittsburgh Steelers. “He needs the run game, play action, screen game more than ever, but that’s not what he wants,” the coach added. “He wants to play the way he’s most comfortable. And he doesn’t have the offensive line or skill group to play that way. Getting (Davante Adams) will help. There’s always a chance he gets hot. I’ll never underestimate his ability as long as he’s still playing. He’s always turned it on when people have doubted him the most.” Rodgers had a solid statistical showing Sunday in the loss to the Patriots, but he’s now carved them up twice. In two games against them, Rodgers has completed 69.8 percent of his passes for 514 yards (257 per game), four touchdowns, no interceptions and a 115.4 passer rating. In all other games, he’s completing 59.3 percent of his passes for 1,382 yards (230.3 per game), eight touchdowns, seven interceptions and a 76.4 rating. “Rodgers’ skill erosion is real,” an executive said. “Not being able to extend plays with his feet puts a lot of pressure on the offensive line to be firm up the middle and the playmakers to get open quicker. I won’t be surprised if you see more of the screen game being put into their offense. They really need to ride Breece Hall more as a runner and pass catcher out of the backfield.” The rush gets HOME on 3rd down 😤 📺: CBS pic.twitter.com/2RvF7RzR7g — New England Patriots (@Patriots) October 27, 2024  The Jets had visions of Super Bowls when they acquired Rodgers in 2023, but their playoff drought is likely about to hit a 14th consecutive season. Rodgers, who turns 41 in December, is running short on time to change the narrative of his Jets tenure. “Rodgers has been so good for so long that it’s almost like people believed he was immune from the effects of tearing his Achilles at 40 years old,” another executive said. “That’s a difficult injury for a young player. To be 40 and play at that (expected) level, that’s really hard, and they can’t protect him. Advertisement “At his age, Aaron is coming off a career-ending injury in most sports. To not have the footwork, quickness and mobility, that’s fine. We should expect that. But for some reason, the expectation is he should be looking like the MVP from 2021. That’s not living in reality. He’s probably doing better than most 40-year-olds with that injury. It’s almost unfair to him to ask him to be the driver of that team in those circumstances. But there’s a double-edged sword that maybe he doesn’t realize he’s not the same Aaron he was in 2021.” Patrick Mahomes is on pace for the worst statistical season of his career, but there’s not nearly as much concern about the three-time champ. “Mahomes is playing at an elite level,” a defensive coach said. “(He’s) doing what it takes week in and week out, has complete command of the situations. His footwork in the pocket is as good as I’ve seen. (He’s still) growing every week as a player. Best competitor in the game. “He just wills his team to winning.” GO DEEPER How Chiefs newcomer DeAndre Hopkins helped Travis Kelce have his best game of the season The struggles are more about the situation around Mahomes. They’ve had numerous issues at both tackle spots. Wideouts Rashee Rice and Hollywood Brown and running back Isiah Pacheco have been out with significant injuries. Tight end Travis Kelce has dropped off quickly, although he finally caught fire Sunday against the Raiders. “The Pacheco injury is the biggest factor that not many people talk about,” an executive said. “They obviously miss the play, but also the physicality and spark he brings the offense. Kelce is getting older. It’s noticeable on tape that he’s losing some (yards after the catch).” Yet, the Chiefs are the NFL’s lone unbeaten team. Credit their defense, for sure, but Mahomes has made a host of clutch plays in the fourth quarter to seal some close victories. WE'RE NOT WORTHY. pic.twitter.com/8dYWhc0ybA — Kansas City Chiefs (@Chiefs) October 27, 2024  “Mahomes’ issue right now is injuries at receiver,” another executive said. “(DeAndre) Hopkins isn’t a stretch-the-field player anymore. It’s more of an issue of protection and issues with balance, which puts a lot of pressure on the QB. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with Mahomes. He’s managing a little bit of a s— show in terms of a personnel standpoint, their depth, changing out guys, offensive linemen, injuries.” Advertisement The Chiefs acquired Hopkins last week and Pacheco is expected to return at some point this season, so help is on the way. All the while, Mahomes is trying to figure out what works with the rest of his supporting cast, not unlike last season before he turned it on in the playoffs. If their opponents can’t take down Mahomes when it’s looking like this, they might be in real trouble if the Chiefs figure it out down the stretch. And it’s a good bet that happens because they almost always do.  There’s been a lot of stability in the top five of late, but Jared Goff, Jordan Love and Brock Purdy have been knocking on the door. Goff is the latest to climb to No. 6, and a two-spot jump in the top 10 is a significant rise. Goff is squarely involved in the MVP race. Jayden Daniels made his top-10 debut with a two-spot jump of his own. He’s been electric this season and just had a signature moment with the Hail Mary to shock Caleb Williams and the Bears. Daniels, who has spent four consecutive weeks in the top 13, and Lamar Jackson are the only two QBs who have been in the rankings every week but never fallen back.

Prescott has thrown two interceptions in three consecutive games, including back-to-back losses to the Lions and 49ers, as the Cowboys have fallen to the 13th seed in the NFC and two games out of the playoff picture.

NYT > Sports,U.S. Women’s Soccer Coach Held a News Conference in a London Pub,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5947302/2024/11/25/emma-hayes-press-conference-pub-uswnt-england/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 17:28:20 +0000","“Thankfully it still smells of fart and feet,” Emma Hayes said of returning to Underworld, a black-walled basement club.","UK Women's Football The first time Emma Hayes introduced herself to the US Women’s National Team (USWNT) she put a photo up on the big screen. The photo showed the intersection on Camden High Street, north London, just outside a pub called the World’s End. Hayes said to the players: “This is Camden, England. This is where I’m from. This is what made me.” Advertisement So when Hayes returned to the UK ahead of England vs USWNT at Wembley on Saturday, U.S. Soccer decided to use the pub as the setting for her pre-match press conference. A press conference in a pub — that must be a first. So, at 11am on a Monday morning, The Athletic was weaving our way down a pub’s staircase, round the bar, past some less-than-salubrious toilets, into Underworld, a black-walled basement club where Hayes spent much of her youth dancing until 3am. “I remember many an evening we would come in here, and thankfully it still smells of fart and feet,” said Hayes, who’d been greeted with a ‘Welcome back Emma’ sign outside. “It was a big indie place for me back in the day and I definitely have not seen this place in the daylight so that’s refreshing.” Although the music blaring from the speakers remains the same, the agenda and vibe at this time in the morning were slightly different — not least the fact that tea, coffee and pastries were being served. With a table and mics set up where Hayes used to rock and roll, the head coach looked out to a bizarre mix of her mum, sisters, school friends, former and current colleagues, and the international media. Asked how she felt to be in the Underworld with those closest to her, every word captured on camera, navigating questions from coaching at Wembley to Donald Trump, from USWNT’s Thanksgiving plans to the homophobic abuse aimed at her former player Sam Kerr, from developing the national youth team strategy to Hayes’ top tourist tips, Hayes said simply: “F****** brilliant!” Hayes may be coaching in America but she has not changed, firmly shaped by her upbringing in north London. She credits her friends and family for keeping her humble. Those in the audience had shared her journey with her since she was a child, people who continue to run projects across the London borough at Camden Sports Development or youth leagues at Regent’s Park. Advertisement “My community is what I am and what I care about,” she said. “I’m so stoked to be here with people that have been massive in my life. My friends have never changed and I’m grateful for that. If you say otherwise, there’ll be about 50 of them lining up at the door for you… I’m kidding. “Are you?” one heckled. “I probably shouldn’t say this in a press conference,” said Hayes, “but one of my friends used to live up in Delancey Street and she lived in a big posh house, a nice five-storey, it was lovely, gorgeous. “I used to go up there and pretend, maybe one day, this would be a life for me. I used to come home with a little posh accent and my mum would say, ‘Your s*** still stinks'”. That was one way to keep your daughter grounded. When it comes to her tenure as the USWNT boss, Hayes is, in her words, “fresh out of the packet”, but she is already thinking about her legacy, explaining that unifying the US talent pool under a women’s football development strategy is “going to be the biggest piece” of what she leaves behind. She described herself as a “builder” who wants to lay foundations for the long term, and importantly she wants to devise a strategy for players and staff across all departments which is centred around a “female lens”. “Everything we create, the systems, frameworks, methodology, everything is done through a male lens. I seek to challenge that. If we value women and want to keep women in the workplace, we have to be creative because raising children is the hardest job in the world and your children need you too. But you’re entitled to be able to do that and have a job in football. We have to think through a female lens. That’s at the heart of everything.” Hayes said of her own accord: “I’m not going to answer any questions on men’s football. I know exactly where I am and what I want to do with my life. That’s in the women’s game, developing everything in and around that.” From meeting the press to pulling a pint, @emmahayes1 is a woman of the people! pic.twitter.com/MBlZNkheDA — U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team (@USWNT) November 25, 2024  On Saturday Hayes will be a visitor at what she called her “second home”, Wembley. The 48-year-old will have to go through a “weird moment” of humming the English and American anthems because she “loves them” both before coming up against former Chelsea players like her ex-captain Millie Bright. Hayes momentarily feared making the jump from club to national-team management as she was unsure how the change in rhythm would affect her. For around 25 years, she had driven to the training ground six or seven days a week. Advertisement “I worried about that for about four seconds,” she said. “Then I said, ‘OK, what are the benefits? “I get to get up and breathe, take Harry to school, go to the gym, create my schedule around those things, and not sacrifice the things that make me feel healthy.” She added: “I definitely didn’t feel healthy at the end of my time at Chelsea. I don’t want to say it’s pressure. I just think it’s the stress, the toll it took on me. Doing that during menopause, I realised, was even harder. “To get on top of all of these things, I feel like I’ve got my mojo back, my smile back and joy back. I didn’t realise how much I’d lost in that. I’m loving football more than ever.” (Top photo: U.S. Soccer/Getty Images/Brad Smith) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,How Tennis Players and Tennis Coaches Choose Each Other,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5947172/2024/11/26/tennis-players-coaches-relationship-how-choose/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 17:28:20 +0000",Novak Djokovic’s decision to hire the former star Andy Murray has renewed interest in one of the most important relationships in sports.,"Tennis How does one of the best male players in tennis history choose a new coach? Pick somebody who has been there with you — and who you beat to get there. Novak Djokovic’s decision to hire Andy Murray for at least the Australian Open has renewed interest in one of the most interesting psychological relationships in sport: The tennis player and their coach. Advertisement Djokovic has always sought out a coach who has scaled the mountain he chose, hiring Boris Becker, Andre Agassi and Goran Ivanisevic throughout his career, all of them, like Murray, former Wimbledon champions and multiple major winners, Ivanisevic apart. He needs the voice of someone who he respects and who is happy to have it out with him mid-match — until they aren’t. A few months after Djokovic and Ivanisevic parted ways in March this year, six seasons and 12 major titles in the bank, Ivanisevic explained that they simply ran out of patience with each other. Djokovic’s decision comes on the back of a reshuffle at the top of the WTA Tour, with world No. 2 Iga Swiatek, world No. 3 Coco Gauff, world No. 6 Elena Rybakina and four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka all firing and then hiring in the wake of the U.S. Open in a bid to renew their games, work on technique, strengthen relationships, gain an edge — or rather, a mix of all these things that is unique to each player’s priorities and each coach’s way of working. That mix can win titles and inspire careers, but it had better work, with players and their teams on the road together and working at close quarters for practically the entire year. “I imagine that if I had a family and kids, I would not be here at all,” world No. 18 Marta Kostyuk’s coach Sandra Zaniewska said in an interview with The Athletic earlier this year. A technical master or a sideline hype master? A proven champion or a developing prospect? Players and coaches alike have myriad decisions to make in choosing each other. GO DEEPER Murray named Djokovic's coach for Australian Open There are all sorts of factors that go into choosing a coach. Sometimes players want to work on something technical, whether a shot or a surface. Three-time Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka brought in former Wimbledon champion Richard Kraijeck in 2016 to improve his grass-court tennis; Roger Federer and Murray did the same thing for clay with Jose Higueras and Alex Corretja respectively. Advertisement Djokovic hired Ivanisevic — who is now with Rybakina — in part to improve his serve, increasing its fluency and turning Djokovic into one of the most feared and precise servers in the sport in the early 2020s. In search of a better net game, Djokovic employed Australian player Mark Woodforde, who won 11 Grand Slam doubles titles with fellow ‘Woody’ Mark Woodbridge; he hired former U.S. Open finalist Todd Martin to work on his serve earlier in his career with less successful results. Technical changes were the main motivation behind Gauff’s decision to split with Brad Gilbert, with whom she won the U.S. Open in 2023. Gilbert coached Gauff to deflect the vulnerabilities in her serve and forehand by turning matches into battles of defense and attrition; he would tell her to hit her forehand with a slow, looping arc to neutralize attacks. When opponents figured this out — and her serve kept letting her down — it was time for a change, not just in her game but in the type of coaching that would help her progress. “I wanted someone to help me with what I wanted to see progress in, especially on the serve,” Gauff said in a news conference at the WTA Tour Finals in Saudi Arabia, which she won in an early boost to her relationship with Matt Daly, a specialist on both footwork and grip technique who co-created a training device to help players improve their grip, and Jean-Christophe Faurel. “JC” has worked with Gauff previously and players often return to coaches they know and trust. Djokovic went back to long-time coach Marian Vajda in 2018 before they split for a second time four years later. Murray did likewise, bringing Ivan Lendl back in 2016 after the latter had stepped down two years earlier, and then again for a third spell in 2022. As when football clubs sack and hire managers, availability is the intangible that remains out of players’ control and choosing a familiar face can be easier than going into the unknown, especially in the case of Djokovic, 37, who does not have much time left in his career to take a punt on something new. Emma Raducanu is another player focused on improving a specific shot — often the serve or forehand. If she doesn’t feel it’s working, she is quick to move on. Torben Beltz, who was brought in to improve Raducanu’s forehand in November 2021, was sacked five months later when it was felt that insufficient progress was being made. Raducanu doesn’t want a hype man or woman, but technical expertise. One of the most successful examples of technical focus in recent times comes from women’s world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, who transformed her serve with the support of biomechanics specialist Gavin MacMillan after it completely broke down in 2022. GO DEEPER How tears and a telephone in Toronto changed Aryna Sabalenka's tennis life It’s something Swiatek, who Sabalenka dethroned as world No. 1 in October, is looking for from her new relationship with Wim Fissette. Fissette, who has had Grand Slam-winning success with Kim Clijsters, Angelique Kerber and Naomi Osaka, is one of the most prominent coaches on the WTA Tour. Their uniting offered a window into the mutual considerations that players and coaches undertake when beginning a relationship, which representatives from both have explained over the last few weeks. Advertisement Swiatek, by her own admission an overthinker, spoke to Fissette by phone before meeting in person in Warsaw to discuss “the specifics of the technicalities and what he wanted to change in my game”. At a news conference at the WTA Finals earlier this month, Swiatek said that Fissette “added some extra stuff that I haven’t thought of” as well as aligning with her own ideas for improvement. On a personal level, Swiatek appreciated Fissette’s listening skills, which players and friends said is one of his defining characteristics as a coach in interviews with The Athletic last month. “The communication was kind of smooth. He also let me talk a lot and he was able to listen to me and this was pretty fun,” Swiatek said. Fissette told Eurosport last month that he wanted to work with Swiatek after splitting with former world No. 1 Osaka, who switched to working with Serena Williams’ former coach Patrick Mouratoglou in September. “Not only because she is No. 1 in the world but also because of her personality, which is a role model for other tennis players,” Fissette said. GO DEEPER Emotional intelligence, data, and tough love: Who is Wim Fissette the coach? Personality is the other deciding factor in player-coach relationships: Not just whether they work or not, but how long they might last. While players are typically the more ruthless party in ending partnerships despite the now de rigueur mutually gushy Instagram announcements, coaches can sometimes take the decision. Fissette was working with world No. 5 Zheng Qinwen when he decided to rejoin Osaka’s team last year, a decision which left Zheng blindsided and heartbroken. Zheng has since reunited with Pere Riba, who helped her to an Olympic gold medal and a first Grand Slam final in 2024. They have a quirky dynamic whereby during practice sessions at a tournament, Zheng dictates the sessions, but Riba calls the shots in training; they figured out the compromise after learning each other’s personalities, a necessary process in every relationship. Jessica Pegula, who reached the U.S. Open final in September after splitting with David Witt and bringing on Mark Knowles and Mark Merklein, discussed the importance of retaining identity in a news conference at the WTA Tour Finals. “I think you can see a coaching situation doesn’t work out because they try to change the player too much,” she said. Advertisement “You obviously have to get along with the person. You have to be able to respond well to them.” American world No. 18 Frances Tiafoe was next to hire Witt and he reached the U.S. Open semifinals with the American in his box. “Someone needs to push me and hold me accountable, but also make it fun for me,” Tiafoe said in a news conference at the tournament. “If you come at me with a drill-sergeant-type mentality, I’m going to go the other way.” Patrick McEnroe, who has been guiding players since retiring in 1998, worked with Tiafoe at the Laver Cup exhibition event. “He brings a certain energy to everyone around him, so obviously you’ve got to understand that coming in.” Mouratoglou, who coached Simona Halep and Holger Rune between Williams and Osaka, described the need to be a “chameleon” in a recent Zoom interview ahead of his arrival in London for Ultimate Tennis Showdown, his main pursuit outside of coaching. “My job is to understand I cannot be the same every time,” he said. “Serena needed to feel that she was in control of everything. If you don’t win the title, it’s nothing. It’s No. 1 or nothing. “Simona was the opposite, she wanted me to be in control of everything.” After Halep had a panic attack at the 2022 French Open, Mouratoglou realized he had to back off the intensity that had worked with Williams. “She felt the pressure of having to deliver was hurting her. I completely changed the way I was interacting with her.” Halep then reached the Wimbledon semifinals before being provisionally suspended in October 2022 after testing positive for roxadustat. Tennis integrity authorities suspended her for four years in 2023 before the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) reduced the ban to nine months on appeal in March this year after accepting that the positive test came from a contaminated supplement. Mouratoglou said he felt “responsible” for Halep’s case in an Instagram video in 2023. Advertisement Now working with Osaka, Mouratoglou said the former world No. 1 is “a very interesting personality” but “not easy to understand because she’s very secretive and keeps a lot inside.” “I think in terms of game and work to do, we are really on the same page. But there is this piece that is very important, which is understanding the person that she is. That will take more time.” In the sea of recent changes, world No. 1 Sabalenka has been an oasis of calm. She prioritizes coaches who can understand her unique personality and has built a relationship with her long-time coaches Jason Stacy and Anton Dubrov over time after some “really bad experiences” that left her “betrayed”. “I was (never) looking for big names because sometimes big names are just big names,” she added at a news conference at the WTA Tour Finals earlier this month. “I was looking for someone smart and someone who is always looking for something. “I was looking for someone who can understand that even if I go crazy on court, it’s nothing personal.” “Anton, I knew him, since I don’t know 15, because he was in the academy when I was practising. “With Jason, it took us two years to open up and trust him fully and to understand him as a person and I’m really glad I didn’t kick him out.” Former U.S. Open champion Daniil Medvedev also treasures stability, working with main coach Gilles Cervara for more than seven years before bringing on former world No. 6 Gilles Simon, which is more similar to Djokovic’s decision to bring on Murray. “I am not someone who wants to constantly change and look for something new,” he said in a news conference at the Laver Cup in September. Argentina’s world No. 30 Francisco Cerundolo echoed the benefits of having multiple coaches at a news conference a couple of months ago, but America’s Danielle Collins meanwhile said in an interview earlier this month that she prefers not to have much of a team around her: She likes working things out herself and isn’t always convinced of the value that coaches can bring. Advertisement That value can be hard to quantify. In Djokovic’s case, the rarefied level at which he operates means it’ll likely come down to whether Murray can provide the right sort of energy to help him get over the line for an 11th time at the Australian Open. Murray’s ability to absorb and defuse the frustration that comes his way from Djokovic, just like his coaches had to try to do when he was hurling invective their way during his own career, may be his biggest asset as the rivals turned partners establish the most important element of any relationship. “The main thing is to trust them,” world No. 4 Jasmine Paolini told The Athletic in Riyadh.

NYT > Sports,Ed Sheeran Issues Apology to Manchester United’s New Head Coach,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5946604/2024/11/25/ed-sheeran-ruben-amorim-sky-sports/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 17:28:20 +0000",Sheeran was criticized for interrupting an interview involving Ruben Amorim.,"EPL Ed Sheeran has apologised to new Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim for interrupting his post-match interview following Sunday’s draw at Ipswich Town. Sheeran, 33, said he had been intending to greet Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp and was unaware Amorim was being interviewed at the time, when the UK broadcaster cut to him mid-way through Amorim’s pitch-side discussion. Advertisement The singer-songwriter is a sponsor and minority shareholder of his hometown club Ipswich and was celebrating the newly-promoted side’s 1-1 draw against United. He was criticised on social media following the incident but issued a statement to explain his interruption was an accident. “Apologies if I offended Amorim yesterday, didn’t actually realise he was being interviewed at the time, was popping to say hi and bye to Jamie,” Sheeran wrote on social media. “Obvz feel a bit of a b****** but life goes on. Great game tho, congrats to all involved x”. After overseeing a 1-1 draw during his debut match in charge, Amorim was giving his first post-match interview to the Premier League’s primary UK broadcaster Sky Sports as United head coach. The 39-year-old was asked by pundit Izzy Christiansen what had impressed him the most from his new players in training in the build-up to Sunday’s fixture and what he wanted to take forward from the game. “You start discovering things: Garnacho can hold the ball between lines,” Amorim replied. “You can see that in the game because the game is always open. You try to find these things. Bruno Fernandes, he improved his game by playing near the ball, feeling the ball. He can give us sometimes the long pass. But you cannot put him there all the time, because he wants the long pass. He concluded: “We try to find things about the players. We will need a lot of time, a lot of time to work out these things.” As presenter Kelly Cates began to ask the next question, the camera panned out to Sheeran greeting Redknapp. “Ed Sheeran has joined us,” Cates said. “Ed, we’re just speaking to Ruben Amorim, who may not want to talk to an Ipswich fan.” “I don’t think he wants to speak to me. He doesn’t want to speak to me,” Sheeran said. Ed Sheeran crashed Ruben Amorim's first post-match interview  😂 pic.twitter.com/cTSMgyTE8w — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) November 24, 2024  Attempting to keep Sheeran’s appearance short and sweet, Cates said: “From an Ipswich point of view, it was almost perfect?” “I loved it, I love being back in the Premier League,” Sheeran replied. Redknapp then promised to speak to Sheeran later, who left the pitch-side desk and departed out of shot. Advertisement “Thanks very much Ed. Ruben, it’s an unpredictable when we’re pitch-side,” Cates explained, before resuming the post-match interview. Sheeran was subsequently labelled “rude” and “disrespectful” on social media, and Sky also faced criticism following the incident.  Sheeran grew up in Suffolk and is a boyhood Ipswich fan. He has been the club’s front-of-shirt sponsor since the 2021-22 season, with the club in League One. This was welcomed by supporters, the club having previously been sponsored by gambling company Magical Vegas and former owner Marcus Evans. Ipswich have since enjoyed back-to-back promotions under Kieran McKenna and, in May, secured a return to the Premier League following a 22-year absence. Sheeran designed the club’s third kit for the 2021-22 campaign and appeared in this season’s promotional video for the third strip. In August, it was announced the four-time Grammy Award winner had bought a minority stake in the club, and he is regularly pictured at matches.     A post shared by Ed Sheeran (@teddysphotos)  “I have lived in Suffolk since I was three years old and, while I travel the world and sometimes feel like an outsider in big cities, Suffolk and Ipswich have always made me feel part of the community and protected,” Sheeran said this summer. TNT Sports featured an interview with Sheeran and Peter Crouch ahead of Ipswich’s opening match of the Premier League season against Liverpool, and he was pictured greeting the Sky Sports punditry team in the studio ahead of Sunday’s fixture against United. Ipswich have won just one of their opening 12 games and are among the favourites for relegation this season, but came from a goal down inside the opening two minutes to secure a 1-1 draw against United.

Here are how the two substitutes’ benches look ahead of kick-off: What do you make of the two matchday squads and starting XIs? Let us know in either the Discuss tab for subscribers, or with an email: livebloguk@theathletic.com  Advertisement As for the visitors, here is who Luis Enrique has selected from the start as Paris Saint-Germain look to make up lost ground on their Champions League rivals: Next up, the sides’ substitute lists. Cue the official teams from Germany. Here is Vincent Kompany’s Bayern Munich XI to take on PSG:  Both benches are on the way shortly too. Getty Images Hello and welcome again to our live coverage of matchday five from this season’s Champions League — and specifically for today, a big one in Bavaria as Bayern Munich host Paris Saint-Germain.   PSG are in difficulties with just four points from their opening four games, while Bayern did at least arrest some of their worries and losing momentum in the Champions League, with a victory at home to Benfica last time out.  We’ve got reporters at the game and watching on, and we’ll bring you all the colour and context you need to know before, during and after the match.  So in short, don’t go anywhere. The teams are on the way, kick-off won’t be much longer and we’ve got you covered from here.  Getty Images It is currently half-time in today's two early Champions League matches: In Slovakia, USMNT star Christian Pulisic scored the opening goal for Milan but Slovan Bratislava equalised just a couple of minutes later. At the same time in Prague, Atletico Madrid have a commanding lead thanks to goals from Julian Alvarez and Marcus Llorente. Getty Images And it was Kane who sat next to Kompany during the pre-match press conference — he was asked about Bayern's slow start to the Champions League campaign. ""We are not used to being so far down (the table), he said. ""But I don’t think anyone is familiar with the new system yet. We have to win the remaining games to get into the top eight. ""It will be a difficult game. There’s a lot at stake, we are aware of that."" Advertisement Getty Images Harry Kane is enjoying another super season for Bayern Munich having made another blistering goalscoring start. He is level with three other players as the leading Champions League goalscorer this term. 5 goals – Harry Kane, Raphinha, Viktor Gyokeres, Robert Lewandowski 4 goals – Jonathan David, Vinicius Junior 3 goals – 14 players  PSG have not made the start to their Champions League campaign that they would have wanted — the French giants have won just one of their first four games and their hopes of an automatic knockout spot are dwindling. ""It's obvious that after four matches, including three at the Parc des Princes, with fair or unfair results, unfair for me, we have to have good results to qualify,"" said Luis Enrique. ""We made things difficult for ourselves. Football is what it is. You have to score. ""We will give it our all, we will be brave, we will take risks, as we usually do."" Getty Images Like Kompany, PSG head coach Luis Enrique knows that this evening's opponents pose a real threat. ""It is very clear that we are two teams that are similar,"" he said yesterday. We want to have the ball, we press very high... we have similar statistics. ""We are among the best teams with goal chances but there will only be one ball. And so one team will have to suffer. Them, or us. ""We'll probably have to go further against Bayern. Run more, raise the level, especially against Bayern at home."" Getty Images Bayern manager Vincent Kompany is well aware of the size of the task facing his players at the Allianz Arena later this evening. ""We are playing against one of the big clubs in Europe,"" he said in his pre-match press conference. ""They have a lot of individual quality and a very good coach. Both teams will want to win. We are playing at home and this match is of utmost importance to us. ""It's a squad with incredible talent. The spaces between the lines are never big, the pressing is very aggressive and good. When they have the ball, they have a clear attacking approach. ""As a team, they are really very good."" Getty Images The players are gathered in the tunnel in the capital cities of Slovakia and the Czech Republic. That is because the two early matches in today's Champions League are minutes away from starting. Milan and Atletico Madrid are both in the lower middle part of the table so they will both be hoping to push up the table with wins on the road — we'll have half-time and full-time updates for you from those two matches:  Advertisement Getty Images We would love to hear from you in the build-up to today's game. We are running our usual matchday discussion, which you can access by clicking the 'Discuss' tab at the top of this page or by clicking here. We want to see score predictions, thoughts on the match and conversations with your fellow subscribers. Some of your messages may even feature in our live coverage throughout the night! Getty Images PSG have struggled with injuries at times this season, but their problems are showing signs of easing. They will be without Lucas Hernandez and Senny Maylulu this evening, but Goncalo Ramos and Presnel Kimpembe are both part of the travelling party, the latter after almost two years on the sidelines following an ACL injury suffered in February 2023. Elsewhere, Nuno Mendes missed the win against Toulouse on Friday but is also part of the group in Munich so should be fit to be involved. Getty Images Not too many injury problems for Vincent Kompany to worry about as Aleksandar Pavlovic and Josip Stanisic have returned to first-team training after their recent issues. The Bayern manager is, however, without Joao Palhinha owing to an adductor injury sustained on international duty. Hiroki Ito has not yet played for the club since signing in the summer after a foot injury that has been operated on twice. Mathys Tel is a doubt after missing the weekend's win against Augsburg so may not be included today. Getty Images Four years ago, in 2020, Bayern Munich beat Paris Saint-Germain 1-0 in the Champions League final.  Tonight, they meet for the third time since. Those four years — an Olympic cycle, a World Cup cycle — is a period of time that lends itself to assessing how the two clubs, which share as many similarities as differences, have changed. The Athletic dives deeper below. GO FURTHER Bayern Munich vs PSG: Four years after meeting in the Champions League final, how have they changed? Interestingly, this fixture has the quirk of being played 13 times and never drawn. That makes it the most-played European fixture for both clubs where every game has had a winner. Advertisement  The bottom half of the standings is littered with big teams who haven't got their continental campaigns off to ideal starts. Milan are 20th, Atletico 23rd, while PSG lie 25th after just one win from their opening four matches in Europe. That said, the table is still quite bunched: 10th-placed Manchester City are just three points ahead of PSG.  So both teams at the Allianz Arena tonight know they could massively aid their hopes of progression with a win. Lots on the line! The Athletic Liverpool top the standings at the moment, the only side with four wins from their four matches. British sides Aston Villa, Manchester City, Arsenal, and Celtic are all competing to be in those top eight places too. Bayern Munich and Real Madrid are lagging behind where they would want to be, lying 17th and 18th respectively, firmly mid-table. Getty Images The second half of the Champions League’s league stage begins today with another set of mouthwatering fixtures. Four games in, the league table has started to take shape, and though a lot could yet change, this seems like a suitable time to measure how teams have done in relation to expectations.  So The Athletic has looked at the teams who have overperformed, underperformed and those who have played in line with expectations, using our projections, powered by Opta. Enjoy.

The 21-year-old midfielder said his enjoyment returned during former interim head coach Lee Carsley’s final camp in charge, after believing he had been “a little bit mistreated” during England’s run to the Euro 2024 final, where they lost to Spain. Advertisement Bellingham started all seven of England’s matches at the Euros but said he faced criticism for his attitude and willingness to participate in media duties, which resulted in his mother not wanting to leave the house following the tournament. Asked about a post on Instagram this month where he referred getting his “smile back in an England shirt”, Bellingham replied: “When I’ve reviewed the (Real Madrid) games I think my form has been OK, well, pretty good to be honest, I’ve just not been scoring goals. “I’ve got to be honest, I think I lost my smile a lot after the Euros when it came to playing for England. I felt like I was a little bit mistreated in comparison to what I contributed. I felt like some of it was a bit harsh on me, I think I felt a bit like the scapegoat. Maybe I was feeling a little bit sorry for myself. “I think that (November England) camp with a lot of new faces really brought out the joy in my game again. I think you can see that in the two games (against Republic of Ireland and Greece). “In general I hadn’t lost my smile in a Madrid shirt. I’m annoyed when we lose and I’m and I get frustrated and upset when we lost but it’s never a case of not being happy. I’m the luckiest lad in the world, I get to play week in, week out for the biggest club in the world and represent my country. It was more to do with how I was treated off the back of the Euros. But yeah, the smile is back.” Bellingham provided two goals and an assist during England’s run to the Euro 2024 final. After scoring a 95th-minute overhead kick against Slovakia in the last-16 to send the tie to extra time, he said it was a the perfect response to people “talking a lot of rubbish”, adding: “It feels like it’s a bit of a pile-on”. “Pressure is no problem,” he continued. I understand that with Madrid the expectation is very high, as with the national team. I felt that I had contributed very well in the Euros at key moments and it seemed that the world was breaking down around me. They were not good moments. Advertisement “There was criticism that I didn’t speak to the media, I didn’t do a press conference and they said I was above all this, and it wasn’t like that: I was with my family during the tournament, with my grandparents too. “They crossed a line of respect and that’s why I take it personally. My mother didn’t want to leave the house after the tournament. It was something very personal for me, that’s why I decided to keep quiet.” Madrid return to action against Liverpool in the Champions League on Wednesday. GO DEEPER Jude Bellingham - who else?

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Isaiah Hartenstein, a 'dream big' for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, discusses decision to join Thunder",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5948886/2024/11/26/isaiah-hartenstein-shai-gilgeous-alexander-thunder-nba/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 18:31:10 GMT","Hartenstein knew OKC was the right team for him when the team's decision-makers traveled to ""some random hotel"" in Eugene, Oregon.","NBA SACRAMENTO — In the days leading up to NBA free agency, Isaiah Hartenstein had a family situation that forced him to reroute his location from Texas to Oregon. He needed to visit his grandparents in Eugene. So any free-agency pitches would either need to wait, go virtual or make a detour for the Pacific Northwest. Advertisement The Oklahoma City Thunder decision-makers acted quickly. They’d previously planned to make the quick flight down to Houston to pitch Hartenstein, their top target. The itinerary was altered. Thunder general manager Sam Presti, head coach Mark Daigneault and their long-time lead medical voice, Donnie Strack, flew from Oklahoma City to Eugene. “It’s not like I was in a nice little Los Angeles setup (like most NBA free-agent meetings),” Hartenstein told The Athletic. “We were in some random hotel in Eugene. Can’t remember the name.” The gesture, to Hartenstein, “meant a lot,” considering the family reasons that forced it, a sign of both how the Thunder operated and how much they coveted him. On the team side, the location meant little considering the potential reward. They would’ve met Hartenstein anywhere, planting a large chunk of their available cap space on the table for a player who franchise face Shai Gilgeous-Alexander called a “dream big man for a marquee guy” late Monday night after the Thunder’s 130-109 win over the Sacramento Kings. “I always kind of knew how the organization was from afar,” Hartenstein said. “But then to have them come out and present it all to me, explain how they kind of wanted to play me, explain the culture, it was just something really exciting for me. It’s a young group of guys who play the right way, first in the West and I felt like there was something I could bring that could really help.” Hartenstein signed a hefty three-year, $87 million deal with some built in team-friendly aspects. The deal declines from $30 million to $28.5 million from the first to second season and the third season is a team option, creating financial flexibility right as Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren will be stepping into their expected big money extensions. Advertisement It’s been a steady rise for Hartenstein. He went to the Houston Rockets as the No. 43 pick in the 2017 NBA Draft and bounced from the Denver Nuggets to Cleveland Cavaliers to the LA Clippers in his first three seasons. He finally gained some career traction as a rotation big on a 42-40 Clippers team back in the 2021-22 season. Analytics models loved him. The New York Knicks stole him away on a two-year, $16 million deal. Hartenstein took off in New York as a rugged center who could start or come off the bench, protect the rim at a high level, rebound like crazy, make better than 60 percent of his shots, burn defenses with his floater and blast open driving lanes with his physical screening. He was a key part of a great Knicks team. Gilgeous-Alexander, the publicly reserved but very aware star guard of the Thunder, watched from afar and took notice. “To be honest with you, I was watching the playoffs and I am aware of contract situations in the league,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “So I kind of knew (of his availability) as he was playing. And then once I saw the Knicks make all those moves in the summertime without him involved, I was kind of, like, ‘Hmm…'” The Knicks swung a blockbuster trade for Mikal Bridges in late June and maintained a pretty public plan to also bring back OG Anunoby at a steep price. Considering the new CBA apron rules, that restricted how much they could pay Hartenstein, opening the door for Presti and the Thunder to break it down. “I leave the front office stuff to Sam,” Gilgeous-Alexander said when asked if he made a call about it. “Trust him really well. Obviously he reads minds. So I didn’t have to say anything. … We knew as a group and the world kinda knew there was a hole in us as a team last year. I think Isaiah fills that hole very well. Sam did a good job filling it. We are better because of it.” Advertisement That has finally started to show this past week. Hartenstein fractured his hand in the preseason and missed the first 14 games. He returned off the bench and played 29 minutes in a home win over the Portland Trail Blazers, putting up 13 points, 14 rebounds, three assists and four blocks. He then backed that up on Monday night with 19 points, 10 rebounds and four assists, sliding into the Thunder’s starting lineup as the lone healthy center as Holmgren recovers from a broken hip. “Offensive rebounding, defensive rebounding, size in general,” Gilgeous-Alexander said when asked what Hartenstein adds. “A lot of times we have found ourselves doubling the post just because we’re undersized. We don’t have to as much anymore. You know, he’s very skilled, can pass. I’m sure you saw it today. He had one behind his back falling down.” Here is the pass Gilgeous-Alexander mentioned. Hartenstein’s value feels outsized in this current moment considering Holmgren’s injury status. The Thunder’s franchise center is currently on crutches and isn’t expected to even get a re-evaluation for nearly two months. A long absence awaits and, in the meantime, Hartenstein profiles as the starting center in an otherwise small-ball environment for a Thunder team favored to grab the top seed in the conference. But Hartenstein chose the Thunder — and they targeted him — with Holmgren’s inclusion as part of the equation, believing that both big men could not only survive but thrive on the court together. In their best theoretical playoff version, both are paired up in the frontcourt for large chunks of the game. That was part of their pitch — join a team that already has an elite franchise center because that isn’t the only position he will play. “Just knowing that he (Holmgren) can play at the four, too, (appealed to me),” Hartenstein said. “Knowing this wasn’t like a situation where I’m blocked. Or it’s like I’m not starting at all. It was a situation where I knew he could play at the four. I can play the five. I felt like we could complement each other.” They haven’t played a regular-season second together and won’t for the next couple months. But Hartenstein and Holmgren did share some preseason minutes together and the results were intriguing. Advertisement “The rim protection is one thing,” Hartenstein said. “I feel like we’re two of the elite rim protectors in the league. We approach it a little different. He’ll probably have more blocks. I’m more of a guy (whose impact is shown in) opponent field goal percentage around the rim.” They connected on a couple dribble handoff actions in a preseason game against the San Antonio Spurs. “That was really fun,” Hartenstein said. Here’s one clip. Daigneault called Hartenstein the best screener he’s ever coached, noting his craft and subtle tactics. That includes a situation like below, where he walls off a lane for Holmgren to drive and dunk after delivering the dribble handoff. The Thunder had the third-worst rebound rate a season ago. It burned them in their second-round playoff loss to the Dallas Mavericks. They have the worst rebound rate this season, playing a large portion without a center. Hartenstein was added in part to help correct that. He is one of the league’s best rebounders. Two games is far too small a sample for anything in the NBA, but the early results are positive. Hartenstein has played two games, grabbed 24 rebounds and, in those two games, the Thunder has a 53.8 rebound rate, fifth in the NBA during that mini portion of the schedule. “I’m not coming in here to change anything they’re doing,” Hartenstein said. “I’m just kind of here to enhance anything I can. I mean, I’m just kind of the player I am. I try to make everyone’s life easier. I’m going to rebound, help connect the team, facilitate, defend the bigger guys, protect the rim. So I just feel like there’s a lot of, like different scenarios where I could help the team, but I’m not going to come in and change the way they play. I mean, they play the way I like to play anyway.” Advertisement That was part of the Thunder’s pitch in Eugene. “I’m a very present day-by-day type of guy,” Hartenstein said. “And that was the first thing that they kind of mentioned: We don’t want to skip steps. That’s a thing that certain teams don’t do. They were being honest and just tell me what they needed from me. And I felt like I could bring something to the team that already was first in the West that could really help them get over the hurdle.” (Photo of Hartenstein: Thearon W.

They face off in a Maui Invitational semifinal Tuesday night.,"Sports Betting North Carolina was down 21 points, then completed a furious comeback with Drake Powell’s corner 3-pointer with just over a minute left. Auburn was down 16 at the half, only to win on Johni Broome’s tip-in in the final seconds. They face each other the next night. The Maui Invitational is a lovely delirium. Venue: Lāhainā Civic Center — Lāhainā, Hawaii
Time: Tuesday, 11 p.m. ET
TV: ESPN
Streaming: Fubo (try for free) The Tigers were on the wrong side of a 49-33 intermission after Iowa State’s Milan Momcilovic hit a smooth fadeaway to end the half. Then Auburn’s Chad Baker-Mazara started hitting 3-pointers, and freshman Tahaad Pettiford again showed seismic confidence off the bench in pressure possessions. With the game tied at 81 and the clock winding out, Denver Jones sliced through the lane for the win. No dice for him, but Broome split two Cyclone rebounders to get the deflection up and in. That’s a second top-five win for Bruce Pearl’s program — in November. Advertisement In the nightcap, the Tar Heels pulled off some misadventures of their own. UNC was a much bigger favorite than Auburn, yet was down 18 at halftime. Maybe it was jet lag because this team came alive late. Seth Trimble looked like a man possessed, finishing with 27 points on 10-for-14 shooting. The slumping RJ Davis had his best game of the season with 30 points, seven boards and five assists. After two wild comebacks, these teams meet in the second semifinal of the Maui Invitational. Michigan State and Memphis play in the first semifinal. Of the final four teams, Auburn and Memphis have never won the tournament. Michigan State did back in 1991. North Carolina is a four-time champion (1999, 2004, 2008, 2016). North Carolina is eighth in the nation in points per game and 13th in offensive rating. Auburn is 11th in offensive rating and second in effective field goal percentage. The proclivity for drama and undeniable talent on both sides should justify staying awake for a Hawaii-Aleutian Standard Time start. Memorable Matchup: 2019 NCAA Tournament — the fifth-seeded Tigers thumped No. 1 UNC in the Sweet Sixteen, 97-80. Chuma Okeke led the way with 20 points on just 11 shots. From The New York Times’ Joe Drape: “Sometimes, basketball can be a simple game: You run, you shoot. For nearly all 40 minutes of their Midwest Region semifinal on Friday, North Carolina and Auburn went at each other in a furious contest that was part Olympic relay race, part barroom Pop-A-Shot game. When it was over, the capacity crowd at Sprint Center had sore necks and racing hearts, while the fifth-seeded Auburn Tigers had a 97-80 upset victory that moved them a step closer to their first national basketball title.”  (Photo of Johni Broome: Brian Spurlock / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How Kevin Love is finding ways to make impact in limited minutes for the Heat,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5949486/2024/11/26/kevin-love-heat-today/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 18:07:41 GMT","The former All-Star is mostly a floor-spacing role player, but he's given Miami a big lift. ""They just love playing with him.""","NBA Kevin Love is maximizing his impact as a role player while showing his greatness in shorter flashes. The 36-year-old NBA veteran has transitioned into one of Miami’s leading bench players since joining the Heat last year. Before this chapter, Love established himself as an All-Star (five selections), one of the world’s premiere players (two All-NBA nods) and a champion (he won a ring with the 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers). These days, he’s enjoying his growing family away from the court while offering collaboration and encouragement to his teammates. Advertisement Though Love’s minutes have regressed, his impact remains undeniable as he continues to adjust his game to more of a floor-spacer. Of his 41 field-goal attempts, 25 have been 3s, and he’s shooting a career-best 44 percent so far behind the arc. He and Bam Adebayo have played 50 minutes together, resulting in a net rating of plus-12.7 entering Tuesday’s NBA Cup matchup against the Milwaukee Bucks. In his Nov. 10 season debut, Love brought the ball up against Minnesota’s Rudy Gobert. Even a split second of indecision from Gobert left Love with enough space, time and rhythm to knock down a pull-up 3-pointer.   During Sunday’s win over the Dallas Mavericks, the mere threat of Love attempting a 3 was enough for center Daniel Gafford to leap on the closeout before Love repositioned himself for a wide-open attempt. Miami ranks ninth among all teams in catch-and-shoot 3-point percentage this season (38.6). After missing Miami’s first eight games of the season, Love started his first four appearances before coming off the bench in his last two (both Heat wins). Since his season debut, he’s yet to log 20 minutes in a game and is averaging respective career-lows across the board, but that happens when high usage becomes spot minutes. Love’s minutes (13.5 per game) and scoring average (7.3) don’t fully frame the impact he’s provided Miami’s bench, especially given the team’s limitations because of injury or player development. Rookie big man Kel’el Ware is a promising shot-blocker with floor-spacing potential. At only 20, Ware plays even more sparingly than Love. He’s eclipsed the 10-minute mark only once –  and that was roughly three weeks ago – but Love remains readily encouraged about this year’s No. 15 pick to soon find his footing as he and other team veterans aid Ware’s strides. The rookie big hasn’t found himself feeling discouraged as he develops, and veteran presences like Love and Adebayo sharing their experiences can only help promising players like Ware eventually find their own NBA identity. Advertisement “And it’s all of us, all the bigs have been working with Kel’el a lot,” Love said about working with Ware. “So it’s not just me. It’s not just Bam [Adebayo], it’s everybody putting their best forward to just help each other and try to better communicate. That’s something we’re working on right now. You can hear a great team, so we just need to continue to communicate.” Along with still being one of the NBA’s most respected voices and feared shooters, Love’s knack for rebounding and whipping outlet passes for teammates racing down the court for easy scores remains some of the most fun basketball to watch. He’s been impressing hoop fans with his outlet passes for as long as we can remember, so it’s not surprising how much fun teammates can have when racing around and trusting Love’s strong hands, keen eyes and high basketball IQ will create scoring opportunities. Here, in another example against Minnesota, Love is ready to whip the outlet pass to a streaking Terry Rozier III before most of the other players even cross halfcourt. During Sunday’s overtime win against Dallas, Love collaborated with Jimmy Butler on a long-range assist after Mavericks forward P.J. Washington missed a free throw with under four minutes left in the third period. “Man, I love playing with K Love,” Butler said of his teammate on Monday. “He’s so smart. He’s always looking to make the right play every single time. With him on the floor, it’s so much space. It’s just like a head nod. I know what he’s thinking. He knows what I’m thinking. We talk about it because we’re one of the vet-vets on this team. But the one thing that we always keep in common is that we definitely want to win.” Kevin Love with the outlet 🔥

Before he debuted this season, the Heat ranked only 19th in defensive rebound rate (69.8 percent). In the time since, Miami ranks third in that category (73.5). It’s safe to say touchdown assists and home run-esque 3s have a home in Miami’s rotation this season. “They just love playing with him,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “He’s going to glass-eat. And all he wants to do is set you up for an opportunity going the other way, and those are important advantage opportunities for us.” (Top photo: Issac Baldizon / Getty Images ) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Victor Wembanyama's up-and-down season: Is he shooting too many 3s for Spurs?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5949516/2024/11/26/victor-wembanyama-ups-downs-spurs/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 17:55:32 GMT",Opponents are putting their best perimeter and most aggressive defenders on Wembanyama.,"NBA Victor Wembanyama’s sophomore season with the San Antonio Spurs has been one of fits and starts. Having already mastered numerous American idioms — his self-avowed favorite is “low key” — the reigning NBA Rookie of the Year, born and raised in France, likely won’t need The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms to understand his first month of the 2024-25 season has included “short, inconsistent and irregular intervals” of productive play. Advertisement Spurs coach Gregg Popovich made a point of lowering expectations for the start of Wembanyama’s second season even before it began. Cognizant that the 20-year-old’s rigorous schedule of near-constant play for the previous 18 months — a full 2023 season with Metropolitans 92 in the French LNB Élite Pro A League; an NBA rookie season that culminated with his unanimous rookie honor; and, finally, weeks of practice and play with the silver medalist French national team in the 2024 Olympics in his native land — Popovich cautioned anyone willing to listen that it was going to take time for Wembanyama to re-establish the rhythm of NBA play. “I don’t think he’ll be in great rhythm to start the season,” Popovich said after the Spurs completed a five-game preseason schedule in which the 7-foot-3 sensation played only twice. Wembanyama agreed with the NBA’s all-time winningest coach but assured that the return of his rhythm wouldn’t take long once the regular season began. Then the regular season arrived, but Wembanyama’s full rhythm didn’t. Through the first six games, he went 22 of 54 from the floor, including 4 of 21 on 3-point shots. After he scored a career-low six points in a 105-93 loss in Oklahoma City on Oct. 30, even casual Spurs observers questioned his shot selection to that point: 48 inside the arc, 41 beyond it. Popovich, who is now recovering from a mild stroke he suffered on Nov. 2, was not among the distressed. After what would turn out to be his final game on the bench before the stroke, a win at Utah on Halloween night, the Hall of Fame coach made it clear Wembanyama had a green light to fire away from deep. “He is more of a perimeter player than he is a post player,” Popovich said after Wembanyama followed that career-low night in Oklahoma City with a 25-point output, including 4 of 13 from 3-point range against the Jazz. “We want him to be able to do everything: isolate, shoot, do the whole deal.” Advertisement Wembanyama’s justification for his increased emphasis beyond the arc: “It’s just to play my game,” he said, “and my game involves shooting 3s too.” Wembanyama’s teammates are foursquare supportive of that approach to his game. After 8-of-16 3-point shooting was instrumental in the first 50-point game of the 20-year-old’s young career in a win over the Washington Wizards on Nov. 13, fellow long-range bomber Julian Champagnie, 38 of 111 on 3s this season, endorsed Wembanyama’s emulation of Steph Curry. “We want him to shoot those shots,” Champagnie said. “(He’s) obviously a special, special player. It’s not always going to be by the paint for him. Teams are going to play him differently. Tonight was the three, 8 of 16. … If it’s 1 of 16 or 8 of 16 or 16 of 16, keep shooting them, because he’ll get them. “He’s 7 foot 5, so there’s no closeout that’s going to get to him. So, keep shooting them.” Despite Wembanyama’s height, be it his officially listed 7-3 or an informed estimation like Champagnie’s 7-5, many of the NBA’s teams appear to have a new defensive “book” on him that helps explain some of the inconsistent and irregular intervals he’s experienced. They treat him like the perimeter player Popovich insists he truly is, giving their best perimeter and most aggressive defenders the assignment to guard him. Houston’s annoying defensive pest, Dillon Brooks, who is 6 foot 6, has become the template for frustrating the Spurs star. The Rockets are 2-1 against the Spurs with Wembanyama shooting just 23 percent (4 of 17) from beyond the arc in games in which Brooks has been his defensive menace. LA Clippers coach Ty Lue even put 6-5 guard James Harden on Wemby for a few short stretches of a Nov. 4 game at Intuit Dome. Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billips asked 6-7 Jerami Grant to guard Wembanyama on Nov. 7 and his aggression earned him an away-from-play technical foul after he twice pushed Wembanyama to the floor as the two wrestled for space in the paint before a play. Advertisement The Oklahoma City Thunder, missing injured Chet Holmgren in their second matchup against the Spurs, let 6-5 Alex Caruso do his best impression of Brooks for significant stretches of a Nov. 19 game. It has been an adjustment, both for Wembanyama and his teammates, who have reacted to the aggressive attention Wembanyama is getting on the perimeter by leveraging the spacing it creates for them. It helps that Wembanyama’s new teammates Harrison Barnes (43.9 percent) and Chris Paul (38.6 percent) are knocking down 3-pointers at a high rate, helping the Spurs go from 28th in 3-point percentage last season to 18th entering Tuesday’s game in Salt Lake City against the Jazz. Wembanyama also has adjusted. Sitting at 22 percent from deep after his first six games, he has regained his 3-point mojo. Over his last eight games — he missed three with a badly bruised left knee — he has made 29 of 71 (40.8 percent) from long range. “It’s less an individual thing than wanting to get our offense to progress,” Wembanyama said of making the long-range game a major part of his offensive repertoire. “Basketball is a game we have to play to have fun, and that comes with being aggressive and having good spacing and not hesitating.” Mitch Johnson, who enters Tuesday’s game having guided the Spurs to seven wins in his 12 games as interim coach, appreciates the adjustments Wembanyama has made, especially his adapting to being hectored by smaller defenders. He appreciates Wembanyama’s occasional pump fake and dribble drive and jab step and stepback to get more room for his 3-pointers. “He’s taken his time a little bit more,” Johnson said. “I think he’s been a little bit more decisive. There are times when, because of that type of defense, there’s going to be an initial level of resistance or physicality. When he plays through that, that’s where we’re getting a ton of opportunities. (The defenders) have no choice but to help.” Advertisement When defenders help, Wembanyama has been much better lately at finding open teammates. This was never more evident than in the fourth quarter of his return against the Golden State Warriors on Saturday after his week-long injury absence. That win over the Western Conference leaders seemed like a microcosm of Wembanyama’s up-and-down season with the fourth quarter the distinctly up part after three miserable quarters. Through the first three, Wembanyama missed 7 of 12 shots, including 5 of 7 3-point attempts. He grabbed only six rebounds, blocked but one shot and committed a team-high four turnovers. Not surprisingly, the Spurs went to the fourth quarter trailing Golden State 81-71. Wembanyama then played 10-plus minutes of the fourth. He made 4 of 9 shots (2 of 6 from 3), grabbed five rebounds, had five assists, blocked two shots, committed nary a turnover and led an aggressive Spurs defense that limited the Warriors to 13 points. The result was a 104-94 win that put the Spurs at 9-8 on the season. They haven’t had a winning record so deep into a season since beginning the 2020-21 campaign 11-10. Johnson figured Wembanyama would need a quarter or two to shake off some rust after sitting out the previous three games. “Yeah, he’s had an off-and-on start, like we’ve all talked about for a few months now,” Johnson said afterward. “So, some of his stints (tonight) were probably a little shorter just to try to maximize his production and effort. “But he was a grown man in the fourth quarter. Some of his rebounds, some of his catches, some of his passes, some of his simple stuff … that is a really big emphasis for him because he does these amazing things. It’s so natural that when he can command the fundamentals and dominate the fundamentals, he’s a load.” Paul, the 39-year-old “Point God” whose presence has been instrumental in teaching the Spurs how to finish games, denies personal credit for Wembanyama’s recent surge in offensive efficiency. He has witnessed his young teammate’s dedication to improvement, including perfecting fundamentals. Advertisement “I wish you guys could see the work that goes in, day in and day out,” Paul said after Wembanyama went 6 of 12 from 3-point range, scored 34 points and grabbed 14 rebounds in a win over the Sacramento Kings on Nov. 11. “There’s things that happen in the game where we all see (his) growth, everybody on the team. “So, it’s fun to see that. You know how talented he is, but (it’s) his will to want to get better; his will to want to work on things.” The entire league saw Wembanyama’s will to improve during his rookie season, which he closed by averaging 25.8 points, 10.1 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 3.9 blocks in his final 10 games. Should we expect the same progression from him this season? History suggests sophomore seasons often feature major improvements after players have adapted to the pace and physicality of the NBA. But, asked if he had turned a corner after his early shooting struggles this season, Wembanyama denied the corner’s existence. “That’s not how progression goes,” he said. “I’m not going to be shooting 66 percent in my career, but I’m also not going to be shooting 25 percent. So, this is how progression goes. We don’t want to overreact in one way or the other. It’s what else to expect. It’s just how a career goes. “I’m very young. I’ve got 75 games in my career, so it’s got to be like that.” For someone whose “fits-and-starts” season already includes a 50-point game and a second “5×5” that put him in an exclusive club with Hakeem Olajuwon and Andrei Kirilenko, that is a frightening prospect, though Wembanyama is sure to be the one who remains low key about it.

But the total amount of money split between the 12 MLB postseason teams this year, $129.1 million, was a record.  Each year, playoff clubs vote on how many full shares, partial shares and dollar awards to give out inside their organizations, which means the amount each person is awarded varies. Players often choose to reward staffers who are around the team throughout the season. Advertisement The World Series champion gets 36 percent of the pool, and the losing World Series team 24 percent. This year those amounts came out to a total of $46,473,177 and $30,982,118, respectively. The two teams eliminated in the League Championship Series get 12 percent apiece. The Division Series losers each get 3.25 percent, and the teams that don’t advance beyond the Wild Card each get 0.75 percent. The Dodgers gave out 79 full shares, 17.49 partial shares and $405,000 in cash awards. The New York Yankees, the runners-up, awarded 71 full shares worth $354,572 and 16.38 partial shares. Full shares for the other 2024 playoff teams were worth: • Cleveland Guardians (72 shares) $182,663 • New York Mets (68) $179,948 • Detroit Tigers (67) $55,729 • Philadelphia Phillies (63) $52,278 • Kansas City Royals (68) $49,583 • San Diego Padres (77) $45,985 • Baltimore Orioles (67) $11,870 • Houston Astros (76) $10,749 • Milwaukee Brewers (68) $10,013 • Atlanta Braves (86) $9,548 The pool is made up of 60 percent of gate receipts from the first four games of the World Series and the LCS, the first three games of every DS, and the first two games of every Wild Card Series. Road teams in the best-of-three Wild Card Series have travel expenses deducted to a maximum of $100,000. It’s harder to compare numbers from prior years because the postseason field expanded to 12 teams from 10 in 2022, the start of the current collective bargaining agreement. Last year’s playoffs created $107.8 million in pool money, a then-record. The winner, the Texas Rangers, distributed full shares worth $506,263.  The 2022 figures were similar: The pool that year was $107.5 million, and the champion Houston Astros gave out $516,347, the record for an individual share.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Explaining why Barcelona have closed part of their ground 'indefinitely',https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5949974/2024/11/26/barcelona-montjuic-fans-behaviour/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 17:47:54 GMT",Barca believe a group of fans should repay the money the club have been fined for crowd misbehaviour. The supporters involved disagree...,"UCL Barcelona find themselves in a stand-off with a section of their fanbase after closing part of their home stadium “indefinitely” over fines related to supporters’ bad behaviour. The club believe the groups making up their official supporters’ stand should reimburse them for these fines. Those groups disagree. Advertisement On Tuesday, Barcelona announced they would close part of Estadi Olimpic Lluis Companys, where they are playing home matches while the Camp Nou undergoes extensive renovations, before their Champions League match there tonight against French visitors Brest. Part of the lower north end of the stadium will be left empty. In a statement, Barca said the Espai d’Animacio (supporters’ space) would be “closed due to non-compliance by the groups that form part of the obligations they have assumed with the club”. So, what is going on and why have the club taken this decision?  Barcelona have been fined a total of €21,000 ($22,000; £18,000) by Spain’s La Liga, European football’s governing body UEFA and the Generalitat de Catalunya (the Catalonian government) since the start of last season for fan behaviour. The latest example was a €10,000 UEFA punishment after a banner with Nazi connotations was displayed in the away end during the Champions League game away to Monaco, of France’s Ligue 1, in September that read ‘Flick heil’, referring to Barca’s new German manager Hansi Flick. The nature of the banner was the final trigger for the club to take action against any similar behaviour. Barcelona said they had been subject to “14 disciplinary proceedings for behaviour contrary to the regulations in force in the supporters’ area”. GO DEEPER Barcelona handed suspended UEFA ban after fans' 'racist behaviour' against PSG The club have already paid the fines but demanded the four groups that make up the supporters’ stand reimburse them in an attempt to stop this sort of behaviour. Club president Joan Laporta gave the groups — Almogavers, Front 532, Nostra Ensenya and Supporters Barca — 15 days to pay but they refused to do so, as they do not think this is their responsibility. Barcelona and the fan groups signed a collaboration agreement last season that, according to the club, meant they were entitled to claim a refund from the supporters’ stand for any disciplinary fines associated with that part of the stadium. But Albert Yarza, president of Almogavers, said the groups were unaware of the situation. Advertisement “During this process, the groups have been given up to three deadlines to comply with their obligations. The last one expired at midnight last night without any result,” the club statement read. “Having failed to comply with their obligations by any of the deadlines granted, Barcelona is closing the Espai d’Animacio indefinitely.” “We are sad and surprised by the club’s reaction,” Almogavers’ Yarza told The Athletic. “The club has set a deadline for the payment of the €21,000 and we have not agreed to pay it because it means taking on responsibilities that we believe we do not have. The club is punishing us today by not allowing us to go to the stadium.” Yarza said he believed the club would hold a meeting shortly to discuss the issue to find an outcome that was “no longer conditional on us making the payment and unblocking the situation”. “Today, we won’t go (to the Brest game). It’s the price we have to pay for not having paid the €21,000, but this will serve two purposes: to be able to hold a meeting and to make it visible that when the supporters’ stand is not there, it is noticeable,” Yarza added. Boardroom sources — who, like all those cited in this article, asked to remain anonymous to protect relationships — told The Athletic the club would meet group representatives once they had paid back the fines money, saying the club had taken this decision to curb violent behaviour they believe has no place at Barca, particularly after supporters made a commitment not to use racist or homophobic insults. A statement from Football Supporters Europe (FSE) said it stood “in solidarity” with Barca’s fan groups and urged the club to reverse this decision. “The club is punishing large numbers of fans by closing the active section, without providing evidence that the minority of individuals involved in the incidents that triggered the fines are actually associated with the active groups,” the FSE statement read. “This is a blatant act of collective punishment.” Barcelona did not wish to comment officially. FSE stands in solidarity with all active fan groups of FC Barcelona after the club decided to close their section in the stadium for tonight’s #UCL match against Stade Brestois. 1/5 https://t.co/qo75aBdHst — Football Supporters Europe (@FansEurope) November 26, 2024  Josep Maria Bartomeu formally established the supporters’ stand while he was club president in the 2016-17 season. It remained after Laporta succeeded Bartomeu in 2021, although it has been redefined while the team play at the Lluis Companys during the Camp Nou’s refurbishment. The groups are occupying fewer seats at Barca’s smaller temporary home. Laporta has long fought against the club’s more radical fans. When he was elected for his first spell as president in 2003, he made clear his determination to remove violent supporters from the Camp Nou stands. GO DEEPER Madrid derby descended into chaos as players pleaded for calm with fans in balaclavas The club’s ultras, known as the Boixos Nois, were banned from attending matches and travelling to away games that year. Laporta’s determination to get rid of them saw him receive death threats and led to his home being vandalised with graffiti messages such as, “We are going to kill you,” and, “Our house is the Camp Nou, yours is a grave.” Advertisement The Boixos Nois remain distanced from the club with Laporta again in charge and are not involved in the current supporters’ stand. But the club president is determined not to allow any offensive behaviour to take place in Barca’s stadium. Club sources say that banner at the Monaco game was a turning point for Barcelona to take stronger action against fans to try to ensure such incidents do not happen again. Any potential return depends on Barcelona and the supporters’ groups fixing the situation. Fan representatives say Barca have not agreed to their requests for meetings. Now the deadline has passed and they will not be allowed to attend the Brest game tonight, club sources say talks will take place in the coming days to try to solve the issue. The supporters’ stand holds 572 seats and is generally the area that produces the most noise, starting chants and leading support for the team. After their 4-1 Champions League home win against Bayern Munich last month, Barca players went to that part of the stadium to celebrate with the fans. The best-case scenario is that Barca and their supporters find a breakthrough and the stand is filled again for their next home game, in La Liga against Las Palmas on Sunday. But it is unclear whether that is possible given how far apart the two sides seem right now.

I don’t know why I get so excited about football on Thanksgiving, but I do, and I’m even more thrilled when my model finds some value. Luckily, there is some value this year. I wouldn’t force it otherwise, but I don’t have to worry about that.

 Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox. Caleb Williams and this Bears offense have looked much better since they made a change at offensive coordinator. Pair that with the Lions defense being a little banged up on a short week, and I think Chicago can hold its own in this game. That is, on offense. Nobody has been able to contain the Lions offense since their bye week, and I don’t expect that to happen on Thanksgiving. Give me all the food, and give me all the points. Subjectively, I hate this play, but the numbers are what they are. The Rams offense can pop off at any moment, and I’m not sure the Saints are the team that can stick with them. However, the Rams laying a full field goal on the road after getting dismantled by the Eagles on Sunday Night Football seems a bit much for me. Hopefully, we don’t get an incredible Matthew Stafford game because the Saints won’t be able to keep up if that happens. The Ravens have a good run defense, so I don’t think we’ll see another epic Saquon Barkley performance. If the Eagles are forced to throw the ball more often, I think this will be a high-scoring game. Philly moving off its run-heavy game script worries me a little, and there’s a chance the Ravens will cover the spread. Long story short, Lamar Jackson is playing the best ball of his career and probably should win MVP, and I’m not sure the Eagles will be able to stop him.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Cowboys Today: Jerry Jones more interested in wins than 'ambiguity' of draft picks,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5949514/2024/11/26/cowboys-today-jerry-jones-tanking-draft-picks-injuries/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 17:30:30 GMT",The Cowboys had 16 players on their injury report Monday as they deal with a season-long problem of getting everyone on the field.,"NFL When a season is going as poorly as this one is for the Dallas Cowboys, no one is interested in any excuses. And I get it, every team deals with injuries. But the list the Cowboys continue to navigate through remains an issue. QB Dak Prescott (hamstring) and DE Sam Williams (knee) have already been lost for the season. There’s still no clear timetable on when (and if) DE DeMarcus Lawrence (foot) will be able to return. Advertisement And then that brings us to the uncertainty coming out of Sunday’s game at Washington and entering Thursday’s game against the New York Giants. Reserve offensive tackle Asim Richards, who has played 105 offensive snaps over the last three games, suffered a high ankle sprain Sunday. It seems unlikely he will be able to play Thursday. Richards was one of 16 names on Dallas’ Monday injury report. Of that group, five are listed with multiple injuries. Five key players remain question marks for Thursday: LG Tyler Smith (ankle/knee), WR Brandin Cooks (knee), CB Trevon Diggs (groin/knee), TE Jake Ferguson (concussion) and RG Zack Martin (ankle/shoulder). Cowboys EVP Stephen Jones said Monday on 105.3 The Fan in Dallas that there’s a good chance Cooks and Smith will be able to play. Diggs also has a chance. But Jones said it’s “a little more of a long shot” for Martin and Ferguson. Starting quarterback Cooper Rush (knee) was a name not expected to be on the report following Sunday’s game. Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy made it sound like it’s not something that would prevent Rush from playing Thursday. “He’s got some work to do,” McCarthy said, “but I think we’re going to be fine.” GO DEEPER Jerry Jones: McCarthy contract extension 'not crazy' Micah Parsons made it clear after Sunday’s game that he has no interest in tanking. Dallas’ star defender isn’t hoping to improve the Cowboys’ draft spot. And the team owner and general manager is completely on board. Cowboys DE Micah Parsons: ""I’m not done yet. I don’t plan on tanking. If the higher-ups are looking for a draft pick, I hope that’s ruined, because we got a lot of football left to play. As long as I’m a part of this team, we’re always going to fight."" — Jon Machota (@jonmachota) November 25, 2024  “Love it,” Jerry Jones said Tuesday morning on The Fan. “Just absolutely love it. Micah gets criticized for some of the things that he says, but the way that was articulated is strong. … (Tanking) has not come across anybody’s mind in this organization. Somebody is going to take that and say, ‘That’s your problem, you got your head up your you know what. You don’t realize that you need to be playing for a higher draft pick, Jones, and you’d do a little better in the draft.’ Advertisement “I get it. I get all of it. But it’s critical to us to get out here and compete. Those guys (in the draft) will be there for us, the ones we want when we get there in the draft.” Jones later added that “there’s a lot of ambiguity with those draft picks.” If the season ended today, the Cowboys would have the 11th overall pick. Judging by the remainder of their schedule and what the team has been saying about tanking, it seems more realistic that they will end up picking closer to 15-to-20 than 5-to-10. The last time they were in a similar situation was 2020, when they finished 6-10. They ended up with the 17th overall pick and drafted star WR CeeDee Lamb.  The Cowboys think highly of left tackle Tyler Guyton’s future in the league. They know he has the ability to be a quality starter. But it’s very clear that their first-round pick has to clean up the penalties. Entering this week, only Houston Texans offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil (15) has more penalties than Guyton (12). Of Guyton’s 12 for 90 yards, four are false starts and three are for illegal formation. Those bother the coaching staff most because they are pre-snap penalties. “It’s a big emphasis,” McCarthy said. “We’ve obviously talked about it time and time again. It’s just the discipline and the stance of breaking that plane. It’s just not consistent enough. There’s communication and every (officiating) crew is different, but it has to stop. He knows it. He feels sick about it. But we just got to get it corrected. “Those are penalties that potentially took points off the board or an opportunity to score more points. We got to get it corrected. We’re far enough down the line. He understands it. That’s how this league goes too. His name comes up in the pre-game meetings with the officials. It’s an emphasis that the officiating department is making on a weekly basis. There’s something there and we got to be better than that.” • Power Rankings: Cowboys inch up after knocking off Commanders • QB Stock Report: Ranking the starting QBs, 1 to 32 • Ted Nguyen’s best and worst coaching decisions: Liking what Mike Zimmer did (Top photo of Jerry Jones: Robert Deutsch / Imagn Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Jared Goff had just his second game of the year without a touchdown pass, but it didn’t matter; his efficient play and the dynamic duo of Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery led Detroit offensively to the win. Both backs have been sensational in 2024, as “Sonic and Knuckles” each have 11 total touchdowns.

Confirmed good. pic.twitter.com/7jPy66PNfP — Field Yates (@FieldYates) November 25, 2024  As strong as the Lions offense has been, the D in Detroit stands for defense. The Lions are yielding 16.6 points per game (second in the NFL). Sunday was another example of their improvements from 2023, as the Lions limited an opponent to six points for a second straight game and to under 20 points for the sixth time this season. Despite Pro Bowl edge rusher Aidan Hutchinson being out since Oct. 13, Detroit has fielded one of the elite defensive units in football. Advertisement The Chiefs must enjoy the legendary “Rocky” movies because they love to make it look like a loss is coming before eeking out a win. Kansas City is now 10-1 after winning its eighth one-score game of the season on Sunday.

Oftentimes this year, he’s looked like a mere mortal, but the three-time Super Bowl MVP found his rhythm in the win with three touchdown passes and 329 total yards. He’s heating up at a good time; in three of the last four games, Mahomes has had three touchdown passes. Sunday was also a reminder of his dual-threat ability, as he totaled a season-high 60 rushing yards, including a clutch 33-yard scramble that set up Shrader’s game-winning kick.

KC may be unable to keep its run going with a difficult schedule down the stretch. That slate includes the Los Angeles Chargers, Houston Texans, Pittsburgh Steelers and closing out the regular season against the upstart Denver Broncos. Don’t look now; the Eagles are soaring. Philly has taken control of the NFC East with a seven-game winning streak that it extended Sunday against the Los Angeles Rams to get to 9-2. Jalen Hurts and A.J. Brown kept the Eagles passing game moving even without DeVonta Smith. Vic Fangio’s defense continued to lock up, holding a seventh team to 20 points or fewer. But nobody had a bigger impact on the game than Saquon Barkley, whose recent play is putting him in “Best Player on the Planet” territory.

Saquon Barkley outgained the Giants by himself 🫣 pic.twitter.com/vesEsr2Otr — SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) November 25, 2024  Barkley’s play in this playoff push could mean much more than winning an MVP award. Philly has a tough road ahead in pursuit of the NFC’s No. 1 seed, which starts this week with a visit to Baltimore and fellow MVP contender Lamar Jackson. Speaking of Jackson, he and the 8-4 Ravens got back on track as John Harbaugh took his first matchup with his brother Jim as head coach of the Chargers. The reigning league MVP totaled three touchdowns (two passing, one rushing) in the win, and Baltimore rushed for 212 yards, the fourth such occurrence this year. Advertisement Derrick Henry (140 rushing yards) and Jackson keep pacing the high-flying Ravens offense — a unit that ranks in the top three in the NFL in total yards, passing yards, rushing yards and points scored per game. The Ravens defense was also solid against the Chargers after being much maligned this year. LA gained 285 total yards and went 5 of 14 on third downs (35.7 percent). As long as Baltimore can play complementary football — which includes Justin Tucker overcoming struggles in the kicking game — having No. 8 under center gives them a chance to win the Super Bowl. Lamar Jackson grabs his third rushing TD of the year to get the Ravens on the board 🔥 🎥 @NFL pic.twitter.com/emkSoFDLP0 — The Athletic (@TheAthletic) November 26, 2024  Green Bay (+1800) is one team I’m watching as the 2024 season approaches the homestretch. The Packers are 8-3 after dismantling the banged-up San Francisco 49ers and are right on the heels of the Lions and Minnesota Vikings in the NFC North. The Pack has one of the most balanced squads in the NFL, ranking fifth offensively in total yards per game (382.5) and tied for second in total takeaways (22). Jordan Love has not fully made his superstar turn yet, but he spread the ball around and played cleaner against San Fran, as he had his first game of the year without an interception. Josh Jacobs was the focal point offensively, though, cracking 100 yards rushing for the third time this season and recording his first three-rushing-touchdown game since October 2022. Defensively, Xavier McKinney keeps making plays in his first season in Green Bay. His pick of Brandon Allen was his seventh of the year, tied with Detroit’s Kerby Joseph for tops in the NFL.

Advertisement A frustrated Salah declared he was “probably more out than in” but Slot is confident the public comments will not have a negative impact on Liverpool’s fortunes. “People told me about this but I’ve said many times that we don’t share this over here, at least I don’t share this over here,” Slot said. “The only thing I can say is that if I look at my line ups then Mo is more in than out! That quote I can give you. “I don’t think he’s distracted at all. I didn’t see it after the (Manchester) United game (in September) when there were some comments (from Salah) and then a post (on social media after the win over Brighton) that you told me about. “After that he just kept on scoring. He’s just fully focused on the game tomorrow. These kind of things are for inside here in the media and fans talk about it, which is completely normal, but if you had been at the AXA (training ground) today, I don’t think any player talked about it. “I don’t think there’s any distraction for Mo or the other players.

Maybe it even brings the best out of him if you look at his performances until now. “I talk to Mo about what I expect from him, like I do with all the other players, and he is in a good place at the moment.

Another tough week. Totals have really let us down recently which I think is mostly a run of bad variance. Sides have been a disaster and I haven’t been able to get on the right side of the market over the last few weeks. Totals, however, have beaten the closing line 10 out of 14 times while we have only won three of those bets while pushing once. That’s just not going to get it done. Advertisement If you’re unfamiliar with closing line value, beating the closing line means betting a game at a better price than what the price is when the game starts. That would be considered “beating the market.” For me, if you beat the market two-thirds of the time, you’ll probably see success over the long-term. The totals have been good in that regard. Unfortunately, my sides have not. Last week’s record: 1-5, -4.50 units
Season record: 45-56-4, -16.62 units, -14.5% ROI Eight bets in total this week, four each on sides and totals. There is something in the Iron Bowl that I’m eyeing up but need some movement before getting involved. I’ll update if so. As always shop around for the best price and good luck to us! I have some Bowling Green MAC futures (+700) so I contemplated not having extra risk here, but I did hit their win total over so I’m not going to shy away. I think Bowling Green is the superior team here. This line is short at anything under a field goal. Let’s get this win and cheer for the Falcons next week in the MAC Championship Game. On the contrary, this is a bit of a hedge against my Liberty CUSA futures. I still have value to play here, but Liberty hasn’t met its preseason expectations. The Flames just haven’t been the same since the stunning loss to Kennesaw State. My numbers make this closer to a pick ’em so I’m happy to take anything at a field goal. Make sure to shop around because there is a +3.5 out there at a little bit more expensive price. I guess the theme this week is betting on games involving futures that I bet from the preseason. I bet South Alabama under 6.5 wins at +148 so I could reduce risk here, but this is a pretty big edge on Texas State. I think Texas State is the much better team here and am happy with anything at -2.5 or better. This is a huge game as both teams are alive to make the College Football Playoff. While Clemson’s result doesn’t knock them out, this is a must-win game for the Gamecocks. My model has been higher on Clemson than just about everyone this year and especially the CFP committee. South Carolina’s defense is legit, but I still have questions about the offense, especially on the road against a good Clemson defense.

Advertisement Alisson, Diogo Jota, Federico Chiesa are still missing, while Kostas Tsimikas has joined the list of absentees after turning his ankle in training. Slot is likely to hold Alexander-Arnold back for Sunday’s Premier League showdown with Manchester City with Conor Bradley set to start against Real Madrid. “It’s funny that you talk about our injuries because most people only ask about the injuries that Real Madrid have. We have had a few recently,” Slot said. “Trent is in the squad but he will not be available to start. He can maybe make a few minutes. In an ideal world he maybe doesn’t, but if it’s really necessary he can. “Federico’s not in the squad yet.

Sign up here to receive it directly in your inbox. Good morning. Last night, John Harbaugh got the upper hand after an aggressive fourth down call on his own 16-yard line, with the Ravens winning 30-23 against Jim’s Chargers. Now say it with me: “How is it already Week 13?” Below, we have: We’re only 40 days away from the NFL’s regular season finale on January 5, so let’s check in on the key battles. Here’s what you need to know, with the help of Austin Mock’s playoff projections: Who gets the first-round bye? Identical 10-1 records have the Chiefs and Lions as favorites to lock down their respective No. 1 seeds and secure the invaluable week off. Advertisement For Kansas City, it’s business as usual. It would be the fifth bye of Patrick Mahomes’ seven-year career. In Detroit, it’s anything but. They haven’t had a first-round bye since 1991, when Barry Sanders carried them to the No. 2 seed and a trip to the conference finals. But keep an eye on the Bills and Eagles, both 9-2. Each holds about 30 percent odds of landing a No. 1 seed, which means the most important remaining game might be Buffalo’s trip to Detroit in Week 15. Otherwise, the remaining schedule for Buffalo is the fifth-easiest, based on opponent win percentage, while the Eagles’ is 10th. And don’t forget about the Vikings (9-2), who have the fourth-toughest remaining schedule, but can beat anybody. Their Week 18 visit to Detroit could decide the NFC North. Who are in line for the three AFC wild-card spots? The Chargers (7-4), Ravens (8-4) and Broncos (7-5) have commanding leads over the Dolphins (5-6), Colts (5-7) and Bengals (4-7). Miami will also have its three-game win streak tested by an upcoming schedule of the Packers, Jets, Texans and 49ers. Still, watch out for the Colts, who trail Houston (7-5) by two games for the AFC South lead but could make a run with an improved Anthony Richardson and the league’s easiest remaining schedule (Patriots, Broncos, Titans, Giants and Jaguars). And the NFC wild-card race? The Vikings and Packers (8-3) look like shoo-ins (90-plus percent), while the Commanders (7-5) are fighting to stay afloat after three straight losses. Currently on the outside are four teams who can win on any given Sunday: the Cardinals (6-5), Buccaneers (5-6), Rams (5-6) and 49ers (5-6). Keep an eye on the Falcons (6-5), who lead the NFC South but find themselves in a precarious situation after losing two straight, with an upcoming schedule that includes the Chargers, Vikings and Commanders. The Buccaneers (5-6) could win out against their  remaining schedule, the third-easiest: the Raiders, Panthers (twice), Cowboys, Saints and Chargers. Advertisement On the other end, who will hold the No. 1 draft pick? The Raiders (2-9), Giants (2-9) and Jaguars (2-9) all project to finish 4-13, but Trevor Lawrence’s return to practice yesterday and Jacksonville’s second-easiest remaining schedule make it likelier that New York or Las Vegas will hold No. 1. But the Panthers (3-8), Patriots (3-9), Browns (3-8) or Titans (3-8) could still land it, especially with the upcoming schedules for New England and Cleveland.  Given that the Bears’ easiest remaining opponent is the defending NFC-champ 49ers, there’s a chance their losing streak extends from five to 11 over the remaining six weeks. If it does, the Bears (4-7) would end with a 4-13 record and a top-three pick, which could entice their next head coach after this season of heartbreak. With the coaching cycle brewing and Bill Belichick motivated to get back into the NFL, I asked 10 coaches and execs from across the league: What’s the best landing spot for the future Hall of Famer? One common answer: the Jacksonville Jaguars. In a recent episode of the “Scoop City” podcast, my co-host Chase Daniel and I discussed the possibility of Belichick taking over Jacksonville should Doug Pederson get fired. Belichick has a strong relationship with Jaguars ownership, though it’s anticipated he would seek changes in the front office, particularly regarding general manager Trent Baalke. The other two teams that came up frequently: the Cowboys and Buccaneers (should those jobs open up). 🎧 More from the podcast: “I watched the All-22 again of Bo Nix, and to keep it as clear as possible, I think the growth that he has shown since September has been astronomical. And as Bo Nix goes and that defense goes, Denver becomes a scary team for me.” Back to you, Jacob. With the regular season of most fantasy leagues nearing an end, your team(s) are now either playoff locks, fighting for a spot or hoping to avoid last place. If you still need to choose a last-place punishment, here are three options, starting with the friendliest: Until then, let’s look at the top Week 13 waiver adds — and remember to set your lineups early, because we’ve got games this Thursday afternoon: No. 1: Commanders RB Jeremy McNichols. Brian Robinson Jr. injured his ankle, and Austin Ekeler suffered a concussion, with McNichols as the next man up if both sit. This time of year, we need to take a starting RB when we can get one, and there’s upside here — McNichols had 20-plus fantasy points on a season-high nine touches in Week 4. Advertisement No. 2: Raiders RB Ameer Abdullah. Alexander Mattison and Zamir White missed Week 12, and could sit against the Chiefs this week. If so, Abdullah’s role — he played 90 percent of snaps, finishing with 65 total yards and a touchdown on eight carries and five catches — makes him a must-add in a game when the Raiders will be throwing. No. 3: Broncos WR Devaughn Vele. The seventh-round rookie set a career high with 80 yards on nine targets this Sunday as Bo Nix’s No. 2 option in the passing game (25 percent target share). He now has at least four catches in each of his last three games, averaging nearly 10 points. Hosting the Browns (ninth-most fantasy points allowed to WRs) on Monday is enticing. Deeper leagues: Raiders RB Sincere McCormick played the first snaps of his career on Sunday and averaged 6.6 yards on five carries, giving the 24-year-old a chance to see more work. In Miami, RB Jaylen Wright (seven carries) has supplanted Raheem Mostert as the backup to Devon Achane. Chiefs TE Noah Gray is a strong red-zone target with four touchdowns over the past two games. If J.K. Dobbins (knee) misses any time, Gus Edwards would be the lead back in Week 13 with Kimani Vidal as the No. 2 in L.A.

The citations for careless driving and a seatbelt violation against Hill were dismissed Monday due to “lack of prosecution” by an officer or witness, per the documents. Advertisement Hill was issued the citations on his way to Hard Rock Stadium for the Dolphins’ Week 1 game versus the Jacksonville Jaguars. Body-worn camera footage released by Miami-Dade police showed Hill being forced out of his vehicle and onto the ground by officers. In the video, police approached Hill’s car, and he rolled his window up after a brief interaction. The police told Hill to keep his window down. When he did not fully roll it down, one of the four officers opened the car door and pulled Hill from the vehicle by the back of his neck. One officer put Hill face-down on the street to handcuff him.

Hill later called for a Miami-Dade police officer to be fired after the detainment in a statement released by his attorney Julius Collins. “The officer’s use of force was excessive, escalating and reckless,” Hill said in the statement.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Rice football hires Davidson's Scott Abell as new coach in bid for explosive FCS offense,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5949758/2024/11/26/rice-football-scott-abell-head-coach/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 16:33:31 GMT",Abell’s teams were led by an explosive shotgun triple option offense that led the FCS in scoring and rushing in 2023.,"NCAAF Rice has hired Davidson head coach Scott Abell as its new head coach, the school announced Tuesday. Abell went 47-28 in seven seasons at the Football Championship Subdivision school. He inherited a Davidson program in 2018 that hadn’t won more than two games in a season since 2011 and has posted seven winning seasons in seven years. That included two Pioneer Football League championships in spring 2021 and fall 2021 and three FCS playoff appearances. Advertisement “After spending time with Scott throughout this process, it was clear that we had found the right leader for our program,” athletic director Tommy McClelland said in a statement. “He has had an immediate impact on every program he has coached and is passionate about developing winners on and off the field. He is the right person to lead Rice football into a new era of success. I am thrilled to welcome Scott and his family to Rice.” Abell’s teams were led by an explosive shotgun triple option offense that led the FCS in scoring and rushing in 2023. The Wildcats led the FCS in rushing for four consecutive seasons from spring 2021 to 2023. This fall’s Davidson team went 6-5 and finished 13th in FCS in scoring. In 2018, Davidson broke the Division I record with 789 rushing yards in a single game against San Diego (a game it lost 56-52). From 1970-2017 (54 year), @DavidsonFB won 6+ games nine times. @Scott_AbellFB won 6+ games every full season he was the head coach at Davidson. The job he did there was one of the best in college football history. @RiceFootball is in very good hands. — SportSource Analytics (@SportSourceA) November 26, 2024  This year’s Rice team ranks 115th in the FBS in scoring offense and 116th in rushing yards per game. While the Owls reached bowl games in 2022 and 2023, the program has not had a winning season since 2014. “I cannot imagine a more ideal time or fit for myself, my family, and the future of Rice Football,” Abell said in a statement. “Today begins the journey, as we pursue championships.” Abell was previously the head coach at Washington & Lee with a 39-24 record from 2012 to ’17, and will bring experience from a coaching career based almost entirely in Virginia and North Carolina to Houston to coach the Owls.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Jerry Jones: It's 'not crazy' to think Mike McCarthy will get contract extension,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5949575/2024/11/26/cowboys-jerry-jones-comments-mike-mccarthy-contract-extension/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 16:24:37 GMT",The Cowboys snapped a 5-game losing streak and are 4-7 after winning Sunday. Mike McCarthy is in the final season of a 5-year contract.,"NFL Judging by the season the Dallas Cowboys are having, most assume there will be a change at head coach in January. Mike McCarthy is in the final year of the five-year contract he signed in 2020. But Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones said don’t assume anything just yet. During his weekly radio interview Tuesday morning on 105.3 The Fan in Dallas, Jones said he’s not ruling out a contract extension for McCarthy. Advertisement “I don’t think that’s crazy at all,” Jones said. “That’s not crazy. Listen, Mike McCarthy is an outstanding coach. … This is a Super Bowl-winning coach. Mike McCarthy has been there and done that. He has great ideas. Bottom line is that no place in my body language or anything else have you seen indications about what we’re going to be doing relative to this (coaching) staff at the end of this year. And we shouldn’t. We got a lot of football left.” After a rough start in his first season on the Cowboys’ sideline, McCarthy guided Dallas to three consecutive 12-win seasons. This season got off to a 3-2 start, but a five-game losing streak has put them at a position where the playoffs are highly unlikely. The biggest issue has been extremely poor play at home, which has been the case since the stunning 48-32 wild-card loss to the Green Bay Packers in January. McCarthy was hired after former head coach Jason Garrett was unable to have more postseason success. The Cowboys have only one playoff win since McCarthy was hired. Of course, what is Jones supposed to say when asked if it’s crazy that he could give McCarthy an extension at the end of the season? Sunday’s 34-26 win at Washington was Dallas’ first in seven weeks. Jones has made it clear several times over the last month that he has no interest in making an in-season coaching change. So, his plan all along has been to give McCarthy the full season. He will then evaluate everything and make his final decision in January. That doesn’t mean he hasn’t had any thoughts about who could potentially be Dallas’ next head coach. But it also doesn’t do anything positive to say on Nov. 26 that he already has an idea of who that will be and it’s not McCarthy. Jones would prefer to see how this season plays out. For McCarthy to get a new contact, though, it would likely have to be an historic finish for Dallas. It is somewhat interesting that their remaining six games are against four teams with losing records and one against a Commanders team they just beat at Washington.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Zooming in on 8 incredible stats that define the Cavaliers' remarkable 17-1 start,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5948791/2024/11/26/cleveland-cavaliers-8-incredible-stats/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 16:15:10 GMT","Cleveland has outscored opponents by 223 points, already surpassing last season’s total of198. The franchise wins mark is within reach.","NBA CLEVELAND — Twenty games into an NBA season is typically the first moment teams begin to assess who they really are. It’s essentially one-quarter of the season, which is enough of a sample size to draw pretty substantial conclusions about where teams have been and where they’re headed.  As the Cavs close in on the 20-game mark this week, the numbers behind their 17-1 start are astounding. I dug through all of the data and metrics the last few days to pull out some of my favorites.  Advertisement All statistics and league rankings are before Monday’s games … 1. Georges Niang is 20th in the league in plus-minus at plus-103. Not bad for a reserve averaging 20 minutes a night, right? But that’s not the nutty part.  He’s seventh on the Cavs. Seventh! The Cavs have seven of the league’s top 20 players in plus-minus. For comparison, Boston has three in the top 20. Oklahoma City has two.  2. It should come as no surprise, then, that the Cavs lead the league in point differential by a healthy margin. Cleveland has outscored its opponents this year by 223 points, already surpassing last season’s total of 198.  They were at 441 two years ago, which is in the neighborhood of the 492 differential the year they won the championship. At this rate, the Cavs will blow through those markers well before the All-Star break.  The Cavs’ best point differential in team history is 732, not surprisingly from the season they won a franchise-record 66 games. Their point differential through 18 games that season: 222. Just one point off their current pace.  Based on the numbers, the franchise wins record is going to be within reach. More on that later. GO DEEPER NBA Power Rankings: Giving thanks for returning vets, sharp coaches and ... Elfrid Payton? 3. When Donovan Mitchell was on the court last year, the Cavs outscored teams by 5.9 points. When he was off the floor, Cavs opponents outscored them by 1.5 points. No surprise there. Teams often dip when the best player is resting. In the Cavs’ case, it was a 7.4-point swing last year.  This year, the Cavs are outscoring teams by 7.2 points with Mitchell on the floor — and 5.6 points when he’s not.  So the Cavs are outscoring opponents this year without Mitchell at nearly the same clip as they were last year with him.  What a BLOCK by Caris LeVert 🖐️ pic.twitter.com/emkFwf3SKU — NBA TV (@NBATV) November 10, 2024  4. Without getting too far into the weeds with the on-court/off-court metrics, it’s worth noting one other item: The Cavs have a positive number with every player off the floor, meaning they aren’t getting outscored by teams just because one player is resting. That shouldn’t be surprising given all of the other data and it further emphasizes how much of a team effort this season has been. Advertisement The interesting nugget, at least to me: The Cavs are at their “worst” when Evan Mobley is off the floor. They’re “only” outscoring teams by 3.1 points when Mobley sits, which is the lowest figure for a player on the team. For those of us who felt the Cavs couldn’t become legitimate championship contenders until Mobley emerged as the team’s best player, please stand by.  5. This one defies logic and it doesn’t feel sustainable. But again, this is the part of the season where we start drawing conclusions about what’s real and what’s not.  One of the best defensive lineups the Cavs have used this season is Mitchell, Caris LeVert, Sam Merrill, Niang and Mobley.  Make it make sense.  Mobley is the only above-average defender in the group, yet across 74 possessions together, that lineup has a defensive rating of 89.3. The 74 possessions, for the record, are the third-most on the team, according to Cleaning The Glass. This is a lineup that gets heavy usage and they’ve oddly been terrific together on the defensive end.  The offensive rating for this group is over 120 and the net rating is a whopping 30.9. It’s been a great lineup for Kenny Atkinson. But it’s the defensive numbers that are most surprising.  EV4 ➡️ Sammy. @evanmobley & @smerrill05 | #LetEmKnow pic.twitter.com/Cd3Yo9boEN — Cleveland Cavaliers (@cavs) November 25, 2024  6. Ty Jerome is on the type of heater he never even experienced in college. Jerome has scored 55 points in his last two games and has four 20-point games in November. He never did that in three years at Virginia.  Atkinson has remarked multiple times this year about Jerome’s shot making and what a pleasant surprise it has been. He has made 11 3s in the Cavs’ last two games. Never did that in college, either. He could be an early candidate for Sixth Man of the Year, but he might have to fight his own teammate for it. Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox.
 Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox. 7. For as big of a revelation as Jerome has been, LeVert might be even bigger. He has historically been one of the league’s most inefficient players, which has made his start to the season all the more stunning.  LeVert is averaging 134.2 points per 100 shot attempts, far and away the best mark of his career and ranking in the 90th percentile across the league, according to Cleaning the Glass. He’s one spot ahead of three-time Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic on the points per 100 shot attempts chart.  Advertisement LeVert was in the 21st percentile last year in efficiency and hasn’t ranked above 38th since his second year in the league — under Atkinson in Brooklyn.  Atkinson said a few games ago he always thought LeVert could be more efficient when they were together with the Nets and he was disappointed the coaching staff couldn’t get it out of him. They are now.  8. I saved maybe my favorite for last.  Given all of the Cavs’ efficiency numbers to this point, Cleaning the Glass projects them to win 67.4 games this year. That, of course, would be a franchise record.  But Cleaning the Glass also projected them for 14.8 wins to this point based on how they’ve played so far, so the Cavs are already a couple of wins ahead of pace. That could mean a bit of regression in the wins column — or it could mean flirting with 70 victories in April.  How accurate are the projections? Here is the Cavs’ win total for the past three years as predicted by Cleaning the Glass based on their efficiency numbers. Actual win total in parentheses:  2023-24: 47 (48) 2022-23: 55 (51) 2021-22: 45.8 (44) The Cavs and Oklahoma City Thunder have matching 67.4 win projections for this season.

The goal itself wasn’t anything too special compared to what we’ve seen before from Tkachuk: A nice passing play resulting in a goal from the bumper spot on the power play, followed by a celebratory embrace with his linemate Tim Stützle. Put the Tkaptain™️ stamp on this one!#GoSensGo pic.twitter.com/fqT6W26PEz — Ottawa Senators (@Senators) November 26, 2024  It was just a little less emphatic than his celebration on a disallowed first-period goal due to goaltender interference where he made two fist pumps. “Just a relief I guess,” Tkachuk said after the game. “Just needed a goal there to create a little cushion for our team and just wanted to capitalize on our power plays.” Advertisement The Senators captain’s leadership had come under fire during the Senators’ five-game losing streak, which ended Monday with a 4-3 win over the Calgary Flames. Specifically, Tkachuk’s emotional responses on and off the ice that sometimes lead to penalties and fights. The word immature has been used to describe this young Sens core before, and Tkachuk himself has even discussed it after the team looked disengaged in some of its recent losses. “I think everybody around here knows that — we know that — we’re a good team,” Tkachuk said last week. “It’s just a matter of doing it day in and day out and just no more bulls— excuses.” Following the loss to the Vegas Golden Knights on Thursday, Tkachuk seemed to take the loss hard as he was the last to step off the ice. Brady last off the ice 🙁 pic.twitter.com/MXKJ7Z6BwN — Kevin Lee (@BringBackLee) November 22, 2024  On Saturday, with the Senators down 4-1 in the third period, Tkachuk scrapped with Canucks forward Dakota Joshua. An early trip to the dressing room with another loss in view drew more criticism. Ottawa scored twice in his absence before losing 4-3 to Vancouver. Entering Monday night’s game, the heat was turned up on the Senators. The losing streak had caused some fans to wonder if the team’s core was good enough to compete and if Tkachuk’s leadership style was the right one to lead Ottawa to success. In light of that criticism, Senators head coach Travis Green defended his captain with a passionate speech on Monday morning. “I’ve heard the chatter a little bit,” Green said. “We’re lucky to have this guy, for starters. He’s a skilled hockey player. He’s tough, he’s mean. He cares passionately about winning, about winning in Ottawa. And he’s a very good hockey player. Whether you were playing peewee hockey, junior hockey, the American League. Any league, any world, you’d want a player like this on your hockey team. I don’t think it’s fair. Is he perfect? No. There are not many perfect players in the world, if any. But sometimes when you have something for a little while, you kind of forget what you have. And I think the Ottawa Senators are lucky to have this guy. I don’t think it’s fair, the chatter. Is he going to make mistakes? Hell yeah. Every player does. I would probably take a step back from that because I don’t think it’s fair. Advertisement “Sometimes you’ve got to light a fire under a guy’s ass and try to get him to play hard. I’d much rather have a guy that plays extremely hard and teach him when to do it and when not to do it. I think people forget this guy’s a young guy still. … To go after a guy because he’s emotional and because he wants to win. Like, really? We want all our players to be emotional and want to win.” Later that night, Senators owner Michael Andlauer spoke his piece during an interview with Amazon Prime’s Andi Petrillo and Blake Bolden. “It’s part of the culture I want to exude,” Andlauer said. “I look at our fans. Our fans are grassroot, they’re passionate. Guess what? Our captain is too. When I talk about a culture, I talk about caring more. Work harder than your competition and care more. Care more about each other. Care more about the fans. The man just turned 25 years old. Do you remember how you behaved when you were 25 years old? Let’s understand. We have a very young team and we still have a lot of maturing to do. But, boy, you’ve got to keep that passion. That’s what it’s all about.” Tkachuk’s teammates have spent the last few days talking up their captain, too. “I think you saw (Saturday) night, he shows a lot of emotion,” Senators forward David Perron told The Athletic on Sunday. “You always walk that fine line of what is too much? Was it what is not enough? I think it’s great that he plays like that. He plays with a lot of passion. “He’s not afraid to stand up and kind of put his guts on the table and tell the truth of what he thinks.” “He puts a lot on himself,” Senators defenceman Jake Sanderson said Monday. “He comes in every single day and he leads us in practice. He brings it in the gym, everywhere he is. You know Brady’s leading us. He was great tonight, great on both sides of the puck and he gets rewarded.” Advertisement Tkachuk was one of four Senators who recorded a two-point game in the win over Calgary and he also led the team with five shots on goal. For the second time this season, Tkachuk has power-play goals in back-to-back games. It was an improved performance all around for the Senators, and Tkachuk being at the forefront was sorely needed. Tkachuk was mostly stoic and even a bit subdued in his answers when speaking with the media postgame. It largely has to do with the mountain the Senators will have to climb to bring their record back to .500 and a three-game California trip on the horizon. When asked about the criticism he’s faced and his leadership style while enduring it, Tkachuk used the moment to show his dedication to the team. “I just want to give my blood, sweat and tears to the guys in this room,” Tkachuk said. “And that’s what I feel like I do and pride myself on is giving absolutely everything I have for this team and for this group. You know what, to be honest with you, I didn’t see much of it. It’s kind of been just focusing on the here and now and my teammates. “To be honest with you, I just care about winning here and just giving absolutely everything I have for this team and the trust I have for my teammates that they’re there for me as well. I always appreciate their support.” (Top photo of Brady Tkachuk: Chris Tanouye / Freestyle Photography / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Brown will coach the team’s season finale against NC State on Saturday; no decision has been made on whether Brown will coach the Tar Heels in a bowl game. In a statement, Brown said “this was not the perfect time and way in which I imagined going out, no time will ever be the perfect time.” He added that he “will always cherish the memories and relationships” built in Chapel Hill over 16 seasons. Advertisement Brown, 73, has three years left on his contract and is owed about $2.8 million, per USA Today. The decision to part ways comes amid a rollercoaster final season in Chapel Hill. The Tar Heels lost four consecutive games, including an embarrassing 70-50 showing against James Madison in September, regrouped to win three in a row and then lost to Boston College 41-21 on Saturday. Sources familiar with UNC’s hiring process tell The Athletic that Tulane coach Jon Sumrall will get a “good look” during the hiring process. pic.twitter.com/szkRuc1seY — Ralph D. Russo (@ralphDrussoATH) November 26, 2024  Following the loss to James Madison, Brown said he told his team in an emotional postgame locker room, “If you all don’t feel like I’m the leader you need, then I’ll go do something else.” But he walked those comments back and later told SiriusXM radio on Nov. 20 that he was still committed to doing the job. Brown’s second run with the Tar Heels resulted in a trip to the ACC championship game in 2022 and trips to bowl games in all six seasons. UNC never won the league championship with Drake Maye or Sam Howell, quarterbacks who were NFL Draft picks, but Brown leaves the program in better shape than when he got it. He inherited a program that had gone 2-9 and 3-9 in its previous two seasons under Larry Fedora. In his first tenure in Chapel Hill, Brown went 1-10 in each of his first two seasons and then led the Tar Heels to four top-20 finishes in the AP poll, including an 11-1 season in his final year, in 1997. Brown’s 113 career wins, 10 bowl trips and four bowl victories are the most in school history. He’s quite simply the best football coach North Carolina ever had. “Mack Brown has won more games than any football coach in UNC history, and we deeply appreciate all that he has done for Carolina Football and our University,” UNC athletics director Bubba Cunningham said in a statement. Advertisement “Coach Brown has led the Carolina Football program back into the national conversation as we improved the program’s facilities, significantly increased the size of the staff, invested in salaries and bolstered our nutrition and strength and conditioning programs.” Brown led Texas to a national championship in 2005. His 282 career wins between stops at Appalachian State (1983), Tulane (1985-87), North Carolina (1988-97, 2019-2024) and Texas (1998-2013) rank 18th all-time in college football — and are only 10 fewer than legendary coach Nick Saban’s.

They’re the real deal. MGM: 🚀🚀🚀🚀 Magic (12-7) | 25th offense | 3rd defense | 9th net rating Many of us believed the Magic would struggle to stay afloat without Paolo Banchero for roughly a month. And it looked that way right after the injury as the Magic lost four straight without him. Since then, the Magic have been carried by great defense and Franz Wagner’s ascension right before our eyes. Their record is boosted by being 9-2 against losing teams, but we’re not going to hold that against them when they’re missing Banchero. It would be great if they scored semi-efficiently though. MGM: 🪄🪄🪄🪄 Clippers (11-8) | 22nd (tied) offense | 5th defense | 11th net rating This doesn’t look quite as good after the Clippers got destroyed by the Celtics last night (see below), but the MGM is not swung by one game. It’s too scientific! I won’t be fooled into talking about this team “when Kawhi Leonard is healthy.” This team without him is so good defensively, and it has a bevy of role players to wear you down. Ty Lue won’t get them to contending status without Leonard, but not many teams want to face the Clippers. MGM: 🚢🚢🚢 Advertisement Grizzlies (11-7) | 5th offense | 6th defense | 6th net rating Now that Ja Morant is back, it’s time to take the Grizzlies seriously again. They went 5-3 in this latest stint without Morant in the lineup, and we’ve seen some real development with role players like Scotty Pippen Jr, Jaylen Wells and Jake LaRavia. Memphis is one of five teams top-10 in both offense and defense. They’re one of two teams ranked top-six in both. MGM: 🐻🐻🐻 Yep, no hot takes on any of those four. The name of the meter has the word “Maybe” in it, after all. Star returns: KD Beal, Kristaps and Ja are back! 🏀 Kristaps Porziņģis is back. He made his season debut in the Celtics’ win over the Clippers.

That means we’re back trying to figure out where everybody in the league may fall in the hierarchy of good and bad. But we don’t have time to rank all 30 teams, so we’re going to keep up the revolutionary Top-Three, Middle-Three, Bottom-Three ranking system. We’ll tell you teams 1-3, 14-16 and 28-30. Some say it’s harder than ranking all 30! I am some! For what it’s worth, the MGM squads are all probably between the top and middle teams. Advertisement Top three: Celtics (15-3), Thunder (13-4), Cavaliers (17-1) This feels pretty set right now, although the Thunder have a great case for being included. The Celtics continue to show us they’re the best team in basketball. The Thunder are thriving without Chet Holmgren thanks to Isaiah Hartenstein being back. Just wait until Holmgren is healthy again. And the Cavs are in a historic space that tells us we shouldn’t be surprised if they end up in the NBA Finals. And they’re not even fully healthy yet. Middle three: Bucks (8-9), Mavericks (10-8), Timberwolves (8-8) We know these teams are capable of being more. The Bucks are still hoping Khris Middleton makes them look like a contender, but Giannis Antetokounmpo’s production has brought them to a much more competitive space lately. The Wolves are still trying to figure out what their dynamic is with Julius Randle in the mix. The Mavs need Luka Dončić to be healthy and in shape, but you can see the structure of another deep playoff run. Bottom three: Jazz (4-12), Pelicans (4-14), Wizards (2-13) We know why the Jazz and Wizards are bad. Washington has only beaten the Hawks (twice!), and the Jazz aren’t competent enough to be better on either side of the court. The Pelicans are still just suffering through massive injuries. As guys start to come back to health, others seem to sit. They’re signing guys from past media guides to get a full rotation. New Orleans desperately needs to hit the reset button. This wasn’t supposed to go like this. OG Anunoby just dismantled Denver Knicks 145 (10-7), Nuggets 118 (9-7): What a ridiculous stat line throughout this Knicks blowout victory in Denver. Karl-Anthony Towns had 30 points, 15 rebounds, four assists and three steals against Nikola Jokić (a modest 22-7-7). Jalen Brunson had 23 points, 17 assists and just two turnovers. And it all pales in comparison to OG Anunoby, who dropped 40 points on 16-of-23 shooting. I know it says he missed shots and had a turnover. He had a perfect game and completely dominated everything Denver tried to do. New York’s offense is serious. Advertisement Thunder 130 (13-4), Kings 109 (8-10): The Kings are finally healthy with Malik Monk back in the picture, but it didn’t matter against this Thunder juggernaut. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was dastardly, dropping 37 points and 11 assists on the Kings, who just couldn’t do anything to slow him down. OKC outscored the Kings by 20 in the second half to cruise to victory in the fourth. Magic 95 (12-7), Hornets 84 (6-11): The Orlando broadcast called the 18-point first quarter by the Magic “forgettable.” If that’s the case, then the Hornets will want those final two quarters to be expunged from the record. Orlando’s defense held Charlotte to 38 total second-half points, as the Magic scored 37 in the fourth to come back and win behind 53 bench points. They survived LaMelo’s 44 points, nine rebounds and seven assists. Ball and Brandon Miller combined for 64 of Charlotte’s 84 points. Celtics 126 (15-3), Clippers 94 (11-8): The Clippers have been shutting everybody down on defense. The Celtics showed them that things get a little different when you come to Boston. The defending champions had a 51-point second quarter in which they hit more 3-pointers (12) than the Clippers made total shots (11). Payton Pritchard and Jayson Tatum led the Celtics with 20 points. There are 53 50-point quarters in NBA history. A dozen have happened since April of 2021. Pacers 114 (8-10), Pelicans 110 (4-14): Perhaps the Bounce Stock Report has revived Tyrese Haliburton! The Pacers point guard had 34 points, hit nine 3-pointers, dished 13 assists, collected three steals and turned it over just twice in Indiana’s win. But that’s not the crazy part of this game. Elfrid Payton, who was out of the league for two-plus years before New Orleans needed bodies last week, had 21 assists. His previous career-high was 16 set back in 2019. Pistons 102 (8-11), Raptors 100 (4-14): Remember when Monty Williams had Jaden Ivey backing up Killian Hayes last year? Well, J.B. Bickerstaff would never. The Pistons had to get past 31 points, 14 rebounds and seven assists by Scottie Barnes. They did that with Ivey’s 25 points on 10-of-13 shooting, eight assists, five rebounds and one game-winner. Look at this tough buzzer-beater.  Nets 128 (8-10), Warriors 120 (12-5): The Warriors knocked down 19 3-pointers in this one and were up 18 in the third quarter, so you probably wonder how the Nets were able to beat them at the Chase Center. Brooklyn knocked down 20 3-pointers with seven different players hitting multiple threes. Dennis Schröder and Cam Thomas combined for 50 points. Mavs 129 (10-8), Hawks 119 (7-11): The Hawks had 76 points in the paint, shredding the Mavs’ defense so many times throughout the night. And it didn’t matter because Kyrie Irving had 16 of his 32 points in the fourth quarter, Spencer Dinwiddie had 22 points off the bench and Jaden Hardy had 23 points. Dallas outscored Atlanta 68-52 in the second half. Advertisement Grizzlies 123 (11-7), Blazers 98 (7-11): Ja Morant returned from his hip injury to lead the Grizzlies with 22 points and 11 assists in just 23 minutes. The Grizzlies were plus-22 with him on the floor. Memphis is 6-3 when he plays this season. 📫 Love The Bounce? Check out The Athletic’s other newsletters.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Why are Timberwolves sitting at .500? 'We just don't play hard',https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5945905/2024/11/26/timberwolves-struggles/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 15:02:35 GMT",Last season's Wolves were defined by exuberance and determination. The first 16 games this season have been defined by listlessness.,"NBA On the very first play in Boston on Sunday afternoon, Julius Randle hit Rudy Gobert with a pass on a duck-in. There is no way that was an accident. The previous 48 hours had been an inflection point of sorts for the Minnesota Timberwolves, at least as much there can be one so early in an NBA season. It centered around a concerning interaction between Randle and Gobert in the fourth quarter of a bad loss in Toronto on Thursday. But all parties involved seemed determined to show that they had quickly moved on from the situation as they arrived in Boston. Advertisement The Randle-Gobert play didn’t go anywhere, and the Timberwolves did not score on the possession. But it was meant to serve a greater purpose as the wayward Wolves try to find the mojo that has been missing all season long. Last season’s Wolves were defined by exuberance and determination. The first 16 games of this season have been defined by isolation and listlessness. That is how the Wolves came out of another loss, a 107-105 defeat to the Celtics, focused more on the silver linings of putting up a fight against the defending champions than dropping to 8-8 on the season. “Very proud of our effort tonight,” coach Chris Finch said. If that seems like a low bar, well, there is good reason for that. The body language during the loss in Toronto was the worst it has been all season. One of the biggest priorities Finch put on their path forward was to stop the moping that has made the team so tough to watch during certain points this season. “We have a lot of guys that are in their own feelings regarding their own personal performances,” Finch told the media in Boston after practice on Saturday. “Maybe they haven’t been playing up to their expectations or ours and it’s affecting them too much. I don’t think it’s a selfish thing. … “They’ve just been a little bit disappointed and have had a hard time hiding their emotions, and that’s a maturity and a toughness that comes with that that you have to be able to do.” Gobert said as much just before the Wolves left on their two-game trip last week. After a narrow victory over the short-handed Phoenix Suns, he pledged to better live up to his standards as the NBA Defensive Player of the Year, something he admitted to not doing this season. “I’ve been myself the majority of the time, but there’s too many times when I feel like I let the team down a little bit, whether it’s one quarter or a few minutes, and I can’t have that if we want to be great as a team,” Gobert said. “And if we want to be a championship team, every minute that I’m on the floor, I have to be the best in the world at what I do.” Advertisement It was an impressive showing of personal accountability, one that left the impression that whatever is ailing the Timberwolves during this early season acclimation period to newcomers Randle and Donte DiVincenzo could be fixed. The Wolves then had three days off, a relative rarity in the grind of an NBA season, which Finch wanted to use to address the team’s disappointing defense, which has plummeted to 14th in the NBA after it was the best unit in the league last season. And while the main play that drew all the attention in that Raptors game came from Gobert not getting the ball on offense, that appeared to be much more of a last-straw situation than a smoking gun. Yes, Gobert was upset that Randle did not throw him the ball for a dunk or a foul that could have given the Timberwolves the lead. Yes, it was an extremely selfish reaction by Gobert to slow-play his exit from the paint and force a three-second violation turnover in a tie game with under four minutes to play. Then he doubled down on the dysfunction by committing a frustration foul on Scottie Barnes on the other end that gave Barnes free throws and put the Wolves behind. But Gobert’s angst likely stemmed as much from the problems on the defensive end as it did from not getting a dunk. Randle has played well offensively for the Timberwolves, hitting 57 percent of his 2-point shots, finding teammates on the perimeter for open 3-pointers and even showing some chemistry with Gobert on lob passes. But he has struggled on defense early in his Wolves tenure, with slow reactions to cutters, a lack of intensity at the rim and the lowest rebounding numbers (6.6 per game) of his career. GET UP 4⃣ pic.twitter.com/evcnXOCO67 — Toronto Raptors (@Raptors) November 22, 2024  To work through some of the deficiencies after trading Karl-Anthony Towns to New York, the Wolves coaching staff made some adjustments to how they cover the pick-and-roll. Gobert excels in drop coverage when he falls back away from a screen and essentially covers both the ballhandler and the roll man at once. The Raptors game featured more instances of Gobert being up to the level of the screen in coverage, which could be a more comfortable situation for Randle. Like it has been for most of the season, it was messy. RJ makin' it look easy 😮‍💨 pic.twitter.com/wRVyQ5IppL — Toronto Raptors (@Raptors) November 22, 2024  Gobert understands how important defense is to a team’s success. His teams in Utah relied heavily on his ability to protect the rim and end possessions with rebounds. Last season’s run to the Western Conference finals was fueled by a relentless defensive pressure that covered up for a lackluster offense. So when the defense slips to the degree it has in Minnesota this season, he understands that there is only so far a team can go. Advertisement None of that justifies his actions toward the end of the Toronto game. They drew the ire of Anthony Edwards on the court, and there was a spirited conversation in the locker room after that game about what needed to happen for this group to get it together. Gobert apologized to the team, Randle also expressed regret for his decision in that moment and the team pledged to move forward with renewed urgency. The good news for the Timberwolves is that they have been through tense moments like that. At the end of Gobert’s first season in Minnesota, he was suspended for the first Play-In game after he punched Kyle Anderson in the huddle of the final regular season game. The two quickly put that incident behind them and grew to have a deep respect for each other’s impact. Randle insisted there was “no beef” between the two of them, and the team did respond with a strong performance against the Celtics. Despite being down by as many as 19 points in the game, they rallied back over the final 18 minutes to get it down to a one-possession game. Despite allowing the Celtics to hit 21 3s, the Wolves held them to their lowest point total of the season. Gobert delivered his first 20-rebound game of the season, Edwards had 28 points, nine rebounds and seven assists and Rob Dillingham had his best game as a pro, scoring 14 points in 15 minutes. That it came against the Celtics was almost expected within the locker room. Getting up for the heavyweights has not been much of a problem. It has been lackluster games against teams like Portland, Toronto and Miami without Jimmy Butler that have tempered the enthusiasm surrounding this team. “It shouldn’t be just when we play the best teams in the league, but it should be within ourselves,” Gobert said on Monday. “It has to be competing with ourselves every day, whether it’s in practice or in games, just having that mindset that it’s just something that we can’t turn on and off.” put it back, Ru. 💪 pic.twitter.com/hLxfzdivZq — Minnesota Timberwolves (@Timberwolves) November 24, 2024  Added Edwards: “That’s the No. 1 thing. We just don’t play hard. We came out and played hard tonight. We make mistakes, but the reason we were able to overcome those mistakes is because we played hard the entire game.” It’s a damning statement, and Edwards has culpability there as well. From his inattentiveness on defense to lazy turnovers, Edwards has had too many stretches where he looks every bit of 23 years old rather than the veteran tone-setter the Wolves need him to be. When he is all the way locked in, the Wolves feed off of that energy and mean streak. 11-0 RUNNNNN@PaniniAmerica Prizm Performance of the Game pic.twitter.com/GvC4Gwwbcn — Minnesota Timberwolves (@Timberwolves) November 24, 2024  One player who seems capable of delivering a jolt regularly is Dillingham. The No. 8 overall pick has gotten some court time while Mike Conley is out with a toe injury. The 19-year-old looks every bit his age during some stretches, including running into teammates on the defensive end and getting caught in the air on the occasional drive to the bucket. But the electricity in his game is undeniable, a Jordan McLaughlin who can score. He put up 14 points in 15 minutes against the Celtics, with an ingenuity that is infectious. he put on a show. 🍿 pic.twitter.com/q47718UJDy — Minnesota Timberwolves (@Timberwolves) November 25, 2024  “We look different when he’s on the floor,” Finch said after practice on Monday. “He gives us a change of speed. He was instrumental in helping us get back into the game. This is all part of the growth.” The Wolves return home for a big week, starting with the Houston Rockets on Tuesday, then games against the Sacramento Kings, LA Clippers and Los Angeles Lakers. By the time they finish the homestand, they will have played 20 games, just under a quarter of the season and a general benchmark by which they want to see a real identity form. Advertisement “I know the chemistry and makeup of our team,” Finch said. “We’re just kind of going through a tough patch. We’ve got to figure it out, but I thought we took a step forward (against Boston).” — Jared Weiss contributed to this report (Photo of Jaylen Brown and Rudy Gobert: Danielle Parhizkaran / The Boston Globe via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Penguins Today: The rebuild is on. Could a David Jiříček trade be next?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5949377/2024/11/26/penguins-today-david-jiricek-trade-rumors/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 15:00:47 GMT",Kyle Dubas was in Cleveland to watch Jiříček on Sunday.,"NHL Though it’s a word Kyle Dubas has avoided, the Penguins’ rebuild is happening. Dubas’ summer likely was the surest signal. Aside from signing captain Sidney Crosby to a two-year extension, the boss’ moves pointed to the Penguins’ contention window slowly slamming. The exception was the surprise acquisition of Rutger McGroarty, a top prospect who wasn’t working out with the Winnipeg Jets. Advertisement McGroarty instantly became the best Penguins prospect, briefly opening the season in Pittsburgh before an AHL assignment. So far, McGroarty’s AHL production has been discouraging (a goal and three points in 12 games). Still, he’s a young first-round pick who will carry a low cap hit for the next several seasons — qualities that matter to Dubas. Witness his acquisition of Philip Tomasino from the Nashville Predators yesterday. Young? Tomasino is 23. First-round pedigree? He was chosen 24th in 2019. Cap hit? He’ll count $825,000 through this season, but barring a dramatic uptick in production — he has 23 goals and 71 points in 159 NHL games — Tomasino is unlikely to command a significant raise as a restricted free agent. This is a classic low-risk/high-reward trade for a flailing team. The Penguins have the fourth-worst points percentage in the NHL and are 4-10-4 since a modest 3-2-0 start to the season. The Penguins roster hasn’t provided Dubas much (if any) reason to go all-in for anything other than the dreaded rebuild. Dubas isn’t done trying to add players similar to McGroarty and Tomasino. The Penguins are in the mix to trade for David Jiříček, league sources told The Athletic. The sources were granted anonymity because they are not permitted to publicly comment on the Penguins’ offer to the Columbus Blue Jackets. No Penguins prospect is off limits as part of the package, the sources said, including McGroarty. A Penguins source said Dubas hasn’t soured on McGroarty. Rather, that source said, Dubas simply loves Jiříček, a right-shot defenseman. A Blue Jackets source said Dubas attended Jiříček’s AHL game in Cleveland on Sunday, when Jiříček scored a nifty winning goal. Take a look:  Think the Penguins could use some of that? His qualities check the boxes: Young? Jiříček turns 21 on Wednesday. First-round pedigree? He was chosen sixth in 2022. Cap hit? He counts $918,333 through next season, per Puck Pedia. Jiříček is 6 feet, 4 inches and figures to add to his 200-pound frame. It’s easy to see why Dubas would covet him, even if the Penguins already employ a couple of high-profile/high-priced right-shot defensemen in Erik Karlsson and Kris Letang. Advertisement It’s not as easy to see how Dubas would beat other offers Wadell might receive. The Penguins’ prospect pool is deeper than before Dubas took over the organization, but it’s not exactly teeming with future stars. There’s an adage that Thanksgiving Eve is the unofficial start to Penguins season in Pittsburgh. That’s not as true now as it once was, as the team has gotten more popular over the past 20 years. The Penguins don’t even always play at home on Thanksgiving Eve. They do this year. And they plan to keep asking the NHL to schedule home games for that date. The Penguins regularly play to a sellout the night before Thanksgiving, which in Pittsburgh is generally considered the second biggest party night of the year. (The first is whenever the city holds the St. Patrick’s Day parade, annually one of the largest in the United States.) Pittsburgh is a pro sports town first, a drinking town second — and the Penguins are tethered to the city’s biggest drinking days. They usually play at home either on Thanksgiving Eve or the day the green beer flows, and often enough on both dates. The Thanksgiving Eve game is timed well for the Penguins. Students are home from college, off from high school, and most of the prep football teams are finished with their seasons. Small-scale family and friend reunions tend to end at local watering holes in the city’s South Side neighborhood, but a good many of those start in the Uptown area the Penguins have always called home. Penguins Today won’t publish on Thanksgiving and Friday. I’d like to devote Wednesday’s edition to readers’ memories of past Thanksgiving Eve games and examples of what yinz are thankful for when it comes to being a Penguins fan. Drop your comments below, please and thank you. Have fun with it, but keep things clean. Advertisement • The Big Three’s place in Pittsburgh history will not be marred by what increasingly looks like a lousy endgame. There’s a Stanley Cup for each of Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Letang, remember? (Letang should have won the Conn Smythe in 2016, but I digress.) Josh Yohe examines the bleak picture facing the Big Three in this insightful story. • Former Penguins player and current national analyst Paul Bissonette said he escaped significant injury after an altercation with several men at a restaurant in Scottsdale, Ariz. Chris Johnston has more details. • Hailey Salvian took a deep dive into the future of professional women’s hockey in North America. The Penguins would like that future to include a team in Pittsburgh, but the city’s exclusion from hosting a neutral-site PWHL game — as it did last season — in 2024-25 disappointed Fenway Sports Group, which owns the Penguins.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Giants have become a national punchline. Will Brian Daboll, Joe Schoen survive the season?",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5948778/2024/11/26/giants-brian-daboll-joe-schoen-hot-seat/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 15:00:37 GMT","Giants co-owner John Mara doesn't want to make major changes, but recent events might change his thinking.","NFL New York Giants co-owner John Mara included an important qualifier in his vote of confidence for coach Brian Daboll and general manager Joe Schoen last month. “We are not making any changes this season,” Mara said when the Giants were 2-5 on Oct. 23. “And I do not anticipate making any changes in the offseason either.” Advertisement Mara may not anticipate making any changes in the offseason. But he likely didn’t anticipate the team losing four straight games after his vote of confidence, including an overtime defeat to the lowly Panthers on an international stage and a 30-7 bludgeoning by the Buccaneers on Sunday to drop to 0-6 at home. And Mara certainly couldn’t have anticipated last week’s messy divorce from quarterback Daniel Jones after his benching. The handling of Jones’ departure, finalized when the quarterback went directly to Mara to request his release last Friday, and the subsequent embarrassing showing against the Bucs has made the Giants a national punchline. That’s also something Mara couldn’t have anticipated, and it’s surely not something he appreciates. This was probably our longest live room ever. A lot to discuss. Listen to the recording here: https://t.co/tkqtLy0ZjR — Dan Duggan (@DDuggan21) November 25, 2024  That is the backdrop as the Giants have a short week to prepare for a nationally televised showdown with the Cowboys on Thanksgiving. The Cowboys have owned the rivalry, winning seven straight and 14 of the past 15 games in the series. The stakes won’t get higher for Daboll and Schoen this season. The heat on the brass will get turned down if the Giants produce a respectable effort, even if they don’t win. But if the Giants get blown out again — by a 4-7 Cowboys team with plenty of its own problems — there’s no telling how Mara will react. Jerry Reese, Ben McAdoo and Joe Judge were once safe — until they weren’t. GO DEEPER New York Giants fan survey: Should Brian Daboll, Joe Schoen return in 2025? Still, in-season firings seem unlikely. The greatest evidence of that is Mara said five weeks ago that there wouldn’t be any in-season firings. Going further, there wouldn’t be any real benefit to making changes during the season. It’s particularly useless to fire a general manager during the season, especially after the trade deadline. The most consequential moves Schoen will make over the next six weeks will be managing the practice squad. As for Daboll, five games of Mike Kafka as interim coach doesn’t figure to inspire a dramatic turnaround. Advertisement There’s a sentiment that making firings now could give a team a head-start on the search for replacements. Most viable general manager candidates are currently working for other teams, so they won’t be available to be interviewed until after the season. The dynamic is different with coaches, with prominent free agents like Bill Belichick and Mike Vrabel. But neither of those candidates figures to jump at the first opening before surveying the many jobs that will open after the season. The one factor that could trigger an in-season firing of Daboll is if it’s deemed that he’s lost the locker room. He seems precariously close to crossing that threshold. Players were openly blasting everything about the program after Sunday’s loss. Typically, when coaches lose the locker room, the message is conveyed through anonymous sources. But rookie wide receiver Malik Nabers had no problem complaining about the game plan, and tackle Jermaine Eluemunor didn’t hold back in questioning the team’s effort while speaking to groups of reporters in the locker room after Sunday’s game. Brian Daboll says he talked with Malik Nabers after his postgame comments yesterday: ""He's a very competitive individual. You want to get the ball in his hands and I've got to do a better job of getting the ball in his hands early. He's a smart young guy who's very competitive."" pic.twitter.com/jm00NZo1QS — Giants Videos (@SNYGiants) November 25, 2024  It’s hard to see how Daboll gets things tightened back up, especially on a short week and with the change to third-string quarterback Tommy DeVito failing to provide the “spark” the coach was seeking. If Daboll can weather Thursday’s game, he should be able to survive at least until the end of the season. The rest of the Giants’ games will be buried in the 1 p.m. window, and the national media will largely turn its focus to teams in the playoff race. Advertisement But if the Giants have a repeat of Sunday’s performance in Dallas, Mara could wind up facing decisions he never could have anticipated a month ago. Here are additional thoughts on the state of the Giants at this inflection point  Daboll is reaping what he sowed with the Giants’ lackluster effort in Sunday’s game. Daboll was permissive of Deonte Banks’ lax effort twice early in the season before finally benching the second-year cornerback for the final three quarters of a Week 8 game. With no repercussions for a lack of effort from a player like Banks, who has accomplished nothing in the league, it’s not surprising to see other plays that caused Eluemunor to say, “I personally don’t think everyone’s giving 100 percent.” Daboll said the coaching staff reviewed the game tape “with a fine-tooth comb” and determined “the guys played hard; they played with effort.” Comments like that are hard to process when clips are circulating of players blatantly loafing. Linebacker Micah McFadden said the team didn’t watch much of the game during their film review on Monday. “More than anything, it was kind of highlighting that there was a lot of good effort,” McFadden said. It’s interesting that Daboll highlighted the good effort after players publicly criticized the obvious lack of effort. It seems like a continuation of his unproductive, permissive approach with Banks. Rookie wide receiver Malik Nabers was a big-play generator early in the season. Nabers made seven catches of 20-plus yards in the first four games of the season. Nabers has just one catch over 20 yards in five games since returning from a two-week absence due to a concussion. His one explosive play in the past five games was a 21-yard catch on a hole shot against Cover 2 on the first play of the second half on Sunday. Advertisement Part of the reason for the lack of explosive plays is that Nabers isn’t gaining yardage after the catch. Nabers averaged 4.5 YAC in the first four games of the season. That’s down to an average of 1.6 YAC in the five games since returning from the concussion. DeVito’s 17.2 percent sack rate last season was off the charts. He improved that to 11.4 percent on Sunday, which would still be the third-highest sack rate in the league if he had enough attempts to qualify. For perspective, Jones had a 7.8 percent sack rate, which is the 13th highest in the league. DeVito was sacked on three of his eight dropbacks (37.5 percent) in the first half Sunday. He was only sacked once on 27 dropbacks in the second half. DeVito was quicker to take off from the pocket after the break, scrambling three times for 29 yards in the second half. DeVito was pressured on 25 of his dropbacks, and he took some big hits, most notably a crushing shot to the ribs from defensive tackle Calijah Kancey on a deep pass late in the fourth quarter. DeVito had the wind knocked out of him and had to miss one play. It was ridiculous that Daboll called timeouts on the Giants’ final drive in a quest to score a cosmetic touchdown while trailing 30-7. DeVito took another big hit with 11 seconds remaining that resulted in a roughing the passer penalty before air-mailing two passes into the end zone as time expired. Expect to see a lot more of DeVito scrambling on Thursday with Dallas’ Micah Parsons rushing off the edge. To make matters worse, both of the Giants’ starting tackles — Eluemunor (quad) and Evan Neal (hip) — are dealing with injuries. For all of the debate about running back Saquon Barkley’s departure, one area the Giants clearly downgraded is ball security. Barkley had six fumbles on 1,739 touches in six seasons with the Giants. Advertisement Rookie Tyrone Tracy has four fumbles on 138 touches this season, including three fumbles on his last 18 touches over the past two games. Tracy is only in his second year as a running back after switching from wide receiver in his final season at Purdue, but he didn’t have a single fumble on 132 touches last season. Veteran running back Devin Singletary has two fumbles on 96 touches this season. The Giants didn’t intercept a pass for the 10th straight game on Sunday, tying the NFL record for the longest drought. The Giants’ lone interception this season was made by rookie linebacker Darius Muasau on a tipped pass in Week 1. It’s incomprehensible that the Giants haven’t lucked into a tip or an overthrow in 10 straight games, especially with their pass rush generating pressure on opposing quarterbacks. It’s less surprising that the Giants defensive backs haven’t made plays. Cornerbacks Cor’Dale Flott, Dru Phillips and Banks combined for three career interceptions in college. Banks and Flott have combined for three interceptions in five NFL seasons. The Giants have a league-low 31 passes defended, so they haven’t even been in position for many interceptions. Banks was targeted five times while covering Bucs No. 1 wide receiver Mike Evans. All five targets were completed for 68 yards. Passes to other receivers were also completed over Banks and in front of a safety in Cover 2 multiple times during the game. Veteran wide receiver Darius Slayton didn’t have a target until two desperation passes on the final plays of the game were thrown in his direction. Slayton was held without a catch for the first time since early in the 2022 season when he was buried on the depth chart (excluding Week 18 of the 2022 season when he played three snaps as the starters were rested). Advertisement Slayton played 58 percent of the snaps, which was his lowest snap share of the season. More of Slayton’s snaps were spread to second-year wide receiver Jalin Hyatt, who has been buried on the depth chart for most of the season. Hyatt didn’t garner a target in 25 snaps. It’s becoming increasingly obvious that Slayton has no future with the Giants. That makes the decision not to deal him at the trade deadline more head-scratching. Outside linebacker Brian Burns lined up almost exclusively over the left tackle while Kayvon Thibodeaux was on injured reserve with a broken wrist. Burns had 22 pressures and four sacks in the five games Thibodeaux missed. Burns lined up exclusively against the right tackle in Thibodeaux’s return on Sunday. Burns didn’t record a pressure, while Thibodeaux had one pressure despite Bucs All-Pro left tackle Tristan Wirfs being sidelined by a knee injury. Thibodeaux was supposed to be on a pitch count, but he played 63 percent of the snaps because No. 3 edge rusher Azeez Ojulari left late in the first quarter with a toe injury. The severity of Ojulari’s injury isn’t known, but it seems unlikely he’ll be ready for Thursday. Holding onto Ojulari through the trade deadline was another questionable move. He raised his stock with five sacks during Thibodeaux’s absence, but Ojulari has returned to a reserve role and is now dealing with yet another injury. Giants defensive coordinator Shane Bowen got creative in his attempt to stop the run by putting inside linebackers Bobby Okereke, McFadden and Muasau on the field together for the first time this season. The Giants essentially played a 4-3 with two defensive tackles and two outside linebackers on the line. The new personnel grouping made no difference. Watch Baker on the lead block 😭😭😭 How can you not love Baker Mayfield?! 📺: #TBvsNYG on CBS/Paramount+📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/wuCgzLl5kn — NFL (@NFL) November 24, 2024  The Bucs rushed for 156 yards on 32 carries, including a 56-yard run by Bucky Irving against the 4-3 grouping when Muasau missed a tackle at the line of scrimmage. Muasau was also beaten in coverage for a 26-yard completion to tight end Payne Durham in the second quarter.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Devin Neal, Travis Hunter and other NFL Draft prospects who stood out Saturday",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5946869/2024/11/26/devin-neal-travis-hunter-other-nfl-draft-prospects-who-stood-out-saturday/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 15:00:30 GMT",Time's running out for NFL Draft prospects to boost their stock. Who got the job done over the weekend?,"NFL area scouts will be submitting their final in-season reports over the next few weeks, so this is the time for prospects to make a closing argument for those write-ups. Numerous 2025 NFL Draft hopefuls stood out over the weekend. Here are seven in particular who helped themselves: One of the greatest players in school history, Neal gave Jayhawks fans another unforgettable performance Saturday in a win over Colorado. The Lawrence native finished the game with 207 yards rushing, 80 yards receiving and four total touchdowns, as Kansas never trailed. What stands out most about Neal is how skilled he is in setting up missed tackles. He probably won’t be one of the top testers during the pre-draft process, but his ability to read pursuit angles, make a cut and leave defenders off balance is what makes him productive. There are likely to be double-digit running backs drafted in the second- to fourth-round range in April, and Neal figures to be part of that logjam. His receiving skills, along with his makeup (his coaches rave about him as a person and player), could help separate him in the spring — even if his 40-yard dash is average. GO DEEPER Twenty NFL draft prospects I hated leaving off my updated top-50 board In most situations, this is a high-percentage play for the offense … The play-action sail concept spreads out the coverage and gives the quarterback options as he reads high to low. With the safety dropping with the vertical route, Kansas QB Jalon Daniels makes the correct read on the deep crosser. Hunter, though, is just better on the play. As the receiver flattens the crossing route, most cornerbacks would give up a pocket of space that’d be tough to make up. But using his reaction quickness and fluidity, Hunter stays within arm’s length at the break and closes in a flash to make a play on the football. His athletic instincts and movement traits make this look easy. Advertisement No. 38 on my updated top-50 board, Hairston has been flying under the radar due to a shoulder injury that has sidelined him most of the season. He made his return Saturday against Texas and, despite some obvious rust, reminded everyone why he’s an intriguing prospect. Alone on an island against Isaiah Bond and his track speed here, Hairston doesn’t look like an inferior athlete. Watch his pedal, turn and transition to stick with Bond on the deep post, followed by a fantastic finish as he tracks and swats away the ball. Quinn Ewers’ throw is late with way too much loft, but Hairston likely makes a play even if the pass is perfect. In last year’s draft class, Andru Phillips was one of “my guys” — and Hairston falls into that category this year. He’s currently my CB4 in the class. GO DEEPER The Athletic 134: In late November, every win deserves credit Last week, I gushed about Longhorns defensive tackle Alfred Collins, who has secured his spot as a top-100 pick in this draft. This week, Sorrell deserves praise for the way he has boosted his stock. He had a sack and several pressures against Kentucky, but it was his effectiveness in defending the run that stood out on tape. Sorrell’s go-to is his snatch move. You can tell how much he works at it because it’s all over his tape and has become second nature for him. In the clip above, watch how quickly he engages off the snap to attack the breastplate, grab a fistful of cloth and pull the blocker’s weight forward, slinging himself into the backfield. This stop at the 1-yard line led to a third-down sack and, subsequently, a missed field goal. Sorrell doesn’t have the type of edge speed to easily capture the corner, but he is crafty and coachable with the football character that will be welcome as part of an NFL defensive line rotation. His draft arrow is pointing up. Advertisement I’m going to continue beating the Higgins drum until the Iowa State prospect gets more love. With his 155-yard performance Saturday against Utah, the South Miami native went over 1,000 yards receiving on the season. He is one of just a dozen FBS players to reach that mark so far in 2024 (only Tetairoa McMillan and Hunter have more receiving yards in the Big 12). At 6-foot-4 and 212 pounds, Higgins quickly enters his routes and gets on top of coverage with sub-4.5 speed. On this route below, he does a great job of attacking the defender’s leverage before seamlessly stemming back outside, leaving cornerback prospect Zemaiah Vaughn off balance and late to recover. A better throw and this would be six points. But Higgins still tracks the underthrown ball and finishes through contact. Higgins has a strong case to be one of the first senior wide receivers drafted, somewhere on Day Two. Ohio State had some defensive standouts in its win over Indiana — Cody Simon was dynamic, especially as a blitzer; Jack Sawyer led the team in pressures. But Hamilton continues to be the most underrated prospect in the Buckeyes’ defensive front. Hamilton (6-2 1/2, 300) doesn’t have the desired size for a one-technique tackle, but he holds his ground versus double teams and shows improved stack-and-shed efficiency against single blocks. On this rep above, he does a great job with his hands to establish leverage, track the football and cross the blocker to shut down the B-gap. Considered a borderline draft pick by NFL scouts over the summer, Hamilton not only has proven himself to be draftable, he has made a strong case for climbing into the top 125. He is following a similar path as his older brother, DaVon, who developed late and became a third-round pick for the Jaguars in 2020 (and signed an extension last year). GO DEEPER Field being reshaped in day shows beauty of 12 teams: College Football Playoff Bubble Watch Ersery is a prospect for whom I had high expectations coming into the year, but he has been up and down as a senior. He’s held on to a spot in my top 50 but hasn’t cemented him as a first-round lock. However, he played arguably his best game of the year Saturday against Penn State. Facing off against Abdul Carter, one of the freakiest athletes in college football, Ersery held his own and allowed only one pressure (and zero sacks) all game. He gave up some ground when he was late to counter a few inside moves, but he consistently got the job done in pass protection and as a run blocker. Despite some sloppy inconsistencies, Ersery (6-6, 337) has the movement skills that NFL teams covet. And his performance against Penn State shows the glass-half-full perspective for his projection.

But in the hustle and bustle that marks the time when we unleash Mariah Carey upon all of the elevators, I did find something I am grateful for, and that is the NBA Cup. Advertisement I have really grown excited by these Tuesday and Friday nights in November. Teams are competing and not blatantly exercising organizational priorities, and in a culture where we’re waiting for the next “trades we want to see” piece to drop, I like that NBA Cup games take place just after the glorified feel-out games that mark the opening weeks of the season and wrap up just before all of those new contracts become tradeable. In essence, the NBA Cup is your “offseason paper championship,” given that the rosters you see now are the ones we spent from the NBA Draft to media day discussing. So, yes, I am grateful. With that said, let’s get on to Power Rankings and what these 30 teams are grateful for as the normalcy of November comes to a close. A reminder: These Power Rankings won’t just rank every team. We will retain the tiers that teams will be promoted into and relegated out of. There will be five tiers every week: Let’s dive into Week 5 of the Power Rankings.

Defensive rating: 110.2 (eighth) Thankful: Kristaps Porziņģis is back Boston got off to a 14-3 start without The Unicorn, which seems significant given that the Celtics started 13-4 last season with Porziņģis playing 15 of those games. Porziņģis’ return capped a seven-day period that began with the Celtics tagging the Cleveland Cavaliers with their first loss. Now, the Celtics don’t have to be one of the most one-dimensional offenses in the league with unsteady rim protection. The full championship rotation is finally here.

Atkinson has transformed the Cavaliers offense in a way no head coach in franchise history has done. And the thing is, Atkinson could easily be coaching in Brooklyn or Charlotte right now.

Offensive rating: 114.2 (10th)
Defensive rating: 103.2 (first) Thankful: Isaiah Hartenstein is back Similar to the Celtics, the Thunder got their center back after having a fantastic start to the season in his absence. Unlike the Celtics, the Thunder needed Hartenstein as a replacement to go along with his presence as an asset in his own right. The injury to Chet Holmgren would have been far more devastating to last season’s Thunder team. This year, the Thunder were able to Smurf (they are blue, right?) their way to some wins with Jalen Williams as their nominal starting center.

Defensive rating: 107.5 (fourth) Thankful: Draymond Green’s discipline Green is a 35-year-old undersized power forward playing his 13th NBA season after being a second-round pick. He has had durability and discipline concerns for most of the previous five seasons. But entering Week 6, Green has played in every single game while serving as both Stephen Curry’s primary setup guy offensively and the computer of the Warriors defense. It’s the first time Green has played the first 17 games of a season in seven years. GO DEEPER Draymond Green, others pay the price for being the NBA's old men on D Last ranking: 5

Defensive rating: 103.7 (second) Thankful: AT&T It is such a luxury for the Rockets to have the youth and athleticism from Amen Thompson and Tari (Eason) coming off the bench. When those two are on the floor together, the Rockets outscore foes by 5.1 points per game and by 15.0 points per 100 possessions. Those two are legitimate game changers for coach Ime Udoka.

Offensive rating: 115.9 (fifth)
Defensive rating: 108.9 (sixth) Thankful: Tuomas Iisalo The Grizzlies had the worst offense in the NBA last season, and while player availability had a lot to do with that, coach Taylor Jenkins needed some reinvigoration. Iisalo, the 2024 EuroCup Coach of the Year, was tapped as one of Jenkins’ new assistants. This season, only the Cavaliers average more points per game (120.4), and that’s with Ja Morant missing half the games. Only the Thunder drive more, and they live in the paint and on the offensive glass. Memphis is dynamic with whoever is available to Jenkins this season, and he made a strong move by adding Iisalo to his staff.  Last ranking: 7

Kentavious Caldwell-Pope signed as a free agent and is shooting 22.4 percent from 3. But Wagner has been a steady and consistent force while allowing Orlando to maintain its size advantage defensively. He is leading a Magic team that has won nine of its past 10 games.

Before the season, it seemed more likely that fellow wing Mikal Bridges would take on a heavier role offensively. But Anunoby is averaging a career-high 19.1 points per game while hitting career-best marks from the field (52.4 percent) and from 3 (42.2 percent). Most importantly, Anunoby hasn’t missed a game.

Defensive rating: 109.8 (seventh) Thankful: Naji Marshall breaking through The Mavericks were crying out for a player to help Luka Dončić, Kyrie Irving and Klay Thompson offensively earlier this month. Marshall, a free agent from the New Orleans Pelicans, has emerged as that player. Undrafted out of Xavier, Marshall is averaging a career-best 11.3 points on 55 percent shooting from the field. He already has eight dunks this season; Marshall had nine all of last season and has never had more than 14 in a season. Marshall can be even better, too, as he is only shooting 28.6 percent from 3 after making 38.7 percent last year. Advertisement Last ranking: 11

Defensive rating: 108.4 (fifth) Thankful: Jeff Van Gundy Similar to Memphis’ offense, the LA Clippers are benefiting from head coach Tyronn Lue adding a new coordinator to his staff. The Clippers had a four-game streak of holding opponents under 100 points before Boston tied an NBA record with 12 3s in a quarter Monday. Van Gundy has brought a level of detail and urgency to the Clippers that has led to arguably the most impressive defense in team history, and that’s with Paul George departing and Kawhi Leonard not playing a single game. Ivica Zubac in particular has stepped up on the glass and the interior to be an All-Defensive team candidate. Last ranking: 13

Defensive rating: 114.0 (17th) Thankful: The Los Angeles Lakers Denver would be a lot lower in these rankings if it didn’t have a visit to Los Angeles this past weekend. The Nuggets’ dominance over that franchise in the last few seasons is really a sight to behold. After a tough NBA Cup loss at home Friday against the Mavericks, the same night Nikola Jokić came back from personal leave, beating up on the new version of the Lakers showed that Denver can still be a problem.

Barnes is the reigning Western Conference Player of the Week and shooting a career-best 43.9 percent from 3 and 52 percent from the field. Paul is in his 20th NBA season and still is one of seven players averaging at least eight assists per game while playing in at least 10 games. Advertisement Last ranking: 6

Defensive rating: 117.9 (27th) Thankful: The New Orleans Pelicans The Pelicans already gave the Lakers Anthony Davis in 2019, which immediately led to a championship. Davis is now averaging 30 points per game for the first time in his 13-year career. But that’s not all! The Pelicans had a chance to get Los Angeles’ 2024 first-round pick in June but decided to defer to 2025. That allowed the Lakers to select forward Dalton Knecht 17th. Knecht is shooting 50/40/90 as a rookie: 51.5 percent from the field, 45 percent from 3 and 93.3 percent from the free-throw line. Last ranking: 14
In the last week: L vs. NY
Offensive rating: 112.6 (13th)
Defensive rating: 115.3 (20th) Thankful: A bye week It’s really nice to have five days off at this time of the year. It’s even better when Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal are recovering from calf injuries. The Suns were awful with Durant out of the lineup, losing six of seven games. The lone win came in Utah, and four of the losses were by at least 10 points. It’s discouraging that the Suns couldn’t find more wins with Devin Booker available, but Phoenix should be grateful that there weren’t more games to play this past week.

Defensive rating: 111.1 (11th) Thankful: Tyler Herro’s offense Miami is significantly better defensively with Herro off the floor, but Herro has been a big part of why the Heat aren’t a bottom-10 offense. Herro is averaging career highs in points (23.8), assists (5.1) and 3-point volume (4.1 makes per game) and accuracy (42.6 percent). It’s the first time in Herro’s career that he is over 40 percent from 3. Last ranking: 10

Defensive rating: 112.2 (13th) Thankful: Nickeil Alexander-Walker’s versatility We’re scraping here a bit, as we’ve already acknowledged Anthony Edwards’ shooting and Julius Randle’s good health to begin the season, and Minnesota is scuffling. But Alexander-Walker has been a bright spot for a bench that has been thinner than expected due to Donte DiVincenzo’s struggles and Rob Dillingham’s lack of readiness. Alexander-Walker is shooting career highs from the field (48 percent) and from 3 (44.4 percent) while compiling a career-best 2.6 assists per game. Alexander-Walker is still an impact defender for a team that is disappointing on that end. Advertisement Last ranking: 23

Antetokounmpo has been on a rampage as the Bucks have won six of their past seven games, with Giannis averaging 33.4 points, 10.9 rebounds and 7.9 assists.

Defensive rating: 117.3 (25th) Thankful: Jordi Fernandez The former Kings assistant had a triumphant return to Northern California as the head coach of the Nets, getting back-to-back wins against the Kings and Warriors. The win over the Warriors was particularly impressive given that it came with a rest disadvantage and with a gameday roster that didn’t have Ben Simmons or Nic Claxton to begin with and didn’t have Cameron Johnson to end with. Cam Thomas also was held out in the fourth quarter. Fernandez leaned on Dennis Schröder to complete the comeback in Golden State while getting production out of Ziaire Williams and Jalen Wilson.

When the Pacers play in Indiana, their defense is acceptable while the offense is good (albeit not great like last season). When the Pacers get on a plane, they have a bottom-10 offense and defense, and All-NBA point guard Tyrese Haliburton goes from 22.5 points per game on 46.3 percent from the field to 12.3 points and 31.8 percent.

He was playing behind Killian Hayes to begin last season, and he couldn’t build chemistry with Cade Cunningham as a rookie due to Cunningham’s season-ending leg surgery. Ivey has improved his game in his third season, getting his 3-point percentage over league average to 37.2 percent while getting back to the free-throw line at a high rate.

Defensive rating: 118.2 (28th) Thankful: Zach LaVine’s resolve The Bulls might be at a crossroads, but LaVine decided that he was going to make the best out of the situation. He has had a solid start to his 11th season and has been more efficient than ever as a shooter. LaVine is making 52.1 percent of his field goals and 44 percent of his 3s, both of which would be career highs. There’s only been one season where LaVine made 50 percent from the field or 40 percent from 3, and that was LaVine’s first All-Star season in 2020-21. LaVine also has more dunks already this season (14) than all of last year (13). Advertisement Last ranking: 19

He leads the NBA with 3.1 steals per game, is adding 1.0 blocks and 4.7 rebounds and is doing just enough offensively to return positive value. If Daniels ever can get his shooting to be league average, then he would be a star. In the meantime, he has an awesome nickname now (Great Barrier Thief). Last ranking: 22

On one hand, Miller already has had six games where he failed to clear 40 percent from the field. That needs to be cleaned up. But he gave the Pistons a career-best 38 points a day before his 22nd birthday, and he is already halfway toward matching his four 30-point games from last season. Last ranking: 18

Markkanen continues to improve parts of his game, as he is up to 44.6 percent from 3 this season. The only other year of Markkanen’s career where he broke 40 percent was 2020-21, his last season in Chicago. It’s criminal, or tank-worthy, that Markkanen only averages 12.8 field goal attempts per game this season. Advertisement Last ranking: 29

Defensive rating: 114.1 (18th) Thankful: Jared McCain The Sixers are thoroughly uninspiring, with only one of their wins coming without needing overtime and only getting six minutes from the expected star trio of Joel Embiid, Paul George and Tyrese Maxey because of various injuries and Embiid’s suspension. But McCain has been a bright spot who was only able to emerge thanks to the stars being out of the lineup. Nick Nurse had no choice but to give McCain a chance to generate some offense. Over the last nine games, McCain is averaging 24.3 points and 4.0 assists while shooting 42 percent from 3. Not bad for the 16th pick in the draft.

The last time Payton started more than one game in a season was 2020-21 with the New York Knicks. In Monday’s loss to the Pacers, Payton compiled 21 assists while making seven field goals. New Orleans has had multiple games where it didn’t have 20 assists as a team, including last week’s 41-point loss at Dallas, the last game before Payton joined the team in place of Jaylen Nowell. Last ranking: 30

Defensive rating: 118.8 (30th) Thankful: Jordan Poole bouncing back. Washington has beaten one NBA team this season — Atlanta, twice —but Poole has gone back to the lab and cleaned up his game. Last year saw Poole’s field goal percentage drop to 41.3 percent and his 3-point percentage drop to 32.6 percent. This season, Poole is shooting career bests from the field (45.9 percent) and from 3 (44.3 percent), and he is up to 21.2 points and 4.9 assists per game. While Kyle Kuzma has gone the other way in terms of harmful inefficiency, at least Poole has played better after being one of the most inefficient guards in the league last year.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Fantasy football Week 13 drops: Quentin Johnston's drops make him droppable and more,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5949291/2024/11/26/fantasy-football-week-13-drops-quentin-johnstons-drops-make-him-droppable-and-more/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 14:36:03 GMT",Gary Davenport gives advice on who to drop ahead of Week 13 as fantasy football playoffs near.,"Fantasy Football It ain’t the time of year for the faint of heart. Sure, if your fantasy team is 10-2 (or even 9-3), you can relax a little — you’re almost certainly headed to the playoffs. But even then, there’s still the matter of securing a first-round bye — getting one week closer to a championship without having to worry about taking a loss that ends the season. Advertisement But lots of other fantasy managers are sitting at 7-5 or 6-6 (Or 5-7 — keep hope alive!) and simply cannot afford to take another loss. Fortunately, all 32 teams are in action this week (something to be truly thankful for), but that doesn’t mean there aren’t managers with potential holes on the roster — or dead weight dragging it down. GO DEEPER Fantasy football Week 13 waiver wire: Streamers, Jeremy McNichols, Xavier Legette This late in the season, roster construction philosophy should change. It makes a lot more sense to roster “handcuff” backs than a wide receiver who you’d only be able to start without sobbing after four shots of Rumple Minze. If your starting quarterback is solid, there’s no need to carry a “meh” backup. If players can’t help you now (or in the near future), there’s no point in rostering them. Grab your running back’s backup. Heck, if your playoff spot is sewn up, add a second defense with an outstanding postseason schedule. Fantasy managers desperate for a win should be trying to lock down spot starters at positions of weakness. What they shouldn’t be doing is letting the following players (who, per my mystic reverse-jinx powers, have a real shot at a big Week 13) clog up their roster anymore. (Rostered percentages courtesy of Yahoo!) Players to dump in leagues with 10 teams or short benches Johnston’s rookie year was poo, and he only has 22 catches this season. But six of those grabs have gone for scores, and Johnston took a three-week stretch of double-digit PPR points into Week 12. While speaking to Omar Navarro of the team’s website, Johnston credited his 2024 success in part to the confidence in him expressed by head coach Jim Harbaugh. “That’s what every player wants to hear from a coach; that must mean he really believes that,” Johnston said. “Him and the rest of the coaching staff got all the confidence in the world in me, as I do in myself. Shoot, once I believe in myself and the coaches believe in me, anything anybody else got to say doesn’t really matter at that point.” Advertisement Harbaugh continued to express confidence in Johnston after a Week 12 goose egg in which Johnston looked like he was trying to catch the ball wearing oven mitts, but wise fantasy managers should be out on the second-year receiver. Johnston hasn’t caught more than two passes since Week 9, and there are other wideouts, like the Denver Broncos Devaughn Vele, who are widely available and can, you know, catch and stuff. Over the first eight weeks of the season, Purdy was a respectable eighth among quarterbacks in fantasy points. But the most relevant Mr. Irrelevant in NFL history missed last week’s blowout loss to the Green Bay Packers with a shoulder injury. While addressing the media, Niners head coach Kyle Shanahan expressed some confidence that Purdy could be back out there Sunday against the Buffalo Bills. GO DEEPER Fantasy Football Week 12 recap: Can McCaffrey turn it around? It doesn't look good “He threw lighter today to see if the rest helped, and the rest did help him,” Shanahan said Monday. “We will see again, going through the same things that we did last week. We are going to let him rest all the way up to Wednesday. We will see how it feels Wednesday, and then we will take the exact same course throughout the week, and hopefully, it responds better this week than last week with the rest.” Purdy is genuinely questionable for Week 13 — when the reeling San Francisco 49ers face an uphill battle against arguably the league’s hottest team. The Bills have allowed the eighth-fewest fantasy points per game to quarterbacks in 2024. And even if Purdy does give it a go, he’ll be at less than 100 percent. Never mind his four starts this year with under 15 fantasy points. If fantasy managers don’t have a better option on the roster, they might want to check the wire — because starting Purdy this week is asking for trouble. Players to drop for literally anyone  Advertisement Johnson has already appeared in this column this year, but I had to include him again after seeing that he has a higher rostered percentage than Cedric Tillman of the Cleveland Browns and Romeo Doubs of the Packers. I mean, seriously — what are we doing? In three games since joining the Baltimore Ravens, Johnson has one more catch than I do. He’s been targeted six times, which goes beyond some “he’s acclimating to a new offense” type of thing. He was added as injury insurance — nothing more. The list of receivers who should be rostered ahead of Johnson is, well, all of them. Mason was admittedly outstanding in place of an injured Christian McCaffrey early in the season — he averaged more than five yards a carry in five of the first six games of the season and was eighth in PPR points among running backs over that span. But that was then, and this is now. McCaffrey is back to dominating the backfield workload for the reeling 49ers. Mason had all of four touches last week against the Packers. It’s simple, really — if you have McCaffrey on the team, then keeping Mason on the roster makes sense. If not? Live in the now, man. Want to know when an NFL team has a bad passing game? When you start missing Daniel Jones, things are bad. And after one start from Tommy DeVito, that’s where we are with the New York Giants. Robinson wasn’t terrible last week against the Giants — he caught all five of his targets for 47 yards. But Robinson hasn’t had 12 PPR points in a game since Week 5. There’s just no ceiling to the Giants passing game with Danny DeVito (played by Louie De Palma in “Taxi”) chucking worm-burners all over the place. And the possibility of Drew Lock taking over sounds like as much fun as a colonoscopy. Gary Davenport is a two-time Fantasy Sports Writers Association Football Writer of the Year.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Rookie Jared McCain, taking inspiration from Stephen Curry, is thriving for the Sixers",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5945868/2024/11/26/jared-mccain-sixers-rookie/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 14:00:43 GMT","The rookie has been one of the bright spots in the Sixers' dark season: ""It's a great feeling having this kind of an impact on the team.""","NBA The NBA has seen smiles like Jared McCain’s before. Isiah Thomas and Magic Johnson had magnetic smiles that captivated and charmed throughout the 1980s. In today’s league, Anthony Edwards has a great one, but that’s usually followed by the kind of trash talk you wouldn’t want around your mother. And then there’s Stephen Curry, who, at age 36, is still a smiling, baby-faced assassin who can put opponents to sleep. Advertisement McCain has a smile that makes you believe that he’s happy to be here soaking in every moment of his rookie season for the Philadelphia 76ers. But, like all of the telegenic guards, McCain’s smile hides something: a competitive streak that has him terrorizing opposing defenses, one relocation 3-pointer at a time. Has McCain’s race to the front of the Rookie of the Year race been surprising? Yes, for how quickly the 20-year-old has emerged onto the NBA scene. But maybe we shouldn’t be surprised. It’s possible people were too focused on watching and dissecting his wildly popular TikToks and painted fingernails to properly evaluate his basketball acumen. Yes, McCain, like many young athletes who have grown up in the social-media era, presents a different public persona than his predecessors, but he has many of the same qualities as those great NBA guards, specifically his hero, Curry. “He’s always been my favorite player in the league,” McCain told The Athletic. “Steph influenced so many people, including me, in my generation. When I was growing up, I wanted to shoot 3s from as far away as I could.” McCain grew up in California, during the height of Curry’s career. He was 11 and vividly remembers watching during Curry’s first championship run with the Golden State Warriors. He’s one of the first of the Curry generation to make it to the league, inspired by watching the Golden State guard change the game. There are significant parts of McCain’s game that remind you of the future Hall of Famer. “I think I watched him more off the ball than on the ball,” he said. “I watched the way he relocates after he passes it. I watched the way he’s able to sprint around the court. I think I’m in really good shape, and I get my feet set fast. So those are some things that I think I can use to my advantage to get shots off. Advertisement “I know I have to be crafty at the rim, so I’m still working on my finishes there. But when people close out on you, you have to figure out how to create space.” What has made the rookie so difficult to guard early in his career? He’s a terrific shooter, with a quick release and unlimited range. But he’s more advanced off the dribble than anticipated. He possesses a quick first step and has a strong body that allows him to get his shoulders past a defender on his way to the basket. That makes up for the fact that he plays almost exclusively below the rim. He has a developed midrange game and is a talented pick-and-roll player. McCain moves without the ball at an almost expert level. He knows how to navigate and manipulate screens to get open and to create a basketball advantage. He has mastered passing to a teammate and relocating for an open look from 3-point range. Jared McCain looking Steph-like on back-to-back plays pic.twitter.com/eIsRKwMO7f — Kevin O’Connor (@KevinOConnorNBA) November 23, 2024 
We should have known that the skill set that made him a two-time Gatorade Player of the Year in California, a McDonald’s All-American, a Duke standout and a first-round pick would translate to the league. Shooting, in this era after Curry’s revolution, always translates. Especially when you can catch and shoot or shoot off the dribble or off movement, as well as McCain does. He has shown there is a steely competitor underneath the aw-shucks smile and TikTok dances. That he’s doing all of this for a version of the Philadelphia 76ers that resembles a washed, all-bark-no-bite Apollo Creed in his pre-fight news conference with Ivan Drago is as amazing as it is surprising. The Sixers are 3-13 on the season after getting smoked at home on Sunday night against the Los Angeles Clippers. If the season ended today, Philadelphia would have the second-highest lottery odds, and they do have a top-six protected pick. So if you are a Sixers fan looking for a positive, they are firmly in the Cooper Flagg race. The health of superstar center Joel Embiid has been tenuous for almost a year. All-Star forward Paul George has suffered multiple knee injuries since training camp, and he hasn’t played well when he has been in uniform. McCain has been the biggest bright spot this season for the Sixers. Right now, he has a good chance to be the league’s Rookie of the Year. He set an NBA record for most 3-pointers made in his first five career starts, with 26. He set the Sixers record for most 3s made through the first 15 games of his career, with 37. He set the rookie record for most consecutive games with at least three 3-pointers made, with eight straight. Advertisement McCain went seven consecutive games scoring at least 20 points. By contrast, the other rookies in this class have combined for 10 such games. In part because of his teammates’ injuries, McCain has been Philadelphia’s most consistent offensive player. And no matter how this season turns out, he and star guard Tyrese Maxey have the potential to form a potent backcourt duo. “He’s himself,” Maxey said. “That’s what everybody likes about him. He’s not afraid to be himself off the floor, and when you have that, that’s half the battle. He’s been playing well from the very beginning. In training camp and in preseason. We all knew pretty early that he could play.” The 76ers front office fell in love with McCain’s shooting in the pre-draft process. But what sold executive Daryl Morey on drafting him was that McCain picked up multiple facets of the game abnormally fast. If you asked the Sixers in June whether McCain would have been this vital to their team by November, they would have chuckled and told you as gently as possible to calm down. “I’m surprised for sure that he’s produced this much, this early,” Sixers coach Nick Nurse said. “But when you saw him in summer league, he did the little things. I thought it was pretty obvious that this kid could play.” Yet, for many, it was easy to wonder if the kid who embraced the TikTok craze could play at the NBA level. Since he was a teenager, he’s had to have a sense of toughness. “I’m so used to the talk right now that it doesn’t really matter what anyone says,” McCain said. “I’ve been dealing with it since high school. I hear it all the time; they call me ‘TikTok Boy’ and things like that. “It’s just that I’m on a bigger stage right now. I know that I work hard. I know how much I put into the game of basketball. So, I’m not going to allow how people feel about what I do to affect my play.” Advertisement If there was truly a “Steph Curry” moment for McCain, it happened a week ago against the Miami Heat, one that McCain himself didn’t pick up on. He was running as a wing in transition in the first half, with teammate Kelly Oubre Jr. leading the opportunity. Oubre ended up getting a relatively uncontested layup, because two Heat players ran to McCain to try to deny him. That’s the kind of gravity McCain has earned in the last few weeks. When told of this, McCain just smiled and laughed. His other landmark moment this season came against the Brooklyn Nets, when he nailed a 3-pointer, turned and yelled emphatically, “I’m the Rookie of the Year.” “I’M THE ROOKIE OF THE YEAR!” —Jared McCain 🔥 pic.twitter.com/ezzlIDg4Q9 — SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) November 23, 2024  We don’t know if the Sixers are going to turn this around. They have dug a huge hole and are already six games out of the No. 4 spot in the Eastern Conference, which means home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs. But we do know that McCain has been the curiosity who’s quickly turning into a star, and no matter what, that’s the win Philadelphia can take away from the season. “It’s a great feeling having this kind of an impact on the team,” McCain said. “Coming to a team with Tyrese Maxey, Paul George and Joel Embiid, I just wanted to find a way to get on the floor. So, this is pretty crazy to think about. “I didn’t try to put any expectation on myself. I just wanted to come in and be myself and work as hard as I could. I wanted to let the work show.” (Top photo: Mitchell Leff / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

That’s not true, though. It’s there. “Yeah, it’s hard not to have that in the head,” the 25-year-old Kurashev said after practice on Monday. “I’ve had that before with the contract year. You try not to think about it too much. You just want to go out there on the ice. At the end of the day, you can’t control what the contract is. You can control how you play. At the end of the day, that’s how you will get a new contract. I got to make sure I start playing well again and help the team, so I can get a contract and all that. But I’m not thinking about that right now. I’m just playing every game that I can and do the best I can. At the end of the day, that’s how I’ll get that.” Advertisement Kurashev is also well aware he hasn’t taken care of business well enough on the ice this season to have peace of mind about his business off it. He has been a healthy scratch the last two games. It looks like he’ll return to the lineup Wednesday, but it will have been a full week since he’s played in a game. He also sat out one game earlier in the season. That’s a harsh reality check for someone who produced a career-high 54 points last season, started the season centering the second line and was hopeful to take another step this season and get paid for it. Kurashev does have time to turn his season around. There are 61 games left. But as Blackhawks coach Luke Richardson has tried to get across to him the past week, it’s on Kurashev to do that. He has to make things happen from here on out. So far this season, he’s been too passive. “We don’t want him to be reckless, but we need him to go after and get that puck and be a little bit more engaged like he was last year and shooting the puck, take charge,” Richardson said. “It’s not always look for a play. Sometimes it’s look to shoot first, and if it’s not there, maybe there’s some time to skate into ice and make a play.” Kurashev mentioned being more aggressive multiple times on Monday. If he gets in Wednesday, he’s ready to shoot more, drive more, forecheck more. “I don’t feel like I have many shots, especially in the last couple games I was playing,” said Kurashev, who has four points on the season. “I got to stay on that, and then try to attack the net more. You never know, it can bounce in or someone can be a rebound and my teammates score. I got to be more aggressive and try and take the game and not just wait for something to open up. “Of course, it’s frustrating when you don’t play and you don’t maybe produce as much as you want to. But I’m trying to stay positive and try not to think about it too much. Every day trying to take a step. I’m sure it’ll start bouncing, just got to work hard and take the game and not wait for it to come to me.” Kurashev is hopeful playing with Connor Bedard again will spark him. Last season, Kurashev produced eight goals and 14 assists, including 10 primary assists, while sharing the ice with Bedard in five-on-five play. This season, Kurashev has zero goals and one assist in 90 minutes with Bedard. There are a lot of different ways to dissect Bedard’s game so far this season. Below, I’ll look at him through Corey Sznajder’s tracking data. First is Bedard’s tracking data from 2023-24. He was firmly in the blue in a lot of categories.    And below are what those numbers look like this season. He’s still excelling in a lot of areas, but his defensive numbers are down from last season. Another category that jumps out is his one-timers per 60. That was in the positive last season. Most NHL players will struggle to score if they’re not scoring off passes from teammates with one-timers. That could be an area where Taylor Hall could help as a linemate next game. Hall is one of the team’s top passers and creates a lot within the offensive zone.      Most NHL teams hand out a player of the game award after victories. It’s often a unique item, too. The New York Rangers have their Broadway hat. The Nashville Predators hand out a small shovel. The Minnesota Wild have a chain with the word “HARD” attached to it, which Michael Russo recently wrote about. Advertisement “They made one, right?” Blackhawks captain Nick Foligno said of the Wild’s victory chain. “That’s cool. It’s neat. It’s something personal. Whatever comes up, there’s an inside joke sometimes. We had one that was really funny. I think we had an actual sword (with the Columbus Blue Jackets). We weren’t allowed to travel with it, but at home, we gave it out too, with the kepi (hat).” The Blackhawks handed out a championship-style wrestling belt for years. It’s since been retired and placed in the archives. They went next with a Blackhawks puck chain. And then last week, they introduced a new tool belt after defeating the Florida Panthers. “I just think it’s something to change it up,” Foligno said. “I think something has to be personal. It was cool with the puck, but, you know, personal touch. I thought the tool belt, we’re trying to build something here. You need one of those to build. Just something tacky but funny.” There are future plans for an even more team-specific award. “I think down the road we’re going to have something pretty cool from Sac and Fox Nation (with whom the Blackhawks have a partnership),” Foligno said. “That’ll be pretty cool as well. Hopefully a lot of games to be won and passed around. … I just said, with our namesake and the special relationship that we have, we need to have something they feel proud that we hand out. Just like in their culture, like when someone does something, to distinguish they seem to hand out feathers or whatever it might be. So we’re trying to think of something very personal to our team and make them proud that we’re handing it out in their honor.”     A post shared by Chicago Blackhawks (@nhlblackhawks)  It might be safe for Blackhawks fans to get excited about forward prospect Nick Lardis. He just continues to score goals. Lardis has been especially feeling it over his last five games. In that span, he had nine goals, six assists and 41 shots on net. He had two hat tricks and two games of 10-plus shots on net. He’s now tied for an OHL-lead 23 goals in 22 games. He also leads the league with 123 shots on net and is sixth with 36 points. Advertisement “The skill set has always been there with Lardis — the skating, the shot, the ability to get the shot off quick. But talking to Andy Delmore, who has been his main point of contact this year from our development staff, just said he’s less of a complementary player now,” Blackhawks assistant general manager of player development Mark Eaton said recently. “It’s less for him about waiting to get the puck in good areas. He’s going to get pucks. He’s retrieving more pucks. He’s working to possess more pucks and get pucks in more higher quality scoring areas.” The last Blackhawks prospect to lead the OHL in goals was Alex DeBrincat. He had 65 goals in 63 games during the 2016-17 season. Here’s a compilation of some of Lardis’ recent goals: Does winning faceoffs matter? Sure, somewhat, but probably not as much as a lot of people think. There is no direct correlation between winning faceoffs and being a great possession team. For example, the Panthers are 28th in the league with a 47.6 faceoff percentage. Some studies have shown winning or losing a ton of faceoffs can result in a goal differential over large sample sizes. That’s all to say it’s difficult to gauge whether the Blackhawks’ faceoff percentage has been a factor in their losses this season. The Blackhawks are 29th in the NHL with a 45.1 percentage. It is interesting to see when that percentage is broken down by zone. The Blackhawks are 20th with a 49.7 winning percentage in the offensive zone, 27th with a 46.4 percentage in the neutral zone and 32nd with a 40.2 percentage in the defensive zone. The defensive zone number does give you pause. You also factor in the Blackhawks have taken the seventh-most faceoffs at 448. That equates to a lot of lost faceoffs. It might be worth my time later in the season as the sample size grows to see how many goals the Blackhawks are allowing soon after faceoff losses. The Blackhawks are near last season’s home attendance average so far, but there might be some concern if Bedard doesn’t get going and/or the team doesn’t start winning. Through eight games this season, they’ve averaged 18,649 fans. They finished with an average of 18,836 fans last season. Patrick Kane’s second game back has helped bump the numbers early this season. The Blackhawks drew a season-high 19,984 for their game against the Detroit Red Wings. They have also had four games with 19,000-plus fans and one with 18,000-plus. Advertisement Their three games under 18,000 might be an issue going forward this season. Last season, the Blackhawks had just six games under 18,000 fans. With 33 to go, there isn’t a big margin for errors. February, March and April could be challenging with 10 of their 14 games on weekdays. Playing one of their home games this season at Wrigley Field for the Winter Classic will obviously be a big boost. They also have 12 more weekend games remaining. Can you guess which Blackhawks line has been together the most this season? It’s the fourth line of Craig Smith, Lukas Reichel and Patrick Maroon, as we all expected. The trio has played together a team-high 86.6 minutes, according to Evolving Hockey. While the line has an expected goals percentage of just 41.71, it has defied expectations. The Blackhawks have outscored teams 5-1 with the line on the ice. If I were to rank the Blackhawks prospects by play, not potential, this season, this is where I’d have them: 1. Frank Nazar, forward, Rockford IceHogs (AHL): Nazar has his share of doubters. The NHL will be the ultimate test, but I think he has a chance to be part of the Blackhawks’ core in the future. The offense and skating appear to be there. He could be the second-line center of the future. He has a chance to be an elite penalty killer, too. If he can smooth out some areas in the defensive zone, which is what he’s working on, he should be able to help the Blackhawks sooner rather than later. 2. Nick Lardis, forward, Brantford Bulldogs (OHL): See above. 3. Sam Rinzel, defenseman, University of Minnesota (NCAA): Rinzel is becoming everything the Blackhawks dreamed he would be when they used a first-round pick on him in 2022. He’s finally added some muscle to his frame, and it’s allowing him to be a difference-maker all over the ice. He’s one of the best offensive defensemen in college hockey and is no longer a defensive liability. Advertisement 4. Aidan Thompson, forward, University of Denver (NCAA): Whether Thompson’s breakout college season is anything more at the next level will be seen with time, but he’s definitely off to an impressive year. He has had a point in every one of his 14 games this season and is second in the nation in points and third in goals. He’s an older prospect, but there’s still time for the Blackhawks to sign him and see what he can bring. 5. Samuel Savoie, forward, IceHogs: Landon Slaggert deserves some recognition in Rockford, too, but Savoie has been the biggest surprise. He took a step from last season’s injury, and you weren’t sure how he would bounce back. He’s returned in a big way. His speed and tenacity have been impressive all over the ice. He could be in the NHL next season. (Photo of Philipp Kurashev skating against Kraken forward Chandler Stephenson: Stephen Brashear / USA Today) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The 54-year-old has been without a job since leaving his role as England manager in July following eight years in charge of the national team.  However, despite several reports linking him with a return to the game, Southgate says going back to coaching is not the only option available to him as he ponders the next step he should take in his career.  Advertisement In a post on LinkedIn, he said: “After eight years serving in one of the highest profile roles in world football, I’m consciously taking time to reflect on what I lived through and thinking deeply about what comes next. “Looking back there are matches and moments I will remember for the rest of my life. Coaching top players was a challenge that pushed me to operate at the very highest level.  “The weight of the role with the unique responsibility it carried was something few ever get to experience. Perhaps the hardest thing of all to replicate though, is going to be the sense of purpose. “This higher purpose (from being England manager) kept me on track, gave me structure, made my life more fulfilling and is going to be extremely difficult to replicate. “It’s why I’m not limiting my future options to remaining as a football coach.” After a 17-year playing career that saw him make 557 appearances for Crystal Palace, Aston Villa and Middlesborough as well as playing 57 times for England, Southgate retired in 2006. He managed his former club Middlesbrough for three years between 2006 and 2009. He then became England academy manager in 2011, before three years as under-21 manager in 2013 and then finally becoming first team manager in 2016. During his eight years in charge of the England first team, he led the side to two European Championship finals, as well as the quarter-finals of the 2022 World Cup and a fourth-place finish at the 2018 World Cup. In October, Southgate said that he intended to have a year away from coaching. Southgate continued: “As part of working out what comes next, I’ve really enjoyed picking the brains of some outstanding people. By offering them a blank canvas great conversations have developed and a flow of ideas I’d never contemplated.  “I’m comfortable with this period of ‘exploration’ and not having all the answers. I’m following the advice I would give to any young person, without a clear career vision.  Advertisement “Keep learning, build or explore your network, seek different life experiences and when you decide what’s next, there will be no right or wrong, just one path or another.  “For now, I’m finding my required purpose within all that being able to dial up the days supporting my chosen charities. It’s my intention to identify people I want to work with and projects and passions I want to work on.  “I will be putting purpose high on my list of considerations, because in those difficult moments we all face, the purpose will keep us going.” GO DEEPER Gareth Southgate's legacy: He repaired a broken England team and made them a force again (Top photo: Catherine Ivill/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Scottie Barnes' good leadership, Chris Boucher and more: Raptors starting 5",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5948514/2024/11/26/scottie-barnes-chris-boucher-raptors-starting-5/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 13:21:34 GMT","Elsewhere, the Raptors need to start taking a lot more 3s.","NBA The play looked about as uncomfortable as could be. A few days after returning from a three-plus-week absence because of a broken orbital bone, Scottie Barnes got hit across the face again. Collecting his own rebound in a loss in Cleveland on Sunday night, Barnes was patient and powered up to take another attempt. He tried to lay the ball in, and Cavaliers centre Jarrett Allen got some ball but also hit Barnes in the face on the follow-through of his block attempt. Advertisement Barnes was on the ground, in obvious pain. It would have been more than understandable if he spooked in the moment. However, after a brief stoppage, Barnes was up. A few seconds later, he hit a 3, excitedly screaming as the Cavaliers called a timeout. The Raptors lost in Cleveland. On Monday, they lost again in Detroit on a Jaden Ivey buzzer-beater. Forget about the results, and the injury: This has been a wonderful start to the year for Barnes as a leader. He has been criticized, often with good cause, for saying the wrong thing or acting the wrong way early in his career. The Raptors still gave him a maximum-value extension in the offseason, a bet on a pass-first forward with elite size and athleticism. He hasn’t played enough yet this year to be able to assess his growth on the court, but he has made steps with his demeanour. He has channeled that best in his effort to push the pace with the ball. The intangibles, which can be overemphasized, feel better, too. Most importantly, he seems excited by the right things. Barnes yelped in glee after blocking Evan Mobley on Sunday, and was even louder after Jamal Shead hit a 3 going the other way. While he is still trying to shoot efficiently, he has dished out 20 assists in his first three games back. His 31-point, 14-rebound effort versus the Pistons was his best Alpha effort of the year, albeit not enough against the Pistons without Cade Cunningham. Extra vision with the goggles 🥽 pic.twitter.com/lF1uhF8xSr — Toronto Raptors (@Raptors) November 25, 2024  Mobley and Cunningham, two of the three players picked ahead of Barnes in 2021, are significant contributors in their respective’ teams season. Franz Wagner, the eighth pick that year, looks like he could be an All-Star in Orlando. There are many other excellent players who were picked elsewhere in the first and early second rounds. Advertisement It feels like we’ll be arguing about those players for a long time. The Raptors are about as together as any team with a 4-14 record can be, and Barnes deserves some credit for that. You might have forgotten this, but Chris Boucher was great in the Tampa Tank season. He was eighth in Sixth Man of The Year voting, averaging 20.3 points, 10 rebounds and 2.8 blocks per 36 minutes. Most of the scoring was owing to a career-best 38.3-percent accuracy from 3. He was below 17 points per 36 minutes in each of the three following seasons but entered the Pistons game at 21.7 points per 36 minutes, despite a 3-point percentage a few ticks below his career average. He is shooting 67.1 percent from inside the arc, numbers that imitate a rim-running centre. He is back in coach Darko Rajaković’s good graces. He is also in the final year of his three-year contract, which will make him an interesting trade candidate. It is harder than ever to complete trades because of the stricter rules for teams paying into the luxury tax and above aprons. Also, Boucher is probably the fourth big on a good team. While the third year on that contract seemed unnecessary at the time, at least the Raptors structured the deal so it descended as time progressed. He makes $10.8 million this year. A team looking for some depth and offensive rebounding could come calling. Boucher to Cleveland (25th in offensive rebound percentage) for Georges Niang and two second-rounders? Boucher to Sacramento (23rd) for Trey Lyles and a second? Boucher to Orlando (14th) for Gary Harris, Caleb Houstan and a pair of seconds? BOUCHER 😤👏 pic.twitter.com/v7bDvGFPoe — Toronto Raptors (@Raptors) November 26, 2024  He’s not going to be the star of a market. Competitive teams might be turned off by how shot-happy he can be. But if the Raptors can turn him into some picks, that will be a credit to both team and player. Davion Mitchell and Boucher are fourth and sixth in total minutes for the Raptors this year. They are also both free agents at the end of the year — Mitchell is restricted, Boucher is unrestricted. Perhaps coincidentally and perhaps not, the Raptors used two of their second-round picks in 2024 on Jamal Shead and Jonathan Mogbo. Shead has been struggling, although he had a wonderful early stretch in Detroit, while Mogbo is having another good stint, but both feel like they could slide into the veterans’ roles next year if necessary. It's the defence for me 🔒 https://t.co/SZh8mbVaW7 pic.twitter.com/UkqaGxCUWs — Toronto Raptors (@Raptors) November 25, 2024  That is a good place to be when you are rebuilding. The Raptors are committed to paying Barnes, Immanuel Quickley and RJ Barrett as well-compensated starters or more, giving them little room to add on the fringes in the short-term. The Raptors won’t want to pay into the luxury tax as they try to build toward another playoff appearance, which means getting choosy about your role players. Advertisement Mitchell and Boucher have been good this year. But, if by the end of the year, both Mogbo and Shead have proven they can hang in the rotation — the Raptors have been solid with Mogbo on the floor, less so with Shead — the Raptors can be comfortable in letting the free agents walk, Mogbo even took two 3s against the Cavaliers, and banked one in against the Pistons. Baby steps! Not for nothing: Ja’Kobe Walter could also replace UFA Bruce Brown, although neither has been healthy enough for that to make sense in anything other than theory. The Raptors came into the Detroit game taking 30.5 3-pointers per 100 possessions. That is last in the NBA. It is more than six attempts below the league median, and 20 below the league-leading Celtics, an admitted outlier. Meanwhile, Raptors opponents are averaging 36.7 attempts 100 possessions. The Raptors came into the Pistons game allowing the third-lowest 3-point accuracy, which means their opponents are due for some positive regression. Perhaps the Raptors have been a little unlucky shooting the ball, connecting on 33.6 percent of their 3s. We know there isn’t much shooting talent on this team, though, especially without Quickley. On average, the Raptors are allowing 12.8 made 3s per game and making 10.4. It seems like those numbers will only grow further apart. The Raptors need Quickley back, and they need some other guys to start shooting more, even if they might occasionally scan as bad shots. This math cannot hold. (To be clear, it is not currently holding. They are 4-14!) Against the Pistons, the Raptors were getting blown out until Barnes made three semi-contested looks that he easily could have turned down, especially with the Raptors struggling from deep. (He even took a heat check from extra deep). A tad more of that, please. SCOTTIE B WITH BACK-TO-BACK 3s‼️ pic.twitter.com/VXlbidC5J5 — Toronto Raptors (@Raptors) November 26, 2024  Jakob Poeltl finished two points shy of his seventh double-double in eight games against Detroit. The Raptors centre was mentioned as an also-ran for Eastern Conference player of the week on Monday, won by Giannis Antetokounmp. However, he didn’t look as spry in Cleveland or Detroit as he had previously. That could have just been a matter of comparison, as Cleveland’s Allen and Mobley and Detroit’s Jalen Duren are long and athletic. That is not Poeltl’s game. However, Poeltl has played 35 or more minutes seven times in 15 games this year. He crossed that threshold just four times in 50 outings last year. It is worth monitoring.

On Tuesday, English football’s governing body launched its 2024-2028 equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) strategy, which is targeted at all levels of football in the country. Advertisement This comes after Kick It Out, a leading UK anti-discrimination charity, said in July that it had received the highest number of reports of discrimination it has ever had in a season during the 2023-24 campaign. While outlining its new EDI strategy, the FA said: “Our commitment to creating a game free from discrimination is as strong as ever. We must embrace the unique diversity of our country and continue to use football as a force for good.” GO DEEPER Record high discrimination reports received in 23-24 season, says Kick It Out By 2028, the organisation wants 30 per cent of England’s coaching staff in the men’s game to be from a Black, Asian, mixed or ethnic background, an 11-point increase on the current percentage. The FA also wants 50 per cent of the women’s staff to be female and 50 per cent of all FA employees to be female by 2028, an eight-point increase on the current percentage of female employees. There are also aims to increase the amount of FA employees who are from disabled or LGBTQ+ backgrounds in both coaching staff in the men’s and women’s games as well as leadership roles and the FA Council (the 92 elected representatives from across English football — the council meets to decide the major policies of the FA). According to research conducted by Kick It Out, racism remains the most reported form of discrimination, with the charity seeing a 47 per cent rise in racist abuse across all levels of the game last season. Meanwhile, faith-based discriminatory reports were also up by 34 per cent, driven by a sharp increase in antisemitism (63 per cent) and Islamophobia (138 per cent). Although homophobic reports had fallen by 24 per cent, LGBTQ+ hate rose sharply online, with reports up from 43 to 65. Reports of transphobia online also increased by 183 per cent. The FA plans to launch a new anti-discrimination standard for grassroots football, an initiative that will address the under-reporting of discrimination in the game. The organisation launched the Enough is Enough campaign in November 2023, aimed at tackling hate across grassroots football, and in the new EDI strategy, they want to build on the campaign. Advertisement A new initiative named Flag It, will be introduced. This will aim to challenge the bystander effect and reinforce the need for action when an individual sees, hears, or senses inappropriate behaviour at games. The FA outlined plans to move to mandatory reporting of diversity numbers in the professional game and to grow the number of coaches and referees from historically underrepresented groups. There are also plans to run campaigns to tackle misogyny and empower women in football as well as tackle LGBTQ+ cultural challenges through education. “We want a football environment that is free from prejudice and abuse – whatever form it takes,” the FA added. “We believe the best way to tackle discrimination is by taking preventative action. “We will run multiple initiatives that will improve the way incidents are reported, applying the appropriate sanctions, supporting victims, and developing behaviour change campaigns to ensure we effectively deal with the root causes of discrimination.” (Top photo: Catherine Ivill – The FA/The FA via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

But firing a coach before the end of his second season is a sign of a need for immediate change for new athletic director Justin Moore, who arrived from Texas A&M in the summer. So how good is the Tulsa job? Who could get in the mix? Based on conversations with industry sources, here’s how the Tulsa job breaks down and who could get in the mix.  There is a strong history at Tulsa, but much of it is in the far past. The program has a winning record all-time and claims 35 conference championships, including six consecutive Missouri Valley titles in the 1980s, but the Golden Hurricane have just two championships since 1986 and one since 2012. More recently, the program reached 12 bowl games in 19 years from 2003 to ‘21, but it has won more than seven games just once in the last decade, and it has six losing seasons in the last eight years. Tulsa was 10th in the American in attendance last season and eighth this year. The roster needs help. It doesn’t have a top-15 rusher in the AAC. Quarterback play hasn’t been good, and talented receiver Kamdyn Benjamin is an outgoing senior. The defense is also led by seniors. Redshirt freshman quarterback Kirk Francis won the starting job out of camp but has been benched multiple times this season. Tulsa is 10th in the AAC in 247Sports’ Team Talent rankings based on high school recruiting, and its 2025 recruiting class currently ranks eighth in the league. Advertisement Resources have been an issue. Former head coach Philip Montgomery took a pay cut in 2018 to help the athletic department. There is no indoor practice field. Wilson’s salary wasn’t public as Tulsa is a private school, but it’s believed it was a bit south of $2 million, which would be middle-of-the-pack in the AAC but could be enough to draw a Power 4 coordinator. Moore, the new AD, has a vision to expand funding for the program, which is desperately needed. He wrote to fans on Sunday, “We need world-class facilities, expanded operational budgets, an increase in support staff, and, in today’s landscape, the ability to share revenue with our student-athletes and support them in NIL opportunities.” Tulsa is the smallest school in the Football Bowl Subdivision, with an enrollment of less than 4,000 students, though its freshman retention rate hit an all-time high this year. Moore comes from Texas A&M with a good track record as the chief operating officer, but he has work to do. A small private school make for a small alumni and donor base. It’s not a great sign when the athletic director has to publicly say football is and remains a priority. UNLV offensive coordinator Brennan Marion is a former Tulsa player who had two prolific seasons in 2007 and 2008, twice leading the nation in yards per catch. He has played an integral role in UNLV’s resurgence over the last two seasons, an 18-7 record with different starting quarterbacks in each season. Kansas State co-offensive coordinator Matt Wells grew up in Oklahoma and has head coaching experience at Utah State and Texas Tech. He nearly got the New Mexico job last cycle. He also coached as a Tulsa assistant from 2002 to ’06 and spent the last two years as an Oklahoma analyst. Wells went 44-34 at Utah State, including two 10-win seasons, but he was fired midway through his third season at Texas Tech, exiting with a 13-17 record. Advertisement Incarnate Word head coach Clint Killough is 18-4 with the Cardinals and has a top-five FCS team in San Antonio. The previous two UIW head coaches have had success at North Texas (Eric Morris) and Texas State (GJ Kinne). Could the trend continue? Killough is also just 31 years old. Former UAB head coach Bill Clark retired in summer 2022 due to back issues, but industry sources believe he’s ready to get back onto the sidelines. Clark went 49-26 at UAB with two conference championships, most of that success coming after the program was rebuilt from nothing after being shut down following his first season. But Clark doesn’t have ties to Texas or Oklahoma. USC offensive coordinator Josh Henson is an Oklahoma native and Oklahoma State graduate and former assistant. He previously coached at Texas A&M when Moore worked there. He has developed multiple offensive lines that were semifinalists for the Joe Moore Award since 2020. Miami offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson coached at Houston from 2019 to ’22, and he’s now directing one of the best offenses in the country. The Hurricanes lead the nation with 44.7 points per game, led by quarterback and Heisman Trophy candidate Cam Ward. Clemson offensive coordinator Garrett Riley is a West Texas native with plenty of ties in the state from his time at TCU and Texas Tech. This year’s Clemson offense ranks 11th nationally in scoring, up from 52nd a year ago. Riley already makes more than $2 million, so he would likely have to take a pay cut if he’s interested. Kansas State cornerbacks coach Van Malone coached at Tulsa from 2010 to ’11 and Oklahoma State after that. The Houston native has been at K-State since 2019 and has been in the mix for head coaching jobs in recent years. SMU defensive coordinator Scott Symons was a finalist for the Troy job last year. The Mustangs finished 11th nationally in scoring defense in 2023 and are 10-1 overall and set to play in the ACC Championship Game this year. Advertisement SMU offensive coordinator Casey Woods helps direct an offense that is fifth nationally in scoring this year. Woods has also coached at Missouri, UAB and Auburn. Texas State head coach GJ Kinne is another former Tulsa player and was in the mix for this job last time, but ultimately went to Texas State instead and is taking the Bobcats to their second consecutive bowl game. He just signed a new contract at Texas State, making a reunion here very unlikely. There’s still some tradition here, and the job can pay well. But resources elsewhere in the program have been hard to come by. If the new athletic director can improve the financial situation, there is some upside.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"NFL Week 12 best and worst coaching decisions: Dave Canales, Bryce Young progress",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5945885/2024/11/26/nfl-week-12-worst-best-coaching-decisions-nguyen/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 13:00:05 GMT","Also, Mike Zimmer's Cowboys defense bests Kliff Kingsbury's Commanders offense and Matt LaFleur has the Packers' run game humming.","Dave Canales’ tenure as the Carolina Panthers head coach had a shaky start but he’s starting to press the right buttons and quarterback Bryce Young suddenly looks promising again. Speaking of first-round quarterbacks, Jayden Daniels’ career got off to a sizzling start but his numbers, like the Commanders offense, are starting to regress. Advertisement Packers head coach Matt LaFleur bolstered his case for coach of the year with a creative game plan against the 49ers. More on all of this in Week 12’s best and worst coaching decisions. When a franchise benches its former first-round pick quarterback, it usually means the end for that player with their respective teams. When the Panthers benched Young, he was trending toward becoming an all-time bust. He didn’t look like he belonged in the league in his first 19 games. He was skittish in the pocket, inaccurate and was easily taken down. Still, benching the first overall pick after a little more than one season seemed premature. The Colts made a similar decision with No. 4 pick Anthony Richardson after just 10 starts. GO DEEPER Bryce Young's continued growth shows why Panthers should ride with him rest of the way Both quarterbacks look like different players since getting inserted back into the starting lineup. Richardson had the best game of his career against the Jets in Week 11 and played much better than his box score numbers indicated Sunday against the Lions. The Colts had big plays wiped away by dropped passes and penalties. Richardson also had to throw the ball away repeatedly to avoid sacks on quick pressures. Young had the best game of his career Sunday against Kansas City. The Chiefs’ defense has dropped off since last year but it’s still a very good unit and coordinator Steve Spagnuolo’s scheme is as tough to figure out as any other coordinator’s. Canales called a great game with well-designed plays but most importantly, Young looked prepared for the blitz. 12:43 remaining in the first quarter, third-and-2  On the Panthers’ first drive, Young put running back Chuba Hubbard in a yo-yo motion in which he went outside before returning into the backfield. The purpose was to undress the defense and serve as a changeup. Backs usually don’t come back into the protection after motioning outside. Pressure teams like the Chiefs also have blitz checks when offenses go empty (no blockers in the backfield). No linebackers followed Hubbard outside, so Young knew a linebacker blitz was coming.  Both linebackers blitzed but both defensive ends dropped. Young knew he had numbers in protection and didn’t panic or throw hot. He waited for the dig route to develop.  He threw a perfectly layered ball over the underneath coverage to convert on third down. Young made several impressive throws and nearly brought the Panthers back from a 20-9 deficit. Down eight with 6:54 remaining in the game, Young led the Panthers on a touchdown drive and Hubbard capped off the drive with the two-point conversion to tie. Unfortunately, they left too much time for Patrick Mahomes, who effortlessly got the Chiefs in position to kick the game-winning field goal. Advertisement I don’t know who had the final say on sitting Young and Richardson, so these aren’t purely coaching decisions, but the results are the results. Both quarterbacks are playing well. Maybe in the future, we’ll think it’s OK to let young quarterbacks take a breather if they’re struggling. The Cowboys pulled off one of the biggest upsets of the season, beating the Commanders 34-26. The Cowboys were outscored by a combined 52 points in the first two games without quarterback Dak Prescott. They were 10.5-point underdogs against the Commanders. They barely had a pulse with Cooper Rush behind center. Commanders coordinator Kliff Kingsbury’s offense was already showing signs of regression. His offenses as head coach of the Cardinals had a trend of regressing in the second half of the season. Last week, he was on the wrong side of this column for his unwillingness to move star receiver Terry McLaurin around to get him better matchups. He’s back this week for a lackluster game plan against a bad Cowboys defense despite consistently getting excellent field position. GO DEEPER The Commanders split apart on the field Sunday, continuing an ill-timed reversal of fortune Don’t get fooled by the final score, Washington’s offense struggled mightily. Coming into the game, the Cowboys were giving up 2.55 points per drive (third worst in the league). The Commanders only scored nine points in the first three quarters. They had a nice drive in the fourth quarter followed by a crazy 86-yard touchdown pass to McLaurin with 33 seconds left in the game to make things interesting, but they were not ready for Cowboys defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer’s blitzes in the run game or pass game. Daniels had the worst game of his career against the blitz, averaging minus-0.88 expected points added (EPA) per dropback and only averaging 3.9 yards per attempt against the blitz. 14:20 remaining in the third quarter, first-and-10  The Commanders typically like to run their zone read away from the wing (tight end lined up off the ball) so that if Daniels keeps the ball, he would have blockers releasing outside for him.  Knowing this, Zimmer slanted the defensive line toward the wing side. This occupied the left tackle, which meant no one would block linebacker DeMarvion Overshown. Defensive end Chauncey Golston got upfield, which caused Daniels to hand the ball off to Austin Ekeler.  The slant caused Ekeler to cut right into Overshown and Golston. The Commanders’ offense has reached a point where it’s too predictable. The Cowboys looked like they were a step ahead on every play. Dallas was in cover 3 or cover 1 for most of the game and Daniels threw curl routes and hitches against it repeatedly. They got more creative with their passing combinations in the fourth quarter but it was too little, too late. When asked about the trend of his offenses regressing during the week, Kingsbury was dismissive and said he wouldn’t change his offense. After this week, it might be time for change. GO DEEPER Wild final 5 minutes: How the Cowboys hung on to beat Commanders An example of a creative run game that does an excellent job of eliminating tendencies is the Packers’. They gashed the 49ers’ run defense and did it one paper cut at a time. The Packers ran for 169 yards while only averaging four yards per carry. Green Bay was in shotgun on 68 percent of snaps and it is hard running out of shotgun without using the QB option game, but LaFleur drew up wing-T-esque backfield actions that confused the 49ers’ run fits. 14:53 remaining in the first quarter, second-and-10  On this play, the Packers were running a “simple” split zone play to the left with the tight end blocking the backside defensive end. The first bit of window dressing was to have the tight end motion to the left before going back to the right to execute a “sift” block.  After the snap, quarterback Jordan Love spun around, turned his back to the defense and faked the ball to receiver Jayden Reed on a sweep. The fake caused linebacker Fred Warner and nickel Deommodore Lenoir to bite outside.  Love then completed his spin and handed the ball to Josh Jacobs, who had a huge crease down the middle of the defense to run through. With a simple fake, the Packers affected two defenders and froze the rest of the 49ers’ front. 13:57 remaining in the first quarter, second-and-7  On this play, the Packers had their pony personnel (two running backs) on the field. Before the snap, Jacobs motioned like he was going to run to the perimeter.  After the snap, Jacobs cut back toward the right to get the ball. The Packers were running a simple counter scheme with a guard pulling to kick out the edge and a skill player leading the way. Running back Emanuel Wilson would be the lead blocker. Jacobs’ motion froze Lenoir on the back side of the play.  Lenoir’s false step gave receiver Romeo Doubs time to block him. Again, the Packers perfectly executed their blocks and gave Jacobs a huge lane to run through. When I wrote about the wing-T offense’s influence on the NFL, I spoke to Dan Casey, who consults for NFL teams. “Defenses have gotten really good at fitting this, the basic version of run plays,” Casey said. “So you do have to change the math or change the fit somehow. The nice thing about these wing-T concepts is there’s not a paradigm for defenses fitting it. It’s not like they’re seeing it every day in practice.” GO DEEPER Packers' free-agent tandem of Josh Jacobs, Xavier McKinney fuels blowout of 49ers The idea is to run regular plays but change how you present them. LaFleur is doing a masterful job of integrating those concepts in the Packers offense. Defenders must think twice before reacting, which doesn’t allow them to play fast. We’ll see these concepts all around the NFL as we get into the playoffs. Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,General Motors enters the grid: Why F1 changed its tune after rejecting Andretti,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5948455/2024/11/26/general-motors-f1-formula-one-grid-expansion-andretti/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 12:57:01 GMT","The difference between now and F1's January rejection of Andretti is that with General Motors, it has exactly what it wanted all along.","Formula 1 As recently as a couple of months ago, the idea of Formula One expanding beyond its existing 10-team, 20-car grid anytime soon seemed fanciful. F1 had made clear in January when it rejected Andretti Global’s proposal to set up a new team that would race starting in 2026 that it needed convincing that expansion was the right thing to do. Advertisement The sport has surged in popularity since Liberty Media completed its acquisition in 2017 — also the last time there were 11 teams, with Manor folding after the 2016 season — and resulted in a boom in revenues. The potential of anything upsetting that, or failing to bring more value, was often cited as a reason to say no to Andretti. But now that has changed. F1 announced on Monday that it had reached an “agreement in principle” for General Motors to establish its own team beginning in 2026 after the American automotive giant took over the reins of Andretti’s F1 plans. All being well, Cadillac will join the grid as an 11th team, expanding the field to 22 cars and drivers. Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox.
 Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox. That expansion could flare many of the concerns that were raised through the rejection of Andretti. An 11th team will still result in a dilution of the prize money that some of the existing teams feared could lead to instability. It was a misgiving that was labeled by Michael Andretti, who previously oversaw the entry project, as “greed,” while the Department of Justice’s anti-trust division moved to investigate Liberty over the rejection. General Motors’ plan to enter F1 gathered significant steam in only a couple of months due to some key differences, paving the way for the expansion so many fans have been crying out for. The first thing to note is that F1 was always receptive to the idea of General Motors entering the sport. The more road car manufacturers on the grid, the better. For 2026, it already has Ferrari, Mercedes, Honda, Audi and Ford (through Red Bull) signed up, while Renault has involvement as the owner of Alpine, even if the team will switch to Mercedes engines. Particularly in an era where the United States is F1’s biggest target market for growth, having both General Motors and Ford on the grid would be a huge coup. Advertisement F1 said when rejecting Andretti in January that it “would look differently on an application for the entry of a team into the 2028 championship with a GM power unit, either as a GM works team or as a GM customer team designing all allowable components in-house.” In short, instead of having an Andretti team that works with General Motors, a fully-fledged General Motors team would give F1 the value it wanted from any new applicant. Andretti always positioned itself as planning to be a works operation, leaning on the fact it would be an all-American team and emphasizing the partnership with General Motors as being far more than a sponsorship agreement. But it had to make that more explicit and lean heavier on that involvement. It’s something that became clear to those overseeing Andretti’s F1 bid, particularly Dan Towriss, who is a shareholder in the company and has led the efforts in recent months to get General Motors through the door. Towriss took over the reins of Andretti Global at the end of September after Michael Andretti stepped down as CEO and chairman, moving away from an operational role. The understanding from Towriss and Co. that General Motors, not Andretti, had to be at the heart of the bid helped accelerate talks with F1 and bred a more conciliatory approach. Instead of comments being made in the media or frustrations getting aired publicly, everything moved along quickly behind closed doors. Little got out about just how close General Motors was to joining the grid until the Las Vegas Grand Prix weekend, when the story emerged on Friday. A General Motors team could offer F1 what it wanted to expand the grid: value. Andretti itself was unable to do that in quite the same way, no matter how close its ties to General Motors would have been. Even with General Motors joining the grid and not Andretti, some of the concerns rival team principals have raised in the past remain valid, relating directly to the number of teams on the grid. There is the dilution debate and the inevitable reduction in prize money, with F1’s total payout to teams being cut 11 ways instead of 10. Advertisement To make up for this, any new entrant is required to pay a fee split between the current teams. The most recent Concorde Agreement — the commercial terms between F1, the FIA (F1’s regulator) and the teams — was signed in 2020 and set this at $200 million. Still, there have been talks to at least triple this figure by 2026, when the next Concorde Agreement will begin, reflecting the swell in F1 team values over the past five years. Mohammed Ben Sulayem, the FIA president, has always believed the teams’ aversion to expanding the grid related to their financial motives, and not other arguments such as having enough room in the pit lane. Ben Sulayem, who has long supported expanding the grid and encouraged General Motors to build its own F1 engine, noted last year that the regulations permitted up to 12 teams, and that an unofficial 11th already existed: APXGP, the fictional team from next year’s F1 movie starring Brad Pitt, has a full garage setup at some F1 weekends. In recognition of the value General Motors will bring to F1, teams also now appear to be receptive to the idea. In Las Vegas, Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff, Ferrari F1 chief Fred Vasseur and McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown all made positive noises about expanding the grid for another manufacturer. The trio had previously highlighted the issues surrounding expansion, with Wolff suggesting in July of last year that it could be a “safety concern” to have another team. The teams, though, did not have an official say. The approval process relied on two parties alone: the FIA and F1. The FIA was required to give its blessing from a technical and sporting point of view, which it did to Andretti last October, before F1 then ruled on the commercial merits of the bid. So long as F1 said yes, what the teams thought did not really matter. It means that even if there is lingering concern from other teams about expanding the grid for General Motors, F1 makes the only call that counts. F1 will have been convinced that expanding for General Motors is in the sport’s best interests. Not only is it going to bring another major American manufacturer to the grid, serving as a coup that speaks to F1’s global relevance, but it could also bring huge commercial benefits — something Towriss was eager to highlight to The Athletic during a visit to Andretti’s UK F1 base back in April when, despite being rejected, it continued to lay the foundations for an F1 entry. “Sponsors want to see the relevance, they want to see the connection with the U.S. fans,” Towriss said. “So there really is a desire for a U.S. team, even if the sponsor is sponsoring a UK team or something like that, it’s more relevant when there are U.S. fans because there’s a U.S. team, there’s a knock-on effect that will happen there. “We’re hearing it from those corporate partners, and so we’re convinced of it. Again, we’re going to add value to everybody on the series when we come in.” Advertisement F1 will hope expanding the grid creates commercial value — and also opportunities. With another team, there will be two extra spots on the grid for drivers — and their associated sponsors — to join the field. Given the huge amount of talent currently on the sidelines or knocking on F1’s door to get a seat — Franco Colapinto being one talent who could well be on the sidelines next year — having two more berths will relieve a little bit of pressure in the driver market, and create an exciting new opportunity for any interested drivers. The overwhelmingly positive reaction from fans to the news the grid will expand in 2026 is giving early justification to F1’s decision. But it hasn’t changed tune on expansion. From the very start, it was always receptive to an 11th team, so long as the terms were right. The difference between now and its January rejection of Andretti is that with General Motors, it has exactly what it wanted all along.

The chants were loud and noticeable. You could hear everything from “OG Anunoby!” to “Deuce,” every time reserve guard Miles McBride splashed home another 3-pointer. Advertisement It wasn’t so much that the Nuggets fell 145-118 to New York, or that the Nuggets were never really in this one. It was the lack of effort that drew steam out of Denver head coach Michael Malone. It was the lack of energy. It was the lack of fight when the Knicks forged their first run of the night. It was a lack of passion coming out in the third quarter. A little less than 48 hours after their best performance of the season in beating the Los Angeles Lakers, the Nuggets did a 180 on Monday night. They didn’t show up, and they allowed a hungry and aggressive Knicks team to run them out of their own gym. “F— that, I’m not flushing,” Malone angrily said when asked how he would deal with the loss. “You don’t flush when you get embarrassed. You don’t flush when you don’t play hard or play with any physicality. Tonight, we got embarrassed. We’re 16 games in and we’re talking about effort. We have to ask ourselves this question: Who do we want to be as a team? “Playing like you actually care would be great.” This wasn’t so much about Monday night’s loss for Malone. Indeed, this is a culmination of events built over time. The preseason saw four losses in five games. Denver’s regular season opened with home defeats to the Oklahoma City Thunder and Los Angeles Clippers. When Nikola Jokić missed time because of the birth of his second child, there was a road loss to a New Orleans Pelicans team missing almost all of their key rotation players. That was followed by a loss to the Memphis Grizzlies, where the Nuggets looked slow, sluggish and hapless offensively. And yet, there have been moments of brilliance. A home win over the Thunder. Saturday night’s whooping of the Lakers. Following that 0-2 start by winning seven of eight games. The peaks have been there. But the valleys have been low. Dismantling the Lakers on the road looked like the Nuggets were finally beginning to turn a corner, even with that coming on the heels of a home loss to the Dallas Mavericks. Advertisement That’s what has been so frustrating to Malone and the Nuggets in general. An 82-game season is naturally going to feature some pockets where a team isn’t playing great basketball. That is the nature of an NBA schedule being so demanding. Sometimes, what happens on the floor has very little to do with what’s happening on the floor. An NBA coach knows this, and knows there are some things out of his control. But Monday night for Malone was a tipping point. When the Knicks forged a lead, the Nuggets folded. When the Knicks played physical, the Nuggets didn’t match the physicality. “Russell Westbrook played with a ton of effort, and he’s 36 years old,” Malone said. “But I need Nikola Jokić. I need the guys who have been here in the starting lineup to be vocal.” What Malone doesn’t want is for Monday night or last Sunday night in Memphis to be the norm. He doesn’t want inconsistency to be the norm. And through 16 games, what have the Nuggets been? They have been a team with their typical beautiful offense that hasn’t defended particularly well. In 2023, when they won an NBA title, they were arguably the best offensive and defensive team in the league. The story of the greatest players in NBA history. In 100 riveting profiles, top basketball writers justify their selections and uncover the history of the NBA in the process. The story of the greatest plays in NBA history. So far, they’re 17th in the league with a 114 defensive rating. That number isn’t going to be good enough to win another title. Malone knows that. His players know that. These Denver Nuggets are quite capable of scoring. But can they stop anyone? Saturday night’s 127-102 win over the Lakers was one of Denver’s best efforts of the season on both ends of the floor. To go from being that complete a team on one night to being that discombobulated provided a major contrast. That explains why Malone was so heated on Monday night. The Nuggets are 9-7. They are currently in the eighth spot in the Western Conference. Malone doesn’t want this to be who the Nuggets are. And once you get to that 25- or 30-game mark, teams start to settle into what they are going to be. Is it impossible to change stripes once you establish them? Of course not. But changing those stripes takes a ton of work. Advertisement “It is energy,” guard Jamal Murray said. “It is effort. It is discipline. It’s how much you want it and how much you care. And we didn’t have any of that tonight.” Denver’s defense was horrid against the Knicks. The Nuggets allowed New York to shoot 60 percent from the field. The Knicks made 19 of their 36 3-pointers. Anunoby established a career-high with 40 points. The Nuggets didn’t defend at the point of attack. They didn’t defend the rim. They allowed New York point guard Jalen Brunson to get anywhere he wanted off the dribble, and once he did, Denver’s defense usually broke down. But Monday night wasn’t schematic. If the Nuggets are to get to where they want to go, Malone is correct. They have to show more fight and more resilience. They have to be more willing to get in the proverbial mud with teams, and they have to play with more energy. This isn’t always going to be the case, but it needs to be the case more often than not. At this point, the Nuggets are setting the wrong trend, and Malone and Jokić want to put a stop to it right away. “We did not show up tonight,” Jokić said. “I think it’s important to learn from games like this, because other teams are going to look at what they did to us. I think we can learn. But it’s always good to get punched in the face so that we can wake up.” (Photo of Nikola Jokić and Karl-Anthony Towns: Justin Tafoya / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Best day in Maui Invitational history? Comebacks, fireworks and college basketball at its peak",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5949083/2024/11/26/maui-invitational-history-scores-bracket-unc/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 12:46:22 GMT","Only Maui magic explains how a 2,400-seat high school gymnasium seems to always, somehow, spur spectacular basketball games.","NCAAM LAHAINA, Hawaii — Where to begin? Perhaps at the end: at 9:38 p.m. local time, with the Hawaiian sky already a blanket of blackness, save for a few specks of starlight. The 12-hour time warp — four college basketball games, one after another after another — had finally finished. As palm trees bobbed in the breeze, Polynesian Adventure bus No. 261 revved its engine in the loading lane behind the Lahaina Civic Center, awaiting its final passenger. A second later, Dayton coach Anthony Grant descended the stairs from the second-story gymnasium and emerged from the shadows. Then he climbed the few steps onto the bus, before sinking into the front row seat diagonal from the driver. Advertisement What a night. What a day. What a sport. For the last 40 years, the Maui Invitational has become a college basketball mainstay, easily the most celebrated of the early season’s ample slate of neutral-site events. Why? The Maui magic — and no, that’s not referring to the beautiful black sand beaches, or the stunning sunsets framed between volcanoes. Maui magic explains how a 2,400-seat high school gymnasium seems to always, somehow, spur spectacular basketball games. And although there are too many of those to count, the fine folks in Hawaii have at least tried to commemorate many of the classics, with framed black photos that hang in the gym’s dual staircases. Some of the biggest names in the history of the sport adorn those walls: Kemba Walker, Adam Morrison, Bobby Hurley. But after Monday, they’re going to need to make more room. In many ways, it’s fitting that the 40th anniversary of the Maui Invitational opened with arguably the best singular day of games in the event’s history, quite possibly one of the best non-March days men’s college basketball has seen in some time. How good was it? Two top-five teams (No. 2 UConn and No. 5 Iowa State) lost by a single basket. Two other ranked squads (No. 4 Auburn and No. 12 North Carolina) completed second-half comebacks of at least 18 points. (UNC went the extra mile in falling behind 21 against Dayton; it marks the Tar Heels’ largest comeback since 1993, or one year after current UNC coach Hubert Davis last played in college.) Not enough? How about two buzzer beaters, the end of the nation’s longest winning streak and UConn coach Dan Hurley calling the officials a “f—ing joke” on national TV? Again, all in the span of 12 hours, inside the same tiny building in the middle of the Pacific. No other sport is capable of the same high-stakes drama that college hoops is, especially not packed into one locale. The shift from annoyingly awful basketball to the highest level of hoops, sometimes in the course of a single possession, can induce whiplash. But that’s what makes it fun. That’s how you end up with a magical Monday in Maui. Advertisement Memphis and UConn, two former American Athletic Conference rivals, kicked things off at 9:30 a.m. local. Memphis entered as the nation’s third-best 3-point shooting team, while UConn had a top-five offense in its own right. So, fireworks. Points. Plenty of ’em. When Memphis guard Tyrese Hunter sank his career-high-tying seventh 3-pointer with about eight minutes left, it put the Tigers up 10 and the two-time defending national champions on upset watch. With four minutes left, Memphis’ lead had grown to 13; interesting, but not earth-shattering. That part came next — when UConn closed regulation on an 18-5 run, capped by a game-tying Solo Ball 3-pointer with 1.2 seconds left. Naturally, Ball had only made one shot all game before he went onions. Maybe we should’ve known then what the rest of the day had in store. In overtime, hoops gave way to theater. Offsetting technical fouls halfway through — after UConn’s Samson Johnson shoved Memphis center Moussa Cisse to the ground, leading Cisse’s teammate Dain Dainja to shove back — swung the scale from chippy to confrontational. Then Hurley kicked the whole thing into hyperdrive, melting (and falling) down on the sideline after one of his players was called for an entirely standard over-the-back foul. Then came the obscenity, the (overdue) technical foul and seven consecutive Memphis free throws to ice the upset. By noon, the food trucks outside the Civic Center could’ve made a killing selling cigarettes: to fans, team officials, coaches and sportswriters alike. “When we first got picked to play them,” Memphis coach Penny Hardaway said after his team’s 99-97 overtime win, “I was like, OK. Starting off with a bang.” To lower everyone’s blood pressure back down, Colorado and Michigan State — the Spartans missed their first 14 3s yet somehow saw their national 3-point percentage ranking rise — took the court for 40 minutes. A 16-point snoozer. Aaaaand moving on. Because then came the nonsensically good night session, starting with the first opening-round matchup of top-five teams in Maui Invitational history: No. 4 Auburn vs. No. 5 Iowa State. For the first 20 minutes, the Cyclones pressed the Tigers through a pasta maker, their chew-glass defense creating a 16-point halftime cushion. If Bruce Pearl’s Tigers hadn’t rattled off a late 10-2 run before the break, the deficit easily could’ve been 20 or more. Advertisement But then the Tigers and Cyclones went full Freaky Friday, body-swapping in style and substance. Suddenly, Auburn couldn’t miss, while Iowa State couldn’t hit the Pacific from a sailboat, missing nine of its first 10 shots in the second half. The Tigers didn’t take their first lead of the game until four minutes remained, at which point Iowa State woke up, and the two punched each other in the face until the final buzzer. The Cyclones actually led with under a minute to play and had the ball again with the game tied and 30 seconds left, only for Auburn’s best player — All-America center Johni Broome, who finished with 21 points and 10 rebounds — to force a steal with 10 seconds left and tip in a missed layup at the other end to deliver the Tigers an 83-81 win. Voila: Auburn’s second top-five win in the span of three weeks, and a second top-five squad headed to the loser’s bracket. “That there is as good a win as we’re gonna see,” Pearl said postgame, “and as good a game.” Ha. If only he knew what came next. Now, reasonably, at that point, nothing Dayton and UNC could do could match what the day had already seen. But as the College Football Playoff committee seems to be learning in real time, that’s why you play the games. Except, North Carolina only seemed to play half the game: the second half. It fell behind by 18 at intermission, in most frustrating fashion for Tar Heel fans: The team with the fewest turnovers in the country entering Monday coughed it up 12 times in the first 20 minutes, leading to 19 Dayton points. The deficit got as deep as 21 points early in the second half before Davis told it to his team straight-up. “I told them they’re not making comeback plays,” Davis explained after. “You’re just not … If you would change that, this game would flip.” Spark lit. Before long, 21 became 16. Eleven. Eight. Five. Back up to seven. Down to four. Then two. Eventually, after UNC had taken as many punches as possible, its head came back above sea level courtesy of RJ Davis’ stepback 3-pointer with under two minutes to play. Another All-American doing All-American things. Advertisement Dayton immediately hit back with another 3, and we’d seen this script before. It wasn’t until UNC freshman wing Drake Powell hit a corner trey — his second of the night, after having only made one 3 in the team’s first four games — that the Tar Heels took the lead for good. As UNC’s players bounded into their postgame press conference, they straddled the line between celebratory and sleepy. Wanting to enjoy the win but knowing a date with a top-five opponent awaits in under 24 hours. But with the day’s full slate behind them, they could — unlike Memphis, Michigan State and Auburn’s victorious players — put the entire scene into some perspective. “It was electric,” said UNC guard Seth Trimble, who scored a career-high 27 points and who quite possibly will be this event’s breakout star. “To do it in this type of atmosphere, how loud it was, it was super fun.” Simple, but so, so true. Grant, whose team choked away a top-15 win, played the unenviable role of closer. “We can’t really relive,” he said, hurrying out the door, “what happened tonight.” Maybe he can’t. But the rest of us can — and we should. It’s impossible to say that this was definitively, absolutely, 100 percent, no doubt the best day in Maui Invitational history. Too many memories. Too many good games. Too many generations of highlights to splice, even if almost all of them transpired on this tiny piece of paradise. But Monday was in the conversation. If you want to say it’s atop the imaginary list, you’ll find no argument here. Most years, we are lucky to get one, maybe two, true thrillers in this event. But three in one day? At the risk of sounding greedy, are we due more in the semifinals? Another championship classic on Wednesday, worthy of hanging in the Civic Center halls? It seems so. But Monday’s magic was enough to sustain us regardless, and a perfect reminder of what makes this sport so special in the larger athletics landscape. Advertisement Back outside the Civic Center, bus No. 261 was finally fully loaded. The parking brake released, and off it went, up a hill and into the distance, destined to return Tuesday. It was fully quiet now — until a parking lot attendant started clapping his hands, piercing the ocean’s crash in the distance. Pulling his keys from his pocket, he started walking the path the bus just drove, up and away from the Civic Center, the day fully behind him. But before he disappeared into the darkness, he slapped a fellow volunteer on the back and loudly proclaimed what the entire college basketball community thought as its head hit the pillow: “See you tomorrow.” (Photo: Darryl Oumi / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The club’s new INEOS-led hierarchy under minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe cut 250 jobs earlier this year in an attempt to slash costs at Old Trafford. Advertisement Despite paying off staff let go as part of a redundancy scheme, United posted a first-quarter profit of £1.3m — compared to a £32.8m loss during the same period last year. United’s latest figures do not include the compensation fee paid to Erik ten Hag following his dismissal as manager last month, of around £15m, or the €11m (£9.2m, $11.6m) fee paid to Sporting CP to appoint Ruben Amorim as his replacement. The figure follows a total of £47.8m paid out in exceptional costs during the 2023-24 campaign, related to the strategic review process which led to Ratcliffe’s purchase of a minority stake. GO DEEPER Explained: Manchester United's plan to cut 250 jobs The Old Trafford club posted a net loss of £113m in their 2023-24 accounts but insisted that they remained compliant with financial regulations, including the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules (PSR). United have posted five consecutive full-year losses since last achieving profitability during the 2018-19 season. In the latest figures, United’s total revenues fell to £143.1m — an 8.9 per cent drop compared to the same period last season — but the club reiterated its expectation of revenues between £650m and £670m for the 2024-25 season. Omar Berrada, United’s chief executive, said that the club’s cost-cutting and restructuring measures remain “on track”. “The season is now well underway for both our men’s and women’s team, and we are keen to ensure both are as competitive as possible,” he said. “We are delighted to have appointed Ruben Amorim as head coach of our men’s team and remain committed to returning Manchester United to the top of domestic and European football. “Our renovation of the Carrington Training Centre is progressing well, while the Old Trafford Regeneration Task Force continues its work. “Once it has delivered its recommendations, we will then take some time to digest them and evaluate all our options in the upcoming year.” Debt has been a thorny issue at United ever since the Glazer family’s £790m leveraged buy-out in 2005. These latest figures also reveal United borrowed £200m over the summer through their revolving credit facility — which can be thought of like a credit card. That is despite paying off £120m’s worth of this short-term debt in March, shortly after receiving the first tranche of the $300m that Ratcliffe promised in investment as part of his minority stake. Advertisement Another drawdown was necessary, however, to help replenish their cash reserves and fund spending in the transfer market. United had just £73.5m worth of cash in the bank at the end of June. That figure is now up to £149.6m. The drawdown will also have helped finance the signings of Leny Yoro, Manuel Ugarte, Matthijs de Ligt, Joshua Zirkzee and Noussair Mazraoui, which contributed to a transfer spend of £153.7m, offset by £35.6m in player sales. United’s longer-term debt is denominated in dollars — $650m, to be precise — so its value in pound sterling fluctuates depending on changes in the exchange rate. And despite the £200m drawdown, United’s total debt currently stands at £714m — around £20m less than the same period last year, due to favourable exchange rate fluctuations.

Sign up to receive it directly to your inbox. Hello. Sudan has been ravaged by war and yet, remarkably, its national team is breaking new ground. On the way: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine gave the world an understanding of how military conflicts displace football. Ukraine qualified for Euro 2024 via a home play-off staged in Poland because no stadium within their own borders could have safely hosted the tie. A similar scenario is playing out in Sudan without the same weight of global attention. It is not an exaggeration to say the ongoing fighting there is an invisible war, to all except those who find it at their front door. The eyes of the globe are on Ukraine, as well as the conflict involving Israel. Less heed is paid to Sudan — or what the United Nations calls “the worst humanitarian crisis on earth”. Advertisement War in the African nation has been raging since April of last year, with an estimated 150,000 people killed and 14 million forced to flee their homes. Under these circumstances, football would expect to take a back seat or grind to a halt, but incredibly, Sudan’s players have picked this moment to strive for history. Somehow, the national team is in the rudest of health. Next year, they will appear at the Africa Cup of Nations after making the tournament for only the 10th time in the best part of a century. They are on course for the 2026 World Cup, a competition Sudan have never reached before. War might be ravaging the country, but Sudanese football has not given up. It was precisely because so little coverage is given to the trouble in Sudan that The Athletic’s Adam Leventhal travelled there and to the surrounding parts of north-east Africa to write about the catastrophe. The quotes of the people he encountered are sobering. Mazin Abusin, the head of development at Sudan’s Football Association, remembers the first sound of gunshots in the capital, Khartoum, 15 months ago. “We used to say: if you’re lucky, you walk out with your passport, your phone and your life,” Abusin told Adam. He saw bodies in the street and dogs eating them. Football pitches in Khartoum have been commandeered as graveyards. There is no feasible way Sudan’s FIFA-sanctioned matches could take place in their homeland. Fixtures have been staged in South Sudan (a separate country), Saudi Arabia and, most recently, Libya. There are shades of Ukraine decamping to other European cities to keep the sport in motion. “Sudan is the motherland,” said captain Ramadan Agab. “Trying to make the nation happy is an emotion I cannot express.” He and his team-mates are doing what they can to make Sudan smile. Sudan’s squad will not ring many bells. None of the current crop of internationals play club football in Europe and their qualification for the 2026 World Cup is far from assured — but the chance of it happening is real. Sudan are top of their qualifying group and unbeaten after four games. A huge meeting with second-placed Senegal looms in March. Countries reach World Cups by various means — as hosts, without breaking sweat, by the skin of their teeth — and Sudan’s path to 2026 would be like very few others. There is much that matters more than football, but football has a way of surviving most things. 🎙️ Adam produced a podcast to go with his Sudan article, which you can download free of charge here. It’s an outstanding piece of audio work.  Strip out the smoke and mirrors around Mohamed Salah and the only logical conclusion is that his contract impasse with Liverpool is an age thing. Were Salah 22 rather than 32, or even 28, the club would be busting their gut to drown him in banknotes. That’s not to say Liverpool don’t have a wage structure or that money is no object at Anfield, but it’s hard not to think they are worried about spending big on Salah, only to find he goes over the hill and handicaps them by becoming a diminished high earner. It happens, it’s a judgement call and Salah isn’t getting younger. Advertisement But Andy Jones and Mark Carey have tried to look at this objectively, which I think is important. The multitude of graphs in their piece paint Salah as the attacking monster he is, but I was struck by the data (above) showing that his minutes per Premier League game for Liverpool are at their highest level to date this season — the polar opposite of a body creaking with age. Combine that with 10 goals and six assists and Liverpool face a quandary. Because while choosing not to renew Salah’s deal might have theoretical justification, explaining the decision would be fraught with difficulty. It’s that old issue in football: optics. 🎙️ Salah’s future is the subject of The Athletic FC podcast. Suffice to say, ‘sign him up’ was the prevailing view. I watched Aaron Hickey at Heart of Midlothian and I remember being slightly baffled when the club announced he was leaving to join… Bologna. No slight on Hickey (he’s a talented full-back) and no slight on Bologna (they’re on the rise in Serie A), Scotland to Italy just wasn’t a well-trodden transfer path. That’s partly because Scottish football has the same reputation as the Scottish diet: dreadful, unless you’re a native like me and you love it for what it is. But here’s the thing: Italian clubs have spotted an opportunity beyond Hadrian’s Wall because the market in Scotland (like deep-fried pizza) is nice and cheap. Hickey cost Bologna around £1.5m ($1.9m) in 2020. Two years later, Brentford bought him for a club-record £17m ($21m), making Bologna a tidy profit. Liam Henderson, once of Celtic, is now at Empoli. Josh Doig left Hibernian for Hellas Verona and then Sassuolo, and Lewis Ferguson followed Hickey to Bologna from Aberdeen. It’s officially a trend. Until recently, Italian clubs didn’t think to scout in Scotland. The country’s reputation for, er, technical limitations went before it. Speaking to The Athletic, Henderson recalled an air of surprise when he first arrived in Italy and showed people he could play. “They were expecting this Scottish boy to come and smash folk,” he said. It turned out they were missing a trick.

I was poised to roll my eyes, but on reflection, let’s go with it.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Doc Rivers' rotations, Andre Jackson Jr.'s pressure and more: What we're seeing with the Bucks",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5944268/2024/11/26/milwaukee-bucks-doc-rivers-andre-jackson/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 12:30:50 GMT","After a 2-8 start to the season, the Bucks are in a much better place than they were two weeks ago.","NBA Two weeks ago, everyone around the NBA, including us at The Athletic, wondered what went wrong for the Milwaukee Bucks through 10 games and what they might be able to do to fix things. They were 2-8 on Nov. 11, and since that low point, the Bucks have won six of seven games. And if you asked, coach Doc Rivers would argue the Bucks have actually won all seven, considering the pool report and Last Two-Minute report that came out following Milwaukee’s loss on Nov. 16 in Charlotte. Advertisement Disappointment over that missed call aside, things are looking up in Milwaukee, and Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo, the reigning Eastern Conference Player of the Week, has no interest in returning to where his team started the 2024-25 season. “I feel like going through the season, it was sloppy in the beginning,” Antetokounmpo said after the Bucks’ 125-119 win over the Hornets on Saturday night. “I don’t know if our confidence, for everybody, was high. We were losing games. … I think now, as a team, we figured things out. “We don’t want to feel what we felt three, four weeks ago. I don’t think anybody in this locker room wants to go back there. It was miserable for everybody. We were coming in here and working, practicing for three hours, four hours, trying to figure things out, what was going bad. But right now, we are clicking, and we just got to stay here. That doesn’t mean we’re going to win every game, but we’ve got to stay here. We’ve got to stay here as a team, keep competing.” When the Bucks were struggling at the start of this season, Antetokounmpo repeatedly expressed frustration over his team’s willingness to compete nightly. Antetokounmpo has regularly complimented his team’s selflessness and defensive effort as they’ve started to win. If the Bucks are going to stay in this place, as Antetokounmpo would like, they will need to continue competing selflessly every night. To find some examples of selfless competition, let’s play some ones. It took a couple possessions for the Bucks to score their first points Friday against the Indiana Pacers, but as soon as they did, Andre Jackson Jr. was ready. His primary responsibility for the night was making life difficult for Pacers point guard Tyrese Haliburton, and Jackson was going to do everything in his power to make sure Haliburton felt his presence from the start. As soon as Damian Lillard’s floater splashed through the net to open scoring, Jackson tracked down Haliburton and forced him to catch the ball as far away from the rim as possible. That’s what it was like for Haliburton every second he was on the floor with Jackson. To keep the Pacers from initiating their early offense with Haliburton running the show, Jackson did all he could to keep the ball out of Haliburton’s hands and force someone else to start possessions. “Dre was hounding him, picking him up full court, denying him sometimes,” Lillard said. “Once the ball got across half court, he was in his space. A player like that, you want to take away any comfort and any space. Any All-Star-level players, you give them space, they’re going to pick you apart, they’re going to dominate the game. Advertisement “You look at Dre’s stat line, and he didn’t even score a point, but he was plus-18. … I thought Dre just did a great job. It’s what we need from him. It’s what his job is on our team, and I think he definitely had an impact.” Hornets guard LaMelo Ball went through the same thing for the first two and a half quarters Saturday. Wherever Ball went, Jackson was there. If Jackson deflected the ball out of bounds one play, he was standing right next to Ball as the Hornets tried to put the ball back in play. Once Ball had the rock, he was forced to make multiple moves to get it across the half-court line and enter the Hornets into their offensive possession. Lillard was not alone in his praise for Jackson’s defensive effort. All weekend long, Jackson’s teammates celebrated his hustle, toughness and hard work on the All-Star guards the Bucks faced on back-to-back nights. “They get what Dre’s role is, and nobody wants it other than Dre,” Rivers said. “And so they are encouraging him. It’s just, really, be a star in your role, and that’s what he’s doing.” Jackson has not yet earned his head coach’s complete trust, and that has kept the second-year forward from UConn from becoming a full-time regular in Rivers’ rotation. On Saturday, Jackson made a mistake on a defensive coverage that allowed Ball to get an open 3 midway through the third quarter. Jackson came out of the game at the next stoppage and never returned. Ball scored a career-high 50 points in Charlotte’s loss. When teams cover Jackson on offense with their center, Rivers takes Jackson out of the game. When Jackson takes a shot Rivers doesn’t agree with, Rivers takes Jackson out of the game. When Jackson gets overzealous and commits a turnover by attempting a pass he should not try to throw, Rivers takes Jackson out of the game. Advertisement Jackson doesn’t have it all figured out yet, and Rivers hasn’t figured out how to keep Jackson on the floor in every situation. Jackson’s energy and effort, however, are undeniable, and his insertion into the rotation has made the Bucks a better defensive team. As the Bucks have turned things around, few things have been more impactful than the shooting of Gary Trent Jr. General manager Jon Horst signed Trent to be the Bucks’ starting shooting guard and one of the three players, along with Bobby Portis and Brook Lopez, to help carry the scoring load alongside the Bucks’ big three. Rivers played Trent in that role to start the season, and things did not work out. Trent made just nine of his 39 3-point attempts (23.1 percent) and averaged only 8.0 points in 29.5 minutes per game across the first seven games of the season before it was revealed following the eighth game he was struggling with back spasms. Because of those back spasms, Trent played only eight minutes Nov. 7 against the Utah Jazz and missed the next two games before getting back on the floor for six minutes Nov. 12 against the Raptors. In the Bucks’ overtime win Nov. 13 against the Detroit Pistons, Trent broke out in the second half and put up 11 points, four rebounds, three assists and two steals in 34 minutes off the bench. It was his first double-digit scoring performance since putting up 10 points on Oct. 28 against the Boston Celtics. The 25-year-old shooting guard has averaged 13.0 points, 2.7 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 1.2 steals in 27.3 minutes off the bench over the past six games and has scored in double-figures in every game since that breakout against the Pistons. He has knocked down 22 of the 37 3-pointers he’s attempted (59.5 percent) in those six games and seems to be playing with more confidence and swagger in his role off the bench. In recent games, he’s found better chemistry with Antetokounmpo and thrived in the units comprising four bench players surrounding Antetokounmpo. Despite coming off the bench, Trent was given the opportunity to close both games this weekend and hit a few big shots down the stretch. “He’s been huge,” Rivers said after the Bucks’ win Friday. “We’ve avoided any thought of (putting him back in the starting lineup). He’s very comfortable in his role now and that’s where he’s been a lot, so maybe we overthought that. “I think it was two games ago, they were helping off Dre and we needed to start someone, and we were like, ‘We’re not going to start Gary because we like his role.’ And it’s been great for us. And I’m just happy for him with the shots that he takes and the way he works, it’s really good to see him play with confidence.” Advertisement Speaking of Trent’s role off the bench… As the season has progressed, Rivers has made major alterations to his rotation. When asked what has gone into the decision to push Connaughton down in the rotation, Rivers made it clear his motivation behind playing time decisions is simple. “It’s not that deep,” Rivers said. “It’s just that, right now, there’s guys that are playing well. And what I love about Pat is that he’s been a pro, he’s staying ready. It’s as deep as that.” Obviously, every player on the roster would like to play as many minutes as possible, but there will always be players who are disappointed with their playing time. At times, that frustration can lead to problems for teams and their chemistry, but that has not been the case in Milwaukee this season. “The last couple of years I’ve been with the team, there’s never been pouting,” Antetokounmpo said. “I think we have great teammates, great players, winners. They understand … what it takes. I know you can go ask Pat right now, I know he’s still ready. “Everybody is ready. We don’t have that mentality. If your leaders don’t pout, how are you going to pout? If I don’t complain, how are you going to complain? It’s impossible.” For now, the Bucks seem to have found their groove. They’ve taken care of business at home during an easier part of their schedule. If things go sideways though, Rivers may be forced to make changes to his rotation again. What he has already done this season shows he is not afraid of making sweeping changes. (Photo of Andre Jackson Jr. and T.J. McConnell: Benny Sieu / Imagn Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Inside Brett Berard's NHL debut: 35 loved ones, a brother's mad dash to MSG and an assist",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5948738/2024/11/26/new-york-rangers-brett-berard-nhl-debut/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 12:27:51 GMT","The 22-year-old Berard showed flashes of promise on a less-than-ideal Monday for the Rangers, who fell 5-2 to the Blues in his debut.","NHL NEW YORK — Brady Berard kept eying the clock at Boston College hockey practice Monday afternoon. The junior forward knew his brother, Brett, was making his NHL debut for the New York Rangers that evening, but time was working against him. Madison Square Garden was 200 miles away. As the minutes passed, he accepted he’d probably be watching the game on TV. Advertisement At 4:20 p.m., a little less than three hours before puck drop in Manhattan, BC coach Greg Brown called the team in for a huddle. “Some of us know some guys (who) play in the NHL, but to have a family member who plays is pretty special,” he told the team. Then he turned to Brady. “Brady, get the f— on the plane. Go support your brother. Go support your family.” Brady didn’t need to be told twice. He found time to shower and left the rink at 4:37, his flight booked to New York. “I got (changed) in probably 10 minutes,” he said from the Madison Square Garden concourse. “I’m usually a marinate guy in the locker room, so that was pretty fast for me.” Fortunately for him, there was next to no security line at Boston Logan International Airport. He and his girlfriend arrived at the airport at 5:05 and made the 5:37 flight. The plane landed at 6:50, and an Uber dropped him off at Madison Square Garden at 7:20, just a few minutes after puck drop. Brady was one of about 35 people who came to Monday’s game in support of the older Berard brother. His parents were shocked and delighted when they caught sight of him in his black hat and white jacket. So was Brett, who pulled his brother in for a hug after the game. Monday was otherwise a less-than-ideal start to the week for the Rangers. They lost 5-2 to the St. Louis Blues, and league sources confirmed a report from Elliotte Friedman earlier that day that general manager Chris Drury had sent word to the 31 other teams that he was open to making trades. Captain Jacob Trouba and Chris Kreider, the team’s longest-tenured player, were mentioned specifically by name. The 22-year-old Berard offered at least a bit of a bright spot. The 5-foot-9 winger wasn’t perfect but showed flashes of promise in 11:13 of action, picking up his first point in the process. Advertisement “I thought he worked really hard out there,” said coach Peter Laviolette, who didn’t have many positive things to say after the game. “I thought he was trying to make a difference.” Berard, who led AHL Hartford in goals last season, is listed as a top-five Rangers prospect in The Athletic’s Scott Wheeler’s rankings. On Sunday, the 2020 fifth-round pick was putting on a suit ahead of a Wolf Pack game when Rangers assistant general manager Ryan Martin called to tell him he was headed to the NHL. Berard called his dad, mom and brother first, describing them as “the three most important people in my life.” His mom, Lynne, shed a few tears when she found out. Berard’s dad, David, is the men’s hockey coach at Stonehill College, and his team was off Monday. Plenty of Berard’s friends got to New York for the game, too; they are still in college and were in their native Rhode Island for Thanksgiving break. “Everything kind of worked,” David said. Berard was on the ice for the Blues’ first two goals, though he wasn’t at fault for the first, which stemmed from Mika Zibanejad and Trouba failing to connect on a pass behind the Rangers’ net. On the second goal, though, Berard didn’t stay in front of Radek Faksa, who tried shooting the puck. That led to a scrum in front of the net and an eventual Zack Bolduc goal. The rookie helped avenge the mistake. Midway through the second period, he flung a puck into the offensive zone and then received a pass from Will Cuylle behind the Rangers’ net. He tried for a wraparound goal and flung the puck off goalie Joel Hofer’s pads. Zibanejad found it and fed Cuylle who then shot at the open net. The goal gave Berard a secondary assist for the first point of his NHL career. “It was special,” Berard said. “It was crazy to be on the ice for that.” “I think he was a little frustrated because he was minus-2 at that point,” David said shortly after. “I think it’s probably a big weight off his shoulder, and then he had a couple shifts where he was really moving his feet after.” Advertisement Brady jokingly took credit for his older brother driving to the net on the play. “He learned it from me, I think,” he said, laughing. “It was a great play. I learn from his poise. He has sick poise with the puck, sick hockey IQ. Obviously a lot of things I can emulate from his game.” Brady, who will be back at Boston College for 2 p.m. practice Tuesday, is teammates with Rangers prospects Gabe Perreault and Drew Fortescue. He added both were pumped for Brett, with whom they keep in touch. Berard finished the game with two shots and spent time on the second power-play unit. According to Natural Stat Trick, New York had 44.7 percent of the expected goal share when the Cuylle-Zibanejad-Berard trio was on the ice — the best mark of any line on the team. Though disappointed with the loss after the game, Berard called his debut “an awesome experience.” He had butterflies the 24 hours leading up to the game and was too nervous to take a pregame nap, but he tried to slow the game down as much as he could when it began. “It was everything I’ve always dreamed of,” he said.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"What is Baller League, why are KSI and IShowSpeed involved and is it a game-changer?",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5949002/2024/11/26/baller-league-explained-ksi-ishowspeed/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 12:20:53 GMT",What is the new concept and is it really the revolution organisers are suggesting?,"A measure of the shifting cultural sands — in football and how it is presented — came in a press release distributed on Monday. The Baller League is what its organisers have optimistically called a “new era for football” led by YouTube stars KSI and IShowSpeed but, in the grasp for credibility, they have asked a 63-year-old along for the ride. Advertisement Gary Lineker, who steps down from his presenting role at the BBC’s Premier League highlights show Match of the Day at the end of this season, was named among the celebrity managers of the 12-team tournament that will begin in March 2025, trying to plot the downfall of internet stars, including Angry Ginge and Sharky. Old media against new media, football fused with entertainment. The live action streamed over Twitch and YouTube will not be for everyone but the Baller League has big ambitions. Already a hit in Germany, where it was launched last year, a host of high-profile names will see it rolled out in the UK and United States in 2025. But what is the competition all about — and what does it hope to achieve? It has been championed as something novel. Or to borrow the excitable language of promoters, it will be “forward-thinking, aggressive, hyper-exciting football… that’s impossible to ignore”. Now, to readers of a certain vintage, it feels a lot like the Major Indoor Soccer League or the Soccer Six in the 1980s. Small-sided games, rolling substitutes and, well, a bit of light entertainment. The Baller League leans on that concept with the help of celebrity names. KSI, the YouTuber turned part-time boxer, will head up the UK league, with IShowSpeed, who tends to get where water can’t at major sporting events, taking charge of the U.S. operation.  That pairing has a combined 58million subscribers to their respective YouTube channels and that illustrates where the Baller League’s focus will be aimed. Chunkz, Miniminter, Angry Ginge and Sharky, all successful content creators with audiences that run to the size of small countries, are also part of the UK league hosted in London. Perhaps more surprising are the established names that have been convinced to join Baller League. Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards, best known for their roles on Match of the Day and their Rest Is Football podcast, will manage one of the 12 teams, while Arsenal Invincibles Jens Lehmann, Robert Pires and Freddie Ljungberg will take charge of another. Luis Figo, Ballon d’Or winner in 2000, has also signed up, along with former England and Chelsea defender John Terry. Advertisement Ronaldinho, the Brazilian great, will head to the U.S. with Speed when that is launched in the spring. All the stellar names appeared in a stylish launch video but it will be less heralded individuals that do all the running. Baller League says it will provide “a stage for street football whilst giving talent the second chance to perform”, inviting former academy players, professionals, free agents and “street ballers” the opportunity to land a place on teams managed by Lineker, Terry and Figo. Trials will be held in London and Manchester. There will be cynicism that swirls around a concept driven by YouTube stars but this is an era being moulded by them. An annual charity football fixture organised by the Sidemen collective, staged at Wembley in front of 90,000 this March, sold out in less than three hours this month, just days after another YouTube star, Jake Paul, was facing Mike Tyson. A painfully tepid exhibition of boxing it might have been but Netflix, which streamed the fight, claimed it was watched in 60million households around the world. And eyes mean revenue. Or at least the promise of it. The first seeds of the Baller League were planted in Germany. Founded by Felix Starck, currently the chief executive of the organisation, alongside former German internationals Mats Hummels and Lukas Podolski, there have already been two seasons played to build up what the organisers call “a massive following”. There has been star appeal there, too. Hummels has recently stepped away, but former World Cup finalist Christoph Kramer was among the former internationals to align with the German version, while Podolski — alongside Juventus forward Alisha Lehmann — coached the winning team in the first season (Streets United, if you were wondering). Advertisement It began in a disused plane hanger in Cologne and, just like the one that will come to the UK and US, had games streamed live. Unverified figures from the organisers claimed that there were 3million viewers per matchday on Twitch, ranking it as the No 1 Twitch channel worldwide in 2024. Coverage was also available through JOYN, a German streaming app, and Pro Sieben Maxx, a free-to-air television channel. The Bundesliga can still sleep easily at night but there was obvious appeal to the startup. It was reported that 10,000 applications were received to join a players’ draft and commercial partnerships were also struck with blue-chip companies, including Vodafone, Citroen, Gatorade and Samsung. German newspaper Kicker reported that Xing, the jobs website, paid a mid-seven-figure sum to be a league-wide shirt sponsor during the first season. The company is also sponsoring the third season, according to its website. Germany’s lead will be the blueprint for spin-off competitions in the UK and US. There will be a dozen teams playing what amounts to six-a-side football over two 15-minute halves, all in a single indoor arena. Eleven matchday weeks will see every team pitted against each of the others, with the top four progressing to a play-off that will decide a winner. The UK’s event will begin in March and conclude in May, with all games played in London. All seem routine enough? Hold that thought. Baller League’s USP, if that’s the angle you are coming in from, will see each game follow different rules shaped by the spin of a roulette wheel. The final three minutes of each half sees a new set of rules adopted, including a three versus three format and goals scored from distance counting double. That noise you can just about make out is IFAB tutting on the other end of a Twitch stream. Presentation of the new, interchangeable rules drafted in were sponsored by brands when games were streamed in Germany, entrenching the outlook there is money to be made from the concept. Advertisement Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, 77 years young, once claimed that young audiences were “no longer interested in football” when he was attempting to launch the Super League in 2021. Baller League — and others — are taking the theory and running with it. Baller League met resistance in Germany, with some players — who can earn up to €800 (£668; $840) per matchday — turning out for the new concept while still on the books of amateur clubs. Markus Koppe, sporting director of FV Bonn-Endenich, claimed his “dressing room is poisoned because of the Baller League” in a Facebook video that was subsequently deleted. A second post, clarifying his opposition, said: “We would never have had a problem if two or a maximum of three players had taken part. But it was no longer acceptable for us. It’s a great thing for young people. If I were 20 again, I’d be up for playing too.” And those words perhaps best illustrate the generational divide; the traditionalists that baulk at the innovation and the youth eager to jump on board. Baller League also has similarities to the Kings League, launched in 2023 with former Spain and Barcelona defender Gerard Pique at its helm and currently in its second season. The Kings League went with seven players per team but again there were whacky rules and a host of Spanish influencers on board in teams managed by former stars, such as Sergio Aguero and Iker Casillas. A Queens League, for women’s players, was also launched. That, too, was met with some hostility. Javier Tebas, the president of La Liga, called the event a “circus” and there were complaints directed towards local amateur players in Catalonia signing up to play in the Kings League as it caused scheduling problems with their 11-a-side club matches.

That leaves just three more bowl spots among 12 other teams. It could mark the first time in several years bowls won’t need to elevate the 5-7 team with the best Academic Progress Rate (APR) to fill out the field. Unfortunately, that means multiple eligible teams could get left out of the postseason. Advertisement The Big Ten’s lineup seems straightforward while the SEC’s pool of available teams deepened significantly with Oklahoma’s upset of Alabama. There are 13 SEC teams that have qualified for bowl games. Our projection of three SEC teams in the CFP bracket stretches teams outside of the SEC’s bowl contracts. The ACC will have at least 12 teams, perhaps 13, bowling. The Big 12 has nine bowl teams with two more vying for the postseason this weekend. Implementing the current and former Pac-12 schools is a challenge for each of their contracted bowls and current conferences. Seven teams have qualified for the Pac-12 legacy bowls and one more (Oregon State) has a chance to join them this weekend. The Alamo selects first after the CFP and has no restrictions on win-loss differential. Then the order consists of Holiday, Vegas, Sun, LA Bowl and Independence. Among the power-conference teams clinching postseason berths last weekend include Nebraska for the first time since 2016, Florida (which upset Ole Miss), West Virginia, and Oklahoma. We project the Sooners getting a date with Boston College in the Gasparilla Bowl, which will serve as a curtain raiser to a first-round College Football Playoff game on Dec. 20. This week, the Virginia-Virginia Tech winner earns bowl eligibility, while power conference teams Michigan State, Wisconsin, Auburn, NC State, Kansas and Cincinnati seek their sixth win.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How tennis players and tennis coaches choose each other: 'The most important thing is trust',https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5947172/2024/11/26/tennis-players-coaches-relationship-how-choose/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 12:01:47 GMT","The relationship between player and coach can be transformative or combustible, sometimes both. So how do they start?","Tennis How does one of the best male players in tennis history choose a new coach? Pick somebody who has been there with you — and who you beat to get there. Novak Djokovic’s decision to hire Andy Murray for at least the Australian Open has renewed interest in one of the most interesting psychological relationships in sport: The tennis player and their coach. Advertisement Djokovic has always sought out a coach who has scaled the mountain he chose, hiring Boris Becker, Andre Agassi and Goran Ivanisevic throughout his career, all of them, like Murray, former Wimbledon champions and multiple major winners, Ivanisevic apart. He needs the voice of someone who he respects and who is happy to have it out with him mid-match — until they aren’t. A few months after Djokovic and Ivanisevic parted ways in March this year, six seasons and 12 major titles in the bank, Ivanisevic explained that they simply ran out of patience with each other. Djokovic’s decision comes on the back of a reshuffle at the top of the WTA Tour, with world No. 2 Iga Swiatek, world No. 3 Coco Gauff, world No. 6 Elena Rybakina and four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka all firing and then hiring in the wake of the U.S. Open in a bid to renew their games, work on technique, strengthen relationships, gain an edge — or rather, a mix of all these things that is unique to each player’s priorities and each coach’s way of working. That mix can win titles and inspire careers, but it had better work, with players and their teams on the road together and working at close quarters for practically the entire year. “I imagine that if I had a family and kids, I would not be here at all,” world No. 18 Marta Kostyuk’s coach Sandra Zaniewska said in an interview with The Athletic earlier this year. A technical master or a sideline hype master? A proven champion or a developing prospect? Players and coaches alike have myriad decisions to make in choosing each other. GO DEEPER Murray named Djokovic's coach for Australian Open There are all sorts of factors that go into choosing a coach. Sometimes players want to work on something technical, whether a shot or a surface. Three-time Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka brought in former Wimbledon champion Richard Kraijeck in 2016 to improve his grass-court tennis; Roger Federer and Murray did the same thing for clay with Jose Higueras and Alex Corretja respectively. Advertisement Djokovic hired Ivanisevic — who is now with Rybakina — in part to improve his serve, increasing its fluency and turning Djokovic into one of the most feared and precise servers in the sport in the early 2020s. In search of a better net game, Djokovic employed Australian player Mark Woodforde, who won 11 Grand Slam doubles titles with fellow ‘Woody’ Mark Woodbridge; he hired former U.S. Open finalist Todd Martin to work on his serve earlier in his career with less successful results. Technical changes were the main motivation behind Gauff’s decision to split with Brad Gilbert, with whom she won the U.S. Open in 2023. Gilbert coached Gauff to deflect the vulnerabilities in her serve and forehand by turning matches into battles of defense and attrition; he would tell her to hit her forehand with a slow, looping arc to neutralize attacks. When opponents figured this out — and her serve kept letting her down — it was time for a change, not just in her game but in the type of coaching that would help her progress. “I wanted someone to help me with what I wanted to see progress in, especially on the serve,” Gauff said in a news conference at the WTA Tour Finals in Saudi Arabia, which she won in an early boost to her relationship with Matt Daly, a specialist on both footwork and grip technique who co-created a training device to help players improve their grip, and Jean-Christophe Faurel. “JC” has worked with Gauff previously and players often return to coaches they know and trust. Djokovic went back to long-time coach Marian Vajda in 2018 before they split for a second time four years later. Murray did likewise, bringing Ivan Lendl back in 2016 after the latter had stepped down two years earlier, and then again for a third spell in 2022. As when football clubs sack and hire managers, availability is the intangible that remains out of players’ control and choosing a familiar face can be easier than going into the unknown, especially in the case of Djokovic, 37, who does not have much time left in his career to take a punt on something new. Emma Raducanu is another player focused on improving a specific shot — often the serve or forehand. If she doesn’t feel it’s working, she is quick to move on. Torben Beltz, who was brought in to improve Raducanu’s forehand in November 2021, was sacked five months later when it was felt that insufficient progress was being made. Raducanu doesn’t want a hype man or woman, but technical expertise. One of the most successful examples of technical focus in recent times comes from women’s world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, who transformed her serve with the support of biomechanics specialist Gavin MacMillan after it completely broke down in 2022. GO DEEPER How tears and a telephone in Toronto changed Aryna Sabalenka's tennis life It’s something Swiatek, who Sabalenka dethroned as world No. 1 in October, is looking for from her new relationship with Wim Fissette. Fissette, who has had Grand Slam-winning success with Kim Clijsters, Angelique Kerber and Naomi Osaka, is one of the most prominent coaches on the WTA Tour. Their uniting offered a window into the mutual considerations that players and coaches undertake when beginning a relationship, which representatives from both have explained over the last few weeks. Advertisement Swiatek, by her own admission an overthinker, spoke to Fissette by phone before meeting in person in Warsaw to discuss “the specifics of the technicalities and what he wanted to change in my game”. At a news conference at the WTA Finals earlier this month, Swiatek said that Fissette “added some extra stuff that I haven’t thought of” as well as aligning with her own ideas for improvement. On a personal level, Swiatek appreciated Fissette’s listening skills, which players and friends said is one of his defining characteristics as a coach in interviews with The Athletic last month. “The communication was kind of smooth. He also let me talk a lot and he was able to listen to me and this was pretty fun,” Swiatek said. Fissette told Eurosport last month that he wanted to work with Swiatek after splitting with former world No. 1 Osaka, who switched to working with Serena Williams’ former coach Patrick Mouratoglou in September. “Not only because she is No. 1 in the world but also because of her personality, which is a role model for other tennis players,” Fissette said. GO DEEPER Emotional intelligence, data, and tough love: Who is Wim Fissette the coach? Personality is the other deciding factor in player-coach relationships: Not just whether they work or not, but how long they might last. While players are typically the more ruthless party in ending partnerships despite the now de rigueur mutually gushy Instagram announcements, coaches can sometimes take the decision. Fissette was working with world No. 5 Zheng Qinwen when he decided to rejoin Osaka’s team last year, a decision which left Zheng blindsided and heartbroken. Zheng has since reunited with Pere Riba, who helped her to an Olympic gold medal and a first Grand Slam final in 2024. They have a quirky dynamic whereby during practice sessions at a tournament, Zheng dictates the sessions, but Riba calls the shots in training; they figured out the compromise after learning each other’s personalities, a necessary process in every relationship. Jessica Pegula, who reached the U.S. Open final in September after splitting with David Witt and bringing on Mark Knowles and Mark Merklein, discussed the importance of retaining identity in a news conference at the WTA Tour Finals. “I think you can see a coaching situation doesn’t work out because they try to change the player too much,” she said. Advertisement “You obviously have to get along with the person. You have to be able to respond well to them.” American world No. 18 Frances Tiafoe was next to hire Witt and he reached the U.S. Open semifinals with the American in his box. “Someone needs to push me and hold me accountable, but also make it fun for me,” Tiafoe said in a news conference at the tournament. “If you come at me with a drill-sergeant-type mentality, I’m going to go the other way.” Patrick McEnroe, who has been guiding players since retiring in 1998, worked with Tiafoe at the Laver Cup exhibition event. “He brings a certain energy to everyone around him, so obviously you’ve got to understand that coming in.” Mouratoglou, who coached Simona Halep and Holger Rune between Williams and Osaka, described the need to be a “chameleon” in a recent Zoom interview ahead of his arrival in London for Ultimate Tennis Showdown, his main pursuit outside of coaching. “My job is to understand I cannot be the same every time,” he said. “Serena needed to feel that she was in control of everything. If you don’t win the title, it’s nothing. It’s No. 1 or nothing. “Simona was the opposite, she wanted me to be in control of everything.” After Halep had a panic attack at the 2022 French Open, Mouratoglou realized he had to back off the intensity that had worked with Williams. “She felt the pressure of having to deliver was hurting her. I completely changed the way I was interacting with her.” Halep then reached the Wimbledon semifinals before being provisionally suspended in October 2022 after testing positive for roxadustat. Tennis integrity authorities suspended her for four years in 2023 before the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) reduced the ban to nine months on appeal in March this year after accepting that the positive test came from a contaminated supplement. Mouratoglou said he felt “responsible” for Halep’s case in an Instagram video in 2023. Advertisement Now working with Osaka, Mouratoglou said the former world No. 1 is “a very interesting personality” but “not easy to understand because she’s very secretive and keeps a lot inside.” “I think in terms of game and work to do, we are really on the same page. But there is this piece that is very important, which is understanding the person that she is. That will take more time.” In the sea of recent changes, world No. 1 Sabalenka has been an oasis of calm. She prioritizes coaches who can understand her unique personality and has built a relationship with her long-time coaches Jason Stacy and Anton Dubrov over time after some “really bad experiences” that left her “betrayed”. “I was (never) looking for big names because sometimes big names are just big names,” she added at a news conference at the WTA Tour Finals earlier this month. “I was looking for someone smart and someone who is always looking for something. “I was looking for someone who can understand that even if I go crazy on court, it’s nothing personal.” “Anton, I knew him, since I don’t know 15, because he was in the academy when I was practising. “With Jason, it took us two years to open up and trust him fully and to understand him as a person and I’m really glad I didn’t kick him out.” Former U.S. Open champion Daniil Medvedev also treasures stability, working with main coach Gilles Cervara for more than seven years before bringing on former world No. 6 Gilles Simon, which is more similar to Djokovic’s decision to bring on Murray. “I am not someone who wants to constantly change and look for something new,” he said in a news conference at the Laver Cup in September. Argentina’s world No. 30 Francisco Cerundolo echoed the benefits of having multiple coaches at a news conference a couple of months ago, but America’s Danielle Collins meanwhile said in an interview earlier this month that she prefers not to have much of a team around her: She likes working things out herself and isn’t always convinced of the value that coaches can bring. Advertisement That value can be hard to quantify. In Djokovic’s case, the rarefied level at which he operates means it’ll likely come down to whether Murray can provide the right sort of energy to help him get over the line for an 11th time at the Australian Open.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Chargers' loss to Ravens shows just how much work Jim Harbaugh still has to do,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5948879/2024/11/26/chargers-loss-harbaugh-ravens/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 12:00:14 GMT","Harbaugh and GM Joe Hortiz have Los Angeles on an upward trajectory, but the roster limitations were on display Monday vs. Baltimore.","NFL INGLEWOOD, Calif. — The Los Angeles Chargers are an improved team. But Monday night’s 30-23 loss to the Baltimore Ravens showed just how far they have still to go. That is not an indictment of what coach Jim Harbaugh and general manager Joe Hortiz are building. It is still Year 1 of an organizational overhaul. The Chargers are 7-4. They have a really good chance of making the playoffs. The mere fact that the Chargers will play meaningful December games, starting next week in Atlanta, is evidence of an upward trajectory. Advertisement The roster just has limitations at this stage of the process. The Ravens are bona fide contenders. The Chargers are not yet at that level. In the NFL, quality opponents will exploit weaknesses and reveal the truth. “They played better football than we did tonight,” Harbaugh said. GO DEEPER Henry powers Ravens past Chargers 30-23 in 'Harbaugh Bowl': Takeaways This loss is going to sting for Harbaugh, as he falls to 0-3 against his big brother, John. This loss is going to sting for Hortiz, who spent 26 years working for the Ravens. It will sting for offensive coordinator Greg Roman, who was let go by the Ravens following the 2022 season after six years in Baltimore. It will sting for all the former Ravens now with the Chargers, from assistant general manager Chad Alexander, to offensive line coach Mike Devlin, to tight ends coach and run game coordinator Andy Bischoff. Good coaching and sound roster construction can lead to rapid and immediate progress. We have seen that this season with the Chargers. Building a team capable of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy takes time. “You can say there’s a lot of fight and all those different things,” edge rusher Khalil Mack said. “But there’s no moral victories at this point in the season. You got to go out and play winning football when it matters the most.” The Chargers did not have the physicality to match up with Ravens running back Derrick Henry, who finished with 140 rushing yards on 24 carries. Coordinator Jesse Minter’s unit started fast. The Chargers forced punts on the first two possessions of the game. But the Ravens leaned into Henry on the next drive. Henry broke off a 19-yard run on the opening play. He followed that up with a 14-yard run. He totaled 44 rushing yards on the drive, which quarterback Lamar Jackson capped off with a 10-yard touchdown run. Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.
 Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox. Henry is a freight train, and the Chargers did not have an emergency brake to pull. Once Henry got rolling, there was no stopping him. The Chargers lost at the line of scrimmage. They did not tackle well at any level. “We need better block destruction just across the board,” Harbaugh said. Henry averaged 7.1 yards per carry on first down. The Ravens had an average distance to gain of 6.4 yards on second, third and fourth downs, according to TruMedia.

Baltimore successfully converted three fourth-and-1s. Two of those came from Henry on a touchdown drive in the second half. Mack said giving up 212 rushing yards is “the thing that pisses me off the most.” The Chargers were not at full strength, and that mattered. Linebacker Denzel Perryman was inactive with a groin injury. This game was begging for one of Perryman’s trademark violent hits. Maybe if Perryman plays, he meets Henry in the hole in the first quarter and sets a different tone for the defense. Advertisement “He’s definitely one of the hearts and souls in the middle of our defense,” James said of Perryman. Mack was also on a snap count in his first game back from two pulled groins. Mack, who was inactive last week against the Cincinnati Bengals, only played 27 of the defense’s 64 snaps Monday night. The Chargers did not set consistent edges against Henry. Mack said after the game he was “trying not to jump on the field in certain situations.” “I didn’t want no setback,” Mack said, “so I kind of just stayed coachable in those moments.” More snaps from Mack, perhaps the defense’s most consistently physical player, could have made a big difference. “It’s not hard for me to play against that guy,” Mack said of Henry. “I love playing against the greats.” The Chargers were also without cornerback Cam Hart, who has been good in run support this season. He aggravated his ankle injury in Saturday’s practice, according to Harbaugh, and was inactive for the game. Fellow rookie Tarheeb Still started in place of Hart at outside cornerback and ended up one-on-one with Henry multiple times. At the same time, the Chargers had their full stable of interior defensive linemen. They had Tuli Tuipulotu and Joey Bosa on the edge. They had their best cornerback Kristian Fulton, who gave up a 40-yard touchdown from Jackson to receiver Rashod Bateman in the second quarter. They had linebacker Daiyan Henley, and they had all three of their starting safeties in James, Alohi Gilman and Elijah Molden. The Ravens scored on five straight drives after their two early punts. “We just got to get him on the ground,” James said of Henry. Despite the defensive unraveling, the Chargers had a chance to tie the game in the fourth quarter, trailing 23-16. Quarterback Justin Herbert and the offense faced a third-and-6 from their 34-yard line. Advertisement Herbert dropped back after a shotgun snap. Receiver Quentin Johnston came wide open on a crossing route. Herbert delivered a perfect throw. Johnston dropped what would have been an easy conversion — and much more. “I felt I had some space upfield,” said Johnston, who did not have a catch on five targets, “so I just turned my head before I’d seen the catch all the way in.” Johnston struggled with drops as a rookie last season. He called the play a “complete lack of focus at the catch point.” “He’s a fighter,” Herbert said of Johnston. “I’m going to keep throwing him the ball.” Rookie Ladd McConkey is an emerging player. He led the Chargers with six catches on six targets for 83 yards. But Monday night was a glaring example of how badly the Chargers need receiving help. It is a roster limitation after Harbaugh and Hortiz moved on from Keenan Allen and Mike Williams in the offseason. The Ravens had given up at least three completions of 20-plus yards in every game this season. The Chargers did not have a single completion of 20 yards in the game. Receiver Joshua Palmer had three catches on eight targets. Receiver DJ Chark, who the Chargers signed in free agency in March, was a healthy scratch for the game. He could potentially give the passing game a boost. Chark has played only one offensive snap all season. He was on injured reserve until early November. But the reality is that adding the type of difference-maker the Chargers need will have to wait until the offseason. “We’re all going to have some things that we wish we would have played, coached better,” Harbaugh said. The Chargers scored only three second-half points before a garbage-time touchdown made the final score look closer than the game actually was. Running back J.K. Dobbins, another former Raven, left the game with a knee injury in the second quarter, and the Chargers struggled to run the ball after his departure. Gus Edwards had 11 rushing yards on nine carries. “They executed,” Harbaugh said, “and they were the better team tonight.” Monday night was a measuring stick. And now it is clear where the Chargers stand. “We’ll regroup,” Harbaugh said. (Top photo: Sean M. Haffey / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Can Broncos' rushing roulette support a playoff push down the stretch?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5946402/2024/11/26/broncos-running-backs/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 12:00:04 GMT","Denver has had five different players lead the team in rushing during a game this season, the most since 2010.","NFL Bo Nix dropped back to pass 42 times during the Broncos’ victory over the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday, the most for the rookie quarterback since his debut in Seattle in Week 1. It was a somewhat curious figure given the Raiders’ middling performance against the run this season. Sean Payton explained afterward that the heavier-than-expected use of Cover 0 blitz schemes by Las Vegas complicated the run plan. “I probably should have gotten into some heavier personnel groupings,” Denver’s coach and play-caller added after the game. “Yesterday was going to be a tough day for any of the backs,” Payton said Monday during a conference call with reporters. “It was just a heavy blitz-heavy, run-front plan by the Raiders. So quickly we had to adjust.”  The Broncos ultimately averaged just 2.9 yards per carry (63 yards on 22 attempts) during Sunday’s 29-19 win. It was Denver’s lowest output of the season, and it was a performance that provided no further clarity to a murky backfield picture as the team moves into the critical, cold-weather games ahead. Asked about Denver’s running back pecking order last week, Payton called it “the $6 million question,” and Sunday provided no clear answer. Advertisement The Broncos have had five different leading rushers in just 12 games this season: Javonte Williams (five times), Nix (three), Jaleel McLaughlin (two, including Sunday), Tyler Badie (one) and Audric Estimé (one). It’s the first time since 2010 that Denver has had that many different players pace the team in rushing during a game in the same season and just the third time it has happened for Payton in 17 seasons as a head coach. Denver has had three different top rushers in its past three games alone. It’s conceivable that receiver Marvin Mims Jr., whose role the past three weeks has included work in the backfield, could be one or two electric runs away from becoming the Broncos’ sixth player to lead the team in rushing during a game at some point. GO DEEPER Marvin Mims Jr.'s new role highlights Sean Payton's creativity with Broncos offense So who will be the lead back when the Broncos host the Cleveland Browns on “Monday Night Football” next week? It’s anyone’s guess. “I would never know going into a game,” offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi said last week. “There are a handful of plays where we’re like, ‘We want Javonte on this play,’ or, ‘We want Audric.’ A lot of it is (running backs coach) Lou (Ayeni) deciding who is in on this series, who is in on this play. If guys are hitting 5-yard gains, 8-yard gains consistently, it’s easy to keep giving them the ball. Hot hand is a good way to look at it.” Only the so-called hot hand approach hasn’t proven to be a surefire guide for the Broncos. Estimé, the rookie fifth-round pick, saw the first significant action of his career in Denver’s 16-14 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 10. He performed well, running the ball 14 times for 53 yards and providing an important spark on Denver’s two touchdown drives. It seemed like a precursor for a heavier workload. Instead, Estimé has run the ball only nine times in the past two games combined, which is third on the team in that span behind Williams (17) and McLaughlin (11). Advertisement On Sunday, McLaughlin saw his most significant action (eight carries, 44 yards) since Week 9, and that came after Payton hinted early in the week that Denver would find more touches for the second-year back. Williams also had eight carries (minus-2 yards). Estimé had three carries for 15 yards. Mims, meanwhile, has carried the ball eight times over the past three games. While the receiver’s new role has added “a big-play element” to Denver’s offense, as Nix said Sunday, it has also affected the overall math related to allotted rushing attempts in Denver’s backfield. Williams leads the Broncos with 10 rushing attempts per game, which ranks 29th in the NFL, and is on pace to be the lowest per-game average for a running back on a Payton-coached team since Pierre Thomas carried the ball 9.2 times per game in 2013. “I think it’s always hard to feed three (running backs),” Payton said during preparation for the game against the Raiders, a sentiment he’s repeated often this season. “I’m used to, and it’s easy, feeding two. So we kind of do that a little bit. … So it’s a tough, but a good problem to have.” The Broncos’ running backs have publicly expressed contentment with how the workload has been divided. Estimé said it’s incumbent on him and Denver’s other backs to “stay ready, so you don’t have to get ready.” Williams said last week that “nothing should be given,” and added that the players in his room enjoy supporting one another, no matter who sees the most action during a given week. Plus, Denver’s offense has made clear strides amid the running back shuffling. The Broncos are averaging 22 points per game, which is on pace to be their highest output since 2015 (22.1). Their 152 points since Week 7 are tied with the Chiefs for the seventh-most in the NFL during that span. Still, the running game presents a major opportunity for improvement as the Broncos enter the season’s homestretch and then move into a future where building properly around a young franchise quarterback on a rookie contract will be paramount. Running backs who changed addresses this offseason have boosted teams across the league. Saquon Barkley in Philadelphia. Derrick Henry in Baltimore. Josh Jacobs in Green Bay. Joe Mixon in Houston. Aaron Jones in Minnesota. Generally speaking, the league’s top offenses have featured an unquestioned lead running back. Adding that kind of player, be it through free agency or a high draft pick, will have to be at least a consideration. GO DEEPER Bo Nix, Courtland Sutton and a budding bromance steering Broncos toward playoffs That’s not what the Broncos are operating with right now. Williams figures to continue leading the running backs in overall snaps based on his reliability as a pass-blocker, among other traits. Sunday marked arguably the least efficient performance of Williams’ four-year career, but he’s also responsible for Denver’s top two games in rushing yards and three of the top four. McLaughlin won’t carry the ball 20 times at any point, Lombardi said recently, but his versatility as a runner who can operate in tight spaces will continue to give him a role in the offense. The biggest question is whether Estimé can continue to earn the trust that creates a larger opportunity. Advertisement “He’s healthy, we’re excited about his future and I have to continue to find ways to get him more touches,” Payton said. Perhaps Estimé will see a career-high in carries against the Browns. Or maybe he’ll be relegated to a bit role in a plan that more prominently features McLaughlin or Williams. When it comes to the Broncos’ running game in 2024, there’s no telling until the games unfold. Broncos defensive end Zach Allen missed his first game in two seasons with the Broncos with a heel injury. Allen was seen wearing a walking boot around his right foot and leg before the game. Asked whether there was concern about Allen’s injury being long-term, Payton said, “We should be fine there.” Payton declined to provide any further injury updates, so it’s not yet clear what kind of recovery timeline the Broncos could face with cornerback Riley Moss, who left Sunday’s game with a knee injury and didn’t return. Payton said after the game the injury was to Moss’ MCL and that the second-year player appeared to avoid serious injury. In other injury news, the Broncos must decide by Wednesday whether to activate outside linebacker Drew Sanders to the active roster. Sanders, a second-year player who suffered an Achilles injury in the spring and has spent the season on the physically unable to perform list, had his 21-day window to return started by the team almost three weeks ago. If he’s not activated, Sanders would spend the rest of the season on the PUP list. The Broncos did not activate safety Delarrin Turner-Yell (ACL recovery) at the end of his 21-day window last week, ending his season. The Broncos have one more week to decide whether to activate wide receiver Josh Reynolds (hand) from injured reserve. The team opened a roster spot Monday when it released tight end Greg Dulcich, who had been a healthy scratch on game days since Week 5. Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Juan Martin del Potro reveals injury hell before tennis farewell against Novak Djokovic,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5949141/2024/11/26/juan-martin-del-potro-injuries-final-match-djokovic/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 10:01:19 GMT","The 2009 U.S. Open champion has not played since 2022, enduring several surgeries and constant pain.","Tennis Juan Martin del Potro says he wants to “live my life without pain” as he prepares to face Novak Djokovic in an exhibition match to commemorate the end of his tennis career. Speaking in an eleven-minute interview uploaded to Instagram in advance of their match on December 1 at the Estadio Mary Terán de Weiss in Buenos Aires, del Potro, 36, explained how ongoing surgeries and complications with his right knee have affected his quality of life. Advertisement “I haven’t run, walked up stairs, kicked a ball or played tennis since I was 31,” he said. “Do I spend the next 15 years of my life like this so at 50 they put in a knee replacement and I live okay at 60?” Some doctors have advised the Argentine, who fractured his right patella twice in eight months between 2018 and 2019, to undergo knee replacement surgery now. Del Potro is taking “six to eight pills a day” for pain management, anti-inflammatory treatment and anxiety. “I feel like the knee beat me, and I had eight surgeries,” he said, adding that living life on the sidelines of social sporting occasions like football and padel with friends, “bringing the drinks” and “making the videos” has been torturous. “It’s very hard having to put on a facade 24 hours a day,” he said. Del Potro’s last competitive tennis match was also in Buenos Aires, in the first round of the 2022 Argentina Open against compatriot Federico Delbonis. He had a fifth surgery on his right knee following a 6-1, 6-3 defeat, deciding to keep the procedure private. He would only announce that surgery — and three further procedures — if returned to tennis, he decided, or if it became apparent that there was no realistic hope of returning to competition. “I couldn’t bear the pain in my legs anymore,” he said. Del Potro had four surgeries on his right knee between 2019 and 2021, having first shattered it at the 2018 Shanghai Masters; the second time he slipped on the grass at Queen’s Club, London. He attempted to return to tennis at both the 2021 Tokyo Olympics and U.S. Open, but withdrew from both tournaments before accepting a wildcard into the Argentina Open, where he lost to Delbonis. The greatest moment of Del Potro’s career came in 2009, when he beat Roger Federer for the first time in seven attempts to win the U.S. Open. Coming back from a set and a break down, he inflicted the Swiss’s first defeat at the tournament in six years. Del Potro reached just one more Grand Slam final (the 2018 U.S. Open) despite reaching No. 3 in the world, and is most often figured as one of many male players to run into the ‘Big Three’ of Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic in the late 2000s and 2010s. Advertisement This does not quite tell his story. His 20-51 record against those three and Andy Murray remains one of the best of any player to face all four in their career. He is the only non-European man to win a major since the 2004 French Open (Gaston Gaudio, another Argentine); the 2009 U.S. Open is the only time that all three of the ‘Big Three’ reached the semifinals of a major without one of them winning in the end. He reached that 2018 U.S. Open final, where he lost to Djokovic, after multiple wrist surgeries forced him to remodel his two-handed backhand into a half-baked push. He instead developed a mastery of slice midway through his career that allowed him to claim wins over all three of the ‘Big Three’ following his injuries. Del Potro’s idiosyncratic forehand, with its exaggeratedly high, elongated take back, allowed him to crush the groundstroke with barely any spin but incredible precision, its thunderous power obscuring the preternatural coordination required to hit that sort of shot again and again. Alongside the 2018 U.S. Open final, he successfully returned from those wrist injuries to record a memorable win over Djokovic in the first round of the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, as well as reaching the 2018 French Open semifinal. At the 2012 Olympics he played one of the great semifinals in tennis history against Federer, losing 19-17 in a deciding third set that lasted two hours, 43 minutes. Looking ahead to his match with Djokovic, del Potro said it is “an event to say goodbye.” “If I could at least have a bit of peace in my leg for two or three hours, to enjoy something on a tennis court for the last time, it would be beautiful,” he said.

The Chargers beat the Broncos 23-16 in Denver during Week 6.   Following their loss against Baltimore, Los Angeles is now three full games behind Kansas City for the lead in the AFC West. The Chiefs beat the Panthers Sunday on a last-second field goal and the Broncos beat the Raiders comfortably in Las Vegas.  With the win over the Chargers, the Ravens cut into the Steelers lead in the AFC North, now trailing Pittsburgh by just a single game in the loss column. Pittsburgh lost a snowy affair to the Browns in Cleveland on Thursday Night Football while the Cincinnati Bengals were on a bye.  Getty Images Baltimore's three-headed rushing attack ran rampant over the Los Angeles Chargers tonight.  The Ravens totaled 212 rushing yards on 37 carries, averaging 5.7 yards per rush. Veteran tailback Derrick Henry led the way with 140 yards while Justice Hill added 55 yards, including a 51-yard touchdown.  It marked the fourth time this season that Baltimore rushed for 200+ yards in a game. John Harbaugh's squad now leads the NFL in rushing with 2,162 yards in 12 games.  Advertisement IMAGN Ladd McConkey was the lone bright spot among the Chargers wide receivers tonight.  McConkey registered six catches for 83 yards, continuing a productive rookie season. He's now registered four catches or more in 10 of 11 games this season.  His season totals are up to 49 catches for 698 yards and four touchdowns.   The Baltimore Ravens defense made things tough for Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert as tonight's game went on.  Zachary Orr's defense registered four sacks of Herbert, giving them 39 total this season.  Kyle Van Noy, Brandon Stephens, Josh Tupou, and Odafe Oweh each had one sack on the night.  Baltimore has now recorded the third-most sacks this season, sitting behind the Denver Broncos (44) and Houston Texans (42) for the league lead.   Lamar Jackson's dual-threat abilities helped the Baltimore Ravens pick up a crucial road win in Los Angeles.  Jackson threw two touchdown passes and rushed for one score tonight, marking the sixth time this season that he registered three touchdowns or more in a single game.  It's also the third time in Jackson's seven-year career that he's reached 30 combined touchdowns in a single season.   Justice Hill has been a key receiving threat out of the Ravens backfield this season, but the 27-year-old's longest career run truly iced tonight's win.  Hill's 51-yard scamper with 7:24 to play helped Baltimore ice an eventual 30-23 road win in Los Angeles. Hill's longest rush previously was a 17-yard run against the Dallas Cowboys back in Week 3.  He finished the game with 64 all-purpose yards on five touches.  Getty Images Derrick Henry continues to be a dominant force for the Baltimore Ravens, dicing up the Chargers defense on Monday Night Football. He rushed for 140 yards on 24 carries tonight, averaging 5.8 yards per carry. That said, this was the first game this season that Henry failed to reach the end zone.

Tonight's 30-16 road win for Baltimore marked its fourth victory over Los Angeles out of the past five meetings. It also marked Balitmore's third straight win over the Chargers, which included a 16-13 overtime result in San Diego. Baltimore also leapfrogged Los Angeles into the No. 1 wild card spot in the AFC. The Eagles and Ravens went 2-0 in SoFi this weekend. They’ll meet in Baltimore on Sunday in a Saquon Barkley-Derrick Henry billing straight out of the 2000s.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Auburn claws back for dramatic win over Iowa State to emerge as Maui Invitational frontrunner,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5948710/2024/11/26/auburn-iowa-state-johni-broome-maui-invitational/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 05:11:37 GMT",Auburn trailed by as many as 18 points in the first half before rattling off a 20-4 run out of intermission.,"NCAAM LAHAINA, Hawaii — With one touch, a new tournament frontrunner. With Monday’s Maui Invitational headliner between No. 4 Auburn and No. 5 Iowa State — the type of top-five battle typically reserved for another tournament, that much larger one each March — deadlocked at 81 with under a minute to play, the game could’ve gone either way. Iowa State had the ball, and put it in the hands of its best player all afternoon: guard Keshon Gilbert, the hot knife slicing through Auburn’s vaunted defense all day long. Advertisement But as Gilbert drove for the would-be game-winner, he lost his dribble and turned the ball over — and Auburn was off to the races, flying on the fast break with a chance to fully close the door. Denver Jones drove, but his layup clanked off the rim, and floated back down to a mass of men all scrambling to get a hand on the loose ball. Johni Broome — Auburn’s best player, its All-American center — won out. And so did the Tigers. Top 5 Dub 🥶 pic.twitter.com/g7E3pd4raI — Auburn Basketball (@AuburnMBB) November 26, 2024  Broome’s offensive putback, which sent him careening across the Lahaina Civic Center court on his back, proved to be the decisive bucket in Auburn’s narrow 83-81 victory. “Coach wanted a simple high ball screen with me and Denver,” Broome said. “Me and Denver is down there, we’re two animals, and he got on a run — and I let God do the rest.” For the second time on the first day of Feast Week, a battle of big-time brands more than lived up to its billing. By virtue of its victory, Auburn now has two top-five regular-season wins for the first time ever — setting the stage for a potentially special season in Alabama. “To this point, we’ve made history,” Auburn coach Bruce Pearl said. “That there is as good a win as we’re going to see, and as good a game.” Early on, it looked like a much-hyped game might become a much-maligned letdown, as the Tigers looked completely out of sorts trying to handle Iowa State’s pressing defense. T.J. Otzelberger’s team did everything it could to make life difficult on the Tigers, forcing turnovers (seven) and converting them into points (11) on the other end. And when starting forward Chad Baker-Mazara exited the game with a knee injury midway through the first 20 minutes, matters only seemed worse. Pearl’s team rattled off a 10-2 run right before halftime, which kept the game within striking distance, but ISU answered — as it did all afternoon — with a 6-0 sprint of its own to make a 16-point halftime margin. Advertisement “When you’re up the way we were,” Otzelberger said, “you want to try to finish.” Instead, it was like the teams body-swapped at the break: Auburn suddenly unable to miss, and Iowa State’s defense having taken its foot off the gas. The Tigers rattled off a 20-4 run out of intermission, even against a Cyclones defense that might be the best in the country. Iowa State missed nine of its first 10 shots after the break, as War Eagle chants rang out in the Civic Center. Much of that run was fueled by Baker-Mazara, whose back-to-back 3s in the span of 33 seconds shrank ISU’s 10-point lead down to a much more manageable four. Otzelberger called timeout after the second one fell, but any grasp it held on the game was gone by then. “No. 10,” Iowa State guard Curtis Jones said of Baker-Mazara postgame. “He got hot.” That Baker-Mazara balled out that way, after banging knees in the first half, showcased the kind of toughness that has defined Auburn during Pearl’s tenure.“I always say my mama raised a warrior,” Baker-Mazara said. “If I’m not dead, I’m going out there.” After only allowing 0.900 PPP in the first half, Iowa State let Auburn score 1.471 PPP in the final 20 minutes — not far off the 1.485 PPP the Cyclones themselves scored in the first half. Still, the Tigers could never fully close the gap, as Iowa State — usually Gilbert, specifically, who finished with a game-high 23 points — always seemed to muster an answer despite its struggles otherwise. Auburn didn’t actually take its first lead of the game until a pair of Jones free-throws with 4:01 to play. And from then on, the Cyclones and Tigers slugged it out, trading blows and tough baskets. Iowa State briefly reclaimed the lead late, when Gilbert’s final two points — a pair of free-throws — put the Cyclones up 81-79 with 50 seconds left. But this time, it was Auburn with the answer: Dylan Cardwell found a cutting Miles Kelly inside for a layup, setting the stage for the pivotal last 30 seconds. Advertisement Otzelberger called timeout with 31.2 ticks left, to set up a potential game-winner of his own. “Wanted to get (Gilbert) in space going with his right hand, and tried to create contact and get in the paint and to the rim,” he said, “and just weren’t fortunate enough.” As Gilbert ran into Broome, he turned it over, at which point Auburn had about 10 seconds to make its move. Jones driving first turned out to be for the best — it allowed Broome to get back into the play, and have momentum behind him for his leap through traffic. After his tip went in, Iowa State didn’t even have time to inbound the ball and get off a final heave. Not only did Broome score that final bucket, he also led the team in scoring with 21 points, plus a game-high 10 rebounds. Baker-Mazara chipped in 18, too — 16 of which came after halftime — and freshman guard Tahaad Pettiford poured in 14 off the bench. In addition to Gilbert’s 23, fellow ISU guards Curtis Jones and Tamin Lipsey combined for 20 points, seven rebounds and five assists; although they went 2-for-9 from 3. Auburn advances to play the winner of North Carolina and Dayton in the semifinals, while Iowa State becomes the second top-five team of the day to end up in the consolation bracket. The Cyclones wasted no time setting the tone defensively, forcing three Auburn turnovers in the first five minutes and visibly frustrating multiple Tigers players. Maybe that shouldn’t be so surprising — ISU entered the game fourth in KenPom’s adjusted defensive efficiency rankings, keyed by the nation’s best turnover rate and 12th-best effective field goal defense — but… well, teams don’t usually bottle up Auburn like that. Bruce Pearl’s team entered Monday’s game tops in the nation in effective field goal percentage and 2-point percentage, with six different players ranking in the top-250 nationally in offensive rating. It is as versatile and efficient as any team in the country — or, at least it had been, until the Cyclones arrived. Auburn’s 10-2 run late in the first half was the only reason ISU didn’t lead by 20 or more at the break. All the statistical indicators backed up the eye test, too. Auburn entered Monday averaging 41 paint points per game, per CBB Analytics… and scored a whopping 14 in the first half. Meanwhile, Iowa State did what it traditionally does: force turnovers and convert them into points on the other end. “To put 49 on us in the first half,” Pearl said, “we didn’t play very well, but they played great.” Advertisement But you can only keep Auburn down for so long. Houston found that out a few weeks ago, and now it was Iowa State’s turn. The Tigers flipped whatever metaphorical switch they could in the halftime locker room, and raced out to a monstrous 20-4 run to start the second half, completely erasing ISU’s 16-point advantage.The differences? For starters, Auburn took much better care of the ball in the second half, with its five turnovers only leading to eight Iowa State points. And while the Tigers shot 54.5 percent in the second half, they also cleaned up their misses as well as possible, with 11 second-chance points to none for ISU. It took time to climb back from such a deficit, but the Tigers stayed the course, and ultimately deserved to come out on top. “They were the more physical team in the second half, and that showed up in a lot of areas, but specifically on the glass and their ability to get to the offensive glass,” Otzelberger said. “Certainly that last play is a microcosm of that.” When Pettiford, the hero of Auburn’s road win versus Houston, entered early in the first half, he immediately put his big-game pants back on and drained a triple. He finished the first half with 10 points, half of Auburn’s four 3s, and was one of the few Tigers willing to throw his body into the meat grinder that is the Cyclones’ D. And while Broome wasn’t his best, he got to the free-throw line, at least, scoring half of his 10 points at the charity stripe (and three of the other five on one top-of-the-key 3). But otherwise? Pearl’s team desperately needed someone to step up. Everyone not named Pettiford or Broome combined to score just 13 points, with more turnovers (six) than made baskets (five). Alexa, play Chad Baker-Mazara’s music. Baker-Mazara’s first half? Forgettable. As many turnovers (two) as points. And with about nine and a half minutes before halftime, he crumpled to the court holding his right knee, obviously in serious pain. He even jumped off the floor on one leg, so as not to put pressure on the bad knee. He did not return for the rest of the first half. But after intermission? Baker-Mazara was right back out there — and Auburn couldn’t have come back from down 16 points without him. As the Tigers rattled off a 20-4 run to start the second half, CBM was everywhere, canning two critical 3-pointers (one of which was an and-1) and putting much-needed pressure on the center of ISU’s defense. He ultimately scored 16 of his eventual 18 points after halftime, surpassing his previous season-high in less than 12 minutes of second-half action. “I was never really worried about him. I know he’s a fighter,” Broome said. “At halftime I talked to him, and he said he was going back out there, and throughout the second half, he said, ‘I got you.’” CBM😳 pic.twitter.com/3dNqTYwdRH — Auburn Basketball (@AuburnMBB) November 26, 2024  We’ll find out over the next two days, especially if the Tigers end up playing No. 12 North Carolina in the semifinals on Tuesday — and possibly Memphis thereafter, after those Tigers took down No. 2 UConn earlier Monday, announcing themselves as legitimate top-25 contenders in the process. And the rest of Feast Week will teach us plenty, too. Duke versus Kansas and Houston versus Alabama definitely await, and those results will lead to more top-10 rankings movement, too. Gonzaga, Arizona, and Indiana all bang around in the Bahamas. Any of those teams could emerge as Final Four frontrunner depending on how this week goes, the first time many of those teams are facing other high-major sides. Advertisement But at this juncture? With wins over Houston and Iowa State, one on the road and one on a neutral court? It’s hard to tap anyone but Auburn as the nation’s No. 1 team at the end of Monday night. The Tigers proved they can win with defense, as they did against Houston, and they can even surmount an offensive charge like they did in the second half versus Iowa State’s top-five defense. Not many teams would be able to win one of those games, not to mention both. Pearl’s team has the ideal blend of versatility, depth and experience — with Broome as a centerpiece tying it all together. Even if the Tigers lose later this week, they’re clearly one of America’s best teams. (Photo: Darryl Oumi/ Getty Images)  Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Derrick Henry did most of the damage in Baltimore’s bounce-back effort, posting his sixth 100-yard outing of the season after being held to under 70 rushing yards in each of the last two games. Advertisement The Chargers entered Monday surrendering the fewest points per game (14.5) in the NFL but saw their four-game winning streak snapped while allowing 30 points for the first time this season. A lack of running game didn’t help the Chargers, as leading rusher J.K. Dobbins exited with a left knee injury and didn’t play in the second half. Ravens coach John Harbaugh is now 3-0 all-time versus his younger brother, with Monday’s victory over Jim’s Chargers added to wins over his San Francisco 49ers in 2011 and in the 2013 Super Bowl.

He’s improved significantly in that area this year. However, the Ravens are still at their best when they are getting downhill with their running game. After getting off to a sluggish start offensively, the Ravens established their run game on their first drive of the second quarter and it was the difference in the game. They scored touchdowns on four of their next four drives and kicked a field goal on the other one. The Chargers play light boxes the second-most in the NFL and it was a question coming into the game about how they’d hold up to Baltimore’s physicality. The Ravens seemed to wear them down as the game went on. — Jeff Zrebiec, Ravens beat writer The Chargers defense had no answer for Henry, and that was ultimately the difference. They missed linebacker Denzel Perryman in the middle of the defense, and they just did not have the physicality to match up with Henry’s size and power. They lost the line-of-scrimmage battle. They did not tackle well at the second level or on the edges. Henry finished with 140 yards on 24 carries. The Ravens finished with those 212 yards on 37 carries, and only 15 of those yards came from Jackson. Advertisement The Chargers actually had a good plan and executed well against Jackson as a runner, both on designed rushes and scrambles. But the Ravens did not even need those components of their multi-pronged offensive attack. The Chargers defense never felt as good as the statistics showed. And after not giving up more than 20 points to any offense in their first nine games, the Chargers have given up 27 points to the Bengals and now 30 to the Ravens in the last two weeks. The final blow Monday night was a 51-yard rushing touchdown from Justice Hill with under eight minutes to play. — Daniel Popper, Chargers beat writer JUSTICE HILL. 51 YARDS. GONE. 📺: #BALvsLAC on ESPN/ABC📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/DfWCTj2kNO — NFL (@NFL) November 26, 2024  The key play in the game may have been a 2-yard run by a tight end. With the Ravens facing a fourth-and-1 at their own 16 after the two-minute warning in the second quarter, Harbaugh sent his offense back on the field after the stoppage. Tight end Mark Andrews took the direct snap and picked up the first down. Three plays and one defensive pass interference penalty later, the Ravens reached the end zone when Jackson hit Rashod Bateman for a 40-yard score. The Ravens went for a fourth down on two other occasions on a drive that started in the third quarter and they got a touchdown on that drive, too. Harbaugh is well aware of his defense’s struggles to get stops. He knows his offense has to put up points. His aggressive decision making was a catalyst in them doing so Monday. — Zrebiec GO DEEPER Inside the Harbaugh coaching universe: 'You just want to be attached to that' The Chargers were in this game in the fourth quarter, trailing by seven points. A Quentin Johnston drop was the inflection point. Facing a third-and-6, Johnston was wide open on a crosser. Quarterback Justin Herbert put the ball on him and Johnston could not come down with a catch. This resulted in a three-and-out, and the Chargers punted. Johnston has been an improved player this season, but his hands remain a problem. Advertisement Hill’s touchdown came on the next drive. The offense needed to possess the ball and give the defense a rest, but that did not happen, and the Ravens dominated the time of possession in the second half. The Chargers only had two drives before Baltimore extended its lead to two possessions. The third drive was derailed when the Chargers offensive line was beat on a stunt for a sack. Second-half performance is a very concerning trend for Chargers offensive coordinator Greg Roman’s unit. L.A. is averaging 8.3 points in second halves this season, 28th in the NFL, according to TruMedia. The Chargers only had three second-half points Monday night until a garbage-time TD. — Popper (Photo: Ronald Martinez / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Patrol officers say they initiated an enforcement stop after observing a white Dodge sedan traveling over 100 miles per hour on the US-101 freeway south of Tampa Avenue. Advertisement Robinson was cited and then released to a “responsible party,” according to the release. Head coach Sean McVay said Tuesday morning that the Rams were in the process of “gathering information” about the situation, which he said he became aware of on Monday afternoon. The Rams also notified the league about the matter. McVay said he had not yet made any determination about Robinson’s status for Sunday’s Week 13 game at New Orleans but expected to do so over the next day or two. “Before I comment or commit to one thing, I do want to make sure that I have all of the appropriate and accurate information,” he said, “but what I will say is (that) anytime you do things like that, that is not in alignment with what we want to be about, I want to understand all of the facts that are involved. You want to demonstrate grace but also the severity and the seriousness of what could have occurred, especially if it relates to affecting yourself or anyone else in a negative way.” McVay also said that the report of the vehicle’s speed was “concerning.” “Obviously we expect better from him,” said McVay, “and we want to continue to gather all of the appropriate information with the legal things that are involved in that. …We obviously have higher standards (of) what we expect of him and the decision-making process as those things are concerned.” Patrol officers said that after they stopped the car, Robinson identified himself as “an active player for the Los Angeles Rams,” according to the release. Officers said they observed “objective signs and symptoms of alcohol impairment.” McVay said that Rams players have team resources if ever impaired by a substance that are in place to prevent them from getting behind the wheel. Players are informed of those resources, such as drivers or car services, during the onboarding process each year. Robinson, 30, was signed by the Rams in 2023. He has caught six touchdowns this season, which is a career high. (Photo: Steph Chambers / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Six of those men were accused of assault and disorderly conduct.,"NHL Popular hockey podcaster, broadcaster and former NHL player Paul Bissonnette was taken to a hospital Sunday after getting attacked by several men at a family restaurant in Scottsdale, Ariz. In a three-minute video posted to X, Bissonnette said the altercation took place inside and outside of Houston’s restaurant after he observed a group of guests cause issues with the restaurant manager. The 39-year-old Bissonnette said he is a regular diner at the establishment and attempted to intervene after a member of the group laid his hands on the manager. Advertisement “You could tell he was a little shocked and surprised and stunned,” said Bissonnette. “It’s a family restaurant. I don’t think there was anybody in there who could go maybe like help him out. I went over, I just grabbed the guy’s arm that was on him. I said, ‘Sir, if you continue to harass and assault the staff, we’re going to have problems.’ “And then they just started chucking, so it escalated extremely quickly.” Bissonnette said he fought with seven people in total. Six of those men were arrested and charged with assault and disorderly conduct, according to the Scottsdale Police Department. Police confirmed Bissonnette’s account in a statement to The Athletic, describing an altercation that “escalated to the men assaulting Paul Bissonnette both inside and outside of the restaurant.” That group knocked the former NHL tough guy to the ground on a couple of occasions, according to Bissonnette, but he didn’t lose consciousness. He thanked police and hospital staff for their quick response and care. “All is good, guys,” said Bissonnette. “It sucks. I got (kicked) in the face a couple times, but it could have been a lot worse.” Bissonnette is part of the “Spittin’ Chiclets” podcast and detailed his experience on an episode scheduled to be released Tuesday. He’s also a panelist on TNT’s national television coverage and indicated that he would be in the studio for Wednesday’s doubleheader. The veteran of 202 career NHL games with Pittsburgh and Phoenix was clearly shaken by the altercation with a group of men he believed had been golfing earlier in the day. “Just bad dudes,” said Bissonnette. “Way too drunk, and I don’t know what else they had in their system. Yeah, I’m very, very angry at these guys and kind of want their names out there and want them to pay the piper. Just unacceptable behavior at a family restaurant just because they couldn’t grab another cocktail and didn’t want to hear ‘No’ for an answer.” Police have not identified those arrested. As scary as the situation was, Bissonnette felt he held his own in an outnumbered situation. “Took some,” he said. “Gave more.” (Photo: Cliff Hawkins / Getty Images for The Match) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Are the 49ers out of time? Jake Moody slipped on the opening kickoff. Deebo Samuel Sr. and Eric Saubert slipped while running routes. Brandon Allen slipped three times, resulting in a near-fumble, an incompletion and an actual fumble. “Yeah, it started snowing, raining, whatever, in the second half a little bit, so it just made it a little bit slicker, and it kind of killed us on one play where I could have got it to JJ (Jauan Jennings),” Allen said. “I started slipping on it, and then the fumble. That one is so on top of my mind right now.” Astute fans might remember that the San Francisco 49ers had slipping issues the last time the teams played, in the 2023 divisional round of the playoffs at a wet Levi’s Stadium. As was the case in January, the 49ers had all sorts of footing issues, but the Green Bay Packers had none. “There were definitely issues with the footing,” coach Kyle Shanahan said Monday. “It happened to our quarterback on a number of plays, but it happened to a bunch of guys throughout the game. Guys were fixing their cleats. Some did it pregame, some did right after the game (started). But that’s an issue at Lambeau that time of year.” The Packers had a 2-to-1 advantage in time of possession at halftime and finished with an advantage of 36:43 to 23:17. Thanks to two fumbles, an interception and two turnovers on downs, Green Bay’s average starting position was its own 44. The 49ers’ was their own 25.

Our writers react: Mike Jones: Entering the season, it seemed realistic to expect the Texans to take another step forward after last year’s success. I never saw them as a team capable of challenging for the AFC title, but improvement certainly was realistic. Instead, this team has seemed off all season. Maybe it’s a sophomore slump, maybe it’s C.J. Stroud struggling with the weight of expectations, but he hasn’t been as consistently effective this season. Injuries at wide receiver have hurt; so too has the continued struggles of the offensive line. The defensive struggles are a bit perplexing. And that’s a lot to have to clean up over the next several weeks if the Texans aim to contend in the AFC. They’ll still win their division, but they’re just not on the level of Kansas City, Buffalo, Baltimore or Pittsburgh. So, I don’t view the Texans as legit AFC title contenders. Dan Pompei: The Texans are not the quality of team most of us thought they would be. They’ve had two bad losses now, to the Jets and Titans. They will have a chance to change the narrative of their season, however. They have huge games remaining against the Chiefs and Ravens — wins would put this team in a different light. But given they have had difficulty winning the games they are supposed to win, you have to wonder if they will defeat the Jaguars, Dolphins and Titans. Unless their offensive line makes significant improvements, which is unlikely, the Texans will probably have a disappointing finish. Ted Nguyen: All year, there were signs the Texans offense was deeply flawed despite their weapons on the outside. Their offensive line is one of the worst in football. They can’t run-block, so Stroud is forced into a lot of third-and-longs — but they also can’t pass-block, so Stroud has to deal with a lot of pressure in passing situations. Early in the season Stroud was able to play hero ball, but that was unsustainable. On the final drive, with the Texans down three points, Stroud was under siege. I’m not sure how much this offensive line can improve. The offense still has big-play ability but the negative plays caused by the line issues are a lot to overcome. GO FURTHER NFL Week 12 takeaways: Is the Commanders offense collapsing? Are the 49ers out of time? (Getty Images)              The Washington Commanders may need to snap their three-game losing streak without a trio of offensive starters. Running backs Austin Ekeler and Brian Robinson, and right tackle Andrew Wylie were injured during Sunday’s surprising 34-26 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. Updates from head coach Dan Quinn on Monday afternoon suggest uncertain status for each player in the Week 13 home game against the Tennessee Titans. Ekeler, along with Wylie, is in concussion protocol. The running back took a blow while returning a kickoff in the final moments of Washington’s failed comeback. Down on the field for several minutes, Ekeler walked off the field wobbly. The team sent him to the hospital following the game for observations. Scans came back,” good,” Quinn said after visiting earlier on Monday with Washington’s third-leading rusher (355 yards) and receiver (33 catches). Ekeler previously sat out one game after a concussion in the Week 3 victory over Cincinnati. Having already missed three games with hamstring and knee injuries and limited in another, Robinson only received five carries after suffering an ankle injury on Washington’s opening drive. The power back received treatment on Monday. “We'll see how much work he does during the week,” Quinn said. “I'll have a better sense …  as we get further along.” The 7-5 Commanders are 2-3 in games either without Robinson or when he carries the ball less than 10 times. Should Ekeler or Robinson miss the upcoming home game against the Titans, Jeremy McNichols is the only active running back on the roster. Washington released Chris Rodriguez this weekend to open a roster spot. Rodriguez offers the best chance to replace Robinson’s interior running if he re-signs to the practice squad. GO FURTHER The Commanders split apart on the field Sunday, continuing an ill-timed reversal of fortune When the Baltimore Ravens met as a team in preparation for Monday night’s game against the Los Angeles Chargers, coach John Harbaugh wanted to get ahead of the most prominent storyline of the week. Yes, the Chargers are coached by Jim Harbaugh, John’s younger brother. And yes, the connections between the two franchises run deep. The Chargers’ front office, coaching staff and roster is loaded with former Ravens. Yet, John wanted his players to know that none of that mattered inside the building this week. “We’ve told some stories in the past, but not this week,” Harbaugh said. “Really this week, for the players and the coaches, it’s not about that. We have such a challenge. The challenge is playing the game. Getting in that game and playing that game against that team is the biggest challenge you could have, and that’s what everybody is focused on.” Harbaugh’s Ravens are 7-4 after last weekend’s deflating defeat by the Pittsburgh Steelers. Issues with penalties and their normally reliable kicker, and injuries in the middle of their defense, are concerns for the Ravens, who have two tough games in six days. A loss by the Steelers (8-3) to the Cleveland Browns on Thursday keeps the Ravens in striking distance of first place in the AFC North. Yet, a second consecutive defeat Monday would be damaging, particularly with the Philadelphia Eagles arriving in Baltimore on a short week for a game Sunday. The third matchup between the head-coaching brothers — John won the first two, including a victory over Jim’s San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII nearly a dozen years ago — comes at a time when the Chargers have rattled off four consecutive wins to emerge as contenders in the AFC.

Two meager wins and nine disappointing losses for the frustrations of a season to boil over for New York Giants rookie wide receiver Malik Nabers. It took 11 games for the rookie to be ready to stand at his locker and spill to reporters how disgusted he felt after yet another Giants defeat, their sixth straight. The overall message wasn’t surprising — “I’m tired of going out there and losing” — but the rookie didn’t mince words when asked how he’d describe the team’s effort during Sunday’s 30-7 drubbing at the hands of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. “Soft as f—,” said the No. 6 pick in the 2024 draft. To be clear, Nabers wasn’t the only person in the Giants locker room delivering scathing remarks about the team’s poor performance Sunday. “We played soft,” team captain Dexter Lawrence said. “And they beat the s— out of us today.” That Nabers was among the players speaking out only demonstrates how far off the rails this season has gone. The receiver was selected out of LSU to help lift the Giants offense and lend it a new explosive dynamic. Instead, the Giants offense has become the league’s worst, and Nabers is fed up with it. Read more here. GO FURTHER Giants’ Malik Nabers is ‘tired of losing,’ sick of trying to explain why offense is inept The New York Jets’ roots as a brash and unapologetic upstart, cemented by Joe Namath’s Super Bowl III bravado, differentiated them from the old-guard New York Giants for decades. When the Jets had bombastic and playful Rex Ryan as their coach, the Giants had stern taskmaster Tom Coughlin. When the Jets were going all-in on the polarizing Aaron Rodgers, the Giants were hoping the fifth and sixth seasons of nice guy Daniel Jones might turn out differently. If the Jets aspired to be cryptocurrency, the Giants hoped to be the S&P 500. What’s the difference when both are competitively bankrupt? The Pick Six column leads this week by examining how the Giants resemble the Jets, in results if not always process.

It’s getting harder to tell: Sando’s Pick Six (Getty Images)              The Indianapolis Colts are one game away from entering their Week 14 bye. The time away should help them refocus over the final stretch of what’s shaping up to be an eventful conclusion to the regular season. It’s not just that the Colts, despite losing four of their past five games, remain in the playoff hunt. It’s that the teams they’ll face down the stretch give them a realistic shot to earn their first postseason berth since 2020. Indianapolis’ final five games feature matchups against the Patriots, Broncos, Titans, Giants and Jaguars. Excluding Denver, which is 7-5, the other four opponents are a combined 10-35. In other words, these are very winnable games. Of course, the Colts still have their own issues to figure out if they hope to take advantage of their soft schedule. Quarterback Anthony Richardson has played better since returning from his benching, but the offensive line has struggled, running back Jonathan Taylor has become a non-factor, and too much is being asked of a middling defense that was bad to start the season but has made significant strides to give Indianapolis chances it keeps squandering. So, now I’ll turn it over to you. What’s on your mind amid yet another up-and-down Colts campaign?

I don’t know any other way to go about it,"" Rams coach Sean McVay said after the Eagles beat them up Sunday. ""Sunday Night Football"" live blog GO FURTHER Rams can’t run with the big-time postseason teams if they can get run over (Getty Images)              Indianapolis Colts wide receiver Josh Downs sustained a right shoulder injury in his team’s loss to the Detroit Lions on Sunday, and he is considered week-to-week, a league source told The Athletic on Monday. Downs’ availability for next week’s game at New England is also in question, though the belief is that he did not suffer a severe injury. Downs got hurt after making a 7-yard catch and being tackled with about 11 minutes left in Sunday’s game. His right shoulder appeared to be driven into the turf as Lions linebackers Malcolm Rodriguez and David Long Jr. took him to the ground. Downs immediately grabbed at his right shoulder and stayed down before eventually getting up and walking off the field. He reentered the game on the Colts’ next series and wound up playing 29 of a possible 55 offensive snaps. Indianapolis could choose to be cautious with Downs since it only has one game left before its bye week. If Downs is held out against the Patriots, it would be a significant blow to the Colts’ offense. The second-year pro missed the first two games of the season due to a right high ankle sprain, but he still leads Indianapolis in targets (78), catches (53) and receiving yards per game (59.4). Downs is also tied with fellow wideout Alec Pierce for the team-high in receiving touchdowns (four). Pierce got banged up as well in the second half of Sunday’s contest. He had his right ankle re-taped by trainers on the sideline, and he was walking gingerly in the locker room after the game. Despite his gait, Pierce is “good,” a league source told The Athletic, and there’s no reason to be overly concerned about his status moving forward. Pierce is averaging a league-high 23.3 yards per catch this season. NFL Network's Ian Rapoport first reported the news of Downs' shoulder injury. GO FURTHER Colts ask too much of QB Anthony Richardson in sloppy loss to Lions After a hot start with Russell Wilson, the Steelers' offense has hit a rut. Let's take a closer look at which areas need improvements. 8 — times sacked Even though the Steelers have invested heavily in their offensive line, they have not done a great job of protecting the quarterback at any point this season. Through the first nine games, they allowed 2.67 sacks per game, tied for the 11th most. Over the last two games? That’s jumped up to four sacks per game. The underlying numbers have also regressed. Over the first nine games, the Steelers allowed a sack on 8.9 percent of dropbacks (ninth-highest rate) and pressure on 38.6 percent of snaps (fifth-highest). Over the last two, that’s up to 11 percent and 40 percent, respectively. When it comes to identifying the problem, it’s really been a mix of everything. In some instances, individual players have been exposed. Both offensive tackles, in particular, have had their rough moments. Other times, the Steelers haven’t adapted well to the opponent’s schematics. For example, the Browns confused the Steelers’ offensive line with several stunts, including when Myles Garrett twisted inside to blow right past center Zach Frazier. It was one of the few times in his young career Frazier has looked like a rookie. There have also been several times when Wilson has held the ball too long. He led the league in sacks taken in two of the previous five seasons. The Steelers will need to reverse this trend, or the offense might continue to sputter. Read here for more stats. GO FURTHER Explaining the Steelers’ 7 touchdown-less quarters with 7 stats LANDOVER, Md. — Sunday’s game puts you in a strange spot as a fan. At 3-7, you assume your team’s season is over, so a part of you wants as many losses as possible, leading to the highest possible draft pick. But then your fandom kicks in. Your team has a chance to win a game they entered as double-digit underdogs. The Dallas Cowboys outlasted the Commanders in a wild finish Sunday at Washington. It ended Dallas’ five-game losing streak, its longest in the last nine years. But it also provided a significant blow to those who were hoping for a chance at the No. 1 overall pick. And by the looks of the rest of the schedule, it’s unlikely that the Cowboys will end up in the top 5 and maybe not the top 10. According to Tankathon.com, if the season ended today, Dallas would have the 11th overall pick. Heading into Sunday’s game, the Cowboys had worked their way up to ninth, a game and a half back of No. 1 overall. They’re now two games back of the Jacksonville Jaguars, New York Giants and Las Vegas Raiders, who all seem committed to legitimately competing for No. 1 overall. Of the 10 teams currently ahead of the Cowboys, three are still remaining on Dallas’ schedule: Thursday vs. the Giants (currently picking second), Week 14 vs. the Cincinnati Bengals (10th) and Week 15 at the Carolina Panthers (fifth).

Smith, who is a four-time All-Pro, did not practice all week and will miss the game with a hamstring injury. The 27-year-old leads the team in tackles with 110 — which ranks third in the NFL — and also has one interception, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery. As Baltimore’s left inside linebacker in its 3-4 alignment, he is a key cog in the defensive scheme and serves as the team’s signal caller. In his seven seasons with Baltimore and the Chicago Bears, Smith has never had less than 101 tackles. GO DEEPER Inside the Harbaugh coaching universe: 'You just want to be attached to that' With Smith out, safety Kyle Hamilton is expected to wear the green dot and relay the defensive calls, but it will be much tougher to replace Smith’s production. Defensive coordinator Zach Orr said the Ravens will replace Smith “by committee,” which presumably means that Malik Harrison will play primarily on run downs and Chris Board will be in on passing downs. Both are more known for their special teams play. Advertisement The 7-4 Ravens have allowed more passing yards between the numbers (1,794 passing yards and a 75.8 completion percentage) than any team in football. Baltimore enters Monday night’s game 25th in yards allowed per game (362.0) and 23rd in points allowed per game (24.6). The Ravens are also 27th in first downs allowed per game (21.2). Without Smith, the Chargers can further exploit what’s already a Ravens’ weakness. Quarterback Justin Herbert hasn’t been ultra-aggressive in attacking the middle this season, but he has the offensive coordinator (Greg Roman) and the inside assets (Ladd McConkey and Will Dissly) to do it. ESPN was first to report that Smith was unlikely to play in Monday’s game. (Photo: Patrick Smith / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The announcement comes after police detained and then released Williams on Oct. 8 over a gun found in a vehicle he was traveling in during a traffic stop. During the incident, Williams was nearly brought to jail for lacking a concealed pistol license (CPL) for a gun found in the car his brother was driving during a traffic stop. The decision not to bring Williams to jail spurred an investigation weeks later. Advertisement On Monday, Worthy’s office said the law is not clear enough to charge the receiver, as Williams’ brother — who did have a concealed pistol license — was driving the car. Worthy added that if Williams “had the gun on his person, he would have been charged.” “The CPL holder here was the driver and had care, custody and control of the car,” Worthy said, adding, “I urge the legislature to immediately look closely at this law so that the prosecutors in Michigan can have steady and meaningful guidance in the future.” Williams’ lawyer, Todd Flood, praised the outcome Monday. “Although this decision was grounded in facts and the current state of the law, my client is thankful and humbled by the hard work Kym Worthy and her team put into this matter,” Flood said. “This has been a trying time for Mr. Williams. Mr. Williams understands that being a professional athlete carries with it a responsibility to lead with character and professionalism. This is especially true when being blessed to be a member of the Detroit Lions.” The situation occurred on Oct. 8, when Detroit police pulled over Williams and his brother for speeding and driving “in an unsafe manner,” according to the statement from Worthy’s office. Williams’ brother, who was driving at the time, informed the officer about two guns in the car, one registered to each of them. The officer then cited Williams’ brother for traffic violations and handcuffed Williams who, unlike his brother, lacked a concealed pistol license. But after a phone conversation between a sergeant at the scene and a lieutenant, police released Williams, according to reporting by 7 News Detroit. The Detroit Police Department later began an internal probe into why officers released the wide receiver after initially indicating they would take him to jail. Advertisement Worthy denied any special treatment in the decision not to issue charges. “We have looked at this case thoroughly and objectively,” she said. “We did not consider that Mr. Williams is a Detroit professional athlete in our decision making. We have charged Detroit area athletes before and would not have hesitated to do so again if the facts of this case could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. When it comes to charging decisions, we do not take into consideration who the potential defendant is, how much power and influence they have, or how beloved they may be. We deal with the facts and the law only.” In a statement Monday, the Detroit Police Department thanked the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office “for their thoughtful deliberation of this complex legal matter.” “This case illustrates just how challenging on-scene arrest determinations and subsequent charging decisions can be in new and unique situations, such as the one here,” the department said. “While no charges will be issued in this case, as an agency, we echo Prosecutor Worthy’s sentiment that no one is above the law.” (Photo: Kevin Jairaj / Imagn Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

An instant classic. But at the end of 45 back-and-forth minutes — which featured an 18-5 UConn run to end regulation; a buzzer-beating 3 by Solo Ball to force overtime; offsetting technical fouls due to a shoving match in overtime; another technical foul on Huskies coach Dan Hurley for calling officials a “f—ing joke”; Memphis making seven of its last eight free throws, six by PJ Carter; and UConn airballing its desperation 3-point heave as time expired — Memphis outlasted No. 2 UConn 99-97 to snap the longest winning streak in Division I at 17 games, dealing the two-time defending national champs their first loss since Feb. 20. Advertisement And that was all before lunchtime locally. Turns out the Maui Invitational did miss the Lahaina Civic Center. The tournament’s triumphant return to its longtime home, after moving to Honolulu last year in the wake of the August 2023 wildfires, more than delivered. The controversial deciding moment in the game came with 40 seconds left in overtime, with the score tied at 92. UConn wing Liam McNeeley was whistled for an over-the-back foul while trying to high-point an offensive rebound, and the call sent Hurley into a volcanic frenzy, with ESPN cameras capturing him cursing at officials as he stormed down the sideline. Hurley even fell on the floor amidst all the antics. “For that call to be made at that point of the game was a complete joke,” Hurley said after the game. “For me, I don’t know what happened. I might have lost my balance by the absurdity of the call, or maybe I tripped. But if I made that call at that moment, I would have ignored the fact that I was on my back — if I made that call.” Hurley was quickly called for a technical foul (but not tossed from the game), giving Memphis four free throws instead of the two it received from McNeeley’s initial foul. Senior guard PJ Carter then proceeded to sink all four shots from the charity stripe, giving Memphis the four-point margin it needed to ride out the rest of overtime. “As soon as they got the tech, we sent PJ right to the line,” said Memphis guard Tyrese Hunter, who finished with a team-high 26 points. “We know what he’s capable of.” The closest UConn got thereafter was when Memphis’ Colby Rogers — whose clutch 3-pointer tied the game at 92, right before Hurley’s tech — missed one of his two free throws late, making it a three-point game with about six seconds left. Memphis then fouled UConn guard Hassan Diarra, who made his first from the charity stripe but missed his second. The Huskies didn’t firmly grab the offensive rebound, though, and their final heave was nowhere close to a real shot. Advertisement Memphis coach Penny Hardaway said postgame this was the biggest win of his six-year tenure. “That was back-to-back national champions,” Hardaway said. “I’m actually not taking any of this for granted, because I know how hard it is to win, and especially beat a team like that.” In addition to leading Memphis in scoring, Hunter hit seven 3-pointers, tying a career high. UConn’s Solo Ball hit a 3-pointer with 1.2 seconds left in regulation to cap a frantic comeback attempt and finished with 10 points, but he fouled out in overtime, one of three Huskies who ended the game stuck to the pine. Tarris Reed Jr., the Michigan transfer who set a new season high with 22 points, led UConn in scoring, while Alex Karaban’s four 3-pointers were critical to the game even making it past regulation. When Hunter hit his seventh 3 with 8:35 left, putting Memphis up 10, it seemed like the Huskies might lose big, if they did indeed lose their first nonconference game since last season’s epic against Kansas in Allen Fieldhouse. “It’s on my shoulders completely, 100 percent my shoulders: how the team responds, how the team acts, how we watch film, how we do everything in general,” Karaban said. “I’ve got to continue to do a better job of that.” But the Huskies’ response was impressive, with Karaban and McNeeley’s 3-point shooting pulling them back into it. Memphis, meanwhile, didn’t make a field goal over the final four minutes of regulation, daring the Huskies to get back in the game. And as if the Maui Invitational opener needed any more theatrics, the reason UConn got one last look to send the game to an extra session? Memphis was called for a 10-second violation with 14.2 seconds left, setting up Ball’s big-time 3. In overtime, both teams traded baskets to start, but hoops eventually gave way to hysteria when Memphis bigs Moussa Cisse and Dain Dainja got into an altercation with UConn big Samson Johnson, bringing both benches to the brink of clearing. Even Hurley and Hardaway got involved, with Memphis assistant Nolan Smith trying to play peacemaker. Dainja and Samson were assessed offsetting technical fouls after review. Advertisement “I was a little upset with Dain because we had a technical right there, because Moussa got pushed down by Johnson,” Hardaway said. “But I’m never going to be a guy that doesn’t allow a teammate to take up for his teammates. So double foul, their ball, let’s go get a stop and let’s get back in it. “I just saw that the team unified more at that moment vs. being apart because he could have stayed where he was, not cared — but he cared enough to come to Moussa’s defense, and I liked that.” Hurley’s technical, and the ensuing free throws, came less than two minutes later. Memphis will now play the winner of Michigan State and Colorado in the semifinals on Tuesday, while UConn will play the loser in the consolation bracket. GO DEEPER Men’s college basketball Top 25: Feast Week is here. Who's for real? It took less than four minutes of game time for Hurley, who was peeved at the early officiating, to earn a “settle down” from one referee. Minutes later, after continuing to spout off, he and UConn’s bench earned a Class A technical foul. Their frustration was understandable: That tech was UConn’s seventh foul in less than five and a half minutes of game time, putting Memphis in the bonus with basically three-quarters of the first half left. The toughest part for UConn? Liam McNeeley and Solo Ball, the Huskies’ second- and third-leading scorers, plus starting center Samson Johnson each picked up two early personals. That trio combined for just 16 first-half minutes. And while the Huskies momentarily wavered with three starters parked, falling behind by six, they eventually rallied thanks to the efforts of two bench pieces: backup center Reed and sophomore wing Jaylin Stewart. Reed tallied 15 first-half points — matching his season-high — with a variety of transition buckets, and one particularly nasty combo where he hit a drop step, then spun off his defender before ultimately finishing an up-and-under layup. Stewart, who had not made a 3 yet this season and had only attempted five in four games, canned both his 3-point tries, and only missed one first-half look from the field. But Reed and Stewart’s performances only underscore what has become a hallmark of Hurley’s tenure in Storrs: depth, depth, depth. Ultimately, though, foul trouble (and the chippiness behind it) caught up to UConn in the worst way possible. By his standards, Hurley was actually fairly tame in the postgame press conference, reiterating that he “had a lot of issues with what went on out there in the game,” before saying he didn’t even know one of the three officials working it. But his temper came through gritted teeth rather than another blown top. Advertisement “It got off to a bad start when my medical trainer, who must have said something under his breath in a huddle, gets T’d up in the huddle in the first couple minutes,” Hurley said. “In a normal situation, an official comes over to you and says, hey, Coach, tell that guy to shut up — because I know they don’t want to hear it from me. But that’s commonly how that should have been handled.” UConn bigs Reed and Johnson both fouled out entirely, leaving the Huskies without a viable center down the stretch in overtime, as did transfer guard Aidan Mahaney, who struggled mightily most of the game. And while Memphis guard PJ Haggerty also fouled out late in regulation, Memphis going 29 of 40 from the free-throw line was the difference Monday. Memphis entered the game 30th nationally in free-throw rate, but that ranking should rise from here. Hardaway’s team entered Monday as the nation’s third-best 3-point shooting team, hitting 45.9 percent of its triples during its 4-0 start. Haggerty has been a key piece of that, having made half of his 14 attempts thus far, but Hunter has sneakily gotten off to the best 3-point shooting season of his career, making 8 of 18 3s prior to his seven-trey explosion. It was only the sixth time in 111 career games that Hunter has made at least four 3-pointers. But Memphis — the sixth-oldest team in college basketball, per KenPom, starting four seniors beside Haggerty — proved something about its team character against UConn that should raise some eyebrows, especially given how tough Hurley’s teams typically play. UConn didn’t make consecutive shots until almost halfway through the first half, as Memphis’ perimeter pressure and multiple ball screen coverages blew up the Huskies’ actions. Hurley made a nice adjustment to remedy some of that, running staggered screens whenever Memphis tried blitzing UConn’s ball screens, and one such possession freed up Karaban for a top-of-the-key 3, one of his team-best four 3s. Offensively, the Tigers — who entered the game top-30 nationally in free-throw rate — weren’t afraid to challenge the teeth of the Huskies’ defense, especially as foul trouble piled up for UConn. The Tigers entered this week having already beat three top-100 opponents, but nobody anywhere near Connecticut’s caliber. It’s an understatement to say this is a statement win. Memphis earned four votes to win the American Athletic Conference in the preseason but ultimately was picked second behind UAB. (Andy Kennedy’s Blazers, meanwhile, are 4-4 with losses to every top-200 opponent they’ve played.) Hurley said that Memphis had the look of a top-20 team, and it’s hard to argue given the way they out-physicaled the Huskies, who have made their bread by beating up opponents the last two seasons. Hunter has always been a productive player, dating to his Iowa State days — he’s 6-3 in the NCAA Tournament all-time — but he looks to have been fully unlocked under Hardaway’s leadership. And Haggerty, the reigning AAC Freshman of the Year, has been one of the nation’s best guards through the first month of the season. Even former Big Ten bigs Dainja (Illinois) and Cisse (Michigan) look to have hit new levels in Memphis. Calling the Tigers AAC favorites at this point feels more than safe, but if this team keeps it up over the next two days? It’s possible we’re talking about Memphis as one of the biggest winners of Feast Week. Regardless, at minimum, Memphis seems bound to go from receiving votes in this week’s AP poll to fully ranked by this time next week. If it pulls a stunner and wins the whole thing in Maui? It could easily rise into the top 15. This is as good a win as any team has so far this season. (Photo: Darryl Oumi / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Advertisement Rather than have the Rays host the Los Angeles Angels as originally planned in August, they’ll now host that series from April 8-10. The Rays will travel to California for another three-game series with the Angels beginning Aug. 4. The Minnesota Twins’ visit to Steinbrenner Field was moved from the Fourth of July weekend to May 26-28. The Rays will visit the Twins for a three-game series starting July 4. The Rays will not play the 2025 season at Tropicana Field because of damage to the stadium and its roof caused by Hurricane Milton in October. Repairs for the stadium were estimated to cost more than $50 million. Whether the Rays will be able to return to Tropicana in future seasons is still unknown. If construction were to begin in March, as laid out in a timeline in the damage estimate report, the repairs would not be completed until just days before the likely start of the 2026 season. The city of St. Petersburg, Fla., and the Rays still have to decide whether rebuilding is worth the investment because the team was already planning to move into a new stadium in 2028. However, that plan is currently on hold after the Pinellas County Board of Commissioners postponed a vote to approve bonds that would finance the ballpark’s construction.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,NFL removes Patriots' Jabrill Peppers from commissioner's exempt list,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5947811/2024/11/25/jabrill-peppers-patriots-exempt-list/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 21:47:29 GMT",Peppers had been on the list since Oct. 9 following his arrest on assault charges.,"NFL As Jabrill Peppers’ case involving drug possession and strangulation appears headed for trial, the NFL removed the New England Patriots safety from the commissioner’s exempt list Monday. Peppers was on the list since Oct. 9, which barred him from practicing or playing with the team. By removing him from the list, the league paved the way for Peppers to play with the Patriots, potentially as soon as Sunday’s game against the Indianapolis Colts. Advertisement “To me, it’s out of respect to the legal process to let that stuff play out,” coach Jerod Mayo said. “For us inside these four walls, as long as he’s doing the right thing, I expect him to be able to play when he’s ready to go.” Peppers was charged in October with assault and battery, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, strangulation and possession of a Class “B” substance believed to be cocaine, per a police report. Police responded to an incident involving Peppers and a woman. But the league opted to remove Peppers from the exempt list for a few reasons. A baseline suspension for this kind of violation of the NFL’s personal conduct policy is six games, and Peppers has already missed seven. After missing that much time, the league decided to remove Peppers from the list, while keeping open the possibility that Peppers could face discipline or a suspension based on how a league investigation goes, as well as the outcome of his case, a league source said. At a hearing last week, Peppers’ attorney claimed that the woman sought $10.5 million to drop the case, an allegation that representatives for the woman denied. A judge in Quincy, Mass. set a jury trial to begin on Jan. 22, a couple of weeks after the Patriots’ season is scheduled to end. “I understand you guys have questions about what transpired earlier in the season,” Peppers said Tuesday, his first public comments since his arrest. “Under the advice of my attorneys, I’m not at liberty to discuss any details. I look forward to doing so as part as the legal proceedings. Hope you guys understand and respect that.” Peppers said that he spoke with Patriots owner Robert Kraft before returning to the team Tuesday. Last month, Kraft said in a radio interview, “If what was reported is true, he’s gone.” Peppers was voted a captain by his teammates and had become a vocal leader for a rebuilding team. He signed a three-year, $24 million extension in August. Advertisement Peppers has missed the last six games while on the exempt list — he missed a seventh with a shoulder injury before being placed on the exempt list — which is only used for what the league calls “unusual” circumstances. Those circumstances can include players facing either felony charges or charges that involve the use of physical force. Players on the list are still paid, whereas Peppers would not be paid if he were suspended. The NFL said it opened a preliminary investigation into the incident. That investigation remains ongoing while Peppers awaits a jury trial and while he’s now cleared to return to the football field. The Patriots are 3-9 this season and have a rare Tuesday practice scheduled due to the holiday week, which means that will be Peppers’ first chance to be on the field with teammates since October. “I’m thankful that the league let me get back to doing what I love to do,” Peppers said. “I’m going to let the legal proceedings play out.” (Photo: Joe Sargent / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The 21-year-old underwent surgery to insert a pin in his foot in the U.S. last Friday, with his German club Wolfsburg confirming the procedure “went smoothly”. Sources close to the player and the club indicate that he may not return until January. Advertisement Paredes, who shone for the U.S. men’s Olympic team in Paris this summer, has been unable to play any part in Wolfsburg’s season so far following a breakthrough campaign in 2023-24 when he made 28 appearances and scored three goals. He fractured his foot during training in August and had been close to a return earlier this month. However, persistent pain prompted the decision to have a small pin inserted to complete the healing process. Normally, the recovery from such a procedure takes around two months. Wolfsburg will monitor Paredes carefully and hope for a potentially swifter outcome given all his rehabilitation efforts have strengthened his foot. The conservative estimate, though, is that he will return to full fitness after Wolfsburg’s winter break in January. It means he could also be unavailable for selection for the national team’s January 18 friendly with Venezuela in Fort Lauderdale. “Unfortunately after 14 weeks of rehab, I have undergone surgery and will be sidelined for a bit longer this season,” Paredes wrote on Instagram. “I want to wish my team-mates and fans all the best for the remainder of the time. I can’t wait to return and get back to doing what I love most.” Paredes is continuing his recovery at home in Virginia.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Judge denies request to block San Jose State volleyball player from Mountain West tournament,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5947424/2024/11/25/san-jose-state-volleyball-lawsuit-transgender/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 20:57:57 GMT",The plaintiffs sued the Mountain West and its commissioner over the participation of a player who they say is transgender.,"College Sports A federal judge in Colorado on Monday denied an emergency injunction request filed by a group of Mountain West volleyball players and a coach seeking to declare a San Jose State player who they allege is transgender ineligible for this week’s Mountain West tournament in Las Vegas. The plaintiffs, which include San Jose State player Brooke Slusser and suspended assistant coach Melissa Batie-Smoose, sued the Mountain West and its commissioner, Gloria Nevarez, on Nov. 13, alleging that the school and conference violated the U.S. Constitution and Title IX by allowing a transgender athlete to play for a women’s sports team. Advertisement Judge Kato Crews denied the request, writing that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate irreparable harm, in part by waiting until two weeks before the Nov. 27-30 tournament to seek the injunction. He noted that the Mountain West’s policy on transgender athletes has been in place since 2022 and that San Jose State opponents began forfeiting over the issue two months ago. “The Court finds their delay in filing this action and seeking emergency relief related to the MWC Tournament weakens their arguments regarding irreparable harm,” Crews wrote. Crews also wrote that the plaintiffs failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that a transgender athlete’s participation on a women’s sports team violates Title IX. “The movants’ Title IX theory raised in this case directly conflicts with Title IX’s prohibition on discrimination against trans individuals,” he wrote. In a statement Monday, the Mountain West said it is satisfied with the decision. “The Mountain West Conference is satisfied with the denial of the preliminary injunction and will continue to uphold the policies put in place by our Board of Directors which directly align with NCAA and USA Volleyball,” the conference said. “We are excited to proceed with the Mountain West Conference Women’s Volleyball Championship and celebrate and spotlight our student-athlete’s hard work and competitive spirit.” In response to the denial, the plaintiffs filed an emergency appeal Monday night. In their request for relief, they are seeking a reseeding of the conference tournament to eliminate the regular-season forfeits for canceled games against San Jose State. The plaintiffs are also seeking a ruling against the alleged transgender athlete’s eligibility in the conference tournament. Bill Bock, counsel for the plaintiffs, called it “shameful” that conference and NCAA administrators are “unwilling to do their jobs” of protecting fair competition and athlete safety. Advertisement “Because Mountain West Conference Commissioner Gloria Nevarez and NCAA President Charlie Baker won’t do their jobs and are apparently afraid to stand up for the rights of women student-athletes, we are forced to ask the federal courts to do their jobs for them,” Bock said in a statement about the emergency appeal. Slusser, who transferred to San Jose State prior to the 2023 season, joined a federal lawsuit in September challenging the NCAA’s transgender policy and went public with assertions about her teammate’s gender identification. In the lawsuit, Slusser said the teammate, who was also her roommate, “was born male and identifies as a ‘transgender woman,’” and came out to her during a conversation in April. Slusser has since spoken with numerous media outlets about her experience with her teammate. The Athletic is not naming the athlete because the athlete has not publicly identified. The school has not publicly confirmed whether the athlete is transgender. Crews, in his decision Monday, wrote that “No Defendant disputed that SJSU rosters a trans woman volleyball player.” Since Slusser first went public, five schools — Southern Utah, Utah State, Boise State, Wyoming and Nevada — have forfeited matches against San Jose State since late September. Athletes from several of those schools are among the plaintiffs in the Mountain West suit. The plaintiffs alleged that the Mountain West waited until after the San Jose State story broke in September to publish a policy stating a team that refuses to compete against a fellow member with an eligible transgender athlete will forfeit and be charged with a loss. In the lawsuit, the plaintiffs alleged the policy constituted a First Amendment violation that worked to suppress athletes’ ability to protest the alleged transgender athlete’s inclusion. Advertisement However, the judge’s decision indicates the conference’s board approved it in 2022 and circulated it amongst the schools at that time. “The Court also finds the movants have failed to show a likelihood of success on their First Amendment claim involving the TPP,” Crews wrote. San Jose State said in a statement Monday that all its student-athletes are eligible to participate in their sports under NCAA and Mountain West Conference rules. “We are gratified that the Court rejected an eleventh-hour attempt to change those rules,” the statement said. “Our team looks forward to competing in the Mountain West volleyball tournament this week.” San Jose State is the No. 2 seed in the tournament and will play its first match Friday against the winner of Wednesday’s match between No. 3 Utah State and No. 6 Boise State, both of which forfeited against SJSU during the season. “Utah State is reviewing the court’s order,” the university said in a statement Monday. “Right now, our women’s volleyball program is focused on the game this Wednesday, and we’ll be cheering them on.” GO DEEPER Volleyball players, coach sue SJSU, Mountain West over transgender athlete (Photo:  Erica Denhoff / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

According to the filing, a motion to dismiss hearing is scheduled for March 25 in federal court in the Northern District of California, located in San Jose, Calif. Advertisement Earlier this year, the Pac-12 lost 10 members to other power conferences. In September, the conference announced it was adding Boise State, Fresno State, Colorado State, San Diego State and Utah State from the Mountain West in 2026 to the conference as it rebuilds around Oregon State and Washington State. The departing schools will owe the conference exit fees of upward of $17 million each. The Pac-12 is also on the hook for more than $50 million in fees related to the scheduling deal struck between Oregon State, Washington State and the Mountain West last year. The Pac-12 filed an antitrust lawsuit in September, claiming that the so-called “Poaching Penalty” was “anticompetitive and unlawful” because it restricts offers the conference could make to Mountain West members. The Pac-12 also claims the penalties had nothing to do with the scheduling agreement, were forced upon Oregon State and Washington State under a tight deadline to put a 2024 football slate in place and were designed to prevent the Pac-12 from competing with the Mountain West. The Mountain West says Oregon State and Washington State agreed to the fees freely and raised no objection to them at the time the deal was being done. “As a preliminary matter, the Pac-12 has no antitrust standing: it fails to allege any harm to competition or to itself,” the Mountain West’s filing said. Oregon State and Washington State are taking advantage of an NCAA grace period and operating as a two-team league this season and next. To fill out a 12-game football schedule for this season, the schools struck a deal with the Mountain West to play what amounted to seven nonconference games with its teams. Fearing the Pac-12 schools might try to rebuild the conference by inviting some of the Mountain West’s members, the conference tried to protect itself with the poaching penalties. Advertisement Oregon State and Washington State could not come to an agreement for 2025 and a few weeks later the Pac-12 did invite Mountain West schools to join the reconfigured conference. The Pac-12 now contends the poaching penalties are illegal because they have no relation to the purpose of the contract, which was scheduling football games. The Pac-12 has also added Gonzaga to its rebuild but is in need of at least one more football school to get to the eight required for its champion to be eligible to qualify for a spot in the College Football Playoff. The Mountain West has subsequently used the incoming exit fees from the Pac-12 to sway UNLV and Air Force to remain in the conference. The Mountain West has also announced the additions of UTEP as a full, football-playing member and Grand Canyon, which does not play football. Also, Hawaii is moving from being football-only to full membership in 2026. (Photo: Icon Sportswire / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Arsenal go into Tuesday’s match against Portuguese champions Sporting CP in 12th place in the league phase, two points off the top eight places that guarantee automatic qualification into the last 16. They have only won once in their last eight European away ties, the last coming against Sevilla in October last year. Advertisement Goals have been their biggest issue in that run as they are without one in any of their last four away matches as they struggle to create in either of last season’s knock-out ties with Porto and Bayern Munich or this year’s group stage visits to Atalanta and Inter. “It’s certainly something we have to improve,” Arteta said ahead of the trip to Portugal. “I think we have made the right steps and looking back with the way we played against Inter — which is a team that has been so dominant in their league, reached the final of the Champions League which they should have won. To play and dominate that game. “But the reality is that you have to make it happen and we didn’t. Making those steps is what we have to do next. Be ruthless, be efficient in the opposition box and do what we have to do to take the three points away from here.” Arteta reached his 250th game in charge of the club in Saturday’s 3-0 victory over Nottingham Forest, a result which took him past the win ratios (58.8 per cent) of both George Graham and Arsene Wenger at the same stage in their Arsenal careers. But in analysing his team’s recent struggles on the road in Europe he does not see a clear pattern. “Not all the games have been the same,” Arteta added. “It’s true that within those games there were games that were when we had already qualified. Something that is very true is that we have to improve those results and we have to find ways to understand what has been missing. “Sometimes it’s been performance sometimes it’s been other aspects. That’s the next step we have to make as a team.” Arsenal only returned to the Champions League last season after a seven-year hiatus. GO DEEPER Ethan Nwaneri, Martin Odegaard and plotting the best path for Arsenal's prodigious teenager For many of the players, as well as Arteta, it is only their 15th game at this level but the Arsenal manager does not buy into the idea that they are still searching for the right balance of being tight defensively while still carrying a threat in attack. “I wouldn’t say that this is the most important thing but the efficiency that we have shown inside the box at this level with the chances that we are normally able to generate in the Champions League level, is not at the level required to win consistently,” he tated. Advertisement “I always say the Champions League is about boxes, small margins and details. You have to get all of those right to win, especially away from home.” Arsenal lost to Sporting on penalties in the quarter-finals of the Europa League two seasons ago and Arteta believes both teams have improved since then. “It’s always a good exercise to see the team a few years back,” Arteta said. “I watched both games back to have understanding of what worked and what didn’t in order to prepare. It’s difficult to recognise the team two years later. “You tend to see and look at the game and other stuff in a different way but it was good. It feels like it’s been a lot longer in way.

O’Connell has been sidelined since suffering a broken thumb on his throwing hand against the Los Angeles Rams in Week 7. Pierce wouldn’t say definitively whether he’ll play against the Kansas City Chiefs on Friday. Advertisement What does Pierce need to see from O’Connell to get the go-ahead to play? “Just seeing him being able to grip the ball comfortably — hopefully there’s no pain there — and just being able to be efficient,” Pierce said Monday. “To put a player out there that’s hurting or injured still, that’s not in the benefit of the player or the team.” 🔴📽️ Live: Antonio Pierce addresses the media from the Intermountain Health Performance Center. https://t.co/l9QnXMxb9f — Las Vegas Raiders (@Raiders) November 25, 2024  Quarterback Gardner Minshew suffered a season-ending broken collarbone against the Denver Broncos on Sunday, so the path could be cleared for O’Connell to start for the rest of the regular season. The Raiders did not put in a waiver claim Monday for quarterback Daniel Jones, who was released by the New York Giants last week. Jones cleared waivers and will become an unrestricted free agent. O’Connell had replaced a benched Minshew against the Broncos in Week 5, and the plan was for him to be the starter the rest of the way — until he got hurt against the Rams. The 26-year-old out of Purdue is eager to get back on the field, but the coaching staff will be cautious on a short week. If he can’t play — and the Raiders don’t add outside help — they’ll start third-year quarterback Desmond Ridder on Black Friday against the Chiefs. “At the quarterback position, you’ve got to be smart,” Pierce said. “(O’Connell’s) future is much brighter looking ahead. He’s a young player. We’ve just got to be smart. We have a good relationship, Aidan and myself, and he speaks honestly with me, and I speak honestly with him.” GO DEEPER Raiders reach new low as dominance over Broncos is firmly a thing of the past It’s been a limited sample size for O’Connell this season. He’s played in four games, but started only two of them and has just 82 passing attempts. He’s completed 63.4 percent of those passes for 455 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. O’Connell started 10 games as a rookie last season, including all nine of Pierce’s games as interim head coach. Considering the circumstances — he was replacing quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo after former head coach Josh McDaniels and former offensive coordinator Mick Lombardi were fired — he was solid. He finished the season with a 62.1 completion percentage, 2,218 passing yards, 12 touchdowns and seven interceptions and posted a 5-5 record as the starter. While O’Connell entered this past offseason as the incumbent starter, the Raiders still signed Minshew to a two-year, $25 million deal in March and were interested in drafting a quarterback in April. They did not, however, which left them with a quarterback room led by Minshew and O’Connell. Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.
 Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox. The two quarterbacks were in a position battle throughout OTAs and training camp before Minshew emerged as the victor. Telesco, Pierce and former offensive coordinator Luke Getsy felt more comfortable with Minshew’s experience and mobility. It wound up being a disaster. In 10 games of action, Minshew committed 14 turnovers (tied for the most in the NFL) and was benched three times before he got injured last week. Advertisement Now, O’Connell could have a six-game run to show how much progress he’s made. Despite being only in his second season, he’ll already have his fourth offensive play caller in interim offensive coordinator Scott Turner. The Raiders (2-9) are in the midst of a seven-game losing streak and have been allergic to scoring points all season long. They’re averaging just 18.7 points per game (26th) and have only improved slightly to 19 points per game in Turner’s two games in charge. It’ll go a long way if O’Connell can make a difference. The Raiders will explore their options at quarterback this offseason regardless, but there’s still significance in O’Connell having the opportunity to show he deserves to be in the mix. “These younger guys are understanding that this is their opportunity the last six weeks of the season,” Pierce said. “You don’t know how this bad boy is going to go in the offseason. … What do the 2025 Raiders look like, and are you a part of that? … It’s important for these guys to put their best foot forward and, really, for all of our players and myself included (along with the coaching) staff, to show that we’re fighting and there’s no give and no tanking or any of that B.S. that’s being said. We’re trying to win every game possible.” • Raiders were a mess at QB before Gardner Minshew’s injury and need a fix this offseason

Naeher’s career stands comfortably in the top three amongst other World Cup winners Briana Scurry and Hope Solo. “Every tear shed in the challenging times and disappointments made every smile and celebration in the moments of success that much more joyful,” Naeher wrote Monday in her announcement on social media. “This has been a special team to be a part of and I am beyond proud of what we have achieved both on and off the field.”     A post shared by Alyssa Naeher (@alyssanaeher)  Naeher made her debut a decade ago in December 2014, and after stints as the primary backup goalkeeper for the 2015 World Cup and 2016 Olympics, she took over the no. 1 spot following that quarterfinal exit. Ahead of what could be her two final games for the United States, she holds a record 88 wins, 14 draws and only six losses through 113 appearances. “Having the opportunity to be a part of the USWNT for the last 15 years has been the greatest honor,” she wrote. “When I began this journey, I never could have imagined where it would take me.” She earned her 100th cap earlier this year during the W Gold Cup and cemented her status not just as someone who could save penalty kicks, but convert them as well. In the W Gold Cup semifinal against Canada, she buried her attempt from the spot but also saved three of Canada’s attempts — marking her as the only USWNT goalkeeper to make three saves in a PK shootout. She’d repeat the same double later that spring, against Canada, during the SheBelieves Cup. At the Olympics this summer, she once again stepped up to help propel the USWNT to their gold medal victory, including a poster-worthy save against Brazil in the closing moments of the gold cup game at Parc des Princes. Off the field, she bonded with the forward line of Trinity Rodman, Sophia Smith and Mal Swanson (also known as “Triple Espresso”) who pulled her out of her shell. GO DEEPER USWNT on goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher: 'We’re making her a little more mushy gushy' “We’re making her a little more mushy gushy with us, which I think is nice,” Rodman said in France. “We’re opening up a side that I think has always been there, but it’s hidden a little bit.” (Top photo: Joe Robbins / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Following a trade that sent Lars Eller to Washington on Nov. 12, the Penguins acquired forward Philip Tomasino from the Nashville Predators on Monday in return for a 2027 fourth-round pick, which they had attained in the Chad Ruhwedel trade last season. Advertisement Tomasino was Nashville’s first-round pick in the 2019 NHL Draft. Coincidentally, the Penguins sent their first-round pick in that draft — Samuel Poulin — back to AHL Wilkes-Barre to make room on the roster for Tomasino. The 23-year-old Tomasino has scored 23 goals in 159 NHL games. He’s another example of a young player with a strong pedigree but an unremarkable start in the NHL whom Dubas has taken a chance on. Dubas also acquired first-round draft picks Cody Glass and Jesse Puljujarvi on the cheap. Dubas’ Penguins are struggling mightily and are in last place in the Metropolitan Division. While Dubas isn’t in the habit of trading away draft picks, he deemed it worthy for a player with potential who can join his team immediately. The plan is for Tomasino to practice with the Penguins on Tuesday and likely play on Wednesday against the Vancouver Canucks. The 6-foot, 179-pound forward is a native of Mississauga, Ontario. He enjoyed a standout Ontario Hockey League career with Niagara and Oshawa. Say what you will about some of the moves Dubas has made during his 18 months as Penguins general manager. Some of the moves, notably contracts for Tristan Jarry and Ryan Graves, have been failures. He is, however, making wise decisions in terms of identifying young, talented players who could find a home in Pittsburgh. In this trade, he gave up only a fourth-round pick for more than two years from now, which seems very reasonable. Tomasino is making only $825,000 this season, so he fits under the salary cap. Because he can play any forward position, there aren’t too many places where Tomasino wouldn’t fit. I imagine he’ll slide into the Penguins’ bottom six, where offense has been difficult to find. Very few spots are off limits on the Penguins roster these days, so he’ll be allowed to shine in several roles. (Photo: Gregory Shamus / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Spurs confirmed in a statement on Monday that Vicario suffered the injury during Saturday’s 4-0 win at Manchester City. “Guglielmo will be assessed by our medical staff to determine when he can return to training,” the statement added. Vicario’s recovery is expected to take months following his surgery. Advertisement The 28-year-old was limping when walking through the mixed zone at the Etihad Stadium following Saturday’s game, but did play the full 90 minutes. He also received treatment on the pitch in the first half of the match following a collision with City winger Savinho, after which the Italian appeared to be holding his right ankle. “I played 60 minutes at the Etihad with a broken bone in my ankle, giving absolutely everything I had for the team,” Vicario posted on social media. “Unfortunately there was no way around this one… I needed surgery.” Vicario has been a Premier League ever-present for Tottenham since joining from Empoli for a fee of around €20million (£17.2m; $21.9m) last summer, featuring in all 38 matches last season and their 12 so far this term.     A post shared by Guglielmo Vicario (@guglielmovicario)  He also played in Spurs’ first two Europa League league phase matches this season, with Fraser Forster coming in for the other two. Vicario also started in his side’s Carabao Cup third-round win over Manchester City last month, with Forster having played in the second-win victory against Coventry City. This is potentially the worst possible injury Tottenham’s squad could have suffered and will have burst the mood after their stunning 4-0 victory over Manchester City at the Etihad on Sunday. Vicario was crucial to that victory with a series of impressive saves. Since he joined Spurs from Italian side Empoli in June 2023, the Italy international’s distribution has been crucial to the way Postecoglou wants his side to build up from the back. Vicario has the composure when under pressure from opposition strikers to wait until the perfect moment before playing a pass to a defender or one of the midfielders. The problem is Tottenham do not have a quality replacement for him. Forster has made three appearances in all competitions this season but does not have the same confidence when stepping off his line or with the ball at his feet. Tottenham also have two goalkeepers who have progressed through their academy but Alfie Whiteman, 26, and Brandon Austin, 25, have never made a senior appearance for them. Whiteman’s only previous experience was on loan in Sweden while Austin played five times in the MLS for Orlando City in 2021. Advertisement Postecoglou has no choice but to rely on Forster for a busy festive period and might have to adapt his tactics and play slightly deeper because relying on the 36-year-old to sweep up the huge space behind the defence’s high line feels incredibly risky. It is not an exaggeration to say that Vicario’s injury could have massive consequences for their season. (Photos: Paul Ellis/AFP via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The longtime Utah head coach was asked Monday about his future leading the program in 2025 as the Utes (4-7, 1-7) prepare to wrap up a thoroughly disappointing season Friday on the road at Central Florida. Advertisement “I will obviously evaluate after the season’s over, see what the situation is, but my decision will be made based on what’s best for the program, not what’s best for me,” Whittingham said. “It’ll be completely determined on how I feel this program is best served going forward.” Utah defensive coordinator Morgan Scalley has been named coach-in-waiting since last November and will assume the head coach position whenever Whittingham decides to retire. He’s currently the second-longest tenured head coach in college football — tied with Oklahoma State’s Mike Gundy at 19 years — behind Iowa’s Kirk Ferentz (25 years). Last week, Whittingham said he is working with Scalley regarding the impending offensive coordinator hire. Utah’s veteran offensive coordinator Andy Ludwig resigned on Oct. 20 amidst the program’s season-long struggles on offense. For the first time since 2013, Utah will not be bowl-bound. No matter the outcome of Friday’s regular-season finale in Orlando, Fla., 2024 will be Utah’s third losing campaign in 20 years under Whittingham.

 Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox. Utah’s abysmal offensive numbers in 2024 have been driven largely by the bizarre set of injuries that beset the quarterback position. Utah will start its fifth-string quarterback, Luke Bottari, at UCF on Friday night after yet another season-ending injury to a Utah QB. True freshman Isaac Wilson left Utah’s 31-28 loss to Iowa State in the second half with a knee injury. Wilson is the latest Utah quarterback to be lost for the season after starter Cam Rising and backups Brandon Rose and Sam Huard suffered season-ending injuries throughout the fall. Asked Monday about the potential timing of his decision with the offensive coordinator search still ongoing and the transfer portal opening on Dec. 9, Whittingham said he didn’t have an exact timeline. Advertisement “Can’t tell you, for sure,” he said. “We’ll sit down and evaluate everything. I can tell you right now that Coach Scalley will be involved with decisions going forward. It’s only right he does that because he’s the coach-in-waiting and when that time comes, we need to make sure he’s had input on big decisions. It’ll be a team effort in that respect going forward as far as hiring and recruiting.” Whittingham, who turned 65 last week, said he “still has plenty of gas in the tank” but will not only take a hard look at the state of the program after the season ends but understands the perfect ending to a coaching career is rarely achieved. “To time it just right so you can go out at just the right time, there is a very, very small percentage of people who are able to do that,” he said. “So, again, I’m not saying, ‘Well, this was a bad year for me, so I’ve got to come back and have a better year.’ Everyone wants to have a better year next year regardless of who the coach is.” (Photo: Chris Gardner / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Vancouver Whitecaps part with head coach Vanni Sartini after MLS Cup playoffs first-round exit,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5947232/2024/11/25/vanni-sartini-whitecaps-next-coach/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 19:10:52 GMT",Sartini took over in 2021 and led the Canadian side to postseason appearances in three of the last four years.,"MLS The Vancouver Whitecaps has parted with head coach Vanni Sartini, the MLS team announced Monday. Sartini first took over the Canadian club as an interim coach during the 2021 season, replacing Marc Dos Santos, earning the job on a permanent basis after getting the team into the postseason. In total, Sartini led the Whitecaps to the MLS Cup playoffs in 2021, 2023, and 2024, falling in the first round of each instalment. Advertisement In a press release, Vancouver framed this as a mutual parting of ways. However, sporting director Axel Schuster seemed to position this as his own determination in a quote from the team’s official announcement. “I took my time with this decision, and it was not taken lightly,” Schuster wrote. “We have taken important steps each year and it is now the right time for someone else to lead this group on the pitch with fresh and new energy. We have started the process to find our next head coach as we look to take the next step and build a championship contender in MLS, as well as continental tournaments.” While three first-round exits in four seasons are not exactly a robust return, it is worth remembering the Whitecaps team that Sartini inherited. Vancouver made just one trip to the playoffs from 2016 through 2020, and looked likely to repeat that ineffectiveness before he took over the squad in 2021. The Whitecaps had also failed to win the Canadian Championship in the same five-year span, but Sartini led the team to triumphs in the domestic cup in 2022, 2023 and 2024.  Sartini also worked with a roster that was compiled on a relatively lean budget and with frequent squad turnover under Schuster’s operation. Vancouver remained competitive under the Italian thanks in large part to the attacking tandem of Ryan Gauld and Brian White, who joined the club in 2021 and became one of the league’s strongest forward partnerships. GO DEEPER Gauld, the Vancouver player compared to Messi: 'It's not great to have that follow you around' While this year’s squad ranked 12th in salary expenditure, the Whitecaps have been infamous for perceived low investment via transfer fees and updating the academy, particularly in the years following homegrown wing-back Alphonso Davies’ sale to Bayern Munich in January 2019 for an initial $13.5million with performance bonuses that may have risen up to $22m. Advertisement Under Sartini, the Whitecaps became one of MLS’s most watchable teams for neutral viewers. His system generated plenty of chances, though the Whitecaps fell from sixth in chances created per game in 2023 to 18th in 2024. It appears that Schuster and Kerfoot believed that this team had reached its ceiling under his guidance: a side that could consistently qualify for the playoffs and win the domestic cup, but struggle to truly square up against MLS’s top teams. Sartini became a frequent topic of discussion for MLS’s disciplinary committee. In November 2023, the league issued a six-game suspension after the coach made questionable comments about an officiating decision by referee Tim Ford. The Whitecaps’ match on Nov. 5 ended in controversy, as Ford blocked a Whitecaps player from picking up a loose ball on a corner kick, contributing to an LAFC counter-attack that ended in a goal that was eventually ruled out for offside. After the match, Sartini said of the officiating: “If they found (Ford) in False Creek then I’m going to be a suspect. I’m not saying that I would do it, I’m saying I’m the first suspect — it’s different.” Sartini was clear he was joking, but it did not land well. At other times in the press conference, Sartini called the referee’s performance “shameful,” “a disgrace,” and “f—ing horrible.” MLS eventually reduced his suspension by two games, and he coached his first match of the 2024 season on March 23. Vancouver now has one of three current MLS coaching vacancies, joining Atlanta United and the Philadelphia Union. (Top photo: Jeff Vinnick/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Downs is also tied with fellow wideout Alec Pierce for the team-high in receiving touchdowns (four). Pierce got banged up as well in the second half of Sunday’s contest. He had his right ankle re-taped by trainers on the sideline, and walked gingerly in the locker room after the game.

We appreciate the FIA and FOM’s support of our application and their recognition of the value we can bring to the championship.’’ Advertisement “General Motors and Cadillac’s commitment to this project is an important and positive demonstration of the evolution of our sport,” said F1 president and CEO Stefano Domenicali. We look forward to seeing the progress and growth of this entry, certain of the full collaboration and support of all the parties involved.” This comes after news broke during the Las Vegas Grand Prix weekend that General Motors was nearing approval to join the grid in 2026. Andretti Global initially put forward the bid, which included GM building its power unit in 2028, but F1 rejected it. Still, the project continued. Andretti has undergone restructuring recently, with Michael Andretti leaving his operational role and Dan Towriss taking over. It seemed the grid may be open to welcoming GM, based on comments made during Thursday’s news conference. Mercedes’ Toto Wolff said, “We have an obligation, a statutory obligation as directors to present the standpoint that is the best for our company and for our employees, and we’ve done that so in the past. I think if a team can add to the championship, particularly if GM decides to come in as a team owner, that is a different story. And as long as it is creative, that means we’re growing the popularity of the sport, we’re growing the revenue of the sport, then no team will be ever against it. So I’m putting my hope in there.” A prominent American manufacturer with an extensive motorsports history joining the grid could bring fresh eyes to the sport, but it also means the prize money will be split up even more. This will be the first team to join the grid since Haas in 2016, and the sport has had 10 teams on the grid since 2017. F1 has said before that it was open to a GM works team. When it rejected Andretti’s big, F1 said it “would look differently on an application for the entry of a team into the 2028 championship with a GM power unit, either as a GM works team or as a GM customer team designing all allowable components in-house.” Advertisement However, GM will need another customer power unit. It planned to have its F1 engine ready in 2028, two years into the new regulations. New teams joining the grid must add something, which GM does by becoming an engine manufacturer. The plan is still for GM to enter through its Cadillac brand. According to F1’s press release, “Over the course of this year, they have achieved operational milestones and made clear their commitment to brand the eleventh team GM/Cadillac, and that GM will enter as an engine supplier at a later time.” There will still be Andretti involvement, though it remains to be seen how much. GM’s announcement includes the news that Mario Andretti, the last American F1 world champion, will be on the team’s board, serving as the director. “My first love was Formula 1, and now – 70 years later – the F1 paddock is still my happy place. I’m absolutely thrilled with Cadillac, Formula 1, Mark Walter, and Dan Towriss,” Andretti said in the announcement. “To still be involved at this stage of my life — I have to pinch myself to make sure I’m not dreaming.” According to GM’s press release, the other power player involved is TWG Global, which is a holding company that “owns and operates” Andretti Global. As for the Department of Justice’s investigation into F1’s Andretti rejection, what will happen remains to be seen. (Photo: Mario Tama/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"AP Top 25 men's college basketball rankings: Kansas, UConn still 1-2 as Feast Week tests begin",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5946597/2024/11/25/ap-mens-basketball-top-25-rankings-feast-week/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 18:34:11 GMT","The AP top five remains unchanged, but Thanksgiving week is littered with ranked matchups and potential blue-blood clashes.","NCAAM Ahead of one of college basketball’s busiest weeks of the regular season, Kansas remains at No. 1 in the men’s basketball Top 25, with UConn, Gonzaga, Auburn and Iowa State rounding out an unchanged top five. Thanksgiving week is littered with ranked matchups and potential blue-blood clashes within the neutral-site tournaments taking place from the Bahamas to Hawaii and everywhere in between. The Maui Invitational, which features No. 2 UConn, No. 4 Auburn, No. 5 Iowa State and No. 12 North Carolina, among others, tips off Monday afternoon. In Las Vegas, Kansas and Duke clash Tuesday night, while the eight-team Player’s Era Festival tips off with No. 6 Houston, No. 9 Alabama, No. 20 Texas A&M and more in action. Here’s the third men’s basketball AP Top 25 of the 2024-25 season, along with C.J. Moore’s ballot and analysis of the new rankings. This week I moved out Creighton, St. John’s, Illinois and Michigan. Creighton was a team I was skeptical of in the preseason, and a 74-63 home loss to Nebraska over the weekend, combined with the fact they’re outside the top 25 at the three main computer rankings (KenPom, Bart Torvik and Evan Miya), was enough to give the Jays the boot. Illinois was a harder call, because the Illini lost to a top-10 team in Alabama, but I was close to knocking the Illini out last week, and they haven’t done anything to warrant staying in. Michigan was right on the cusp (No. 28 at KenPom, No. 29 at Torvik and No. 22 at Evan Miya), and it made sense to include Xavier in its place. The Musketeers own a win against Wake Forest, which beat Michigan. Advertisement St. John’s was the most difficult team to knock out this week because the Johnnies look like a Top 25 team, and their computer numbers are good. They also took a bad-luck loss against Baylor in the Bahamas, with Zuby Ejiofor missing two free throws to give Jeremy Roach a chance to win the game at the buzzer with a 3. But Sunday’s loss to Georgia made it tough to justify ranking St. John’s if I wasn’t going to rank Georgia. The Bulldogs are on the watch list, but their computer numbers aren’t great. The other two teams under consideration for removal were Texas Tech and Arizona. The Wildcats stay in for now because their losses aren’t bad — at Wisconsin and home loss to Duke — they’re still inside the top 25 at all three computer rankings and they pass the eye test of a Top 25 team. Texas Tech also has great computer numbers (21/19/14) and its one loss was by one to Saint Joseph’s on an uncharacteristic bad shooting night (4 of 20 from 3). Darrion Williams missed a great look at the buzzer that would have won it. Mississippi State, another new addition, is inside the top 25 at all three computers and now has two wins against high-majors (Utah and at SMU). Texas beat a hot Saint Joseph’s team, has solid computer numbers and has just the opening-night loss to Ohio State on a neutral floor. I’m still a little skeptical of the Longhorns, but they also took that loss without former Houston/Arkansas wing Tramon Mark, who made his debut last week in the Legends Classic and should help Texas on both ends. Ohio State, another team inside the top 25 at all three computer sites, also rejoins the rankings. That Texas win is starting to look better.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Alabama's Deontae Lawson out for the year: What the injury means for Crimson Tide,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5947046/2024/11/25/deontae-lawson-injury-alabama-football/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 18:18:32 GMT","Lawson, a junior and projected NFL prospect, likely has played his final game for Alabama.","NCAAF TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — Alabama linebacker and team captain Deontae Lawson left the Oklahoma game on Saturday with an apparent leg injury. On Monday, it was confirmed to be a season-ending injury by coach Kalen DeBoer, a critical setback for an Alabama defense that surrendered 260 rushing yards in a 24-3 loss to the Sooners. Advertisement “Amazing leader, I can see not what he means to us on the field but the love the players have for him,” DeBoer said. “I know we all feel for him. We appreciate everything he’s done. Obviously, you miss what he does on the field but what he brings to the locker room.” Lawson, a junior and projected NFL prospect, likely has played his final game for Alabama. He was a Butkus Award semifinalist with 76 tackles, four pass breakups and two sacks. He was named a permanent team captain before the season, and he was Alabama’s headset communication player on defense. “When you lose a guy (like Lawson) who is your steady-maker in the box, it’s a tough loss,” defensive coordinator Kane Wommack said. “Justin Jefferson stepped up in the second half and did a really good job. We’ve got some young guys trending in the right direction with Jeremiah Alexander, Justin Okoronkwo and Cayden Jones.” Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox.
 Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox. Lawson’s injury compounds another issue for this defense: pass rush. When healthy, Lawson and Jefferson were inside linebackers while Jihaad Campbell turned into a pure pass rusher on obvious pass downs. Now, Lawson’s injury will affect how Campbell is used. He leads the team with five sacks, and Alabama had only one sack against Oklahoma. Jefferson, a senior, replaced Lawson on Saturday and finished with six tackles. Jefferson has been constant in the rotation this year as a third linebacker and has 46 tackles and two sacks. He will assume the headset communication duties moving forward, as he did in Lawson’s place at Oklahoma and will start full-time alongside Campbell at inside linebacker. “Maybe a little different style, but Justin can run, he’s physical, team-first mindset,” DeBoer said. “He’s always ready whenever called upon. We’re all fans of him and want him to go out there and be great, we’re confident in him.” (Photo: Cliff Welch / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Celtics’ ‘cheat code’ Kristaps Porziņģis probable to make season debut vs. Clippers,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5946972/2024/11/25/boston-celtics-kristaps-porzingis-debut-clippers/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 17:37:51 GMT",Porziņģis missed 25 regular-season games and the majority of the playoffs last season with an injury.,"NBA The Boston Celtics are listing center Kristaps Porziņģis as probable to make his season debut against the Los Angeles Clippers in Boston on Monday, the team announced in its injury report. Porziņģis was ruled out for at least five months when he had surgery to repair a torn retinaculum and dislocated posterior tibialis tendon in his left ankle in June, shortly after the Celtics won their record-setting 18th NBA championship. The rare injury was a tear to the tissue that holds the ankle tendon in place, causing the tendon to become unstable. Advertisement Porziņģis missed most of the postseason due to a calf injury and returned for the beginning of the Finals, only to have this injury knock him out for Games 3 and 4. He played through the injury in Game 5 when the Celtics clinched the title, but required surgery soon after the series ended. The 29-year-old previously stated he could be out until Christmas, and the Celtics had mentioned timelines looking deeper into December, so a return on Nov. 25 is notably ahead of schedule. Porziņģis averaged 20.1 points last season — the third-most on the team behind star duo Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown — along with 7.2 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game through 57 regular-season contests. He also averaged a team-high 1.9 blocks. The Celtics started the season 14-3 and continue to be one of the top teams in the NBA without Porziņģis, but have struggled with the health of their center rotation lately. Porziņģis’ return will take pressure off 38-year-old Al Horford to carry the load at the starting center. With the 7-foot-2 center back in the fold, the Celtics can now bring out the lineup that led the team to a dominant regular season en route to a championship. “We’re a really good team right now. We (get) KP and it just makes us that much better on both ends of the floor,” Tatum said last week. “Our chemistry is there. It’s like having a cheat code.” As great as the Celtics have been without Porziņģis, he gives them a new set of solutions for opposing strategies. He ranked as one of the most efficient post players in years last season; switching against lineups with him just doesn’t have the same effect. And for teams that don’t switch, well, that still might be just what the Celtics want. When they can force a defense into scramble mode, they produce open three after open three. Advertisement Porziņģis should also help to shore up one of the Celtics’ early-season issues: rim protection. They ranked third last season in preventing shots at the rim, but have dipped to 12th in the same category over their first 17 games, all without Porziņģis. Opponents shot just 63.6 percent against the Celtics from within four feet of the basket last season (Boston ranked fifth) but have converted 68.2 percent of such attempts so far this season (Boston ranks 24th). The Celtics should still need time to adjust to Porziņģis since they play a different style with him, but Porziņģis should make the game easier for them at both ends of the court. — Jay King, Celtics beat writer (Photo: Maddie Meyer / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Ex-Jets general manager Mike Tannenbaum to lead search for team's next GM, head coach",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5946752/2024/11/25/mike-tannenbaum-jets-gm-search/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 16:16:28 GMT","The Jets have retained Tannenbaum's company, The 33rd Team, with former Vikings GM Rick Spielman set to work on the search as well.","NFL The last time New York Jets owner Woody Johnson ran a search for a new general manager and head coach, he hired two prominent former NFL GMs to consult and lead the way. Ten years later, Johnson is taking a similar tack. After firing GM Joe Douglas last week, Johnson is retaining The 33rd Team, a media and consulting firm run by former Jets general manager Mike Tannenbaum, for support in the Jets’ upcoming GM and head coach searches. Along with Tannenbaum, former Minnesota Vikings general manager Rick Spielman will help spearhead the search. Advertisement Tannenbaum worked for the Jets in various roles from 1997 to 2012, most prominently as the team’s general manager from 2006-12. His knowledge of the organization, as well as how Johnson thinks and what he’s looking for, likely factored into the decision to incorporate him into the process — though it is interesting that Johnson would lean on Tannenbaum to fill the same role that he also fired him from after the 2012 season. Spielman helped the Washington Commanders in their GM and head coach searches last year, which ended with Washington hiring Adam Peters as general manager and Dan Quinn as head coach — that pairing has delivered strong early returns. In 2015, Johnson hired former NFL general managers Charley Casserly and Ron Wolf to lead the charge, a search that ended with them hiring Mike Maccagnan as general manager. Maccagnan, notably, was Casserly’s No. 2 when Casserly was the general manager of the Houston Texans. Here’s what Casserly said about Johnson’s approach, via the “New York Post,” in 2015: “We didn’t make any decisions. These were clearly Woody’s decisions. I don’t want that taken the wrong way. Our job was to give advice when asked. That’s what you do in that position. Woody was outstanding. Woody gave us latitude to ask anything in interviews. He listened to everything we had to say. He encouraged us to give him exactly what we thought. He made the decisions and I think he chose two outstanding candidates. It’s notable that Rex Ryan has been floating his own candidacy for the Jets’ vacant head coaching position too, especially considering Tannenbaum hired him to coach the Jets in 2009. Tannebaum also hired Eric Mangini prior to Ryan’s tenure. Both former coaches now work as media analysts, Ryan for ESPN and Mangini for Fox Sports. Ryan has not coached in the NFL since 2016; Mangini hasn’t had a coaching role since 2015. Advertisement The Jets are believed to be planning to hire a general manager first — since the Douglas firing, longtime NFL executive Phil Savage has served as the interim GM. Robert Saleh was fired as head coach after a Week 5 loss to the Minnesota Vikings and replaced by defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich. Neither Savage nor Ulbrich are considered leading candidates for the full-time positions, though both could potentially garner interviews with the new search committee.

Sheeran, 33, said he had been intending to greet Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp and was unaware Amorim was being interviewed at the time, when the UK broadcaster cut to him mid-way through Amorim’s pitch-side discussion. Advertisement The singer-songwriter is a sponsor and minority shareholder of his hometown club Ipswich and was celebrating the newly-promoted side’s 1-1 draw against United. He was criticised on social media following the incident but issued a statement to explain his interruption was an accident. “Apologies if I offended Amorim yesterday, didn’t actually realise he was being interviewed at the time, was popping to say hi and bye to Jamie,” Sheeran wrote on social media. “Obvz feel a bit of a b****** but life goes on. Great game tho, congrats to all involved x”. After overseeing a 1-1 draw during his debut match in charge, Amorim was giving his first post-match interview to the Premier League’s primary UK broadcaster Sky Sports as United head coach. The 39-year-old was asked by pundit Izzy Christiansen what had impressed him the most from his new players in training in the build-up to Sunday’s fixture and what he wanted to take forward from the game. “You start discovering things: Garnacho can hold the ball between lines,” Amorim replied. “You can see that in the game because the game is always open. You try to find these things. Bruno Fernandes, he improved his game by playing near the ball, feeling the ball. He can give us sometimes the long pass. But you cannot put him there all the time, because he wants the long pass. He concluded: “We try to find things about the players. We will need a lot of time, a lot of time to work out these things.” As presenter Kelly Cates began to ask the next question, the camera panned out to Sheeran greeting Redknapp. “Ed Sheeran has joined us,” Cates said. “Ed, we’re just speaking to Ruben Amorim, who may not want to talk to an Ipswich fan.” “I don’t think he wants to speak to me. He doesn’t want to speak to me,” Sheeran said. Ed Sheeran crashed Ruben Amorim's first post-match interview  😂 pic.twitter.com/cTSMgyTE8w — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) November 24, 2024  Attempting to keep Sheeran’s appearance short and sweet, Cates said: “From an Ipswich point of view, it was almost perfect?” “I loved it, I love being back in the Premier League,” Sheeran replied. Redknapp then promised to speak to Sheeran later, who left the pitch-side desk and departed out of shot. Advertisement “Thanks very much Ed. Ruben, it’s an unpredictable when we’re pitch-side,” Cates explained, before resuming the post-match interview. Sheeran was subsequently labelled “rude” and “disrespectful” on social media, and Sky also faced criticism following the incident.  Sheeran grew up in Suffolk and is a boyhood Ipswich fan. He has been the club’s front-of-shirt sponsor since the 2021-22 season, with the club in League One. This was welcomed by supporters, the club having previously been sponsored by gambling company Magical Vegas and former owner Marcus Evans. Ipswich have since enjoyed back-to-back promotions under Kieran McKenna and, in May, secured a return to the Premier League following a 22-year absence. Sheeran designed the club’s third kit for the 2021-22 campaign and appeared in this season’s promotional video for the third strip. In August, it was announced the four-time Grammy Award winner had bought a minority stake in the club, and he is regularly pictured at matches.     A post shared by Ed Sheeran (@teddysphotos)  “I have lived in Suffolk since I was three years old and, while I travel the world and sometimes feel like an outsider in big cities, Suffolk and Ipswich have always made me feel part of the community and protected,” Sheeran said this summer. TNT Sports featured an interview with Sheeran and Peter Crouch ahead of Ipswich’s opening match of the Premier League season against Liverpool, and he was pictured greeting the Sky Sports punditry team in the studio ahead of Sunday’s fixture against United. Ipswich have won just one of their opening 12 games and are among the favourites for relegation this season, but came from a goal down inside the opening two minutes to secure a 1-1 draw against United.

Harrell, formerly the defensive coordinator, is 4-0 since taking over as the interim coach, with wins against Temple, Florida Atlantic, Tulsa and most recently North Texas, overcoming a 21-0 deficit to win 40-28 on Saturday. ECU fired former coach Mike Houston with a 3-4 record in October before Harrell took over.

East Carolina was considered by industry sources to be the best head-coaching opening at the moment, a Group of 5 job that paid Houston almost $2.5 million, while no Power 4 jobs are open.

Kikuchi, The Athletic’s No. 14 ranked free agent this offseason, netted a deal exactly in line with Tim Britton’s contract projection. The deal, first reported by the New York Post, is the largest expenditure thus far during the Angels’ busy winter. Advertisement The 33-year-old Kikuchi was an All-Star in 2021 and made 32 starts in each of the past two seasons with a 105 ERA+, making him a slightly above-average pitcher. But he shined this season after a trade deadline deal sent him from the Toronto Blue Jays — where he had a 4.75 ERA — to the Houston Astros, where he posted a 2.70 ERA down the stretch. Kikuchi threw fewer curveballs and more sliders, a tweak that yielded results the Angels hope to see over full seasons. He figures to slot into the rotation spot created when the Angels non-tendered lefty Patrick Sandoval on Friday. The Angels, coming off the worst season in franchise history, have added $80 million in payroll by signing four free agents. In addition to Kikuchi, the Angels signed infielder Kevin Newman to a one-year deal with a club option for 2026 ($2.75 million), starting pitcher Kyle Hendricks to a one-year deal ($2.5 million base salary) and catcher Travis d’Arnaud to a two-year deal ($12 million). The payroll increases don’t stop there. The Angels have also swung trades to acquire infielder Scott Kingery and slugging outfielder Jorge Soler, who has two years and $26 million left on his contract. As things stand, Kikuchi would lead the Angels’ rotation, which projects to also feature Hendricks, right-hander Jose Soriano and lefties Tyler Anderson and Reid Detmers. Top prospect Caden Dana and prospect Sam Aldegheri also figure at some point to be part of the equation. The Angels, who won just 63 games last year, could next look to further upgrade their outfield and bullpen. (Photo: Tim Warner / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

De Bruyne is out of contract in the summer and had been planning to speak to the club about his options in recent weeks, but has not started a match since the Champions League meeting with Inter in September. Advertisement “I honestly don’t know,” he said when asked about a new contract. “I knew talks would happen but I unfortunately had the (injury) against Brentford and I put everything to the side, I thought I would be out for two or three days but I ended up being (out) for eight or nine weeks so for the moment I want to get better first and see how I am. “The rest will come, I am not too obsessed with it but there’s not a lot to say. I’m fine, I’m happy, I just want to play good football again and the future we’ll see. “I had a conversation already in the summer but then obviously I had the injury so I was not in the right frame of mind to speak about that, I really want to be back where I need to be on the pitch, be myself again. There’s no rush also so I’m comfortable with my situation, I just want to play football. I’m not really worried.” The 33-year-old revealed that he sustained a problem against Brentford on September 14 that he originally expected to keep him out only for two or three days, but ended up being unable to put any power in his shots. “Every time I would shoot the ball I would get a lot of pain,” he added. “I was trying to find methods to get my power back but it took a long time to get better and actually it only got better on Friday, I can’t explain it, I don’t know why, and now the last few days it’s been better.” City manager Pep Guardiola, who himself signed a new contract with the club this month, emphasised De Bruyne’s importance but said his decision on his future had to be in the best interests of the player and the team. “I don’t know. That is up to Kevin,” Guardiola said. “Whether that is the end of the next one, or the next one, or the next one. Like David Silva, he will decide when is best for him and the team.

Barkley rushed for a franchise-record 255 yards, including 72-yard and 70-yard touchdown runs, and added 47 receiving yards. A.J. Brown reeled in six catches for 109 yards and a TD.  Puka Nacua was the standout performer for the Rams in a losing effort, finishing with nine receptions for 117 yards.  Philadelphia improved to 9-2, staying one game behind the Lions for first place in the NFC. Los Angeles fell to 5-6, one game behind the Cardinals and Seahawks for first place in the remarkably congested NFC West.  GO FURTHER Saquon Barkley’s career night propels Eagles past Rams: Key takeaways The Athletic With the win, the Eagles create more separation in the NFC East and remain one game behind the Detroit Lions for the No. 1 overall seed in the conference. The Rams are still one game back of first place in the NFC West following the loss, remaining firmly in both the divisional and Wild Card races.  Advertisement Brooks Kubena There's a random drug test notice on Saquon Barkley’s locker. It’s Dallas Goedert’s. He slapped it on there as a joke. “I’ve been drug tested enough.”  Saquon Barkley said he partly came to the Eagles to rewrite his story. What is that story right now? “It’s still going. It’s not finished.” Getty Images A late touchdown salvaged Cooper Kupp's stat line tonight, finishing with eight catches for 60 yards and a score.  Prior to his 27-yard touchdown catch with 1:07 remaining, Kupp had seven catches for 33 yards.  That's just 4.7 yards per reception.  Getty Images Without DeVonta Smith (hamstring) in the lineup, all eyes were on A.J. Brown and he showed up in a big way. The 27-year-old wideout reeled in six of his seven targets for 109 yards and a touchdown.  Brown now has over 100 yards receiving in two of his last three games.  Getty Images When healthy this season, Puka Nacua has been utterly outstanding for the Rams. He finished tonight with nine catches for 117 yards, showing off his versatility both as a route runner and a playmaker after the catch. Since returning to the lineup in Week 8, he now has 100+ yards receiving in three of five games.  In one of the games he failed to exceed this mark, he was ejected in the first half and in the other, he finished with 98 receiving yards.     Advertisement Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham, 36, says that he tore his triceps during tonight's game and will have to miss the rest of the season.  Getty Images Saquon Barkley has been so good that even his teammates are speechless at this point. Getty Images Having lost two of their last three games, the Rams upcoming stretch will be pivotal to their playoff hopes but it sure does look difficult on paper. Los Angeles will face the Saints on the road in Week 13 before returning home to face the Buffalo Bills in Week 14. This will be followed by a critical divisional matchup in San Francisco against the 49ers in Week 15. Getty Images Having won seven consecutive games, the Eagles arguably have their biggest test of the season coming up in Week 13 as they travel to Baltimore to face the 7-4 Ravens.  That is followed by a pair of home matchups as Philadelphia faces the Carolina Panthers in Week 14 and the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 15.  Getty Images Jonathan Stewart: Saquon is him!!!

Mike Davis: RBs matter. Letting Saquon walk is crazy.  Advertisement The Athletic The NFC West remains crowded after an eventful Week 12.  Despite a frustrating loss, the Rams remain just one game back of first place. Like Los Angeles the 49ers were blown out today, losing 38-10 in Green Bay. Arizona entered the week alone in first place but lost a crucial game to Seattle. With the home win, the Seahawks moved into a tie for first place with the Cardinals. The Athletic After their blowout win in Los Angeles, the Eagles have extended their lead in the NFC East to three games in the loss column over the Commanders. Washington has lost three straight games, including a 34-26 defeat at home to the Cowboys today. The Buccaneers crushed the Giants 30-7 in New Jersey.  Getty Images Could Howie Roseman gets his third executive of the year? This roster is incredible.  Even on the road, Saquon Barkley is garnering MVP chants after another massive game. He finished the night with 255 rushing yards, including two 70+ yard touchdowns. Getty Images According to Next Gen Stats, Saquon Barkley reached a top speed of 21.38 mph on his 70-yard touchdown run (his first long TD run). That's his fifth play of the season reaching 21+ mph as a ball carrier, the most in the NFL. Expected to gain only four yards on the play, he gained 66 rushing yards over expected, which ranks as the fourth most on any carry in the league this season.

Rams are four players away from contention.  Andrew R.: Rams should probably do something about that open door playing right tackle.  Mike S.: Well among other things I think the Rams may still be searching for a kicker in the future. Add that to a long list.  Patrick M.: It's pretty remarkable how this Rams team has become so defense dependent. The defense keeps rising to the challenge and the offense just can't answer the bell.  Getty Images Byron V.: That Barkley fella is pretty good. Rajesh S.: Wow, just wow. Thank you Giants.  Hillz A.: Saint Saquon.  Chuck W.: Philly D is nice, but that team isn’t .500 without Barkley. MVP for sure.  End of Q4 Eagles 37, Rams 20 Goedert recovers the onside kick, Eagles come out in victory formation with Kenny Pickett under center and that will do it in Los Angeles.

Subscribe to The Athletic on an exclusive offer here. GO FURTHER Ipswich Town 1 Manchester United 1 – That opening goal, Onana’s importance, what Amorim has to do Getty Images And Manchester United defender Diogo Dalot, speaking to BBC Sport post-match, said: ""I think a draw is probably a fair result because we could have done better. We could have controlled much more of the game especially after conceding the goal.  ""We had the spaces but couldn't find the moment to do it. If we are controlled with the ball we can be closer to winning the game."" ""We just need to be ready (to work under new boss Ruben Amorim). For the standard of this club we have to get information really quick.  ""We have only been together with the international players for two or three days so you have to give credit to everyone. He has impacted straight away. The way he transmits ideas is really clear. We just need to put it into practice now."" Advertisement Getty Images Ipswich goalscorer Omari Hutchinson, speaking to BBC Sport, said: ""I thought we showed good character and had a lot of chances. Their keeper made a lot of saves so I thought we could come away with a 2-1 or 3-1 win, but it is a good point in the end. ""It is frustrating to concede so early, a silly goal to give away. But we showed great resilience."" Discussing his goal, he added: ""Very happy. It is my dream come true. I have been working hard for that moment."" Talking to BBC Sport after the game, Kieran McKenna discussed facing the club where he was once a player and coach.  He concluded: ""Everyone knows my history with the club. But today was about Ipswich, the players and the supporters having Manchester United come to the stadium for the first time in 22 years and representing themselves really well."" McKenna added on BBC Radio 5Live: ""We have been pretty consistent across the twelve games. Considering where we have come from to only lose five of the 12 games is pretty good. ""We could have picked up more points for sure, the four draws at home we feel like we could have feasibly won all of them, one of them definitely if the decisions had been right. ""We are there and thereabouts. The players are improving. The season is long and there's still a lot of work to do."" Speaking to BBC Sport post-match, new Manchester United coach Ruben Amorim said: ""We worked on (the early goal) but they have the talent to do it, and then it is all about the players. ""We don't have too many centre-backs so we have to adapt some players. I thought Noussair Mazraoui did very well. He is so smart and is so important for us. He can play anywhere and that kind of player is crucial for our future. ""(The Premier League) is a great environment, a great spectacle. But when the game starts it is like I am back in Portugal or the third division. I am so focused everything is the same.  ""You guys are so lucky to have the best league in the world. I am really happy to be here but today I don't feel much because I like to win games."" Getty Images Kieran McKenna was very measured in the way he spoke to Sky Sports after the match. ""It was a blow conceding the early goal but, as the half went on, we grew in the ascendancy,"" he said. ""We were the dominant team in the first half and deserved to be going in at least level. ""In the second half, Man United had more control and it was difficult. We had to defend with real discipline and I thought we did that well. We didn't give up too many big chances. ""It was a competitive game, we could've won but we could have lost. You take the point and the positives and move onto next week."" Getty Images Ipswich captain Sam Morsy, speaking to Sky Sports post-match, continued: ""We showed a mix of things and we are disappointed not to get the win.  ""(Hutchinson) has got that quality, loads of those (shots) go in in training. He will score loads this season. ""We have good momentum and are getting better and better. The big thing is we keep improving and that is the culture of the football club."" Advertisement Getty Images Perhaps the best indicator of the Ipswich performance is that their captain, Sam Morsy, was frustrated to only come away with a point. ""We're disappointed not to get the win with the chances (we had),"" he told Sky Sports.  ""Their goalkeeper's made a couple of fantastic saves from close range. We did well, we had to show our resilience at the end. ""It's a point in the right direction."" Getty Images In his Sky Sports interview, Amorim was fed the statistic that his team's running stats were the second worst they had been this season and he discussed that. ""If you see the first half, we were a little bit afraid. (Morsy) was always alone and we had to jump on him then Hutchinson was always in dead space, Jonny Evans should have been pressing that guy,"" said the United head coach.  ""But when we haven't had training, it's hard. We had to two days, so they are confused and they stayed where they were. We have to understand the data, to see the data and to understand what happened in the game.  ""First, they have to understand the game then we have to be so much better physically to cope with the high pressure and volume of high-speed running. We need time to work on these things."" Are Ipswich the best bad team ever in the Premier League?  Every time I watch them they are convincingly decent and yet they have nine points. Getty Images Speaking to Sky Sports after the match, Ruben Amorim admitted he isn't thrilled with how many media duties he has. He complained: ""This week I spoke more (to the media) than I did in four years at Sporting.  ""I just want to work with my players.  ""Nothing more."" You're Manchester United manager now, Ruben... get used to it! Ruben Amorim was once again very clear on implementing his style to avoid a repeat of the same problems.  He was asked if his players were confused because they are being told to play in a different way. ""That's the reason, that's really it,"" he told Sky Sports. ""We have two options; we try to just win games and don't risk anything and I guarantee at this stage next year we would have the same problems. ""We will have problems, the players will be confused sometimes but we have to address the new idea and try to be better for this stage next year."" Advertisement Ed Sheeran go away, Amorim is talking tactics here!! Getty Images A very honest opening appraisal from Ruben Amorim when he spoke to Sky Sports after the match. ""It's a tough league. My players were thinking too much during the game, you could feel it,"" he said. ""They were thinking not just about the ball but where they were supposed to be. That is hard. We had all the team together for just two days. ""We needed more physicality. It was a tough match, we lost some balls without pressure. When you start a game like this, you have to control the ball and control the tempo of the game. We cannot do it at the moment but they tried. ""I know it's hard to understand for some (of the players) but they want this."" The statistics don't make particularly good reading for the visitors with the home side recording their highest expected goals (xG) tally of the season. Getty Images As well he might. The Manchester United goalkeeper made five saves today, two of them particularly excellent. Getty Images After 81 seconds, United fans were back on top of the world.  But, at full time, a familiar feeling of frustration lingered. It was the third time they have failed to win in the Premier League after scoring inside the opening two minutes.  In October 1995, they drew 2-2 with Liverpool at Anfield and they were thrashed 6-1 by Tottenham at home in October 2020. Advertisement Premier League The Premier League table still makes very unpleasant reading for Manchester United fans. They finish the weekend one place higher than they started it, but they are still only 12th and losing ground on the teams fighting for the European places. As for Ipswich, they remain in the bottom three but only on goal difference. Today's point sees them climb above Crystal Palace into 18th. Getty Images They might not have won at home yet this season and they are still in the relegation zone, but that was a top performance from Ipswich. These games aren't going to be the ones that define their season and playing how they did today will likely be more than enough to take points from the teams around them. McKenna's men are still very much a work in progress but they will have a real chance of staying up this season.  Here's the anatomy of that opening goal under Ruben Amorim. At just one minute and 21 seconds in, it is Manchester United's earliest goal of the season so far."

George Russell (Mercedes) won the race from pole, while Lewis Hamilton completed a Mercedes one-two. Carlos Sainz rounded out the podium for Ferrari, with Norris (McLaren) sixth. Norris did at least claim a bonus point for the fastest lap, ensuring McLaren head to the penultimate round in Qatar with a 24-point lead over Ferrari in the constructors’ championship.   Subscribe to The Athletic on an exclusive offer here GO FURTHER Max Verstappen clinches fourth F1 championship as George Russell wins Las Vegas GP Getty Images So where does Max Verstappen go from here? Well, there is a record that he could equal next season if he has the hunger for it.  Verstappen is one of four drivers to earn four consecutive drivers’ titles with tonight’s result in Las Vegas — but there is one driver with five. That of course is Michael Schumacher at Ferrari. Over to you, Max and Red Bull. In the meantime, here is the list: Advertisement Getty Images I believe the term here should be ‘game recognises game’, with Fernando Alonso one of the first to congratulate Max Verstappen on his fourth successive world title. What does that mean regarding Formula One history? Here are your multiple world champions: Getty Images There is a fun moment in the paddock as Sky Sports’ presenters interview Max Verstappen, and McLaren team principal Zak Brown interrupts to congratulate him on live TV. As you do. Max gives him a hug, it’s all very cordial, and then he makes the point that it’s nice he’s been able to win it without needing the fastest car. Brown had made the point previously that Verstappen was the best driver driving the best car — but this second half of the season has added a bit more gloss to that impressive career Verstappen is building. Getty Images Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc have both been through most of their media duties, and you can cut the tension with a knife — even if the two Ferrari teammates are trying to wear a smile while they speak. In short, both have said they’ve agreed to not talk about their respective frustrations in public and leave it until they sit down together in private. So what’s the beef? Well in truth, we don’t know — but it certainly sounds like a misunderstanding over what the team is agreeing with the drivers in terms of strategy before a race, and what then takes place out on the track. I’m sure we haven’t heard the end of this one, and they still have a constructors’ championship to fight for over the remaining two rounds.  That picture of George Russell is not my favorite photo though. That is this, from one of my realizations over the course of this grand prix… It’s Pierre Gasly doing a quick reactions warm-up with a ball on the grid, just minutes before the formation lap.  Sadly, such routines don’t help when your car breaks after a few laps and you’re forced to retire after stunning the paddock by qualifying third. A case of what might have been for Alpine in Nevada. Getty Images It is Max Verstappen’s season, but maybe this is George Russell’s night? I’ll tell you what though — he doesn’t half take a brilliant photo. There have been some real corkers after his Las Vegas GP win.  📸 Clive Rose/Getty Images  Advertisement Formula 1 What does a world title look like? It’s looks like this.  Max Verstappen breaks the 400 points barrier for the season and he is now uncatchable at the top. Lando Norris still looks secure in second, and that might explain why Charles Leclerc has been in a grump for the evening.  There are some strong radio exchanges doing the rounds where in essence, the Monogasque driver feels the respect he has shown his Ferrari teammate Carlos Sainz, has not been reciprocated.  Things unraveling a little at Maranello ahead of Sainz’s winter departure then… Getty Images Mercedes chief Toto Wolff has just offered his congratulations to Max Verstappen: 💬 “The deserving champion. It was clear that he was one of the great ones before that already.  “Now a four-time world champion, he dominated in the first half of the year. Domination of the driver, domination of a car, and in the second half of the season, domination of a driver.  “Absolutely worthy four-time world champion.” Formula 1 Every point counts, and that fastest lap bonus from Lando Norris ensured McLaren holds onto 24 points of their constructors’ championship lead with two races (and a sprint) to go. Red Bull looks like it’s out of it now, although they could still mathematically pull it out of the bag.  So, all eyes on Ferrari and McLaren come Qatar — where there are also sprint race points on offer. Getty Images One thing you may have missed in all the late victories was Lando Norris’ bid to claim the point for tonight’s fastest lap. He picked that up, Oscar Piastri allowed him the room to pit for new tires and do it (1:34.876), and that was the McLaren salvage operation to protect their constructors’ championship position. Getty Images As for the rest of the field, here’s the final result. There were just the two retirements in the end: Advertisement Getty Images That was a fun race, hey? Here’s how the top 10 finished and how the drivers’ world title was won:  Getty Images Besides all the joy and excitement, you can also tell what this meant to George Russell. He loved that — and he may well love having Mercedes behind him in total come 2025 too… Getty Images Contrast Verstappen with George Russell, our race winner who looks like a man ready to bounce off the walls in Las Vegas: 💬 “I was planning on flying in a couple of hours, but I am definitely not getting on that flight — I’m going to enjoy this with all my team.  “Vegas is just a crazy, crazy place. To get pole, a dominant weekend, a one-two with Lewis as well — I was just waiting for something to happen, the last two I’ve had on pole have been crazy races with rain, red flags.  “But I’m so, so happy right now.” Getty Images Max Verstappen looked calm and collected, as well as happy, as he gave his initial reaction to his fourth world title: 💬 “It’s been a long season. We started off cruising, and we have to be proud of everyone. To stand here as a four-time world champion, I never thought it was possible. I’m relieved in a way, and very proud. “It was a very challenging season. I had to be calm and in a way, I still prefer last season. But this season taught me a lot of lessons and I’m very proud of how we handled it as a team.” Getty Images It’s been slow going, but the podium interviews are done, with a bonus chat from Max Verstappen — and now the drivers have made it onto the podium for the national anthems. Reaction on the way... Advertisement Getty Images In case you were wondering who flew the checkered flag as George Russell won the Las Vegas Grand Prix, and Max Verstappen won his fourth successive drivers’ championship. Yes, it was Sylvester Stallone.  Getty Images This is from F1 CEO, Stefano Domenicali: 💬 “I want to congratulate Max on an incredible season and his fourth world title. He is a true great of this sport and has so much more to look forward to in his impressive career.  “This season has been thrilling and 2025 looks set to be even closer. Congratulations Max and congratulations to all the team at Red Bull.” Getty Images The podium drivers have just got into a limousine. All three of them on the back seat. It looks cozy. Max Verstappen gets his own car too, given he’ll also join them on the podium as the world champion."
Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How George Russell took Las Vegas GP pole for Mercedes in F1 qualifying,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/live-blogs/f1-vegas-qualifying-live-updates-results-fp3-news/rU8R2orXiGmO/,"Sun, 24 Nov 2024 09:32:45 GMT","George Russell, the last driver to cross the line at the end of qualifying, took P1 ahead of Carlos Sainz and Pierre Gasly","George Russell put together a perfect final qualifying lap in his Mercedes to take pole position for Saturday's Las Vegas Grand Prix.  He pipped Carlos Sainz by less than a tenth, with Pierre Gasly following next in a stunning P3.  Max Verstappen, who can clinch his fourth straight drivers' championship this weekend, will start the race in fifth, one position ahead of his title rival Lando Norris in sixth.  Lights out for the grand prix is Saturday night at 10pm PST, which is 1am EST and 6am GMT.  Getty Images As the dust settles, here is the provisional grid in full for the Las Vegas Grand Prix on Saturday night — which of course, you will be able to follow in full live with us here at The Athletic: Bottas was 19th fastest but has a five-place grid penalty for tomorrow after taking his fourth energy store of the season, exceeding the limit allowed. There will also be a question mark over whether Franco Colapinto will make the race, following his high-speed crash and the damage done to his Williams. Advertisement Getty Images There will be the race to win the Las Vegas Grand Prix tomorrow, and then there will be the race to become world champion. Max Verstappen’s task to claim the title in Nevada is now a bit clearer following qualifying. He will start tomorrow P5, alongside his chief rival Lando Norris (P6) on the third row. If the pair finish the race in those same positions, Verstappen will be crowned champion — as he will if he holds a lead of at least 60 points over Norris leaving Las Vegas.  His current lead is 62 points. Getty Images Lewis Hamilton is cutting a figure who knows his future lies elsewhere, which we all already know given his impending winter swift to Ferrari.   But that Q3 today should have been much better than it finished.  Had Hamilton recreated his best Q2 time of 1:32.567 in Q3 — he really should have managed that given the improving grip — then he would be lining up P3 for tomorrow’s grand prix. Instead he locked up on his first shot, ran wide on his second, and finished bottom of the top-10 shootout. All while his Mercedes teammate claimed pole. No wonder he looked glum in the media pen afterwards. I’d share the quotes, but it really was his expression that said it all.  The shift in dynamic this season has been well represented by qualifying — but Las Vegas did not play ball.  Max Verstappen stuck his Red Bull on pole for the first seven races, Lando Norris had done so in six of the previous nine grands prix. But neither were that close to grabbing the front row this weekend. This is George Russell’s third pole position of the year, the fourth of his career and his first since the British Grand Prix in July. Yet his Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton, along with McLaren’s Oscar Piastri, both remain without a pole in 2024. Ferrari are the only team to avoid a Q1 exit this year, while Verstappen and — more impressively — RB’s Liam Lawson also have a blemish-free record heading into the final two race weekends.  Getty Images With qualifying completed in Las Vegas, let’s update the team head-to-head records — arguably the purest battle between two teammates all season.  Here’s how it looks at each team after 22 rounds (Vegas winner in bold): Getty Images We’ve had an update via Luke Smith from Williams on Franco Colapinto, following his heavy crash at the end of Q2: 💬 “During qualifying, Franco sustained a significant impact of over 50G, requiring a medical check up. An impact of this magnitude is obviously significant and severe, and he will need to be evaluated again tomorrow before we will know whether he is clear to race.  “Franco’s health is all that matters and we are glad he is otherwise OK. We will provide further updates when we can.” There will also need to be a car ready for him to race. Those repairs will be a serious undertaking for the Williams mechanics over the coming hours. GO FURTHER George Russell takes pole at the Las Vegas GP, Verstappen qualifies ahead of Norris Advertisement Getty Images How about Alpine’s form then? Pierre Gasly was on the podium alongside Esteban Ocon in the wet in Brazil. Now he’s turned in a stunning lap in the dry of Las Vegas to grab third on the grid for tomorrow. Here is the Frenchman’s reaction from the quali podium:  💬 “It’s unbelievable. Honestly, we didn’t think we’d be able to achieve a top three in quali. “It was an incredible lap, especially around this track. You are flirting with the walls right through the lap, a lot of adrenaline, a lot of excitement. “I knew crossing the line it was a good lap, but when they came up on the radio telling me we’re lining up third tomorrow… It’s just amazing.” It seems the first impressions on Rui Marques, F1’s new race director, are positive.  George Russell and Carlos Sainz say in the press conference that Marques responded quickly to feedback on track limits and making the pit exit line more visible after the drivers’ briefing. Sainz said: 💬 “I think the drivers’ briefing yesterday was one of the best that we’ve had for a long time.” Getty Images Carlos Sainz could well be the most underrated driver on the grid. Again, he delivers pace and even convinced himself for a moment of top spot. Here’s the Ferrari driver’s quali reaction:  💬 “That was a tough, tight quali. I was a bit closer to pole than what I was expecting. Actually, I thought I had pole and then George came very, very quick at the end. “We’re starting in a good position for tomorrow. We need to stay confident that tomorrow we could be fighting at the front even more than today.” Getty Images It wasn’t what George Russell was expecting, but maybe he should have — this Mercedes has been quick all weekend so far. Here he is, speaking from the qualifying podium: 💬 “It was incredible to be back on pole. We’ve been so quick all weekend and I just knew coming into that last Q3 lap, it was going to be the one that counts. “We had to change the front wing and there was a moment I thought we weren’t going to make the flag, but just so happy and we’ve got to do some deep dive to understand why it’s been so quick so far this weekend, because it was a real surprise.” Getty Images That was also an interesting qualifying in terms of the constructors’ championship.  McLaren may well lead that going into the final three rounds of the season, but it will be Ferrari that has P2 and P4 on the grid tomorrow — with McLaren and Red Bull looking at some degree of points losses already.  There has also been a lot of talk of the red team’s confidence in their potential race pace tomorrow.  Ferrari’s current deficit to McLaren is 36 points. Advertisement Getty Images A nice bit of added spice to the title picture on a weekend when Verstappen could be crowned champion, is that he will start alongside Lando Norris on the third row of the grid as they line up fifth and sixth.  I wonder how ‘elbows out’ it might get on the opening lap. Getty Images Sergio Perez stopped in the media pen following his Q1 exit for Red Bull. As you can imagine, he wasn’t best pleased with looking at a P16 start tomorrow: 💬 “We’ve been lacking a lot of pace through the qualifying, and that’s been the main issue really for us. In hindsight, we should have used two sets (of tires) given we were not so competitive in Q1.  “Tomorrow is going to be a very tricky one…I think we’ve got a fundamental issue at the moment with the car that is just not working for me. “Obviously it’s not ideal. You want to be up there, especially I know what I can do. But when you don’t have that grip underneath you, then it’s really hard and you’re prone to a lot of mistakes.”  Getty Images That’s the top-10 of the provisional grid sorted for tomorrow’s Las Vegas Grand Prix then. Here’s what it looks like: Max Verstappen got a good spot on track to go quick, but his best — 1:32.797 was only good enough for P5, behind both Ferraris. But perhaps crucially, it isn’t behind either McLaren. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri will start P6 and P8 respectively, sandwiching an impressive qualifying from Yuki Tsunoda. Getty Images Seriously, what a lap from Gasly to grab P3 on the grid for Alpine. The team is riding high after the Brazil double podium, but to repeat that kind of pace in dry conditions is a mighty result.  Advertisement Getty Images ⏰ 0:00 Sainz goes fastest with a 1:32.410, toppling a stunner from the Alpine of Pierre Gasly (1:32.664). But here comes George Russell! The Mercedes takes pole with 1:32.312. That is pole by less than 0.1s. ⏰ 0:00 The checkered flag is out! These current laps are the only ones left that will count. Russell remains the only driver into the 1:32s as it stands — but that will surely change… Getty Images ⏰ 01:59 Into the final two minutes, it’s Verstappen and then Russell who head out — with the other eight cars already on track. This is it, the final shootout for Vegas pole."

The Shamrock Series game at Yankee Stadium was dripping in history, with the Irish (10-1) and Black Knights (9-1) matching up as ranked foes for the first time since 1958. Big games between Notre Dame and Army at Yankee Stadium were regular events that captivated the country back in the 1940s. This one drew a sellout crowd to the Bronx, but it was no classic. Continue reading here. GO FURTHER Notre Dame routs Army to keep CFP hosting bid in focus: Inside Irish’s service-academy sweep Getty Images Jeremiyah Love, who had three touchdowns in tonight's game, was matter of fact about the win. “This win is just like every other win.” Love said.  Adon Shuler stressed the importance of eliminating the penalties and what it will do for Notre Dame if they reduce the mistakes. ""We eliminate the penalties and I don’t think any team can score on us,"" Shuler said. Advertisement Getty Images Tonight was the fifth game this season that Notre Dame did not have any turnovers.  Getty Images Army coach Jeff Monken was candid in his postgame remarks about how the game went.  ""They are really athletic and well coached,"" Monken said of Notre Dame. ""They out-classed us.” Getty Images If Army was going to have a shot against Notre Dame, Daily had to carry the heaviest weight. And defensive coordinator Al Golden gave the Black Knights quarterback little chance, as the Irish loaded up at the line of scrimmage and pounded Daily for all four quarters. More telling, Army called Daily runs four times on fourth down and failed to convert on the first three. The fourth was good, but it came with just 32 seconds remaining in the game. That amounts to a failure for the Black Knights, which were ranked No. 2 nationally in fourth down conversions (16 of 19). Army can’t win without short-yardage successes and its quarterback delivering. It got neither in Yankee Stadium. Unlike the Navy game last month, when Notre Dame played base defense against the Mids’ reimagined option offense, Army let Golden play bully ball by loading the box. With Army not posing a threat in the pass game, Notre Dame played eight-man and nine-man boxes much of the game. The Irish often put five defensive linemen on the field at once, or at least walked up linebackers outside of the defensive ends. That approach clogged up run lanes, which Army couldn’t clear with its offensive line. And that left Daily to take hit after hit after hit. Eighteen different Notre Dame players made at least two tackles, with Adon Shuler (8) and Jaiden Ausberry (7) leading the way. Getty Images Notre Dame probably didn’t need to win with much style against Army after losses by Indiana and Ole Miss earlier in the day softened up the field of at-large hopefuls. The Irish did so anyway, all but locking up a first-round home game if they can handle USC next weekend in Los Angeles. The Irish made short and efficient work of Jeff Monken’s squad. At halftime, Notre Dame had outgained Army 258-85. The Irish had 13 plays of 10-plus yards compared to one by the Black Knights, and that lone big chunk ended in a Daily lost fumble. And then Love went 68 yards for a touchdown on the first play of the second half, removing any remaining doubt for a game that contained little of it starting not long after kickoff. During its nine-game win streak, the Irish have outscored opponents by a combined score of 392-92. Notre Dame has emptied its bench in each of the past six games. Will the College Football Playoff selection committee notice? There’s no ignoring the losses by Indiana and Ole Miss on Saturday, but it’s less clear how Notre Dame now compares to Penn State. Both are one-loss teams. The Nittany Lions’ best win is an overtime victory at USC. Penn State escaped Saturday with a one-point win at Minnesota. And while both Notre Dame and Penn State would both be ticketed for home games in the CFP as it stands, the difference between the No. 6 seed and No. 7 seed could be the difference between drawing the ACC champion in the quarterfinals and the SEC champion in that same round. Getty Images This certainly won’t help the Black Knights’ case with the selection committee, but Army is still in the mix to be the highest ranked Group of 5 conference champion. With one remaining American Athletic Conference game next week at home against UTSA, Army has already locked up a spot in the conference title game against Tulane on Dec. 6. The site of that game is yet to be determined. Losing so decisively to Notre Dame is going to leave the Black Knights without much to sway the committee beyond the victory against Tulane they would need on their resume to be considered. If you think Indiana’s schedule is weak, well, go check out Army’s. Not great. Especially if No. 12 Boise State keeps on winning in the Mountain West. The Broncos got bogged down at Wyoming but survived 17-13 to remain unbeaten since a last-second loss at Oregon in Week 2. The Cadets had rarely trailed through their 9-0 start but looked totally overmatched against Notre Dame. Army came in allowing 4.7 yards per play. The Irish averaged 9.8. Advertisement Getty Images Notre Dame concludes its regular season next Saturday Nov. 30 against USC.  Getty Images Army hosts UTSA next Saturday before taking on Navy in the historic Army-Navy Game on Dec. 14. Getty Images Notre Dame did a lot of things right in Saturday's 49-14 win over Army, but the rushing attack truly led the way.  The Fighting Irish totaled 273 rushing yards and five touchdowns against the Black Knights, with three different tailbacks getting on the scoresheet. Jeremiyah Love led the way with 130 yards and two scores of his own while Jadarian Price (53 rush yards, two TDs) and Aneyas Williams (62 rush yards, one TD) also got in on the fun.  It marked the second-most rushing yards in a game for Notre Dame this season (362 rush yards versus Purdue, Sept. 14).  Getty Images After tonight's win, Notre Dame has the best FBS point differential (+301).  Getty Images Riley Leonard: 10-of-13 passes for 148 yards and two touchdowns.  Bryson Daily: 4-of-8 passes for 26 yards, 145 rushing yards for two rushing touchdowns.  Advertisement  Army's undefeated record might have come to an end against Notre Dame, but quarterback Bryson Daily delivered a valiant performance. Daily rushed 35 times for 129 yards and two touchdowns, leaving Yankee Stadium as the Black Knights' top offensive contributor. The senior quarterback has now registered 100+ rushing yards or more in eight of nine games this season, tying Mike Mayweather's program record which was set in 1990. He's also registered eight multi-touchdown games, a statistic Daily will now take into the American Athletic Conference (AAC) Championship game next weekend.   Getty Images A mismatch in every sense of the word as the Irish stage a defensive clinic against the option and let their game-breaking speed loose on the perimeter. Bottom line: Notre Dame will host a College Football Playoff game if it wins at USC next week. True freshman Aneyas Williams even got in on Notre Dame's fun at Yankee Stadium.  Williams extended the Fighting Irish's lead tonight over Army after racing into the end zone from 58 yards out. Williams entered the game with 112 rushing yards this season but now set a new career-high with his longest rush of the year.   Getty Images This is the longest winning streak for Notre Dame under coach Marcus Freeman (nine games).      Getty Images Notre Dame wins its ninth straight game tonight against Army. During the nine-game win streak, Notre Dame has out-scored the opposition 399-92. Advertisement Getty Images Q4 0:22 Army 14, Notre Dame 49  What a drive for Bryson Daily. He gets several third-down conversions and adds a fourth-down conversion at the end, eventually running into the end zone for the touchdown.  Daily gets his second touchdown of the game, despite Army suffering its first loss of the season.  Q4 0:32 Army 7, Notre Dame 49  Bryson Daily converts the first down with a two-yard run on fourth down. It isn't enough for the touchdown but enough to move the chains. Q4 0:37 Army 7, Notre Dame 49  It's fourth-and-goal with less than a minute to go. Army's going to lose this game but they have one last play to try and get a touchdown before the game's end."

Subscribe to The Athletic on an exclusive offer here. GO FURTHER Arsenal 3 Nottingham Forest 0 – Ethan Nwaneri’s first league goal and the Martin Odegaard effect  And Arteta was happy to hail the impact of Ethan Nwaneri, the academy product who came off the bench to score the third goal. He said: ""He is the second youngest (Premier League goalscorer) in our history. That's a story in itself.  ""He's brave. You see the reaction of fans and they were singing 'he's one of our own'. I think we have to put brick by brick and make sure the cement doesn't get dry. Hopefully we can build a beautiful thing with him."" Advertisement Getty Images We've heard from the Nottingham Forest manager and one of his players who both said they were not good enough to trouble Arsenal this afternoon and that was reflected in the fact they did not have a shot on target. It is the first time Forest have finished a Premier League match without a shot on target since April of last year, against Manchester City. Very, very rarely can you win a game of football without having a shot on target. Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, speaking to BBC Match of the Day post-game, said: ""I think we started really well. The sense I was getting in the last 48 hours after the international break, the boys coming together and were all at it. ""It was good to see the impact of the substitutes. Everyone has to feel important. It was a good afternoon."" Describing the impact of captain Martin Odegaard returning and the team putting in a good performance, the Spaniard added: ""It's not a coincidence. The team flows in a different way when he is playing."" Getty Images A landmark day for Mikel Arteta who was taking charge of his 250th Arsenal game, and a landmark day for the club who have now won 2,000 games in the English top flight. They are the second time to reach that milestone after Liverpool, who now have 2,068. Getty Images Nottingham Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo was not happy with his side's performance at the Emirates. ""They played well and we didn't play so well,"" he told BBC Sport. ""Arsenal were the better team. Second half we became more pressing but they killed us with the second and third goals. There's not much to say.  ""We have to improve because we did a lot of bad things - especially with the defending. Losing is always very painful.  ""We came up short."" Getty Images Bukayo Saka benefitted massively from having Odegaard nearby him on Arsenal's right-hand side, as he scored the game's first goal and assisted the second. It moves the 23-year-old onto 12 goal involvements for the season in the Premier League — only Mohamed Salah (14) has more. Advertisement Getty Images The Nottingham Forest players will be the first to know that they were some way off their best today, as highlighted by James Ward-Prowse's comments to Sky Sports after the match. ""On a day like this you need to be solid defensively and take your chances,"" he said. ""Ultimately it was not good enough and it was three relatively easy goals for them. ""We are going to have to improve our defensive structure."" Getty Images I find it astounding that, before his recent injury, there were portions of the Arsenal fanbase claiming that the team was better without Martin Odegaard. His performances today and against Chelsea before the international break showed why he is the essential cog in Mikel Arteta's machine — he was sublime. He attempted 67 passes in the match, completed 60 and created chances for his team-mates with six of them. A supreme showing from the 25-year-old. The Athletic's Jordan Campbell was on hand to deliver The Briefing from the Emirates — check it out at the link below. GO FURTHER Arsenal 3 Nottingham Forest 0 – Ethan Nwaneri’s first league goal and the Martin Odegaard effect Getty Images What a moment for young Ethan Nwaneri scoring his first Premier League goal. In making it 3-0 off the bench, he became Arsenal's second youngest goalscorer in the competition. The youngest? Cesc Fabregas, who was 134 days younger than Nwaneri when he scored against Blackburn in August 2004.  Perhaps surprisingly, the opening goal was the first Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard have combined for since February. Advertisement As you can see from the picture, pretty close. Right decision though, in the end. Getty Images Six games down and one to go in the Premier League today. A huge win for Wolves in west London, a battling point for Crystal Palace at Villa Park, a super win for 10-man Brighton at Bournemouth, and a disappointing draw for Everton against Brentford who were also down to 10. Getty Images Obviously, there have been a few international matches stretching the domestic calendar, but you might be surprised to note that today was Arsenal's first Premier League win since October 5. It also marked their first league clean sheet since September 15. Getty Images Nottingham Forest have been outclassed at Arsenal today. Matz Sels made some good saves to keep the score down to 1-0 in the first half, with Nuno Espirito Santo’s side unable to shackle the brilliance of Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard.  The Belgian keeper could have done little with any of the three goals, as Arsenal picked Forest apart with their crisp, urgent passing. The home side did everything with tempo and the visitors just could not keep up. Forest must take solace from the fact that this was their first Premier League away defeat of the season. They started the day level on points with their hosts. But that was not reflected on the pitch, where there was a gulf in class for long periods. Getty Images That's it! Arsenal win 3-0, inflicting Nottingham Forest's first away defeat of the season. Much deserved too. Advertisement Getty Images Ethan Nwaneri is even trusted to take corners.  A better strike from Gabriel at the far post and he might have had an assist too. 90+1' Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest Into the first minute of six added on. Arsenal fans, near-delirious with delight, sing 'Oh Ethan Nwaneri, he's one of our own'. What a feeling that must be for the teenager. 90' Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest Jota Silva slams a loose ball into the net at the back post after Chris Wood flicked a header across goal, with Forest fans finally given something to cheer about. Or are they? No. Jota Silva wags his finger at the linesman, but replays show he was well offside. There is a VAR check, but it's a potential red card check for a poor tackle from Callum Hudson-Odoi on William Saliba. The verdict: no goal, and play on."
MLB News,The free-agent hitters with the best tools,https://www.mlb.com/news/best-tools-among-2024-25-mlb-free-agent-hitters,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 03:07:48 GMT",,"David Adler The 2024-25 free agent class is full of players with standout skill sets. Let's find the free agents with the best individual tools. Baseball's five tools are the classic way to categorize a player -- contact hitting, power, speed, defense and arm strength. There's a lot more that goes into being an MLB star, of course, but looking at the five tools is a nice and simple way to break down which free agents stand out, depending on what a team needs. Here are the current free-agent hitters who are the best at each tool (only one tool per player, no repeats). Soto might be MLB's best all-around hitter. He's an elite contact hitter, and an elite power hitter. We'll pick him for contact here, because his signature skill is being the toughest at-bat in baseball. And every metric backs that up. In 2024, Soto ranked second in the Majors in expected batting average (.316, just behind Vladimir Guerrero Jr.), based on his quality of contact. He ranked first in the percentage of his swings that produced hard contact (23.8%). Soto was also the only hitter who ranked in the top 10% of MLB in both average bat speed (75.5 mph) and how often he squared up the ball on the sweet spot of the bat (32% of his swings). Soto ranked in the 94th percentile of MLB in both metrics. That means his contact ability is really in a class of its own -- not just putting the bat on the ball, but putting the right part of the bat on the ball, at a high bat speed, all the time. Honorable mention: Alex Bregman, Jurickson Profar You could make the case that Soto is also the best power hitter in this free-agent class, but we're going with one tool per player, and there's another top-tier pure power hitter available: Alonso. Alonso has never failed to eclipse 50 barrels in a full season in his career -- barrels are Statcast's top level of contact quality, balls hit with both ideal exit velocity and ideal launch angle, which are likely to turn into home runs and extra-base hits. Alonso, Soto and Matt Olson are the only hitters with five 50-barrel seasons since Alonso's rookie season in 2019. That includes 58 barrels for Alonso in 2024, and 329 since 2019 -- that's fourth-most of any hitter over that time, behind only Aaron Judge, Shohei Ohtani and Soto. Alonso was also top-10 in Statcast's expected home runs for 2024 (based on how many ballparks where his batted balls would be home runs) and ranked sixth with 22 no-doubter home runs (homers that would be gone at all 30 parks). Honorable mention: Soto, Anthony Santander, Teoscar Hernández There aren't many elite speedsters in free agency this winter, but Kim has a good blend of raw speed and turning that speed into results on the baseball field. Kim's 28.3 ft/sec sprint speed in 2024 ranked in the top quarter of the Majors (MLB average sprint speed is 27 ft/sec), and he used that sprint speed to steal 22 bases. If you tack on the 2023 season, when Kim had a 28.5 ft/sec sprint speed and swiped 38 bags, he has a 28.4 ft/sec sprint speed and 60 stolen bases over the last two years. The strictly fastest player available is probably Garrett Hampson (29.8 ft/sec sprint speed), but he doesn't run as often as Kim, so Kim's speed tool makes a bigger impact on the bases. Kim provides both raw speed and game speed. Honorable mention: Garrett Hampson, Travis Jankowski First base might not be a premier defensive position, but Walker is in a tier of his own with his glove. He's not just one of the best defensive first basemen, he's one of the top fielders at any position. Over the last three seasons with the D-backs -- during which he's won three consecutive Gold Glove Awards -- Walker has been worth +39 Outs Above Average at first base. That makes him a top-10 fielder in the Major Leagues, period (and a top-five infielder), trailing only Dansby Swanson, Andrés Giménez, Daulton Varsho, Ke'Bryan Hayes, Marcus Semien and José Siri. He's by far the best first baseman, 20 OAA ahead of the next-best fielder at his position, fellow free agent Carlos Santana. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Walker has ranked in the 97th percentile of MLB fielders or better by OAA in each of the last three seasons, including 2024, when he posted a +13 OAA. Honorable mention: Nicky Lopez, Willy Adames Bader has been an elite defensive center fielder since he came into the Major Leagues. From his first full season in 2018 through 2024, he's amassed +74 Outs Above Average, the best among all MLB outfielders (just ahead of Kevin Kiermaier) and fifth-best among all MLB fielders at any position (behind only Francisco Lindor, Nick Ahmed, Swanson and Nolan Arenado). Bader has stayed remarkably consistent with his glove over the years. The 2024 season was his fifth in the last seven years where he was worth double-digit Outs Above Average (Bader finished at +10 for the Mets). He's one of only 11 outfielders since Statcast began tracking catch probability in 2016 to make at least 50 plays with a catch probability of 50% or lower. Honorable mention: Michael A. Taylor Adames is the top shortstop on the free-agent market this winter thanks to his combination of power and defense, and his arm has always helped him make his plays at short. Over the past three seasons, he's posted average arm strengths of 90.0 mph, 88.1 mph and 88.2 mph, which isn't at the very, very top of the shortstop position, but is a strong enough arm to place Adames in the upper quartile of shortstops each year, and on the higher end of infielders in general. Honorable mention: Ha-Seong Kim Verdugo had one of the best arms among left fielders in 2024, averaging 91.7 mph in left for the Yankees. Across all three outfield positions, his overall arm strength was even a little higher, 92.1 mph, ranking in the 94th percentile of all MLB fielders. It was Verdugo's second straight season in the top 10% of the league in arm strength, after he averaged 92.8 mph in 2023 (95th percentile). His max arm strength was over 98 mph in both seasons. He also frequently turns his strong throws into outs on the bases. Verdugo has eight outfield assists with a tracked arm strength of 90 mph or higher over the last two seasons -- five in 2023 with the Red Sox, three in 2024 with the Yankees -- including top marks of 96.4 mph last year and 95.0 mph this year. Honorable mention: Michael A. Taylor, Harrison Bader"
MLB News,Where will Sasaki sign? 6 intriguing teams for potential ace,https://www.mlb.com/news/teams-that-could-sign-roki-sasaki,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 03:08:25 GMT",,"MLB.com Because it might take a record-breaking contract to reel in Juan Soto, the top free agent available this offseason naturally has a somewhat limited market of suitors. Roki Sasaki, though? That’s a much different story. Sasaki is expected to be posted by his NPB team, the Chiba Lotte Marines, by Dec. 15. Since he is under 25 years old, Sasaki is subject to international bonus pool restrictions (as Shohei Ohtani was in 2017). That means all 30 teams can bid on the 23-year-old right-hander, especially given that he apparently intends to sign after Jan. 15, thereby making him part of the 2025 international amateur signing class. A potential ace still in his early 20s would fit on any roster, but there are some destinations -- aside from the most obvious -- that stand out as more intriguing than others. These aren’t necessarily the most likely places for Sasaki to land, but rather where the storylines would certainly be intriguing. Here is one such team per division, picked by a group of MLB.com writers. The deck is stacked against the AL East if Sasaki indeed prefers to sign with a West Coast club as some have reported. That said, there are believed to be some East Coast teams in the mix, including the reigning AL champion Yankees -- but what about Boston? Since Sasaki won't be signing a massive deal along the lines of Yoshinobu Yamamoto's $325 million contract with the Dodgers last offseason, he could look to offset some of that sizable gap with endorsement deals, as mentioned by The Athletic's Jim Bowden. In New York, Sasaki would be battling not only Yankees superstar Aaron Judge -- and possibly Juan Soto, pending his free agent decision -- but also the crosstown rival Mets and their superstar shortstop Francisco Lindor for the spotlight. (Not to mention the Knicks, Jets and Giants, among other New York sports teams.) But Boston presents a major market -- and plenty of opportunity. The Red Sox have made just one postseason appearance in the past six seasons, but they're coming off a third-place finish after back-to-back last-place seasons in the East. With superstar Rafael Devers being joined by blossoming stars Jarren Duran and Wilyer Abreu in the lineup, the Sox could certainly use a top-tier starter to anchor a young rotation that showed flashes last season with Tanner Houck, Kutter Crawford and Brayan Bello. Boston is reportedly interested in signing at least one pitcher from the free-agent trio of Corbin Burnes, Max Fried and Blake Snell – but pairing one of those guys with Sasaki wouldn’t be a bad contingency. -- Paul Casella Detroit just reached the postseason for the first time in a decade with one of the youngest rosters in the Majors. With the Tigers' competitive window just now opening, they can’t rest on that success. Now is the time to attack in free agency. It sounds as if president of baseball operations Scott Harris is ready to be aggressive this winter, and what better way to signal that you mean business than by landing one of the most talented young pitchers available? Pairing Sasaki with reigning American League Cy Young Award winner Tarik Skubal might give Detroit the best righty-lefty combination of any rotation. Add in Jackson Jobe, who debuted in September and is the No. 5 prospect in MLB, and suddenly the Tigers have what could be a dominant trio leading their staff for many years to come -- assuming they extend their decorated ace. Is Sasaki the right fit for a roster that has one pitcher in his 30s (Sasaki’s fellow countryman, Kenta Maeda)? Of course! Sasaki's immense talent fits any roster, but in Detroit, he would join a team on the rise, band together with the best pitcher in the AL and accelerate the Tigers’ trek to the top of their division. -- Brian Murphy Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. While it’s true that the Mariners could use an upgrade or two in their lineup (their .224 team batting average ranked 29th in the Majors last season), the addition of Sasaki could turn an already formidable Seattle starting rotation into a true monster. A Sasaki-Mariners fit makes sense on multiple fronts. Not only would his addition bolster a starting staff that already features Luis Castillo, Logan Gilbert and George Kirby -- just to name three -- but the franchise boasts a rich history of Japanese players headlined by Ichiro Suzuki, who has a great chance to be elected to the Hall of Fame in his first year on the BBWAA ballot. From Ichiro to Kazuhiro Sasaki to Hisashi Iwakuma, the Mariners have featured many great Japanese players over the years. Adding Roki Sasaki to that tradition could help cement a rotation that led MLB with a 3.38 ERA last season as the best in baseball. -- Manny Randhawa Washington has posted five straight losing seasons since its 2019 World Series title, but there’s light at the end of the tunnel for the rebuilding club. While the Nationals went 71-91 for a second consecutive year in 2024, they saw glimpses of a brighter future as their core started to come together. The Nats are especially loaded on the position-player front, highlighted by the quartet of CJ Abrams, James Wood, Luis García Jr. and Dylan Crews (MLB Pipeline’s No. 1 prospect). None of those players is older than 24. Washington also has some promising arms, including MacKenzie Gore, DJ Herz and Mitchell Parker. Now, imagine adding Sasaki to that nucleus. The flamethrowing righty has the potential to be the bona fide ace the team is missing, and at 23 years old, he aligns more closely with the Nationals’ next championship window than the high-priced veteran pitchers available on the free-agent market this year. -- Thomas Harrigan Roki Sasaki and Paul Skenes. Enough said. Sasaki and Skenes would make the Pirates THE must-watch rotation in baseball. They're two of the most hyped young pitchers ever. Sasaki is 23. Skenes is 22. They're going to be lighting up the Major Leagues for years to come -- so imagine them doing it together. Skenes and Sasaki in the same rotation could be the pitching equivalent of Aaron Judge and Juan Soto in the same lineup with the Yankees or Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman with the Dodgers -- except if all of those players had started their careers together and risen to superstardom simultaneously. Skenes and Sasaki both have 100-plus mph fastballs. They both have a signature secondary pitch -- Skenes' splinker, Sasaki's splitter -- that is among the nastiest pitches in the world. They might be dueling for the title of ""best pitcher in baseball"" for the next decade. Why not do it as teammates? -- David Adler It won’t surprise anyone if Sasaki goes to the Dodgers, and it would be fun to see him join forces with Ohtani and Yamamoto, his teammates on the World Baseball Classic championship-winning Samurai Japan squad in 2023. That would give the defending World Series champion Dodgers three Japanese stars in the rotation, when healthy. But … purely from the standpoint of baseball theater, wouldn’t it be more fun to see Sasaki pair with Yu Darvish and go up against Ohtani and Yamamoto? (Not to mention pitch against Betts, Freeman, Ohtani and the rest of the Dodgers’ machine.) That would be the ultimate example of trying to be the best by beating the best, all while giving San Diego a stronger chance of keeping up with its neighbor to the north. Really, the storylines write themselves here. The Dodgers-Padres rivalry stands as one of the hottest in baseball right now, with the two teams battling each other all season in the NL West and, frequently in recent years, in October. Both have dealt the other a heartbreaking NLDS loss in the past three seasons. Both have stars aplenty. Now, imagine Sasaki in that mix, potentially dueling both Ohtani the hitter and Ohtani the pitcher in the same game. It doesn’t get much better than that. -- Andrew Simon"
MLB News,'Growing sense' this 8-time All-Star will be traded,https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-rumors-trades-and-signings,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 18:39:00 GMT",LATEST FREE AGENT & TRADE RUMORS,"MLB.com We're keeping track of all the latest free agent and trade rumors. According to a report from The Athletic's Katie Woo (subscription required), the Cardinals have been exploring the potential trade market for third baseman Nolan Arenado over the past few weeks. Multiple teams have expressed interest thus far, and while talks haven’t yielded any substantive progress, there’s a “growing sense throughout the industry” that the 33-year-old will eventually be dealt. Discussions are likely to intensify as the Winter Meetings approach. Per Woo, Arenado is even open to playing more at first base to create roster flexibility for a potential new team, though he it’s believed he would only be willing to waive his full no-trade clause to join a club set up to contend for multiple seasons. Arenado is coming off a down season with the bat (16 homers, 101 OPS+), but he was still worth 3.1 WAR (per FanGraphs) thanks in part to his plus defense at the hot corner. Arenado could be an attractive alternative to the top third-base options on the free-agent market -- Alex Bregman and Willy Adames, both of whom are expected to command a nine-figure deal and are tied to Draft compensation after declining a qualifying offer. Arenado has three years and $74 million left on his contract, but $10 million of that will be paid by the Rockies. To this point, Juan Soto's free agency has been about meeting with teams and hearing their general pitches -- but that has changed according to MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi, who reports that five teams have submitted contract offers to the 26-year-old superstar: the Red Sox, Dodgers, Mets, Yankees and Blue Jays. That is obviously a significant step in the process, especially since MLB.com's Mark Feinsand has said that ""the feeling around the industry"" is that Soto's decision could be made before the annual Winter Meetings get underway on Dec. 9 in Dallas. More > The Phillies are among the teams interested in acquiring White Sox ace Garrett Crochet, and Alec Bohm could be one of the players heading to Chicago if a deal is struck, according to USA Today's Bob Nightengale. If the Phillies trade Bohm and create a void at third base, Nightengale adds that Philadelphia ""is expected to make a strong play"" for Alex Bregman or Willy Adames. Bregman has also drawn interest from the Tigers and Red Sox. Adames has spent his entire seven-year Major League career at shortstop and hasn't played third base since 2013, his first year as a pro. However, he is reportedly open to moving to the hot corner ""for the right deal and the right team,"" according to MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi. Morosi said Tuesday that the Astros are also interested in Adames as a third baseman. Houston would have a clear need at the position if it can't re-sign Bregman. Adames, who received some down-ballot MVP votes this year, has been a plus defender at shortstop over each of the past three seasons, judging by outs above average. His talent on both sides of the ball and apparent willingness to accommodate a team by moving to third base has created ""broad"" interest in the 29-year-old, per Morosi. The Angels have been the most aggressive club in free agency this offseason and kept it up with their first big splash, agreeing to terms with lefty Yusei Kikuchi early Monday on a three-year, $63 million deal, a source told MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. Here is a breakdown of this move from all angles, via MLB.com experts. More > Boston is showing ""strong interest"" in All-Star shortstop Willy Adames, per a report from USA Today's Bob Nightengale -- but that's not all. Along with pursuing Adames, who is coming off a career-best 32-homer, 112-RBI campaign for the Brewers, the Red Sox are in the market for multiple starting pitchers. Nightengale indicates that Boston wants to sign two pitchers from the star free-agent trio of Corbin Burnes, Blake Snell and Max Fried. More > The Phillies and White Sox have discussed potential trade packages for left-handed ace Garrett Crochet that include Phillies All-Star third baseman Alec Bohm and highly touted outfield prospect Justin Crawford, per a report from USA Today's Bob Nightengale. More > The Braves could look to add an outfielder in free agency after non-tendering Ramón Laureano last week, Ken Rosenthal reports for The Athletic (subscription required). According to Rosenthal, the Braves would prefer a left-handed hitting outfielder, because their only current lefty bats are Michael Harris II, Jarred Kelenic, Matt Olson and switch-hitter Ozzie Albies. But they would also be willing to pursue a right-handed hitter. Even though Atlanta's outfield depth is currently thin, Rosenthal writes that the Braves don't necessarily need to go after one of the top-of-the-market outfielders -- Juan Soto, Anthony Santander, Teoscar Hernández and Jurickson Profar -- because Ronald Acuña Jr. is expected to return from his torn ACL a month or two into the 2025 season. The next tier of left-handed-hitting free-agent outfielders that the Braves could pursue includes Michael Conforto, Ben Gamel, Jason Heyward, Travis Jankowski, Max Kepler, David Peralta, Mike Tauchman, Alex Verdugo and Jesse Winker. Right-handed-hitting free-agent outfielders include Mark Canha, Randal Grichuk, Austin Hays, Connor Joe, Manuel Margot, Andrew McCutchen, Tyler O'Neill, Tommy Pham and Michael A. Taylor. The veteran first basemen on the free-agent market could be in demand among teams looking for a more affordable option than Pete Alonso or Christian Walker. The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal reports (subscription required) that the Pirates, Mariners, D-backs and Tigers all could be looking to upgrade at first base, but not for the price tag that Alonso and Walker will likely command. The Nationals could also join that list, although they still might pursue Alonso or Walker. Rosenthal believes that means there could be plenty of demand for first basemen like Paul Goldschmidt, Carlos Santana, Anthony Rizzo, Josh Bell and Justin Turner. The Tigers are interested in free-agent third baseman Alex Bregman, according to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman in an article for the New York Post. Heyman adds that the only club Bregman has played for in the Major Leagues, the Astros, have submitted a contract offer in an effort to re-sign the two-time All-Star, and that the Red Sox have ""inquired and could be a fit for Bregman if they move Rafael Devers to first."" Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. If Bregman was to sign with Detroit, it would reunite him with his former manager in Houston, A.J. Hinch. Hinch was the manager when Bregman and the Astros won the franchise's first World Series title in 2017. With Garrett Crochet headlining the list of potential trade candidates this offseason, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reports in the New York Post that four clubs -- the Orioles, Red Sox, Dodgers and Phillies -- are showing the most interest in acquiring the White Sox left-hander. More > Dodgers right-hander Walker Buehler threw the final pitch of this season at Yankee Stadium, closing out Game 5 of the World Series in the Bronx. Might Yankee Stadium also be where Buehler throws his first pitch in 2025? MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi has been told that there is ""some mutual interest"" between Buehler and the Yankees, who are looking to augment their starting rotation this offseason. More > The Royals and Reds completed a trade Friday headlined by former college teammates, right-handed pitcher Brady Singer and second baseman Jonathan India, heading in opposite directions. The Reds bolster their rotation with Singer, who pitched to a 3.71 ERA over a career-high 179 2/3 innings this season. India, the 2021 National League Rookie of the Year, addresses one of Kansas City's top priorities for this offseason: adding more offense. The Royals also received 25-year-old outfielder Joey Wiemer, who hasn't hit much in his limited time in the big leagues but did record eight outs above average while playing for the Brewers in 2023. The Red Sox are definitely one of the teams vying for Juan Soto. However, will this year's No. 1 free agent actually end up with Boston? MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi said Friday that he will be ""surprised"" if that happens. If Soto does sign elsewhere, the Red Sox will have to pivot to some of the other big bats on the market, and Morosi considers Boston to be one of the top candidates to sign Teoscar Hernández. More > Roki Sasaki isn't the only marquee Japanese pitcher who is expected to make the jump to the Majors this offseason. The 35-year-old Tomoyuki Sugano doesn't possess Sasaki's top-notch velocity, but as a two-time winner of the Sawamura Award -- the Japanese equivalent to the Cy Young Award -- Sugano should have his fair share of suitors. MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi has identified two of them this week: the Angels and the Giants. More > During Friday's edition of Hot Stove, MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi mentioned four possible landing spots for Jack Flaherty this offseason: The Dodgers, Yankees, Padres and Angels. More > The demand is high, but the supply is low. That's the story for teams looking to sign a frontline starting pitcher in free agency this offseason. The best arms available are Corbin Burnes, Blake Snell and Max Fried. You could add Japanese right-hander Roki Sasaki to that group, but he hasn't yet been posted for MLB teams, so he's not officially a free agent at the moment. As for those other three pitchers, at least seven teams have been connected to them in recent reports. Dodgers: The reigning World Series champions are one of the teams that have met with Snell already but are also talking to Burnes and Fried, according to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required). They ""like Snell a lot,"" per MLB Network insider Jon Heyman. The Dodgers are considered among the favorites for Sasaki, but Heyman reported last week in the New York Post that L.A. will try to sign one of the Big Three even if they land the Japanese phenom. MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi sees the Dodgers as one of the two leading candidates for Burnes. Red Sox: Like the Dodgers, the Red Sox have met with Snell already but are keeping their options open with Burnes and Fried, Rosenthal reports. Orioles: With Burnes a free agent after spending 2024 with Baltimore, Orioles general manager Mike Elias said Friday that the team’s new ownership group has given him the flexibility to engage with the top starting pitchers on the free-agent market. Rosenthal hears the team is currently more focused on Snell and Fried, both of whom could have lower price tags than Burnes. Blue Jays: Rosenthal reports that Toronto is pursuing Burnes, Snell and Fried. Yankees: Heyman directly mentioned the Yankees' interest in Snell, but he added that New York's willingness to go after one of the top starters may be contingent on whether it can re-sign Juan Soto. Heyman said that if Soto doesn't come back to the Bronx, the Yankees ""will be more focused"" on these aces. But if Soto is back in pinstripes, Heyman thinks the Yankees won't spend the money necessary to get one of the top pitchers. Giants: Heyman said he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if Snell returns to San Francisco after the left-hander enjoyed his time there during the 2024 season. Mets: Another club that's focused on Soto, the Mets will also be looking to upgrade a rotation that could lose Sean Manaea, José Quintana and Luis Severino in free agency. Although outfielder/first baseman Cody Bellinger exercised his player option for 2025, it’s not a guarantee that he’ll be with the Cubs on Opening Day. According to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required), rival executives say that the Cubs want to trade the 29-year-old. More > MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said Wednesday that Sasaki is expected to be part of the 2025 international amateur signing class, which means the Japanese right-hander likely won't sign with a club before Jan. 15. ""It looks like ... the signing will happen in the new pool period,"" Manfred said via The Athletic's Evan Drelich. More > Thirteen players were tendered a qualifying offer (a one-year, $21.05 million deal for 2025) this offseason, but Reds right-hander Nick Martinez was the only one who accepted prior to Tuesday's 4 p.m. ET deadline. The following 12 players rejected the qualifying offer and will remain free agents: Since the system was implemented in 2012, only 14 players to receive a QO have accepted it. You can read more about year's QO decisions here. The Orioles could be one of the big players on the free-agent market for starting pitchers in their first offseason under their new ownership group. General manager Mike Elias said Friday that the Orioles have ""engaged"" in conversations with high-end starting pitchers in free agency. ""We are looking at the whole menu, the whole spectrum and I credit the ownership change toward putting us in a position to do that,"" Elias said. The highest of the high-end starters on the open market is Corbin Burnes, and the Orioles would welcome his return to Baltimore, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan (subscription required). The Orioles also have been linked to left-handed ace Max Fried. Additionally, Baltimore is among a host of clubs interested in acquiring White Sox southpaw Garrett Crochet via trade. However, given all of the young talent they have traded in the past year, The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required) hears that the O's are more focused on the free-agent market right now. Yankees broadcaster Michael Kay said on his radio program on Monday that according to a source, Mets owner Steve Cohen is willing to beat any other club's offer to Juan Soto by $50 million. More > MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reports in an article for the New York Post that the Yankees met with superstar slugger Juan Soto in Southern California on Monday as they look to retain him after he helped lead them to the World Series. More > The Red Sox have reportedly made their pitch -- or at least an initial one -- to Juan Soto. They are also trying to convince the top starting pitchers on the market to come to Fenway, too. ESPN's Jeff Passan said during Friday's edition of the Baseball Bar-B-Cast podcast that the Red Sox are talking to Blake Snell and Max Fried. More > With Max Fried and Charlie Morton both free agents, adding rotation help is a priority for the Braves this offseason. Nathan Eovaldi ranks near the top of Atlanta’s wish list (per a source), but he isn’t the only free-agent starter the team is said to be considering, as MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi hears the Braves also have interest in Walker Buehler. Returning from his second Tommy John surgery, Buehler struggled to the tune of a 5.38 ERA over 16 starts this past season. However, he finished the year on a high note, tossing 10 straight scoreless innings in the postseason and closing out the Dodgers’ title-clinching win over the Yankees in Game 5 of the World Series. Buehler, 30, was one of baseball’s top starters from 2018-21, recording a 2.82 ERA (146 ERA+) with 620 strikeouts and 137 walks in 564 innings. Atlanta could be an attractive landing spot for Buehler in more ways than one. The right-hander has ties to two nearby states, as he was born in Kentucky and attended Vanderbilt in Tennessee. Buehler also just watched the Braves have success with another reclamation project, Chris Sale. Atlanta acquired Sale from the Red Sox last offseason after several injury-plagued seasons. The lefty stayed healthy in 2024 and is the overwhelming favorite to win the National League Cy Young Award. In addition to their interest in Eovaldi and Buehler, the Braves have been linked to White Sox lefty Garrett Crochet on the trade market, though it's unclear if they have enough prospect capital to swing a trade. Fried is still a possibility, too, but paying top dollar for free agents is not part of president of baseball operations Alex Anthopoulos’ typical M.O. MLB Trade Rumors predicts Fried will sign a six-year, $156 million contract, compared to one year, $15 million for Buehler and two years, $44 million for Eovaldi."
MLB News,Could this team trade All-Star 3B to land Crochet? (report),https://www.mlb.com/news/garrett-crochet-rumors,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 15:55:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of the latest news and trade rumors surrounding Garrett Crochet. Nov. 25: Phils have had 'extensive talks' with White SoxThe Phillies and White Sox have discussed potential packages for Crochet that include All-Star third baseman Alec Bohm and highly touted outfield prospect Justin Crawford, per a report from USA Today's Bob Nightengale. Crawford is Philadelphia's No. 3 prospect, per MLB Pipeline, while Bohm is coming off his best season in the big leagues. The 28-year-old Bohm hit .295 with an .830 OPS in the first half on his way to his first career All-Star selection, but he put up just a .681 OPS following the break. The White Sox reportedly have some hesitation about that second-half dip, though Bohm has been a streaky hitter during his time in the big leagues. He's also had his troubles defensively, though he's coming off a much-improved showing at the hot corner in 2024. Nov. 22: These teams seem most interested in CrochetWith Crochet headlining the list of potential trade candidates this offseason, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman says four clubs -- the Orioles, Red Sox, Dodgers and Phillies -- are showing the most interest in acquiring the White Sox left-hander. Heyman wrote for the New York Post that the O's and Red Sox are in prime position to strike a deal based on the position-player talent that Chicago is likely seeking in return. Of course, there's still plenty of time for another team to enter the mix, with Heyman noting that others have also expressed interest. Nov. 13: These clubs could be involved in trade market for CrochetAlthough the White Sox didn't move Crochet prior to the Trade Deadline, there appears to be little doubt about their intentions for the left-hander this offseason. ""They're going to trade him this winter,"" a rival evaluator told ESPN's Buster Olney at the GM Meetings last week. ""It's not a matter of if; it's a question of when."" Olney shed some light on Crochet's potential market in an article for ESPN+ (subscription required) on Wednesday, noting that general manager Chris Getz is looking for ""a package of prospects constructed around at least one high-ceiling youngster to anchor the deal."" Chicago's preference is for that main piece to be a position player, but the team is open to a pitcher being the centerpiece, ""depending on the depth and quality of the prospects offered."" Based on conversations with industry sources, Olney names the Phillies, Padres, Yankees, Dodgers, Braves, Orioles, Red Sox and Mets as teams that could pursue a Crochet trade. Nov. 9: Mets showing interest in trading for Crochet (report)According to a report in the New York Post, the Mets are ""discussing"" Crochet, who is one of the most likely players to be traded this offseason. It would stand to reason given that three of New York's starters from 2024 -- Sean Manaea, Jose Quintana and Luis Severino -- are free agents. Though the Mets are certainly in position to spend big this offseason, Crochet would be considerably cheaper in his remaining arbitration years than spending toward the top of the free agent pitching market. Nov. 7: Crochet garnering trade interest from many clubs, but one stands outThe White Sox held on to Crochet through the 2024 Trade Deadline when they were receiving calls from many teams interested in acquiring the fireballing left-hander. Now, an even greater number of clubs are trying to maneuver a deal for Crochet, general manager Chris Getz said during this week's General Managers Meetings. Crochet entered this season with only 73 big league innings under his belt over parts of three seasons and a lengthy injury history. But from Opening Day on, he proved he could be an ace. Crochet received his first Major League start in that season opener and proceeded to strike out eight batters and allow one run over six innings. He eventually became a first-time All-Star and ended the season with 209 strikeouts in 146 innings. Given that big jump in innings, Crochet's workload was capped over the final few months of the season. He made it through the year without a stint on the injured list. What do the White Sox want in return for Crochet, who has two years of club control remaining? Getz has made it pretty clear. ""We need to improve our offense, it’s very clear,” he told reporters Tuesday. “With any trade or free agency, we are looking for ways to improve our offense."" One team that could be a match for Chicago in a Crochet trade is the Boston Red Sox. The Red Sox have six position players on MLB Pipeline's Top 100 Prospects list, including three in the top 10. They also have a few attractive pieces already at the big league level who are not yet eligible for arbitration. That group includes first baseman Triston Casas, catcher Connor Wong and Gold Glove outfielder Wilyer Abreu. With so much high-quality position-player depth, ""there’s a widespread sense that the Sox can trade for nearly anyone,"" according to The Boston Globe's Alex Speier (subscription required). MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi said Thursday from the GM Meetings that the Red Sox are ""the team I think a lot of people around here are looking at very carefully"" regarding a Crochet trade."
MLB News,These five teams have made Soto contract offers (source),https://www.mlb.com/news/juan-soto-free-agent-contract-offers,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 14:44:03 GMT",,"Thomas Harrigan The race for Juan Soto is intensifying, with a source telling MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi that five teams have submitted offers to the superstar free agent’s camp, confirming an earlier report from Randy Miller of NJ.com. Per Morosi, the five teams are the Mets, Red Sox, Blue Jays, Dodgers and incumbent Yankees. Soto previously met in person with officials from each of those five clubs, though the meetings were believed to be introductory in nature, with no teams tendering contract offers during that stage. The exact details of the offers Soto has received are unknown, but he is expected to command one of the largest deals in baseball history. Soto is a rarity as far as free agents go, hitting the open market for the first time at a much younger age than the typical player. He turned 26 years old on Oct. 25. The left-handed slugger, who made his MLB debut with the Nationals as a 19-year-old in 2018, is on a Hall of Fame trajectory. He’s one of seven players in MLB history to record at least 200 homers with an OPS+ of 150 or higher through their age-25 season, joining Jimmie Foxx, Mickey Mantle, Eddie Mathews, Mel Ott, Albert Pujols and Mike Trout. Soto is coming off one of his best seasons, having hit .288 with 41 homers, 109 RBIs, 128 runs scored, 129 walks, a .989 OPS and a 178 OPS+ over 157 games for the Yankees, who acquired him from the Padres in a blockbuster trade last December. The performance earned him a third-place finish in the American League MVP Award voting -- the results of which were announced last week -- behind his 2024 Yankees teammate Aaron Judge and Royals shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. Soto added a 1.102 OPS with four homers in the postseason, including a go-ahead three-run blast in the 10th inning of New York’s AL Championship Series clincher against the Guardians that gave the Bronx Bombers their first AL pennant since 2009."
MLB News,Kikuchi agrees to join Angels on 3-year deal (source),https://www.mlb.com/news/yusei-kikuchi-deal-with-angels,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 16:10:00 GMT",,"Rhett Bollinger ANAHEIM -- The Angels have been the most aggressive club in free agency this offseason and kept it up with their first big splash, agreeing to terms with lefty Yusei Kikuchi early Monday. The deal is the largest since Perry Minasian became general manager in 2020, as it’s a three-year, $63 million deal, a source told MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. The club has not confirmed the agreement, which was originally reported by MLB Network insider Jon Heyman. But it represents a solid upgrade to the rotation after the Angels also signed right-hander Kyle Hendricks to a one-year deal worth $2.5 million. Kikuchi immediately becomes an ace for the club and can help the Angels compete after their 99-loss campaign in ’24. The 33-year-old left-hander is coming off an intriguing season in which he put together one of the finest stretches of his Major League career following a midseason trade to the Astros. Kikuchi, who began his professional career with eight seasons in Nippon Professional Baseball, spent his first three Major League seasons with the Mariners before signing a three-year, $36 million contract with the Blue Jays ahead of the 2022 season. Between Seattle and Toronto, he pitched to a 4.72 ERA with a 1.38 WHIP. As with many previous Astros acquisitions, Kikuchi improved dramatically after his July 29 trade, making 10 starts down the stretch, posting a 2.70 ERA with a 0.93 WHIP and 76 strikeouts in 60 innings. Among the changes the Astros made to the veteran’s repertoire was a stronger reliance on his slider; by September, he was throwing 38.9% sliders compared to just 36.6% four-seam fastballs, increasing the effectiveness of both pitches. Kikuchi joins a rotation that includes lefty Tyler Anderson, right-handers José Soriano and Jack Kochanowicz and Hendricks. The fifth spot is up for grabs and the Angels have several internal candidates, such as Reid Detmers, Chase Silseth, Caden Dana and Sam Aldegheri. It’s been a busy offseason for the Angels, who also traded for slugger Jorge Soler and signed free agent catcher Travis d’Arnaud, utilityman Kevin Newman and Hendricks to bolster their depth. They also traded for infielder Scott Kingery and claimed infielder/outfielder Ryan Noda on waivers. Kukuchi’s signing is the largest for the club since they signed reliever Raisel Iglesias to a four-year, $58 million deal before the 2022 season. Kukuchi also represents the club’s first Japanese player since the departure of Shohei Ohtani to the Dodgers last offseason. The Angels still retain a large Japanese fanbase because of Ohtani’s six years with the club."
MLB News,Which home park will suit Soto best? It almost doesn't matter,https://www.mlb.com/news/how-park-effects-impact-juan-soto-free-agency,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 03:08:00 GMT",Lefty slugger's OPS was 57 points higher away from Yankee Stadium in '24,"Mike Petriello There are so many factors that will go into where Juan Soto decides to play in 2025 and for many years after that, and a few of them are extremely obvious. Those include, but aren't limited to: He’s going to want to play for a team that will offer him a record-setting contract, and he’s going to want to play for a franchise that is likely to be playing competitive baseball every single year. He may or may not have additional preferences about climate, state taxes, regional culture or geography. He’s a free agent. He’s earned the right to have those opinions and decide his own future. But there’s one other aspect of all this that comes up now and then, which probably won’t have very much of an impact at all: How will a new team’s ballpark affect his hitting? After all, didn’t he just post a career year playing in hitter-friendly Yankee Stadium, home of the short right-field porch that has fueled plenty of left-handed hitters? Sure. But also, no. It’s the popular narrative. It’s just also not really accurate at all. It’s not that the short porch in the Bronx hasn’t helped a particular brand of lefty, as Didi Gregorius would be happy to tell you. It’s that Soto, obviously, isn’t a typical anything. Yankee Stadium didn’t help him at all, actually, and because of the kind of all-around, historically great hitter he is, any particular ballpark effect isn’t likely to have any sort of major effect on his production. If this all sounds familiar, it should, because we’ve been harping on it for a while. When he was first traded to the Yankees last December, we pointed out that based on the way he’d hit in 2023, Yankee Stadium wasn’t terribly likely to provide him with a boost. Since he’s an all-fields hitter with outstanding power -- not an extreme pull hitter with warning-track power – any gains he’d make in right would probably be equaled or overshadowed by lost homers to the big left-center-field gap. We reiterated it in early August, as that career year was in full swing. So what actually happened in 2024? Right. Exactly. It’s not that Soto didn’t hit well in Yankee Stadium, where for his career (including a few road appearances) he has a line of .283/.400/.579 (.979 OPS), which in terms of on-base and slugging is basically what Bobby Witt Jr. just did in 2024. It’s that he hits well pretty much everywhere – over the last six seasons, only Aaron Judge and Yordan Alvarez have a higher road OPS than Soto’s .988. Consider this: Soto has taken at least 60 plate appearances at 16 different ballparks. At 11 of them, or just more than two-thirds, his OPS has been at least .940, which is a truly elite level of production. So yes, Mets fans, you can accurately say that Soto has posted an outstanding 1.175 OPS (.321/.466/.709) in 35 games in Queens. But Reds fans can say the same (1.186 OPS), and Phillies fans (1.086 OPS), and Pirates fans (.998 OPS), and eventually you’re realizing that it’s not the ballpark, it’s the man. This isn’t even really the world’s most serious analysis, to be sure, because 60 scattered plate appearances over eight seasons of play can lead to more than a little bit of randomness. For example: it’s not clear if Soto’s relative underperformance in Petco Park was anything specific to the park itself, or just a tough settling-in period after a midseason trade from the only team he’d known. (It’s worth noting that even just on the road, 2022 was Soto’s weakest year.) Soto hit 45 homers this past season, playoffs included, and according to Statcast metrics that adjust not only for the different wall heights and dimensions of the various parks but also the environmental effects that impact how well the ball carries, we can see how few of those came simply because of Yankee Stadium. It was: one, and it came at a cost. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. As much fun as it would be to consider what it would look like if Soto called Coors Field home, it seems like there’s a six-team list of main suitors for his services. If you look at the same Statcast environmentally adjusted list of batted balls from last year, and asked what would happen if he played all his games in that team’s home park, the 45 homers would become … That’s on a scale of “only 38, in Detroit,” to “63, in Cincinnati, baseball’s best home run park,” and for all the arguments for those teams to go after him, they're not terribly likely landing spots. For any team likely to sign him, this matters a little, not a whole lot, maybe not at all. Which is to say: it might matter for a different hitter with more specific batting tendencies, like Alex Bregman. But it didn’t really matter that much for Soto, not in the Bronx. The ballpark didn’t make Soto a great hitter, and it’s not why he had such a great year. Soto has been hitting pretty much everywhere since he arrived in the Majors as a 19-year-old in 2018. He’ll hit wherever else he goes from here, too. Given his age and production, there’s hardly been a safer big-ticket free agent in recent history."

NEW YORK -- As more than 1,000 fans streamed through the Citi Field team store last week, donating a record 13,000-plus pounds of food to the Food Bank for New York City, Mets staffers tried to analyze what had gone so right. Were their marketing efforts working that well? Were people simply feeling extra charitable this year? Or had the Mets’ extended postseason run elevated their brand in the eyes of many, creating a closer relationship between the club and its fans? “I’m sure it was a combination of it being the holidays but also the team having finished on such a strong, high note,” said Jane Son, head of foundation and community engagement. “It’s great that, certainly from a foundation and community perspective, we’re benefiting from fan excitement of wanting to support the team -- and, as we head into the holidays, the community.” This year’s MetsGiving initiatives have been as ambitious as ever, beginning with the aforementioned food drive on Nov. 19. Later that week, the Mets received a surprise invitation to ring the Nasdaq opening bell, with former Mets captain John Franco doing the honors to spread MetsGiving awareness. Franco subsequently drove to the New York Common Pantry in Harlem, where he handed out turkeys to families in need. For the rest of that day, Mets employees fanned out around the five boroughs to donate 8,500 turkeys -- another record for an annual team initiative. Ding ding ding!John Franco rang the @NasdaqExchange opening bell along with Mr. and Mrs. Met this morning to celebrate MetsGiving! 🔔📈 pic.twitter.com/88Uwenpxht “We’re home here in Queens, but we also want to make sure we’re supporting others that need it in the other boroughs,” Son said. “We want the city to know we’re here for them.” It’s a charge that will continue for another month, with three more events scheduled: a public coat drive on Dec. 11, followed by the Amazin’ Mets Foundation’s Holiday Dinner for local families in need on Dec. 18, and the team’s annual Kids’ Holiday Party on Dec. 19. Another Mets alumnus, Todd Zeile, will play Santa Claus this year at the party. “We’re grateful that we’ve got alumni that are looking to give back to the community and be there with us to continue to support them,” Son said, “even though they’re no longer playing for the team.” The @Mets and @newyorkcares are teaming up for their annual Coat Drive, presented by your local @DriveToyota dealers.

In that fashion, the Mets hope their on-field success will continue to aid their philanthropic efforts off it. “Obviously, just always looking to give back to the community,” Son said. “The holidays are a tough time for a lot of people, more so this year. And I know every year, everybody says it. But we’re just really focused on helping the community during this time.”"
MLB News,Dodgers championship shares top record-setting postseason pool,https://www.mlb.com/news/dodgers-2024-shares-lead-record-setting-mlb-postseason-pool,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 14:00:00 GMT",,"Mark Feinsand We’ve all heard the old saying, “To the victors go the spoils.” In the case of the World Series champion Dodgers, that meant postseason shares worth nearly a half-million dollars. Los Angeles’ postseason shares were worth $477,440.70 each, part of a record-setting pool of nearly $129.1 million. The overall pool eclipsed the previous record -- set last year at $107.8 million -- by more than $21 million. The Dodgers’ shares were less than the Rangers’ championship shares a year ago, as Los Angeles distributed more shares than Texas did. The Dodgers awarded the 79 full shares, 17.49 partial shares and $405,000 in cash awards from their pool of $46,473,177.14. The American League champion Yankees issued 71 full shares and 16.38 partial shares, with a full share coming in at $354,571.67. The Mets and Guardians, who lost in the League Championship Series, took home a pool worth $15,491,059.05 each. New York dished out 68 full shares worth $179,948.36 (plus 18 partial shares) while Cleveland shares were worth $182,662.86 (72 full, 12.48 partial). Prior to the World Series, the total pools are the same for the teams that reach each round. The size of full shares vary based on how many each team votes to give out, as well as partial shares and cash awards.

MLB News,One free agent who could make sense for every team,https://www.mlb.com/news/one-free-agent-for-every-mlb-team-2024-25,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 19:19:00 GMT",,"Mark Feinsand Thanksgiving is a time for families to gather around the dinner table, share old stories and, of course, argue about which players will wind up with which teams during this Hot Stove season. So while you’re cooking your turkey, mashing your potatoes and baking your chocolate pecan pie -- my personal specialty -- take a few minutes to prepare for the table talk that will surely fill dining rooms around the country. It’s time for our annual exercise in which we try to match up free agents with new teams. This list isn’t meant to serve as a prediction of what’s to come this winter, but rather a chance to try reading some tea leaves and connecting some dots. We call it “30 free agents for 30 teams.” We have only two rules: 1. Every player has to be from another team (no incumbents). 2. Each player can only be on the list once. That means that a number of notable free agents were not included, but don’t read into that in terms of their overall markets. Players such as Alex Bregman, Anthony Santander and Teoscar Hernández will find plenty of suitors despite not being listed below. Don’t @ me … unless you want that pie recipe, of course. MLB offseason signings and trades• Latest free-agent and trade rumors• Top 25 free agents | Every free agent, by position• Tracking every team's offseason moves• FA guides: Soto | Burnes | Alonso | Snell | Bregman | Fried | Santander• Offseason dates, rules & terms explained Without further ado, here’s the latest attempt at playing free-agent matchmaker. Blue Jays: Willy Adames, SSThe Blue Jays are looking at a number of free agents in an effort to upgrade the offense, but Adames may make the most sense. Toronto could shift him to third base next season, after which he could move back to shortstop if Bo Bichette departs as a free agent next winter. Orioles: Max Fried, LHPBaltimore finally found the ace it had been missing last season with the trade for Corbin Burnes, but he’s a free agent now, potentially leaving a huge hole atop the rotation. Should Burnes prove too expensive or simply sign elsewhere, Fried could be the perfect replacement. Rays: Kyle Higashioka, CRays catchers combined for a .563 OPS last season, the second-lowest mark in the AL. Ben Rortvedt will return in 2025, but Tampa Bay could use another catcher to pair with him. Higashioka -- who was teammates with Rortvedt on the 2023 Yankees -- would be an ideal fit. Red Sox: Corbin Burnes, RHPRemember that scenario in which the Orioles lose their ace to free agency? Boston could be the team to snipe Burnes from its division rival, as the Red Sox appear intent on bringing in a No. 1 starter this offseason. Yankees: Christian Walker, 1BThe Yankees’ .619 OPS from their first basemen in 2024 was the lowest in the AL, so figuring out an answer at the position will be on New York’s to-do list. Walker is the best all-around first baseman on the market, hitting 95 home runs since the start of 2022 while winning three straight Gold Glove Awards. Guardians: Michael Lorenzen, RHPThe potential loss of Shane Bieber and Matthew Boyd will leave Cleveland not only with holes to fill in the rotation, but also a veteran presence on the staff. Lorenzen pitched well for the Rangers (3.81 ERA in 101 2/3 innings) and even better for the Royals (1.57 ERA in 28 2/3 innings) following a midseason trade, though a hamstring injury kept him out for most of September. Royals: Jurickson Profar, OFKansas City made some impactful signings last winter (Seth Lugo and Michael Wacha, in particular) that helped the Royals return to the postseason for the first time since their 2015 World Series title run. But the outfield lacked production, ranking 14th in the AL in home runs and 13th in OPS as a unit. Profar is coming off a career year after helping pace a 93-win Padres team. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Tigers: Walker Buehler, RHPBuehler could be this year's Jack Flaherty, an ideal rebound project for pitching coach Chris Fetter, whose group has shown it can help pitchers get more velocity and chase. Buehler overlapped with Tigers director of pitching Gabe Ribas when Ribas was a coordinator in the Dodgers' system. If Detroit isn’t going to be active at the top of the free-agent pitching market, Buehler could be the best fit. Twins: Andrew Chafin, LHPMinnesota’s bullpen struggled from the left side in 2024, as its southpaws combined for a 5.31 ERA and .453 opponent slugging percentage -- both MLB highs. Caleb Thielbar is a free agent, leaving a thin group even thinner. Chafin had 70 strikeouts in 56 1/3 innings with the Tigers and Rangers last season, ranking near the top of the league in both chase percentage and whiff percentage. White Sox: Jose Quintana, LHPChicago figures to have a young rotation in 2025, especially if the team trades Garrett Crochet as expected. Bringing in a veteran to lead the group makes sense, so why not a former White Sox pitcher who threw four 200-inning seasons for the club and made his only All-Star team during that stretch? Angels: Blake Treinen, RHPThe Angels have already addressed their rotation concerns by signing Kyle Hendricks and have reportedly agreed to a deal with Yusei Kikuchi, so expect them to turn their focus to the bullpen in the coming weeks. It’s unclear whether the Angels will spend big for top closers like Tanner Scott or Carlos Estévez, but Treinen would be a strong veteran presence on a team looking to contend. Astros: Carlos Santana, 1BThe ageless wonder posted another strong season at age 38, as Santana hit 23 homers with 71 RBIs and a .749 OPS, racking up 14 outs above average while winning a Gold Glove Award. Houston ranked 13th in the AL in OPS at first base, and while the José Abreu experiment went badly, Santana would help stabilize the position without requiring a long-term commitment. Athletics: Patrick Corbin, LHPThe Athletics have a young pitching staff, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see them try to sign a veteran starter to help guide that group. Corbin went 31-63 with a 5.71 ERA in his final four seasons with Washington, so the 35-year-old will likely have to accept a one-year deal and try to prove he can still be an effective starter. Mariners: Hye-Seong Kim, 2BCole Young, the Mariners’ No. 2 prospect, performed well at Double-A last season but isn’t likely ready to take over the second-base job just yet. Kim, who turns 26 in January, has a .304/.364/.403 slash line over seven-plus years in the KBO, stealing at least 25 bases six times. Kim would add a contact hitter with speed who could help change the dynamic of the Mariners’ lineup, which ranked 14th in the AL in batting average (.224) and struck out more than any other club. Rangers: Sean Manaea, LHPWith Nathan Eovaldi opting out of his contract and Andrew Heaney also potentially leaving via free agency, the Rangers have a need for a frontline starter. Manaea had an excellent year with the Mets and opted out of his own deal, setting him up for a multiyear deal. Braves: Nathan Eovaldi, RHPMax Fried is likely headed elsewhere as a free agent, while Charlie Morton is no lock to return to the Braves. With Spencer Strider’s timetable for 2025 unclear, Atlanta could use another starter to join Chris Sale, Reynaldo López and Spencer Schwellenbach in the rotation, and Eovaldi’s experience and track record would make him a sound choice. Marlins: Gary Sánchez, CNick Fortes returns in 2025 after starting 99 games behind the plate, but Marlins catchers ranked last in the league with six home runs and a .528 OPS. Sánchez has hit double-digit home runs in every season of his career, and while he started only 27 games at catcher and 40 at DH for the Brewers in 2024, the Marlins could offer him more playing time as they seek more power in the lineup. Mets: Juan Soto, OFThe biggest threat to the Yankees’ hopes of re-signing Soto, the Mets appear to be all in when it comes to adding the four-time All-Star. Owner Steve Cohen has the ability to pay whatever he wants, and for a generational hitter such as Soto, it remains to be seen whether any price is too high for the Mets. Nationals: Pete Alonso, 1BWashington needs an influx of power after finishing 2024 with an NL-low 135 home runs. There is no bigger home run threat available this winter than Alonso, whose 226 home runs since he broke into the league in 2019 rank second in the Majors only behind Aaron Judge (232). Phillies: Tanner Scott, LHPThe Phillies face the loss of both Carlos Estévez and Jeff Hoffman, leaving them with a need for late-inning bullpen help. Scott is the best reliever available on this year’s market, so it wouldn’t be surprising if Philadelphia takes a run at him to bolster the back end of the bullpen. Brewers: Yoán Moncada, 3BAssuming that Willy Adames departs as a free agent, Joey Ortiz is likely to move to shortstop, creating a vacancy at third base. The free-agent options beyond Alex Bregman are mostly underwhelming, but Moncada -- who was limited by injuries to only 12 games in 2024 -- has shown the ability to produce and could be a great buy-low candidate. Cardinals: Clay Holmes, RHPThe Cardinals are likely to trade closer Ryan Helsley this winter, and Andrew Kittredge is a free agent, leaving some potential holes in the bullpen. Holmes was an All-Star in 2022 and 2024, and although he lost his closer job with the Yankees late in the season, the righty was a big part of New York’s run to the World Series. Cubs: Jack Flaherty, RHPChicago will look to upgrade its rotation this winter, and while top free agents such as Corbin Burnes and Max Fried aren’t completely out of the question, the likelihood is that the Cubs will be focused on the second tier of starters. Flaherty made the most of his one-year, $14 million deal in 2024, pitching well for the Tigers before helping the Dodgers win the World Series following a midseason trade. Pirates: José Leclerc, RHPDavid Bednar is likely to enter the season as the Pirates' closer, but the two-time All-Star struggled through a rough year in 2024. Pittsburgh will be in the market for a late-inning reliever to get the ball to Bednar, and adding one with closing history would offer protection if Bednar goes through another bad stretch. Reds: Michael Conforto, OFThe Reds will be looking for a corner-outfield upgrade who can help boost the lineup, and while Conforto won’t be confused with Juan Soto anytime soon, the 31-year-old hit 20 homers in 130 games last season. That would have been tied for second on the Reds in 2024, while Conforto’s 116 OPS+ -- which would have ranked second to Elly De La Cruz among Cincy regulars -- was his best since 2020. D-backs: Carlos Estévez, RHPArizona’s 4.41 bullpen ERA ranked 13th in the NL last season, and 10 pitchers registered at least one save. The D-backs suffered 26 blown saves in 2024, and for a team that missed the postseason after losing head-to-head tiebreakers with the Mets and Braves, one more win would have made a huge difference. Estévez made his first All-Star team in 2023 and had a superb season with the Angels and Phillies in 2024, making him one of the best relievers on the free-agent market. Dodgers: Blake Snell, LHPLos Angeles has several starters on its roster, but many of them come with health concerns, leading to the likelihood of a six-man rotation. Shohei Ohtani is coming back from Tommy John surgery (plus shoulder surgery on his non-throwing arm), and Dustin May will be returning from Tommy John and esophageal surgeries, while Tyler Glasnow has never thrown more than 134 innings -- which he did last season. Snell is one of the top pitchers on the market and has intrigued the Dodgers for a while, making it a strong potential match. Giants: Ha-Seong Kim, SSNew president of baseball operations Buster Posey said at the GM Meetings that adding a shortstop would be ideal for the Giants, who could then use Tyler Fitzgerald in a more versatile role. Kim has ties to manager Bob Melvin, who managed him in San Diego from 2022-23, while San Francisco outfielder Jung Hoo Lee is a close friend of Kim’s from their time as teammates in Korea. Padres: Roki Sasaki, RHPSasaki, the 23-year-old phenom from Japan, might be the most intriguing -- and sought-after -- free agent this winter. Because of his international amateur status, teams can only pay him from their international bonus pools, so this won’t become a bidding war like the one we saw last offseason for Yoshinobu Yamamoto. Sasaki will be pursued by many clubs, but his close friendship with Yu Darvish could give the Padres a leg up in this race. Rockies: Kirby Yates, RHPColorado will be counting on some young, inexperienced arms in its bullpen next season, but adding a proven veteran figures to be in the cards. Yates had a stellar season closing for the Rangers, and while he may look for a role with a contender as he enters his age-38 season, a team like the Rockies might try to bring him in to stabilize the back of the bullpen."
MLB News,Next year's Rookie of the Year winners will be ...,https://www.mlb.com/news/early-candidates-for-2025-rookie-of-the-year,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 01:00:00 GMT",,"Joe Trezza With Paul Skenes and Luis Gil taking home their leagues' respective 2024 Rookie of the Year Awards, it's time to turn our attention to 2025. On the latest edition of the MLB Pipeline Podcast, Jim Callis and Jonathan Mayo filled out their hypothetical ballots for the year ahead, selecting the players they believe could take home the hardware next season. In the 2022 version of this exercise, the experts correctly predicted Gunnar Henderson and Corbin Carroll, then the game's top two prospects, would take the honors the following year. But last year, in a mock draft format, Skenes wasn't selected until Round 4 and nobody tabbed Gil as a serious American League contender. More from MLB Pipeline:• Top 100 prospects | Stats | Video | Podcast | Complete coverage Here's how they picked this time around: NATIONAL LEAGUE 1. Mayo: Dylan Crews, OF (WSH No. 1/MLB No.1)The equation when we're contemplating these things is ability plus opportunity. He got called up. He has a place in the Nationals' outfield. He got a good amount of reps so he knows what he needs to work on. To me, Dylan Crews manning the outfield for the Nationals every day, is as good a choice as any in the National League. Callis: CrewsI concur. I also have Crews as my top National League choice ... until Roki Sasaki signs with the Dodgers, Padres or Mets. 2. Callis: Matt Shaw, INF (CHC No. 1/MLB No. 22)I don't think he'll make the Opening Day roster because the Cubs have a crowded roster of veterans. But he just kept getting better in his first pro season, and he played really well with Premier12. I think he can really, really hit and he's going to rise quickly. Mayo: Bubba Chandler, RHP (PIT No. 1/MLB No. 15)The Pirates are going to rinse and repeat. I don't think he'll be up on Opening Day, but the way he finished the year has me thinking he'll be pounding down that door early on from Triple-A Indianapolis, and he'll join Paul Skenes, Jared Jones and Mitch Keller in the Pirates rotation sometime around May. 3. Callis: Andrew Painter, RHP (PHI No. 2/MLB No. 32)I picked Andrew Painter over Dalton Rushing for my third spot. I think Andrew Painter is going to make a difference for the Phillies. I don’t think we’ll see him on the Opening Day roster. I think they’ll break him in. But he’s spectacular in shorter bursts than the other guys. Mayo: ShawEverything you said about Shaw holds true. He’s going to hit his way into that lineup and make a big impact in Chicago. AMERICAN LEAGUE 1. Callis: Coby Mayo, 3B/1B (BAL No. 1/MLB No. 8)He's going to need opportunity. The Orioles are going to have to make some decisions because they have more guys than position spots. But I do think Cody Mayo is going to hit 26 home runs as the American League Rookie of the Year. That's my prediction, 26 home runs. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Mayo: MayoI think they're going to need to find a way to get that bat in the lineup. There is no reason for him to be in Triple-A, and I'm taking the over on the home run total. 2. Mayo: Jackson Jobe, RHP (DET No. 1/MLB No. 5)I think he is ready to make a full-season impact on the Detroit Tigers' pitching staff, help them continue on after a surprisingly succesful year where they made the postseason in 2024. I think he becomes a mainstay in the rotation behind Tarik Skubal. Callis: Jasson Domínguez, OF (NYY No. 1/MLB No. 14)I think the Yankees will find a way to get him regular at-bats. He's been very impressive in short bursts here and there. He's still very young. 3. Callis: Jacob Wilson, SS (ATH No. 1/MLB No. 24)We saw him this year, he was banged up a little bit, so he didn't lose his rookie eligibility. We know he can hit, right? I don't know how much power there will be necessarily. But I'll assume he's going to hit .280 or higher. The guy hits everywhere he goes and plays a steady shortstop. I don't know why that made Jonathan chuckle. Mayo: WilsonI chuckled because you knew who my No. 3 guy was. You stole my pick."
MLB News,"Sims talks new Yanks gig, catchphrase, more in wide-ranging Q&A",https://www.mlb.com/news/dave-sims-q-a-on-becoming-yankees-radio-announcer,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 16:07:55 GMT",,"Bill Ladson In a recent phone interview with MLB.com, broadcaster Dave Sims, 71, answered a wide range of topics, from his new gig as the radio voice of the Yankees to how his signature phrase, “Hey Now,” came about. MLB.com: What has life been like since you were named the radio voice of the Yankees last week? Dave Sims: My text messages approached 400. I feel like I have 800-900 direct messages via Instagram and X. It has been phenomenal. The other thing that has been mind-blowing is, people in Seattle and the Pacific Northwest have said, “Love you. Bummed that you are leaving. I couldn’t be happier for you. Go get ‘em. You are going home.” It doesn’t get much better than that. MLB.com: You will join Bill White as the second African American to do Yankees play-by-play on a full-time basis. How significant is this assignment for you? Sims: It’s funny you mention Bill White. A producer in Philly that I know called me yesterday and said, “You have to come to [Pennsylvania] and get a picture with Bill White.” I said, “Heck, yeah. We’ll make that happen.” We’ll probably do that after Thanksgiving. Bill is obviously one of my heroes. When he was the National League president, he started making calls trying to help me get a big league gig. First of all, Bill was a great player, and I enjoyed him on those great Cardinals teams. Then he came over to the Phillies. His first on-air gig was in Philly. I remember they made him sports director [on WFIL-TV] and they had a hockey game and they made him call a hockey game. He didn’t know anything about hockey. His baseball broadcasting career? Forget about it. High marks. Why he is not in the Baseball Hall of Fame, I have no idea. That’s just rude. He did it as a player, president of the National League and longtime iconic broadcaster for the Yankees. It’s awesome to follow in the footsteps of Bill White. I couldn’t be more proud of that. It’s an unbelievable honor. MLB.com: Your radio partner will be Suzyn Waldman. This will be a reunion of sorts because both of you worked together on WFAN during the late 1980s and early ‘90s. How good is it to be together again? Sims: It’s going to be great. She covered the Knicks when I was doing the Knicks pre- and postgame shows, as well as doing the talk show with Ed Coleman. We would talk multiple times a week about the Knicks and the NBA. We had a good time. We would needle each other. And then the relationship would become more friendly when I got the Mariners job in 2007. … Now we can do that baseball talk, personal talk and all that good stuff. We are really going to be hanging out, and I’m looking forward to it. MLB.com: How much are you looking forward to watching Aaron Judge on a regular basis? Sims: Judge is a great dude. When I saw him in May, I told him I’m shooting for this gig. I told him and Gerrit Cole separately and they said, “I hope you get it. We are rooting for you.” Judge is a spectacular player. He had an unfortunate moment [unable to catch a routine fly ball] in Game 5 [of the World Series], and that’s baseball. He is a smart, caring and a terrific player. Baseball-wise – oh, my goodness – he is so good. It all fits into the big picture being with the Yankees. It’s an iconic franchise. I know there are a lot of people who say, “They haven’t won a World Series since 2009.” Guess what? You still pay attention [to them] every day during the baseball season. We’re thrilled to welcome Dave Sims as the new play-by-play voice of the Yankees on @WFAN660 🎙️ pic.twitter.com/pCGuFyHXAJ MLB.com: In Seattle, you were known as a homer. Will your style change in New York? Sims: [Laughing] All home team announcers are homers. I don’t think I ever said, “We, us, them and they.” But … when the Mariners were winning, you can tell by the energy and tone of the voice on who I was rooting for, which everybody does. … You can hear, “and the Mariners win the game, 2-1!!” If that’s being a homer, so be it. … If you want to go there, I’ll tell you what. I’m having fun. It’s a great gig, a great life. That’s the way I roll. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. MLB.com: Your signature phrase is “Hey Now.” How did that come about? Sims: I grew up on American Standard music – Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra. I love the song, “I Got The World On A String.” It was written in 1932 during the depression and it was recorded by a lot of people. I’m a Sinatra fan and it just hit me. At the end of the song, it goes, “Hey now, I’m so in love.” The other reference comes from Howard Stern and he used the catchphrase, Hey Now, a lot [on his radio show]. As opposed to cussing or saying he hit the hell out of the ball, it just hit me one night. I said it a few times, but the Mitch Haniger base hit [in 2021] was so joyous. I was so happy. It’s very effective for me. It really resonated with people. “HEY NOW! HEY NOW! HEY NOW!” pic.twitter.com/w05djv7yON MLB.com: My first memory of you was as an NBA writer with the New York Daily News. Do you ever think about writing again? Sims: I’m putting out a memoir. I don’t know when that’s going to come out. My wife and I are writing that. [Now] I spend a lot of time getting my workouts in and prepping for games. I like writing, but I love broadcasting. The writing chops developed when I was at the Philadelphia Inquirer and the New York Daily News. They come into play every day, crafting the narrative of a broadcast. So basically I’m writing all the time. I’m not just writing for print. MLB.com: How good is it to have your two sons, Jarett and Jordan, involved in your podcast, “Hey Now?” Sims: Yeah, man. It’s a lot of fun. We developed an on-air chemistry and rhythm. They are getting confident, which I really like. Almost everybody that comes on says, “This is so cool what you are doing with your sons.” I had a great relationship with my dad. I have a great relationship with my guys. It’s my Ben Cartwright [Bonanza] moment. MLB.com: What do you want Yankee fans to know about you? Sims: I lived in New York my entire professional life. I have a foundation in Philly, but my life is in New York and with a stop off in Seattle. I’m home. This is my life. This is one heck of an opportunity to put a ribbon on it. I’ll tell you what: I’m all in. Let’s go Yankees. I’m so looking forward to this."
MLB News,8 free agents who raised their stock after 1-year deals in '24,https://www.mlb.com/news/2024-2025-mlb-free-agents-coming-off-one-year-deals,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 03:16:26 GMT",,"Thomas Harrigan Juan Soto, Corbin Burnes, Willy Adames and Max Fried headline the list of players who are free agents for the first time this offseason. Also part of this class? An intriguing group of stars who are no strangers to the process, having navigated free agency just last year. MLB offseason signings and trades• Latest free-agent and trade rumors• Top 25 free agents | Every free agent, by position• Tracking every team's offseason moves• FA guides: Soto | Burnes | Alonso | Snell | Bregman | Fried | Santander• Offseason dates, rules & terms explained For various reasons, the eight players below signed one-year contracts (or multiyear deals with options that allowed them to hit the open market after 2024) following the 2023 campaign. All of them improved their stock this past season and now get a chance to test free agency again in search of a better outcome. Blake Snell, SP Why his stock was down last offseason: Snell had an incredible 2023 season for the Padres, winning Cy Young honors for the second time in his career after posting an MLB-best 2.25 ERA with 234 strikeouts. However, questions about the lefty’s consistency, control and durability, not to mention the Draft compensation tied to him after he rejected a qualifying offer, combined to depress his market. He remained unsigned for months until inking a two-year, $62 million deal (with an opt-out after 2024) with the Giants on March 19. Why his stock has improved: Concerns about Snell’s durability haven’t gone away after he made two trips to the injured list and threw only 104 innings in 2024. He also got off to a rough start after not having time to properly build up for the season. But Snell’s performance over his final 14 starts reaffirmed his stature as one of MLB’s best starters, as he posted a 1.23 ERA with a .123 opponents’ batting average. On the year, Snell placed in the 98th percentile in whiff rate and strikeout rate and the 99th percentile in hard-hit rate allowed, and he shaved 2.8 percentage points off his sky-high walk rate from 2023 (13.3%). Plus, he was ineligible to receive another qualifying offer this offseason, which means he isn’t tied to Draft compensation. You can read more about Snell’s improved free-agent case here. Teoscar Hernández, OF Why his stock was down last offseason: Hernández’s production regressed after he was traded from the Blue Jays to the Mariners prior to the 2023 season. Although he put up 26 homers with 93 RBIs, he also struck out 211 times and had a .741 OPS with a 108 OPS+ -- down from a 138 OPS+ across 2020-22. He landed with the Dodgers on a one-year, $23.5 million deal in January. Why his stock has improved: Going from pitcher-friendly T-Mobile Park to Dodger Stadium worked wonders for Hernández, whose numbers improved across the board. The right-handed slugger ended up slashing .272/.339/.501 (137 OPS+) with 33 homers and 99 RBIs over 154 games during the regular season and drove in 12 runs over 16 playoff games as Los Angeles won the World Series. Especially encouraging was the leap he made against breaking pitches -- he slugged .516 with 17 homers on those pitches in 2024, up from just eight homers and a .317 SLG in 2022-23. Jack Flaherty SP Why his stock was down last offseason: Flaherty showed ace potential in 2018-19 (3.01 ERA, 10.7 K/9), but he followed that up with a 4.42 ERA across 2020-23, missing significant time due to injury in that span. Flaherty managed to avoid the IL in 2023, but he put up a 4.99 ERA with a 1.58 WHIP and a 2.24 K/BB ratio over 144 1/3 innings between the Cardinals and Orioles. The right-hander signed a one-year, $14 million deal with the Tigers in December. Why his stock has improved: Perhaps no starting pitcher improved more from 2023 to 2024 than Flaherty, who notched a 3.17 ERA with 194 strikeouts and 38 walks (5.11 K/BB) over 162 innings between the Tigers and Dodgers. Year over year, Flaherty had the fifth-largest increase in strikeout rate (+7.1 points), the 10th-largest increase in whiff rate (+5.5 points) and the 10th-largest decrease in walk rate (+4.3 points) among qualifying pitchers.

Sean Manaea, SP Why his stock was down last offseason: After recording a career-high 4.96 ERA over 158 innings for the Padres in 2022, Manaea signed with the Giants as a free agent and spent 2023 pitching mostly as a bulk reliever in tandem with an opener. He threw 117 2/3 innings on the year and notched a 4.44 ERA, then opted out of the final year on his deal with San Francisco to test free agency again. The Mets signed the veteran southpaw to a two-year, $28 million deal with an opt-out after 2024. Why his stock has improved: Manaea was solid enough over his first 20 starts for New York, but he really took off after tweaking his arm slot to emulate Braves ace Chris Sale’s crossfire delivery in July. Manaea recorded a 3.09 ERA with 83 strikeouts and 18 walks over 75 2/3 innings in 12 regular-season starts after the change. He was key to New York's run to the NL Championship Series, with a 2.65 ERA in his first three postseason starts before running out of steam in NLCS Game 6. As expected, he opted out of his contract with the Mets and is back on the free-agent market for the third straight offseason. Luis Severino, SP Why his stock was down last offseason: Severino emerged as one of the game’s top young starters in 2017-18 (3.18 ERA, 10.5 K/9), but injuries ultimately derailed his career with the Yankees. Over his final five seasons with the team, he managed to pitch only 209 1/3 innings. On top of that, he struggled to the tune of a 6.65 ERA with 23 homers allowed over 89 1/3 innings (2.3 HR/9) in his last year before free agency. He left the Yankees to sign a one-year, $13 million deal with the crosstown Mets in December. Why his stock has improved: Although he didn’t quite recapture his peak form, Severino stayed healthy and made dramatic strides in the run-prevention department in 2024. The 30-year-old started 31 games -- his most since 2018 -- and recorded a 3.91 ERA with a 1.1 HR/9 over 182 innings. Severino’s new sweeper was one of the keys to his turnaround, holding hitters to a .139 average with a .238 SLG and inducing 60 strikeouts over 135 plate appearances. Jurickson Profar, OF Why his stock was down last offseason: Profar, who has gone from baseball’s top overall prospect to a journeyman outfielder, was MLB’s least valuable player (-1.6 WAR, per FanGraphs) in 2023. The veteran finished with nine homers and an 81 OPS+ in 125 games between the Rockies (who released him in August) and Padres before returning to San Diego on a one-year, $1 million deal in February. Why his stock has improved: Profar delivered the best season of his 11-year career in 2024, earning an All-Star starting nod and hitting .280 with 24 homers, 85 RBIs, an .839 OPS and 4.3 fWAR -- all career highs. His performance as San Diego’s starting left fielder was critical after the Padres traded superstar slugger Juan Soto to the Yankees to bolster their pitching staff in December. He logged 121 of his 158 starts batting first, second or third in the Padres' order. Joc Pederson, DH Why his stock was down last offseason: After registering 23 homers and a 146 OPS+ for the Giants in 2022, Pederson accepted the club’s qualifying offer to return to San Francisco for the following campaign. However, his second year in the Bay Area wasn’t nearly as impressive, as he produced 15 homers with a 112 OPS+. Given his defensive limitations and struggles against left-handed pitching, it’s not exactly a surprise that he didn’t have a robust market in free agency on the heels of that performance at the age of 31. Pederson joined the D-backs on a one-year, $12.5 million deal with a 2025 mutual option on Jan. 30. Why his stock has improved: Pederson not only rebounded with Arizona, he delivered one of the best years of his career with the bat, recording personal bests in batting average (.275), on-base percentage (.393) and OPS (.908) while slugging 23 homers in 449 plate appearances. Among hitters with at least 400 PAs in 2024, Pederson’s 151 wRC+ tied him with teammate Ketel Marte -- the third-place finisher in the NL MVP voting -- for 10th in MLB. He was worth 3.0 fWAR despite serving as a full-time DH and handling a strict platoon role that only allotted him 105 starts all year. Matthew Boyd, SP Why his stock was down last offseason: Boyd has been a serviceable back-end starter during his career, peaking in 2019 with 238 K’s, an 11.6 K/9 average and 3.2 fWAR for the Tigers. But after undergoing Tommy John surgery in 2023, the left-hander went unsigned as a free agent last offseason. He didn’t join a team until he signed a one-year deal with the Guardians this past June. Why his stock has improved: Boyd made his 2024 debut on Aug. 13 and gave Cleveland’s shorthanded starting staff a lift with a 2.72 ERA, 46 K’s and 13 BB’s in 39 2/3 innings over eight starts. He added a 0.77 ERA and 14 strikeouts across 11 2/3 innings in the postseason, helping the Guardians reach the AL Championship Series."
MLB News,Walker instills joy of reading in young Cardinals fans,https://www.mlb.com/news/jordan-walker-cardinals-give-back-to-community,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 19:00:55 GMT",,"John Denton This story was excerpted from John Denton’s Cardinals Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. In the days leading up to LifeWise STL’s early-April reading and math event with Cardinals slugger Jordan Walker and more than 50 area school kids, president and CEO Scott Walker wondered how intimidated and in awe the children would be upon seeing Walker in person. Within minutes of the event starting, the 22-year-old Cards right fielder had put LifeWise STL’s leadership team – and more importantly, the school children surrounding him – at ease with his megawatt smile and warm, welcoming persona. It is a memory that Scott Walker said will always stay with him from one of LifeWise STL’s most successful events of the year. “He is a tall young man, but he was amazing with the kids,” Scott Walker said of Jordan. “He was a natural with the kids with the way he related to them. Sometimes folks can be uncomfortable with 50 to 60 kids around them, but he got down at their level, was eye to eye with them and interacted in amazing ways. Like I said, he was a natural.” Walker, who made his MLB debut in 2023 and set a league record for players under 21 with hits in his first 12 games as a 20-year-old rookie, hails from a highly educated family that has always placed an importance on schooling. His father, Derek, holds degrees from Harvard and MIT, while mother, Katrina, graduated with honors from Harvard and Washington University in St. Louis. Following a stellar high school baseball career, Walker was headed to Duke University on a scholarship prior to being selected in the first round of the 2020 MLB Draft by the Cardinals. Walker told the kids in April and again in September, when approximately 200 high-achieving scholars were awarded a night at Busch Stadium to watch Walker play, that learning and growing have been keys to his success. “Walker’s Winners,” an event designed to motivate school-aged children from pre-K through 12th grade to set long-range reading and math goals, proved to be a highly effective catalyst. Those students read, on average, slightly more than 13 books thanks in part to the motivation provided by the program set up and orchestrated by LifeWise STL, Ready Readers, Cardinals Care and the Walker family. Most importantly, Scott Walker said, the push to continue reading helped scholars avoid the dreaded “summer slide,” a phenomenon where students fall back academically over the summer months while not sharpening their reading and math skills. On the September night when the group hit Busch Stadium for a game and free food, it was fittingly seated near Walker’s right-field position so the children could watch their mentor in action. “We were situated in a spot where when Jordan was out on the field, he was right there by us, and for the kids to see him live and in action, it was amazing for them,” Scott Walker said. “For a lot of these scholars, it was their first time going to a game. To be able to see a person in the gym with them at LifeWise and then see them in action at their professional setting, it was a great connection for them, and they were thrilled.” Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. With Thanksgiving coming on Thursday and the season of giving upon us, MLB.com wanted to highlight instances of Cardinals players like Jordan Walker giving their time to help others in need. Here is some of the admirable work the Cardinals have done in recent weeks and are planning this holiday season: • This past week, members of the Cardinals’ organization visited the new Cardinals-themed Family Room at the Ronald McDonald House to spread pre-holiday cheer. Team mascot Fredbird distributed memorabilia and interacted with families. • The Cardinals supported several veterans/military organizations, and on Nov. 11, team alumni Scott Terry and Lonnie Maclin visited and dined with the Missouri Veterans Endeavor (MOVE). • In addition to a grant in support of MOVE, grants either have been or will be provided to The Kaufmann Fund, Trees for Vets Program, Got Your Six Support Dogs, St. Louis Service Women’s Post 404, Armed Services YMCA, the Women Warriors Baby Shower and the Veteran Community Project to furnish tiny homes for veterans. Cardinals standout Brendan Donovan, someone whose life was profoundly shaped by his family’s commitment to military service, supported the Houses for Veterans’ event with his time and financial resources. • On Dec. 4, the Cardinals will kick off their annual holiday gift drive. Two days later, Cardinals alumni and front office personnel, led for years by president of baseball operations John Mozeliak, will ring Salvation Army bells in front of local businesses as part of the Red Kettle campaign for 2024. • The Cardinals, the St. Louis chapter of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America and the National Marrow Donor Program are in the midst of the annual Join4Joe blood stem cell donor drive, an annual blood stem cell donor drive to add individuals to the NMDP Registry. Growing the registry increases the chances of finding donor matches for patients awaiting a life-saving blood stem cell or bone marrow transplant. The campaign was organized to honor the legacy of Joe Strauss, a longtime Cardinals beat writer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch who passed away in December 2015 after a leukemia battle."
MLB News,Breaking down the Yusei Kikuchi deal from all sides,https://www.mlb.com/news/yusei-kikuchi-signing-with-angels-analysis,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 18:00:10 GMT",,"MLB.com We finally have our first major free agent deal of the offseason. After a slow first few weeks of free agency, news broke on Monday morning that the Angels had agreed to a three-year, $63 million contract with left-hander Yusei Kikuchi. (The club has not confirmed the deal.) The 33-year-old, who jumped from Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball to the Majors in 2019, is now entering his seventh MLB season. He pitched for the Mariners from 2019-21 (making his lone All-Star team in ‘21), then signed with the Blue Jays in 2022. Toronto dealt him at the 2024 Trade Deadline to Houston, where Kikuchi authored one of the best stretches of his career to help the Astros nail down the AL West title. Excluding right-hander Michael Wacha, who agreed to an extension with the Royals before officially becoming a free agent, Kikuchi is the first player from MLB.com senior national reporter Mark Feinsand’s top 25 free agents list to pick a team. Kikuchi ranked 20th on that list, and ninth among a stacked group of starting pitchers. He now joins the Angels, the busiest team of this young offseason. The Halos, looking to snap a 10-season playoff drought, already acquired slugger Jorge Soler in a trade with the Braves and inked catcher Travis d’Arnaud, infielder Kevin Newman and right-hander Kyle Hendricks to modest free-agent deals. But Kikuchi is their most significant acquisition to date. Kikuchi by the numbers 2024: 32 GS, 175.2 IP, 4.05 ERA (99 ERA+), 3.46 FIP, 3.5 fWARCareer: 154 GS, 809.2 IP, 4.57 ERA (91 ERA+), 4.53 FIP, 7.5 fWAR Here is a breakdown of this move from all angles, via MLB.com experts. What this means for the AngelsVia Angels beat writer Rhett Bollinger The Angels have been the most aggressive club in free agency this offseason and kept it up with their first big splash. The deal is the largest since Perry Minasian became general manager in 2020. Kikuchi represents a solid upgrade to the rotation after the Angels also signed Hendricks to a one-year deal worth $2.5 million. Kikuchi immediately becomes the club's best starting pitcher and can help the Angels compete after their 99-loss campaign in ‘24. Kikuchi joins a rotation that includes lefty Tyler Anderson, right-handers José Soriano and Jack Kochanowicz and Hendricks. The fifth spot is up for grabs and the Angels have several internal candidates, such as Reid Detmers, Chase Silseth, Caden Dana and Sam Aldegheri. MORE > What this means for the AstrosVia Astros beat writer Brian McTaggart The Astros were interested in a reunion and had made an offer to Kikuchi, whom they acquired in a July trade. He excelled after coming over from the Blue Jays, going 5-1 with a 2.70 ERA with 76 strikeouts in 60 innings in 10 starts after the Astros altered his pitch usage. The Astros’ rotation, anchored by Framber Valdez, Hunter Brown and Ronel Blanco, should still be a strength next year, but they still could use more depth. Kikuchi would have filled that void, but the Astros believed the price and years were too much for a mid-level starting pitcher like Kikuchi. Hot Stove implicationsVia senior national reporter Mark Feinsand The Angels were among the teams in the market for a starting pitcher, so the Kikuchi signing was no surprise. His signing takes one of the second-tier starters off the market, potentially setting the price range for some of the others in that group including Jack Flaherty, Sean Manaea and Nathan Eovaldi. Kikuchi is the first starting pitching domino to fall, but there are still plenty of pitchers out there for teams looking to upgrade their rotations. Diving deepVia analyst Mike Petriello Last year’s Angels rotation had the third-highest ERA in MLB, and 2025’s Angels rotation was, as of Sunday evening, projected to be the fourth-weakest in baseball. So yes, they desperately needed starting pitching – even if it’s not quite clear if this winter’s early-offseason strategy of signing lots of low-to-mid-level veterans with names you know is what’s going to get the team back from 99 losses to its first winning season since 2015. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Kikuchi likely becomes their Opening Day starter, which is both a reflection of how strong he was after being traded to the Astros last summer and how weak the incumbent Halos group was. The left-hander has always been a talented-yet-frustrating pitcher. At the time the Jays traded him south, he had a 4.72 career ERA, interspersing periods of quality with three different seasons with an ERA north of 5.00. But Kikuchi more than doubled his slider usage with Houston, mostly dumping his ineffective curveball, and saw his strikeout rate jump from 26% to 32%. That change, pairing the slider with a fastball that usually rates very well in pitch modeling metrics, might be real. But the drop in ERA from 4.75 (Toronto) to 2.70 (Houston) is at least in part fueled by his batting average on balls in play (BABIP) dropping by 100 points, an improvement that may be difficult to retain in front of a below-average Angels defense. Turning 34 in June, it’s probably unlikely that Kikuchi has unlocked some new level of consistency that we’ve never seen before. But if he’s merely raised his floor with the changes he made with Houston, he’ll instantly be the best starter the Angels have to offer, and for a commitment not past three years. That’s not nothing. Stat to knowVia MLB.com research staff 25.9%: That was the gap between Kikuchi’s strikeout rate (31.8%) and walk rate (5.9%) after joining the Astros, an improvement of more than 10 percentage points from his career K%-BB% at the time of the trade (15.3%). Of 69 qualifying pitchers from Aug. 1 through the end of the 2024 season, Kikuchi ranked fifth in MLB in that category, trailing only Blake Snell, Logan Gilbert, Zack Wheeler and AL Cy Young Award winner Tarik Skubal."
MLB News,These 5 teams have submitted offers to Soto (source),https://www.mlb.com/news/juan-soto-rumors,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 05:21:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of the latest news and rumors surrounding Juan Soto. Nov. 26: Five teams submit offers to Soto (source)To this point, Soto's free agency has been about meeting with teams and hearing their general pitches -- but that has changed according to MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi, who reports that five teams have submitted contract offers to the 26-year-old superstar: the Red Sox, Dodgers, Mets, Yankees and Blue Jays. ESPN's Buster Olney reported over the weekend that contract offers were expected to begin rolling in this week. Juan Soto has offers from 5 teams, source confirms the report by @RandyJMiller. Boston Red SoxLos Angeles Dodgers New York MetsNew York YankeesToronto Blue Jays @MLBNetwork Nov. 20: Soto has 'good meeting' with YankeesThe Yankees met with Soto on Monday in California, and team owner Hal Steinbrenner confirmed Wednesday that it was a ""good meeting"" with ""very honest back-and-forth dialogue."" Steinbrenner said that Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, manager Aaron Boone, president Randy Levine, and special assistant to the GM Omar Minaya were all in attendance during Monday's meeting. But he didn't divulge any part of the team's pitch to Soto or say if any offers were made during the meeting. ""It's been a priority,"" Steinbrenner said about signing Soto. ""We wouldn't have gone out to the West Coast if it wasn't. ... We'll be in the mix. I'll leave it at that."" As of Wednesday, Soto has had in-person meetings with the Yankees, Mets, Red Sox and Blue Jays. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Tuesday that Soto will also meet with the Phillies at some point. Soto also plans to sit down with the Dodgers this week, according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. Steinbrenner said he has ""no idea"" if the Yankees will meet with Soto again or if he's confident that the club can re-sign the 26-year-old superstar. But he added, ""[W]e've got the ability to sign any player we want to sign."" Nov. 19: Phillies plan to meet with Soto (report)Yet another team has emerged as a potential suitor for Soto: the Philadelphia Phillies. According to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman, the Phils plan to meet with Soto at some point, though nothing has been scheduled yet. Soto reportedly has already met with the Blue Jays, Red Sox, Mets and incumbent Yankees and is scheduled to meet with the Dodgers next. Per Heyman, it's believed that no offers have been made to Soto yet. The Phillies already have one of the most complete rosters of any MLB team, but they are looking for ways to improve after failing to advance past the National League Division Series in 2024. Phillies ownership has shown a willingness to pay up for some of the top free agents on the market, with Bryce Harper, Trea Turner, Zack Wheeler, J.T. Realmuto, Aaron Nola, Nick Castellanos and Kyle Schwarber all signing lucrative deals with Philadelphia in free agency. Phillies managing partner and CEO John Middleton was candid in addressing Soto's market earlier this month, saying that he believes the outfielder wants to be in New York but adding that Philadelphia could get involved in the bidding anyway as a ""stalking horse."" Nov. 18: Cohen to best any Soto offer by $50 million (report)Yankees broadcaster Michael Kay said on his radio program on Monday that according to a source, Mets owner Steve Cohen is willing to beat any other club's offer to Soto by $50 million. ""I'll put it this way,"" Kay said. ""And I don't think this is something Yankees fans are going to want to hear. I don't think the Yankees are going to go [up to $700 million]. I don't. And then I've heard from somebody in baseball today that Cohen is willing to go $50 million over whatever anybody offers. So it looks like the Mets really want to get this guy."" Nov. 18: Dodgers expected to meet with Soto this weekSoto's decision on where to sign this offseason is the most anticipated in baseball, and according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, ""the feeling around the industry"" is that the decision could be made before the annual Winter Meetings get underway in Dallas on Dec. 9. Feinsand also writes that the Dodgers are expected to be the next team to meet with Soto, with plans to sit down with the superstar slugger sometime this week and perhaps as early as Tuesday. More > Nov. 18: Yanks meet with Soto (report)MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reports in an article for the New York Post that the Yankees met with superstar slugger Juan Soto in Southern California on Monday as they look to retain him after he helped lead them to the World Series. More > Nov 16: Blue Jays, Red Sox and Mets have met with Soto (reports)The Red Sox met with Soto and his representatives, including agent Scott Boras, in Southern California on Thursday night, according to a report from Sean McAdam of MassLive. It appears they aren't the only club that has chatted with the 26-year-old superstar. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Saturday morning that the Blue Jays, along with Boston, have made ""impressive in-person presentations"" to Soto. Heyman later added another team to the list, reporting that the Mets met with Soto on Saturday. He noted that ""all early signs suggest the meeting went extremely well,"" and that owner Steve Cohen and other ""high-ranking Mets officials"" made the trip. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. The Red Sox's meeting with Soto, which was of an introductory and informative nature, per McAdam, lasted for three hours and was deemed as “productive,” though neither money nor terms were discussed between the parties. Soto was reportedly “impressed” by Boston’s presentation, which included a video noting the franchise’s history of star players from the Dominican Republic, Soto’s native country. The Red Sox also detailed their plans for the future, highlighting a promising group of prospects who could potentially team up with Soto to help the club be successful in the years to come. Heyman reports that Soto is scheduled to meet with a fourth team, the Yankees, on Monday in California."
MLB News,"Talk about offseason buzz! Triple-A Salt Lake Bees unveil new logos, uniforms",https://www.mlb.com/news/angels-affiliate-salt-lake-bees-unveil-new-logos-and-uniforms,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 17:08:00 GMT",,"Benjamin Hill ""It's a refresh, not a rebrand. We would say it's an evolution, not a revolution."" That's how Ashley Havili, VP of marketing and merchandise for the Salt Lake Bees, describes her team's new logos and uniforms. The Triple-A Angels affiliate unveiled its refreshed look on Monday, checking off a key item on the offseason to-do list in advance of moving to new Daybreak Field in 2025. Today's Salt Lake Bees were established in the Pacific Coast League in 1994, playing as the bee-adjacent Buzz (1994-2000) and Stingers (2001-05) before adopting their current moniker in 2006. Utah is the Beehive State, and the Bees name has long been utilized by Salt Lake City's professional baseball team. The first iteration of the Bees debuted in 1915 and they, too, were members of the Pacific Coast League. ""We're moving to a new ballpark in the southwest quadrant of the [Salt Lake] Valley. With the move, do we completely go through a rebrand and come up with a new identity for the team? Or do we stay the Bees?"" said Havili. ""[The Bees] are one of Utah's most beloved and recognizable brands. Instead of pivoting and abandoning the brand equity that we've built, we decided to lean into it."" The Bees color palette remains predominantly black and gold, with the addition of an ""Angels red"" accent color that appears on the sleeve patch as well as the sleeve trim of a cream colored alternate uniform. A new custom primary script, black with yellow accents, is displayed on the home and black alternate jerseys. The primary logo, meanwhile, prominently features Bumble, the Bees mascot. ""Bumble is our most famous player, because it's Minor League Baseball,"" said Havili. ""There's so much transition with the players, they come and go. But Bumble is an icon for us. He's a little bit more serious of a bee now, like a killer bee, but he's really fun. He's going to be on our on-field hat, which will probably be one of our most popular."" The Bees' new look is packed with references to franchise history and Salt Lake City's baseball legacy. The interlocking SL ligature references is modeled after the look of the original Bees teams of the early 20th century, while also paying tribute to Salt Lake's '70s and '80s era Gulls and Trappers teams.

MLB News,Here are 8 prospects standing out in winter ball,https://www.mlb.com/news/early-2024-25-winter-leagues-prospect-roundup,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 00:00:00 GMT",,"Joe Trezza Now that the Arizona Fall League has crowned a new champion and MLB's awards season is winding down, the baseball world in the United States is preparing to turn its attention to the Hot Stove. But that doesn't mean baseball isn't being played. There are plenty of exciting and talented prospects still lacing their cleats into November and December in the many winter leagues down in warm-weather countries like Venezuela, Mexico and the Dominican Republic. (Fans, don't forget, you can stream all LIDOM games on MLB.TV.) Last season, notable prospects Jackson Chourio and Junior Caminero used their winter ball experiences to propel them toward impactful Major League stints with the teams they will be a major part of for many years to come. The same could happen this time around, with what happens this winter potentially affecting Major League teams next spring and beyond. Here are eight early standouts from players among their club's Top 30 Prospects list. You can track all the ranked prospects in winter leagues here. More from MLB Pipeline:• Top 100 prospects | Stats | Video | Podcast | Complete coverage Hyungchan Um, C, Brisbane Bandits (Australia)KC No. 25The 20-year-old South Korean is looking to become the first Major League backstop from his country. He found success after a successful run in Australia last winter, earning a promotion this June to Single-A Columbia, so he’s back down under this offseason looking to replicate those results. He’s been one of the hottest hitters down under, batting .423/.483/.731 with two homers, six RBIs and 11 hits in his first seven games. Luisangel Acuña, SS/OF/2B, Cardenales de Lara (Venezuela)NYM No. 12Acuña made such an enormous impact for the Mets down the stretch that some might forget his prospect stock had been dropping since arriving in New York's organization in the 2023 Trade Deadline deal for Max Scherzer. So it makes sense that the 22-year-old would play winter ball in his native Venezuela this year, especially after posting a .299 on-base-percentage and .654 OPS in 131 games at Triple-A Syracuse this summer. So far, the versatile right-handed hitter is riding the momentum from his 14-game stint in the Majors, hitting .364/.421/.576 with a homer and four steals in his first 11 games for Lara. Zach Dezenzo, 3B, Senadores de San Juan (Puerto Rico)HOU No. 5The 24-year-old Dezenzo reached the big leagues with Houston down the stretch and scored a run in Game 1 of the American League Wild Card Series, but overall was limited to 52 Minor League games due to injury in 2024. He's in Puerto Rico playing winter ball ahead of what'll be an important spring for him as he tries to crack the Astros' 2025 Opening Day roster. He's demonstrated a mature approach so far, slashing .379/.472/.414 with five walks in his first eight games. César Prieto, INF, Aguilas Cibaenas (LIDOM)STL No. 14The 25-year-old Cuban is a contact specialist who has always hit, and he's tapped into more power since arriving in the Cardinals system via a deal with Baltimore at the 2023 Trade Deadline. This winter is no different. He played in 12 games for Aguilas last winter and has already suited up in 11 for them this year, hitting .318 with 14 hits in that limited action. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Tirso Ornelas, OF, Charros de Jalisco (Mexico)SD No. 17The 24-year-old Ornelas plays all year round. He played in 63 games last winter in the Mexican League after a full Minor League season, and already has 24 games under his belt this winter in his native country after spending the entire 2024 season at Triple-A El Paso. Ornelas can hit. He batted .297 with 23 homers and an .864 OPS -- and some of the better exit velocities in the Padres' organization -- at El Paso this summer. And he's done a little bit of everything at the plate this winter, hitting .309/.429/.531 with four homers, 17 RBIs and six steals for Jalisco. Hector Rodriguez, OF, Leones del Escogido (LIDOM)CIN No. 12The 20-year-old Rodriguez won Dominican Winter League Rookie of the Year honors last winter and is back performing well for Escogido this time around, hitting .361/.375/.472 over his first 10 games after spending the entire season at High-A Dayton. He socked 12 homers, seven triples and 24 doubles at Dayton this summer. Luis Gastelum, RHP, Caneros de Los Mochis (Mexico)STL No. 30Signed out of Mexico as a 21-year-old in 2023, Gastelum had a breakout year at Single-A Palm Beach this year and has continued pitching well in his native homeland this winter. The right-hander’s best pitch is his changeup, and he’s used it effectively in a large sample this winter, pitching to a 1.37 ERA in 19 appearances for Los Mochis and binging 28 strikeouts in 19 ⅔ innings. Braden Nett, RHP, Senadores de San Juan (Puerto Rico)SD No. 19The 22-year-old Nett reached Double-A San Antonio down the stretch after spending most of the year at High-A Fort Wayne. But he totaled just 65 innings across 20 appearances (19 starts), so there was leash left for him to build up a few more innings in Puerto Rico this winter. They’ve gone swimmingly so far, with Nett posting a 0.90 ERA in 10 innings across three starts, as well as a 13-3 strikeout-to-walk rate during those frames."
MLB News,"Edgar in expanded role, Seitzer to be named hitting coach for '25 (sources)",https://www.mlb.com/news/edgar-martinez-kevin-seitzer-mariners-hitting-coach-roles-2025,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 04:43:50 GMT",,"Daniel Kramer SEATTLE -- The Mariners are expected to formally announce their 2025 coaching staff in the coming days, potentially as soon as Tuesday, and Edgar Martinez will indeed return but in a broader role, specifically overseeing the club’s overall hitting program, sources familiar with the situation told MLB.com on Monday night. Additionally, the Mariners will name Kevin Seitzer as their hitting coach, who will report to Martinez, and Bobby Magallanes as assistant hitting coach, sources said. Seitzer spent the 2015-24 seasons in the same role with the Braves, overseeing one of MLB’s best offenses during his time there, which included seven playoff appearances and the 2021 World Series title. Magallanes was Seitzer’s assistant hitting coach in Atlanta, from '21-24. Separately, Carson Vitale -- the Mariners’ Major League field coordinator since the 2020 season -- is leaving the organization to join new Marlins manager Clayton McCullough as bench coach in Miami. Seitzer, 62, played 12 seasons in the Majors (1986-97) then was the hitting coach for the D-backs (2007), Royals (2009-12) and Blue Jays (2014) before being hired by the Braves. He was an integral figure in Atlanta’s rebuild at the time of his hire and remained a key figure during the club’s sustained run of winning, which included six straight National League East titles and an NL Wild Card berth last year. Seitzer was influential in the development of Braves homegrown products such as Ronald Acuña Jr., Ozzie Albies and Dansby Swanson. He also helped Matt Olson and Marcell Ozuna produce the finest seasons of their respective careers. Magallanes was there alongside him since 2021, but neither was retained after last season despite each having one year remaining on their respective contracts. His job in Atlanta was his first in MLB. Martinez spent the final 34 games as the Mariners’ hitting coach last season -- with positive results -- under new manager Dan Wilson after Scott Servais was relieved of his duties. Martinez will spearhead the implementation of general hitting philosophies and coaching practices, and he will be a regular presence for home games and in Spring Training but isn’t expected to regularly travel. That itself was expected as Seattle wrapped the 2024 season, when Martinez expressed an interest in returning in some capacity -- along with just about everyone within the organization -- but in a less demanding role. Before being brought on in the interim role on Aug. 22, Martinez served as the Mariners’ hitting coach from midway through the 2015 season through the end of ‘18. The coaching transition, specifically on the hitting side, has been significant over the past 12 months. Last November, the Mariners hired Brant Brown to a newly created position as offensive coordinator and Tommy Joseph as assistant hitting coach, supplementing director of hitting strategy Jarret DeHart. All three have since left the organization, with Brown let go in May despite being just months into the job and DeHart dismissed with Servais in late August. Joseph left for the same role with the Orioles earlier this month. The turnover has been a byproduct of a lack of offensive consistency. The Mariners finished 85-77 last year and, excluding tiebreakers, one game back of the final American League Wild Card spot, as the first team on the outside looking in on the postseason standings. Yet they operated with arguably the AL’s best starting rotation, one seemingly built for October yet handcuffed by its offense. Before Martinez took over, Seattle ranked 28th in OPS (.666), 27th in runs per game (3.93) and 30th in strikeout rate (27.7%). After, they ranked fourth in OPS (.764), fourth in runs per game (5.09) and 15th in strikeout rate (23.7%). The Mariners are bullish on bridging the successes under Martinez with the experience from Seitzer and Magallanes to solve their offensive riddle."
MLB News,Ortiz brings baseball greats together for annual golf charity,https://www.mlb.com/news/david-ortiz-hosts-annual-celebrity-golf-classic-2024,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 18:39:11 GMT",,"Ian Browne This story was excerpted from Ian Browne’s Red Sox Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. BOSTON -- As David Ortiz and his celebrity friends from the sports and pop culture worlds galivanted around Marco Island, Fla., at the 16th annual “Weekend with Papi” Celebrity Golf Classic, it was about far more than the glitz and the glamour. The mission was to raise money -- lots of it -- for kids in the Dominican Republic and New England in need of open heart surgery. Ortiz has been at this for over a decade-and-a-half and the impact of his foundation is bigger than anything he did on a baseball field. The golf tournament is where so much of the money gets made, between the golfing, the sponsorships and the on-line auction. “We raise money to save kid’s lives,” Ortiz said by phone on Friday. “As you know, all these life-saving surgeries that we have provided throughout the years have been amazing. We have been able to take care of more than 1,600 kids throughout the years and get their surgery done. We look forward to doing this every year. And the one thing that people should know also is that with $5,000, you can save a life.” A post shared by David Ortiz Children's Fund (@davidortizfund) Ortiz sees living proof all the time of what his foundation has accomplished. “Now that I live in the Dominican, I see people who are working in places where our foundation has been able to take care of their child. They come to me, thanking me. A lot of people, they don’t have the funds to be able to pay for this surgery. It’s been amazing,” said Ortiz. How did open heart surgeries for children become the focal point of Ortiz’s foundation? “I had a friend that basically showed up at my house, and he wanted me to give him five minutes, he wanted to show me something,” said Ortiz. “When we went to the hospital, they had this empty room with two kids and their surgery was done, but they were struggling. I remember one of these kids, he was my son’s age at the time. “All I thought about was me being that child’s parent and not having the opportunity or the money to be able to provide for his surgery. That was my motivation to begin, and you see what we’ve got going on 16 years later.” The goal at this year’s event was to raise $1,775,000 million. This year’s baseball attendees include Pedro Martinez, Johnny Damon, Gabe Kapler, Mookie Betts, Dustin Pedroia, Brock Holt, Jackie Bradley Jr., Kevin Youkilis, Terry Francona, Barry Larkin, Derek Jeter, Jim Rice and Alex Rodriguez among many others. There was basketball royalty on hand as Anthony Mackie and Anthony Anderson added even more of a buzz. A post shared by Terry Francona (@terryfrancona_reds) Aside from Ortiz himself, no baseball player committed more to the cause than the late Tim Wakefield, who died following complications from brain cancer in 2023. “Wake supported this foundation for so long that there is not a moment while we are doing it that we don't remember him or mention him or do something related to him,” said Ortiz."

MLB News,Breaking down Bregman's top suitors ... and each of their chances,https://www.mlb.com/news/alex-bregman-potential-fit-astros-tigers-or-phillies,"Sun, 24 Nov 2024 02:05:13 GMT",,"MLB.com Alex Bregman is the best third baseman available in free agency this year, and numerous clubs are expected to bid on the 30-year-old two-time World Series champion. In recent times, three teams in particular have been rumored to be interested in Bregman, with the most obvious being Houston, where he’s played his entire career. The other two are Detroit and Philadelphia. MLB.com beat writers debated the pros and cons for each: Why Bregman makes the most sense for… Astros: He’s arguably the Astros’ most popular player behind Jose Altuve when it comes to Houston’s run of success over the last decade. Plus, his wife is from Houston and he’s put down some roots in Texas. Bregman said at the end of the season he’d like to remain with the Astros, who took him with the No. 2 overall pick in the 2015 Draft out of LSU. The Astros, who have won seven of the past eight AL West titles and have been to the World Series four times since 2017, are still in a win-now mode, and winning is all Bregman has known. They made the ALCS in his first seven full seasons in the big leagues before falling short last season. Altuve practically pleaded with the Astros to keep Bregman in Houston when the season ended, and owner Jim Crane later admitted Altuve’s words carry meaning. -- Brian McTaggart Tigers: A look at Detroit’s roster and its season shows a team on the rise with young talent all over the field. Bregman is the veteran leader and proven winner that can help the Tigers take the next step, and the kind of impact right-handed bat to balance out what became a lefty-leaning lineup down the stretch and into the playoffs. His high-walk, lower-strikeout approach at the plate fits the Tigers’ mantra of dominating the strike zone, and his outstanding defense at third base can stabilize a position that has been a revolving door at Comerica Park since Nick Castellanos became an outfielder years ago. Oh, and he played for Tigers manager A.J. Hinch for four years in Houston, including with the 2017 World Series champions. -- Jason Beck Phillies: The Phillies are looking to shake up the roster following two disappointing finishes in the last two postseasons. President of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski hinted that trades are coming, and no tradeable player is probably more valuable than All-Star third baseman Alec Bohm. If the Phillies got a good enough return for Bohm, they would need to find a replacement. Who better than Bregman? -- Todd Zolecki What will each team’s best “pitch” be? Astros: Bregman will turn 31 at the start of next season, so a six- or seven-year contract extension means he’ll probably finish his career in Houston. Altuve’s extension prior to last season will keep him in Houston until he’s 39 years old, and Bregman could join him as an “Astro for life” if he re-signs with Houston. Altuve desperately wants to Bregman to return, and the two -- the only remaining position players who were on both of Houston’s championship teams -- could finish their careers in Houston as the faces of the golden era of baseball in Houston, the same way Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio were the faces of an Astros team that made the playoffs six times from 1997-2005 (1997-99, ‘01, ‘04-05). -- McTaggart Tigers: Bregman won playing for Hinch on a blossoming young team before. Why not run it back as the veteran on a team that’s ready to win? Leading another up-and-coming young team to glory would be a boon for his career résumé. Comerica Park doesn’t have the Crawford Boxes, but Spencer Torkelson and Matt Vierling have shown the past couple years that it can be a fair park for right-handed hitters, and a perfect place for Bregman to recapture the doubles numbers he posted early in his career. And Michigan is great for fishing in the summer. -- Beck Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Phillies: The Phils have been one of baseball’s best teams the past three years, and Phillies managing partner John Middleton wants a World Series trophy more than anything. And with stars like Bryce Harper, Trea Turner, Zack Wheeler, Aaron Nola and others signed for the next few seasons, they’re not going to stop trying anytime soon. -- Zolecki What’s the biggest hurdle that could stand in the way of Bregman signing?  Astros: Simply put, money. Crane isn’t a believer in signing free agents to lengthy deals, which is why the team has let players like George Springer, Gerrit Cole and Carlos Correa walk in years past. And the fact the Astros have continued to win at a high level even though so many key players have left in free agency proves it’s been a good strategy. Crane has never guaranteed more than five years to a free agent, and the biggest deal he’s given to any player is the $151 million Altuve received with his extension in 2018. The baseline for a Bregman deal may be the six-year, $151 million third baseman Matt Chapman -- also a Scott Boras client -- received from the Giants in September. Regardless, it will take a club-record deal to keep Bregman in Houston. -- McTaggart Tigers: While the on-field fit with Bregman is obvious, the financial fit is another matter. The Tigers have not been a team for bidding wars; even under the late owner Mike Ilitch, they were more active finding undervalued or overlooked free agents (Pudge Rodriguez, Magglio Ordonez, Kenny Rogers) than outbidding teams for highly-sought talent. There’s a ton of payroll space in Detroit, but the Tigers just got past one long-term deal that didn’t age well (Miguel Cabrera), and still have Javier Báez for three more years. President of baseball operations Scott Harris has been more attracted to shorter-term deals and long-term flexibility, both in Detroit and in his previous job as Giants general manager. He might have to weigh how much he wants to stretch a deal to get Bregman. -- Beck Phillies: The Phillies are almost certainly going to cross the third luxury tax threshold this year. They’d prefer not to push past the fourth, but it would be unavoidable if they signed Bregman. There is speculation that Bregman could be a $30 million a year player. The Athletics' Ken Rosenthal recently wrote that Bregman, however, could be pushing for a contract similar to Manny Machado’s 11-year, $350 million deal. If that’s the case, can the Phillies really afford three $300-million players in Harper, Turner and Bregman, plus Zack Wheeler, who is going to make $42 million this year? -- Zolecki"
MLB News,Where do Yankees stand in Soto pursuit?,https://www.mlb.com/news/yankees-rumors-latest-trades-and-signings,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 15:55:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of all the latest Yankees-related free agent and trade rumors right here. You can follow the latest Juan Soto rumors here. Nov. 25: What might a Soto contingency plan look like?The Yankees are one of four teams -- along with the Mets, Blue Jays and Red Sox -- that remain most likely to sign Juan Soto, per a report from USA Today's Bob Nightengale. But what if Soto signs elsewhere? That same report from Nightengale suggests that one potential pivot for the Yanks would still bring in quite the haul. That would include signing free-agent first baseman Christian Walker, along with either Willy Adames or Alex Bregman to play third base with Jazz Chisholm Jr. shifting to second -- but that's not all. New York could also then attempt to swing a trade with the Cubs for outfielder Cody Bellinger, plus use some of the money it would have given to Soto to make a push for an elite starter in Corbin Burnes, Blake Snell or Max Fried. Of course, all of that hinges on whether the Yanks bring back Soto -- something that is still very much in play. Nov. 22: 'Mutual interest' between Yanks, RHP Buehler (report)Dodgers right-hander Walker Buehler threw the final pitch of this season at Yankee Stadium, closing out Game 5 of the World Series in the Bronx. Might Yankee Stadium also be where Buehler throws his first pitch in 2025? MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi has been told that there is ""some mutual interest"" between Buehler and the Yankees, who are looking to augment their starting rotation this offseason. Buehler was largely ineffective during the '24 season as he made his way back from a second Tommy John surgery. But he showed flashes of his former All-Star self late in the season, capped by six scoreless innings across two outings during the Fall Classic -- a five-inning start in Game 3 and that one-inning appearance out of the bullpen in the finale. The 30-year-old is a former first-round Draft pick who is not too far removed from being one of the best pitchers in baseball. In 2021, Buehler finished fourth in the National League Cy Young voting after recording a 2.47 ERA with 212 strikeouts over 207 2/3 innings. Nov. 20: Steinbrenner: Yankees 'in the mix' for SotoThe Yankees met with Juan Soto on Monday in California, and team owner Hal Steinbrenner confirmed Wednesday that it was a ""good meeting"" with ""very honest back-and-forth dialogue."" Steinbrenner said that Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, manager Aaron Boone, president Randy Levine, and special assistant to the GM Omar Minaya were all in attendance during Monday's meeting. But he didn't divulge any part of the team's pitch to Soto or say if any offers were made during the meeting. ""It's been a priority,"" Steinbrenner said about signing Soto. ""We wouldn't have gone out to the West Coast if it wasn't. ... We'll be in the mix. I'll leave it at that."" As of Wednesday, Soto has had in-person meetings with the Yankees, Mets, Red Sox and Blue Jays. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Tuesday that Soto will also meet with the Phillies at some point. Soto also plans to sit down with the Dodgers this week, according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. Steinbrenner said he has ""no idea"" if the Yankees will meet with Soto again or if he's confident that the club can re-sign the 26-year-old superstar. But he added, ""[W]e've got the ability to sign any player we want to sign."" Nov. 18: Yanks meet with Soto (report)MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reports in an article for the New York Post that the Yankees met with superstar slugger Juan Soto in Southern California on Monday as they look to retain him after he helped lead them to the World Series. Heyman noted that owner Hal Steinbrenner led a delegation from New York that included general manager Brian Cashman and manager Aaron Boone. Per Heyman, the Yankees are said to be ""gung ho"" about getting a deal done with Soto, who has met with three other clubs so far -- the Blue Jays, Red Sox and Mets -- and is reportedly scheduled to meet with the Dodgers. Nov. 14: Yanks reportedly 'in on everyone' in free agencyAlthough the Yankees are going to make a strong effort to bring back Juan Soto, there’s a real chance the superstar outfielder will sign elsewhere, which means New York needs to have a backup plan in place. That backup plan appears to leave no limits. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Thursday in the New York Post that the Yankees are ""in on everyone."" One day earlier, during his live chat for Bleacher Report, Heyman was a little more specific on which non-Soto players the Yanks might target. Heyman said he sees the Yankees becoming more aggressive in the corner-infield market if they don’t land Soto. In that scenario, the Bronx Bombers could target Pete Alonso to play first base, or pursue Willy Adames or Alex Bregman to handle third base. Adames is a natural shortstop, but he is reportedly willing to move to another position for the right team/contract. The Yankees ended the season with Jazz Chisholm Jr. at the hot corner, but they could move Chisholm to second base to replace free agent Gleyber Torres. Heyman also thinks the Yanks would “look more seriously” at signing one of Corbin Burnes, Max Fried and Blake Snell to bolster their rotation and pursue switch-hitting slugger Anthony Santander to replace Soto in their outfield. Nov. 11: Yankees among teams with reported interest in WalkerRe-signing Juan Soto is the Yankees' top priority this offseason, but the club also has a hole at first base that it needs to fill after declining Anthony Rizzo's 2025 club option. The position was a weak spot for the Bronx Bombers in 2024, with Yankees first basemen posting the second-worst wRC+ (76) in MLB. Accordingly, the Yankees are among the teams planning to ""aggressively pursue"" free-agent Christian Walker, per a report from USA Today’s Bob Nightengale. They aren't alone, however, as Nightengale reports that at least five other teams are eyeing the right-handed slugger. The Bronx Bombers have also been connected to Alonso, but the longtime Mets first baseman seems like more of a backup plan in case the Yanks aren't able to re-sign Soto, given the exorbitant cost it would take to sign both players. With the age disparity between Alonso (29) and Walker (33), the latter should come with a much lower price tag, perhaps leaving room in the Yankees' budget to re-sign Soto and add Walker. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Walker doesn’t have quite the same power as Alonso, but he’s no slouch with the bat, having recorded 95 homers and an .813 OPS over the past three seasons. In that same time, Alonso has produced 120 homers and an .826 OPS. Walker, meanwhile, is a far better defender, winning three straight Gold Gloves and leading his position with +38 Outs Above Average since the beginning of 2022. Alonso has produced -17 OAA in that span. Nov. 8: Yanks set to meet with Soto soon (report)The Yankees have scheduled their own sitdown with Juan Soto as they get ready to make their pitch to re-sign their superstar slugger, according to a report from the New York Post on Friday. Yanks owner Hal Steinbrenner is expected to fly to California in about a week and a half to meet with Soto. The Mets are also reportedly visiting Soto next week, but per the Post's report, the Yankees have been assured that they will still be able to meet with Soto after that. The New York rivals are two of the favorites to land Soto, the marquee free agent on the market this winter. Soto had arguably the best season of his career in 2024 after the Yankees acquired him from the Padres in a blockbuster trade last December. The 26-year-old batted .288 with 41 home runs, 109 RBIs, 128 runs scored and a .989 OPS and led New York to the American League pennant. Nov. 7: Could Arenado be on the move? Are Yankees a fit?According to reports by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and USA TODAY, eight-time All-Star and 10-time Gold Glove Award-winning third baseman Nolan Arenado could be available in trade discussions if he's willing to waive his no-trade clause. The same goes for veteran starting pitchers Sonny Gray and Lance Lynn. Arenado, who will be entering his age-34 season in 2025, is coming off a year in which he produced the lowest offensive output in any full season (excluding the 2020 pandemic-shortened campaign) since his rookie year in 2013. He finished this past season with a .719 OPS and 16 home runs for St. Louis. Still, he's only two seasons removed from a third-place finish in NL MVP voting. Yankees announcer Michael Kay, on his ESPN Radio show on Thursday, suggested that Arenado would be a good fit at third base for New York as opposed to spending big money on free-agent first baseman Pete Alonso. Nov. 7: Yanks interested in numerous star FAs, 'aggressive' in bullpen marketThe No. 1 item on the Yankees' offseason to-do list remains re-signing Juan Soto. However, he is expected to take his time in making a decision, and the Yanks' roster has multiple areas of need. So while Soto remains the priority, New York has to look for options at other positions. According to MLB Network insiders Jon Heyman and Jon Paul Morosi, they are doing just that. Heyman wrote Wednesday in the New York Post that the Yankees have ""checked in"" on first baseman Pete Alonso and outfielder Anthony Santander, although both are viewed as ""backup plans"" in case Soto signs elsewhere. Although Soto's departure would leave a hole in the Yankees' outfield, Alonso would make sense as a secondary option since New York's first basemen recorded a 76 wRC+ this season, worst in the American League. Per Heyman, the Yankees have also expressed interest in the top starting pitchers in free agency, including Corbin Burnes, Blake Snell and Max Fried. Yet Heyman adds that it's ""uncertain"" if the Yankees will be able to afford both Soto and a bona fide ace to slot in next to Gerrit Cole. The prices won't be as high in the reliever market, and the Yankees have been ""among the most aggressive teams"" in searching for bullpen help during this week's General Managers Meetings, per Morosi. The Yankees have Luke Weaver returning for 2025, but they have a handful of impactful free-agent relievers: Clay Holmes, Jonathan Loáisiga, Tommy Kahnle and Tim Hill. Morosi mentions Tanner Scott, Jeff Hoffman and Carlos Estévez as possibilities for the Yanks if they don't re-sign some of those aforementioned arms. ""The New York Yankees fully realizing that even with Luke Weaver at the back end of the bullpen, they need to be active in the relief pitching market,"" Morosi said during Thursday's edition of Hot Stove. Yankees are among the most aggressive teams in speaking with reps for free-agent relievers at the GM Meetings. One reason: Three members of their World Series bullpen -- Clay Holmes, Tommy Kahnle, Tim Hill -- are free agents. @MLBNetwork Nov. 4: Cole staying with Yankees on existing dealGerrit Cole is staying with the Yankees. The Yankees' ace will remain in New York on the same four-year, $144 million deal he originally opted out of. Cole and the Yankees will continue to discuss options for a potential contract extension, according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. But for now, the Yankees have secured their ace through the 2028 season. The Yankees had a deadline of 5 p.m. ET on Monday to decide whether to void Cole's opt-out and prevent him from reaching free agency by adding a one-year extension worth $36 million to his pre-existing deal. Instead, the Yankees and Cole were able to negotiate an agreement that excludes that additional year, but still keeps Cole in New York for the same contract that he would have had if he hadn't opted out, while allowing for the possibility of an extension later. Oct. 31: Soto: 'Every team has the same opportunities' in free agencyJuan Soto has been a free agent for less than 24 hours, but a bunch of teams have already been in contact with him, according to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman. Heyman writes in the New York Post that eight teams checked in with Soto in the hours after he and the Yankees lost to the Dodgers in World Series Game 5 on Wednesday. By Thursday morning, the number of interested clubs was up to 11. The incumbent Yankees are likely to make a strong effort to bring him back, but while Soto said after New York’s season-ending loss that he was happy with the team and the city, he also made it clear he’s not giving the Bronx Bombers an edge over any other potential suitor. “I feel like every team has the same opportunities when I go into free agency,” Soto said. ""I don't want to say anyone has an advantage, because at the end of the day we're gonna look at what they have and how much they want me."" Oct. 31: Re-signing Soto atop Yankees’ offseason prioritiesThe good news for the Yankees is that they finished the 2024 season with the best record in the American League and earned their first trip to the World Series. The bad news is that they were outplayed by the Dodgers in the Fall Classic, which Los Angeles ended with a Game 5 win Wednesday. For the Yankees, any season that doesn’t end with a World Series title is deemed by many as a failure. How their offseason is judged will hinge largely on one action: re-signing Juan Soto. The 26-year-old was phenomenal with the Yankees after being acquired prior to this season in a trade with San Diego. He hit a career-high 41 home runs, led the American League with 128 runs and had a 178 OPS+, his best in a full season. “I’m really happy with the city, with the team, how these guys do,"" Soto said after the Yankees' season-ending loss. ""But at the end of the day, we’re going to look at every situation, every offer that we get, and then take a decision from that.” The Yankees will face fierce competition for Soto’s services, perhaps most of all from the crosstown Mets. Even if Soto returns, the Yankees’ lineup will have a different look in 2025 as infielder Gleyber Torres and outfielder Alex Verdugo are slated to become free agents. Anthony Rizzo, who posted a .637 OPS, carries a $17 million club option for next season. The Bronx Bombers will likely try to add another impact bat to take some of the pressure off of Soto and Aaron Judge, who carried the Yankees’ offense throughout the year. A host of Yanks relievers are set to be free agents, including Clay Holmes, Jonathan Loáisiga, Tommy Kahnle and Tim Hill. Cole could also opt out of his contract, but the Yankees can void that decision by adding a 10th year onto his contract for $36 million."
MLB News,"Why the India-Singer swap makes sense for both Reds, Royals",https://www.mlb.com/news/brady-singer-to-reds-jonathan-india-to-royals-trade-analysis,"Sat, 23 Nov 2024 18:38:47 GMT",Cincinnati acquires veteran RHP Singer in exchange for 2B India,"MLB.com The Reds and Royals combined for the biggest trade of the young offseason (so far) on Friday night, when Cincinnati acquired veteran righty Brady Singer in exchange for second baseman Jonathan India and outfielder Joey Wiemer. It was one of those rare deals that saw each team acquiring a proven big leaguer to address an area of need. TRADE DETAILSReds get: RHP Brady SingerRoyals get: 2B Jonathan India, OF Joey Wiemer Let's take a closer look at this exchange from all angles, via MLB.com experts: Why it makes sense for the RedsVia Reds beat writer Mark Sheldon Singer is not known for power stuff and his sinker -- the right-hander's primary pitch -- averaged just over 92 mph last season. He's a ground-ball pitcher and often induces lighter contact. That should serve him well going from pitcher-friendly Kauffman Stadium to hitter-friendly Great American Ball Park. In 32 starts and 179 2/3 innings for Kansas City last season, Singer was 9-13 with a 3.71 ERA and 3.1 bWAR. He had more starts and innings than anybody on Cincinnati's pitching staff in 2024. “Last year, we had 16 pitchers on our staff that started games, so just getting someone with some durability and some longevity that’s had quality in the big leagues that we feel can shore up the rotation,"" Reds president of baseball operations Nick Krall said. ""Those two guys have a chance to really add impact and length to our team.” The Reds’ rotation is expected to have All-Star Hunter Greene, Nick Martinez and Singer, plus Nick Lodolo, Andrew Abbott, Rhett Lowder, Carson Spiers and Graham Ashcraft in the mix for the remaining spots. More >> Why it makes sense for the RoyalsVia Royals beat writer Anne Rogers The Royals have always been fond of India, and he was identified as a potential trade target during this past season, general manager J.J. Picollo said on Friday night. When Wiemer’s name was introduced as part of the potential package, the Royals felt comfortable closing the deal. “Clearly, we were looking for a leadoff hitter,” Picollo said. “ ... We wanted to address on-base. We wanted somebody to provide consistency for us in that leadoff spot. And Jonathan’s going to do that. We were very happy to acquire him. And Joey Wiemer is another player that we’ve always thought very highly of, a highly touted prospect.” India, who will turn 28 on Dec. 15, was the National League’s Rookie of the Year in 2021 and has been a key piece of the Reds’ infield for the past four years. He has a career .253/.352/.412 slash line, and in 2024, when he wasn’t totally healthy despite playing 151 games, he posted a .749 OPS with 15 home runs and 28 doubles. Where India fits defensively is yet to be determined. He has only played second base in his MLB career, but he could have the ability to play third base and outfield. The Royals will discuss his fit, along with returning second baseman Michael Massey’s, throughout this offseason. More >> Hot Stove implicationsVia executive reporter Mark Feinsand With a relatively weak second-base free-agent market led by Gleyber Torres, the Royals jumped the trade market by acquiring India, who was among the best second basemen available on the trade market. Singer isn’t at the same level as some of the top starting pitchers in free agency, but he has had solid seasons in two of the past three years and he is under control for the next two seasons, giving the Reds a cost-controlled starter to bolster their rotation. Diving deepVia analyst Mike Petriello Singer and India were both first-round picks in the 2018 Draft, and each has had some success in the Majors, but neither has been an impact player so far. That’s likely to continue on their new clubs, as they’ll be more supporting players behind bigger stars. India’s entire game is essentially about having one elite skill, and that’s not chasing outside the zone -- and nobody in the Majors was better than him at that last season. While his below-average power (28th percentile hard-hit rate) is likely to look even weaker going from the Majors' best home run park to one of the worst, Kauffman Stadium is actually just as good of a right-handed-hitting park as Great American Ball Park. That is, in part, because it reduces strikeouts and has a huge outfield to cover, which might help India if he can just lace liners into the gaps. While he’s an average hitter overall (104 OPS+), that’s a big deal for a thin Kansas City lineup that probably had only three hitters (Bobby Witt Jr., Salvador Perez and Vinnie Pasquantino) who were even projected to be average. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Singer has been a somewhat similar average-to-slightly-below-average pitcher over his career, though he’s had big platoon splits both in terms of handedness (lefty batters have an OPS that is 103 points higher over his career) and location (he’s been 66 OPS points worse away from Kansas City). There’s a real concern that a pitcher who doesn’t really miss many bats or limit hard contact might give up more than a few extra homers in Cincinnati, though his ability to keep the ball on the ground (79th percentile in ground-ball rate) should help with that somewhat. If the Reds can teach him something to attack lefties, they may find some usage. If not, someone has to eat up the back-end innings."
MLB News,"Perdomo, meet Moise: Some D-backs wins come off the field",https://www.mlb.com/news/geraldo-perdomo-diamondbacks-making-a-difference-in-community,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 18:29:04 GMT",Shortstop's friendly gesture has great significance for young fan,"Steve Gilbert This story was excerpted from Steve Gilbert’s D-backs Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. How does one tell the story or measure the impact of the work the Diamondbacks organization does in the community? There are cold, hard numbers -- the D-backs are at around $93 million in charitable giving since their inaugural 1998 season and will cross the $100 million mark in 2025. But it's the stories about the lives that have been changed by all that giving that truly tell the tale. Take the example of a 10-year-old boy named Moise. Moise was a refugee from Uganda, who came to his first baseball game in 2024 as a guest of the Diamondbacks. Shortstop Geraldo Perdomo saw Moise sitting in the first row by the home on-deck circle next to Debbie Castaldo, the D-backs’ senior vice president of corporate and community impact, and just knew that Moise wasn't a typical fan. So Perdomo walked over and touched hands with Moise through the netting, introducing himself. ""He looks like me!"" Moise said to Castaldo. Perdomo visited with Moise after the game and invited him back to the ballpark for lunch the next week. After lunch, Perdomo took Moise onto the field to teach him how to play baseball. ""This little boy, who was dealing with a whole lot of very difficult things in that moment, found baseball and found a role model and found someone who looks like him that he could believe in,"" Castaldo said. ""Now he walks around wearing a Perdomo jersey and Perdomo T-shirts that we've given to him. “It's just who Perdomo is. He just has an absolute heart of gold, and he knows the impact he had on this little boy. And I think the little boy had an equally big impact on him."" Castaldo considers herself lucky to be working under an ownership group, led by managing general partner Ken Kendrick and team president/CEO Derrick Hall, that values having an impact in the community and is willing to put money and support behind it. And she deals with a clubhouse full of players and staff who are willing to help out where they can. There's right-hander Zac Gallen's passion to help the fight against hunger in Arizona, where an estimated one in six kids don't know where their next meal will come from. Gallen, whose nickname is ""The Milkman,"" teamed up with the Arizona Diamondbacks Foundation, St. Mary's Food Bank and Shamrock Farms through his Zac Gallen 23 Charitable Fund to raise money to provide milk and meals for food-insecure children. Gallen hosted events this year that raised $100,000 for St. Mary's. ""He's so smart and easy to work with,"" Castaldo said of Gallen. ""He really digs in and wants to see real dollars go to work to create solutions for a complex problem like hunger, especially with children."" Another one of the Diamondbacks’ marquee players, outfielder Corbin Carroll, is known around the organization for volunteering for community events. His CC7 Charitable Fund helps fund programs that support children’s programs and projects dedicated to empowering, celebrating and inspiring kids to reach for the stars. ""Corbin's passion for children who are underserved is really amazing,"" Castaldo said. ""His work with the D-backs Nike Jr. RBI Program with the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Valley is just one of the things he does. His donation of gear -- bats and gloves -- is so important because most of the kids don't have the best equipment to be able to compete with. “He just is a very unique player when it comes to his passion for meeting children and young adults all the way through high school. He takes the time to look them in the eye and talk to them. Just a few minutes with him might give them just a moment of lift that they need. He's very rare with his dedication."" Manager Torey Lovullo helps set the tone for all of it with his Torey Lovullo Kindness Champions program, which works with Ben's Bells, Positive Coaching Alliance and the Diamondbacks Foundation to reward K-12 students for kind behavior. Castaldo can list a number of other players who are involved in various projects, and she is thankful for their help. In the spirit of being thankful, the D-backs recently posted on Instagram a thank you to fans. For every interaction the post receives through Tuesday, the team will donate $5 to Arizona food banks.

Plus, the Bills lose during the bye week.","If Saquon Barkley is dreaming about winning NFL MVP, maybe he should give Cooper Kupp a call. In 2021, Kupp had one of the great individual seasons in league history. He won the receiving triple crown with a ridiculous 145 catches-1,947 yards-16 touchdowns line. And for that he got one NFL MVP vote. Aaron Rodgers won in what was ultimately a forgettable season by him. Kupp probably wasn't surprised. NFL MVP changed in 2014, when J.J. Watt was clearly the best player in the league but lost MVP to an ultimately forgettable season from Rodgers. That's when it fully became an award for whatever quarterback was at the front of the line when the season ended. For 12 of the last 15 seasons, and each of the last seven seasons, the MVP has been a quarterback off a No. 1 seed. Yet Barkley's 255-yard game against the Rams has given him some much-needed MVP buzz late in the season. Barkley might have a shot, which is rare for a non-quarterback. Here's what he'll probably need to do to win the award: Set the single-season rushing record, or at least eclipse 2,000 yards: Eric Dickerson's 2,105-yard record has stood since 1984. Barkley is on pace for 2,150.5 yards. Breaking an iconic record would give him a push. Getting to 2,000 would help. Four of the eight 2,000-yard rushers in NFL history won MVP. No running back since 1993 has won without a 2,000-yard season or setting a single-season touchdown record. Would Barkley win if he ends with, say, 1,950 yards? Ask Kupp how that goes. Eagles get the No. 1 seed: The overemphasis on picking an MVP quarterback from a No. 1 seed is maddening, but it's part of the formula now. A non-QB faces long odds to win, and probably can't leave any box unchecked. If the Eagles can overtake the Lions for the top seed, that would eliminate voters defaulting to someone like Jared Goff. And Barkley could argue he's the most valuable player on a top seed. That matters. QBs slip up: Barkley is on a record pace coming off a massive game in a nationally televised stage, and he's still not the MVP favorite. He's actually a decent bit behind. At BetMGM, the favorite is Josh Allen (+150 odds) followed by Lamar Jackson (+220), then Barkley (+650) and Goff (+700). Everyone else is at least 10-to-1. You'll hear a lot this week about Barkley's MVP chances, and he's in the conversation, but those odds are a reminder that if there's a QB who can win, that's what will happen. Barkley likely needs a stumble from Allen, Jackson and maybe even Goff. That's just how the award is now. Barkley is having a remarkable season. But he still needs a few things to happen to actually win NFL MVP."
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Projecting the new College Football Playoff rankings as the regular season nears its end,https://sports.yahoo.com/projecting-college-football-playoff-rankings-130000553.html,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 13:00:00 GMT",Nicole Auerbach builds her 12-team bracket after Alabama and Ole Miss pick up their third losses and Indiana suffers its first defeat of the season.,"We've somehow made it to the final week of college football's regular season. I know — I can't believe it, either. But we've still got three sets of College Football Playoff rankings to go. On Tuesday night, we'll see what the selection committee makes of three-loss Alabama and three-loss Ole Miss. We'll learn how the group treats Indiana after its first defeat came at the hands of the No. 2 team in the country. Will the ACC be well-positioned to get two teams into the 12-team field? Could the committee re-evaluate its stance on Boise State and move the projected Big 12 champion ahead back ahead of the Broncos? These are just some of the questions I want answered this week. I've also answered them myself. As I evaluated teams and resumes here in Week 14, I've come to the very obvious conclusion that the bubble is filled with flawed teams. It's so similar to the men's NCAA Tournament bubble, although in that case we're arguing about the 35th- and 36th-best teams in the country. But the point remains the same: If you're close to the cut line, it's because you didn't fully take care of business. That's why this decision will be made by 13 people in a Texas boardroom. Alabama has now lost three games, and two of them are not good losses. Vanderbilt will likely finish the season with a .500 record. Before beating the Tide, Oklahoma had only had one SEC win on the season; it's been such a rough season for coach Brent Venables that he had to fire his offensive coordinator in mid-October. And Alabama wasn't even remotely competitive against the Sooners, scoring the fewest points it's had in a game since 2004. At some point, a certain number of losses should be disqualifying. Alabama has lost more than a quarter of the games it has played this year. So has Ole Miss, who has an indefensible loss to Kentucky — the Cats' only SEC win this season — and a bad loss to Florida, which had been .500 heading into Saturday's game. The Rebels' loss to LSU is aging badly, too. Still, Alabama is close to making the cut. I've got the Tide as my first team out of the bracket, largely on the strength of their win over Georgia, coupled with a top-15 win over South Carolina and a win over LSU (that, admittedly, is weakening by the week as the Tigers continue to freefall). Because of the head-to-head result, I've got to keep the Tide ahead of three-loss South Carolina — a team I think is actually playing better than Alabama — and I've also got a two-loss Clemson in the mix with them as well. It is possible that the winner of Clemson-South Carolina this weekend jumps ahead of Alabama by Selection Sunday. Either way, as much as I'd love to fully eliminate all the three-loss teams, I can't quite do it with the Tide ... even after a historically lopsided loss to Oklahoma. The three bad losses in SEC country last Saturday — Alabama's to Oklahoma, Ole Miss' to Florida and Texas A&M's to Auburn — significantly helps Indiana stay in the bracket after its first loss of the year, to Ohio State. The Hoosiers' strength of schedule is also much stronger now that it played a team with a pulse; it now ranks 51st in the country per ESPN, ahead of Oregon, Miami, Arizona State, SMU, Notre Dame and Boise State. While Indiana is definitely now a bubble team, I think that it'll be on the right side of the bubble considering its dominance in its wins, its strength of record (7th in FBS) and its only loss coming to a team that the committee greatly respects. Penn State has a loss to No. 2 Ohio State, too, and the Nittany Lions have been ranked in the top five for weeks (without a marquee win to prop up their resume, just like the Hoosiers lack). The ACC should be well-positioned to get two teams into the 12-team field now that the SEC has cannibalized itself a bit as well. If the SEC only sends three teams to the CFP instead of four, I expect the ACC to take advantage of the opening. SMU should slide into the field now, which should position the Mustangs or Miami (whoever loses the ACC championship game) to be ranked high enough to stay in the 12-team field if they lose in the additional game. Remember, the committee is being pressured not to penalize the losers of conference title games. Meanwhile, the myriad upsets in the Big 12 have cemented the conference's fate as a one-bid league. Things are so dire in that conference that there's a real fear the Big 12 champion will be leapfrogged by a Mountain West champion Boise State team, and that the Broncos would earn the No. 4 seed and a first-round bye. The committee suggested its willingness to do that by ranking Boise State ahead of BYU and Colorado last week. And I tend to agree with the committee here if the Big 12 champion ends up being two-loss Arizona State, as I'm projecting. The rest of my projected bracket should be relatively straightforward. I'm still projecting Oregon to win the Big Ten, Texas to win the SEC and Miami to win the ACC. I've got Ohio State, Notre Dame, Penn State and Georgia hosting first-round games, and SMU as my last team into the field. And while I'm sure there will be grumbling about the teams on the outside looking in, I again implore you to think about the losses they could have avoided and the flaws they could have addressed by now. Teams are who they are and what they've done. Results matter. And my projected bracket reflects that."

Nov. 26, 12:30 a.m. The Soto sweepstakes has officially entered the next phase. After Soto and agent Scott Boras met with potential suitors earlier this month for teams to make their pitch and get to know each other better, the remaining interested teams were expected to begin makings offers for the superstar outfielder this week. We've now learned that according to numerous reports those five teams who have made offers are the Mets, Yankees, Dodgers, Red Sox, and Blue Jays. The terms haven't been revealed on any of the offers, but the expectation is that the 26-year-old slugger will land a deal that will make him the highest-paid position player in baseball history. Nov. 25, 9:41 a.m. With the sweepstakes for Soto expected to soon heat up, executives around the league view the Mets as the ""clear-cut favorite,"" reports Bob Nightengale of USA Today. Those executives don't think Mets owner Steve Cohen will be outbid for Soto, and believe that the Yankees ""have a price in mind that they don't want to exceed"" for him. Per Nightengale, the two other teams seriously involved in the Soto market are the Red Sox and the Blue Jays. However, Nightengale notes that the Jays ""would have to dramatically beat the Mets' offer to have a prayer."" As far as the Phillies, they have not yet spoken to Soto's agent, Scott Boras, to express interest. Nov. 24, 3:00 p.m. According to a report from ESPN's Buster Olney, interested teams are expected to begin forwarding offers to Soto and agent Scott Boras this week. Olney also reiterated that the meetings Soto has had with clubs were more about getting to know the team and hearing their pitch, with financials not involved. The Soto sweepstakes is reportedly down to five or six teams: the Mets, Yankees, Blue Jays, Red Sox, Dodgers, and possibly the Phillies, who reportedly plan to meet with Soto, though it's currently unknown whether or not that meeting happened. Nov. 21, 3:34 p.m. The Soto sweepstakes could be down to five or six teams, reports Jon Heyman of The New York Post. Those teams are the Mets, Yankees, Blue Jays, Red Sox, Dodgers, and possibly the Phillies -- though Philadelphia has not yet had a meeting with Soto's camp. Per Heyman, following Soto's meeting with Yankees brass earlier this week, the slugger ""felt better"" about Hal Steinbrenner and the Yanks than he previously had. Yankees people think Soto will take the best deal offered, with Heyman noting that is why the Mets are ""probably as well-positioned as anyone."" The Mets, Yankees, Jays, and Red Sox have already met with Soto, and the Dodgers had been expected to meet with him earlier this week. It's unclear where things stand with the Phillies. Nov. 20, 11:35 p.m. The Boston Red Sox are officially in the Soto Sweepstakes with team president and CEO Sam Kennedy confirming the club's meeting with the coveted free agent outfielder this week and highlighting a sense of ""extreme urgency internally"" driving the team to spend on players – even if they are unable to get Soto – to end a postseason drought. “Even if it takes us over the [competitive balance tax],” Kennedy said Wednesday at the MLB owners meetings, via The Boston Globe. “Our priority is 90 to 95 wins, and winning the American League East, and winning the division for multiple years.” As it stands now at the start of free agency, the Red Sox have the 13th highest payroll ($163.9 million) when it comes to the CBT, which is expected to be $241 million for the 2025 season. After fielding a $224 million squad that finished the year 81-81 last season, is it possible for them to offer the type of money it appears likely to require to secure Soto’s signature? “Is that possible? If that’s what it takes, yeah, absolutely,” Kennedy said, via The Globe. “We are investing more than we did last year. We intend to invest going forward. There is an extreme urgency internally to be competing for the American League East Championship and to set ourselves up for a deep postseason run in 2025 without question. The goal is to win 90 plus games to not be worrying about a wild-card spot.” Of course, Kennedy did not mention Soto’s name when speaking with reporters, saying, “I’m not allowed to talk about the player but it’s going to be that person’s decision.” Interestingly – or perhaps it is nothing more than a red herring – the Globe noted that the interview with the Red Sox president was interrupted by a phone call from David Ortiz. The topic of conversation with Ortiz was not revealed but the reporter observed Kennedy “appeared quite pleased by the conversation.” Nov. 20, 12:51 p.m. Speaking at the MLB owners meetings on Wednesday, Hal Steinbrenner shed light on the Yankees' recent sit-down with Soto. Steinbrenner noted that he hadn't yet thought about a ""walk-away number"" for Soto or an overall payroll number for the team. As far as the Yankees' confidence level when it comes to retaining Soto? ""No idea,"" Steinbrenner told reporters, including Tim Healey of Newsday. ""We’ll be in the mix. I'll leave it at that."" Regarding what the Yankees fans want, Steinbrenner quipped that he's ""got ears"" and knows what's expected of him. Steinbrenner was also asked if losing Soto to the Mets would hurt especially badly. “No,"" he responded. ""As I said, we’re going to be in the mix for Soto. If it doesn’t work out, it’s going to hurt a little bit no matter where he goes."" As things currently stand, the Yankees have roughly $220 million committed to the payroll for 2025. Signing Soto would likely bring that number close to $270 million. The Yanks have roughly $130 million committed to four players through 2027 -- a number that would jump to nearly $180 million for five players with Soto back in the mix. Here's what Steinbrenner had to say about the Yankees' payroll: ""We're in a better starting position than we were a year ago. There's no doubt about that. Look, year after year after year after year, payrolls similar to this year and the luxury taxes they produce are not sustainable, not feasible, and that's the case for the vast majority of owners, and maybe all of the owners. ""Doesn't mean in any given year I can't do what I want to do. I mean, we've got the ability to sign any player we want to sign."" Nov. 19, 9:30 p.m. The Yankees are reportedly ""encouraged"" by their Monday meeting with Juan Soto and his desire to remain in the Bronx. According to NJ.com's Bob Klapisch, the Yankees left their meeting with Soto's camp feeling positive. The Yankees contingent consisted of Hal Steinbrenner, team president Randy Levin, GM Brian Cashman, Aaron Boone and senior advisor Omar Minaya, and they all addressed Soto directly. Soto reportedly wanted confirmation from Steinbrenner about his commitment to excellence. The 2024 MVP finalist also reportedly pointed out where the Yankees need to improve, which Steinbrenner said there will be upgrades to next year's roster. The Mets and Steve Cohen are believed to be the biggest obstacle to a Yankees reunion with Soto, but according to Klapisch, Steinbrenner is believed to be ""100 percent committed"" to being competitive with Cohen. Soto's team has already met with the Red Sox, Blue Jays and Mets with the Phillies and Dodgers still planning to meet with the superstar outfielder. Nov. 19, 11:59 a.m. The Phillies are planning to meet with Soto, reports Jon Heyman of The New York Post. The Mets, Yankees, Red Sox, and Blue Jays have already met with Soto, with the Dodgers expected to have a sit-down with him on Tuesday. Other teams that have been linked to the star outfielder include the Giants and Rays. The Phillies currently have a payroll projected to be around $260 million for 2025, factoring in their arbitration-eligible players and before any external additions. Philadelphia's payroll is top-heavy, with $120.2 million committed to four players (Zack Wheeler, Trea Turner, Bryce Harper, Aaron Nola) through 2027. But the Phillies' payroll commitments drop in a big way after 2027, with just $88.63 million currently on the books. Nov. 18, 7:39 p.m. Next up in the Soto sweepstakes are the Los Angeles Dodgers who will hold their meeting with the outfielder and his agent Scott Boras early this week, possibly as early as Tuesday, reports MLB's Mark Feinsand. The Dodgers, who do not need to travel far, will be following both the Mets and Yankees who met with Soto in Los Angeles on Sunday and Monday, respectively. Los Angeles will be the fifth team to sit down with the free agent Soto. That list also includes the Toronto Blue Jays and Boston Red Sox and will surely get bigger with teams such as the San Francisco Giants, Philadelphia Phillies and Tampa Bay Rays also in the mix, per Feinsand. Nov. 18, 9:02 a.m. The Yankees will make their pitch to Soto and his camp on Monday in California, per multiple reports. Their meeting with Soto comes two days after he met with a Mets contingent that included owner Steve Cohen and president of baseball operations David Stearns. Soto also met with the Red Sox and Blue Jays last week. It is unclear if the Yankees' meeting with Soto is the last in-person powwow he'll have before negotiations for his services heat up. SNY MLB Insider Andy Martino recently reported that there could be a resolution with Soto before or around the MLB Winter Meetings, which start on Dec. 9. The expectation is that Soto, who recently turned 26 years old, will sign a deal that's potentially as long as 14 years and worth upwards of $600 million. Nov. 16, 11:06 a.m. A day after reports indicated representatives from the Boston Red Sox held a ""productive"" meeting with the free agent, some new details emerged about the three-hour encounter. Jon Heyman of The New York Post reported that he is hearing that ownership from the Red Sox and Toronto Blue Jays made ""impressive in-person presentations"" to Soto. Heyman noted that there are still ""multiple team owners"" who have yet to make their pitch to the highly-coveted 26-year-old outfielder and will have their opportunity to do so in the coming days. Toronto's meeting with Soto – as first reported by ESPN's Jeff Passan – took place in California this week. The Mets and Yankees have yet to meet with Soto. Nov. 15, 8:46 a.m. The Red Sox had a ""productive,"" three-hour meeting with Soto and his representatives on Thursday in California, reports Sean McAdam of MassLive. Per MassLive, the Boston contingent at the meeting consisted of president Sam Kennedy, chairman Tom Werner, chief baseball officer Craig Breslow, and manager Alex Cora. During the meeting, the Red Sox screened a video that showcased their ""history of star players from the Dominican Republic"" and went over their plans for the future -- including their highly-rated farm system. According to MassLive, Soto inquired about ""the team's commitment to winning, player evaluation methods, and Fenway Park and its facilities."" Because the meeting was a get-to-know-you session, there was no formal offer made, per MassLive. The Red Sox are in the midst of a downturn, with their last winning season coming in 2021. They finished in last place in the AL East in 2022 and 2023, and went 81-81 in 2024, finishing in third place -- behind the Yankees and Orioles. Boston's future payroll situation is strong, with the team having just a shade over $90 million on the books for 2026 -- theoretically giving them the flexibility to extend a massive offer to Soto. Nov. 14, 12:07 p.m. Former Met Carlos Beltran, who is now a special assistant to president of baseball operations David Stearns, recently discussed New York's pursuit of Soto. ""The Mets want to improve the team and there is no doubt that they will go after all the players that are on the open market knowing that the piece that everyone wants is Juan Soto, and the Mets do not rule out going full blast after him,"" Beltran told Joseph Reboyras of Primera Hora in Spanish. Beltran also talked about the dedication and seriousness of owner Steve Cohen, and how that could impact the Soto sweepstakes. ""The owner of the Mets is one of the wealthiest in the game and he wants to win,"" Beltran said. ""When he tells the press that he wants to win, he doesn’t say it to get the fan excited and go to the ballpark. Really, it’s something personal for him and I was able to experience it this year being around the team."" Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor traveled to Los Angeles earlier this week. When approached, he would not confirm or deny whether he was there to attend the Mets' scheduled sit-down with Soto, who is meeting in California with interested clubs. Beltran discussed the importance of a player like Lindor possibly helping to recruit Soto. ""That is always important. I think that you as a free agent player, knowing what Lindor did last year, and what you know he can do, there is no doubt that you want to associate or share your career with players like Lindor,"" Beltran said. ""I know that is an influence and I know that Soto will probably consider that. He already experienced Judge. Now he has the opportunity to listen to, at least, Lindor."" Nov. 13, 9:12 a.m. The Giants have been expected to be among the top suitors for Soto, but they don't have a meeting set with him yet, according to Jayson Stark of The Athletic. Soto is starting to take meetings this week in California, according to multiple reports. The Blue Jays, Red Sox, Mets, and Yankees have meetings on the books for this week, per ESPN's Jeff Passan. As far as the Giants, they have been trying (and failing) to lure big free agents to San Francisco in recent years. They were in on Shohei Ohtani last offseason before he signed with the Dodgers, and were deep in discussions with Aaron Judge a few offseasons ago before he re-signed with the Yankees. While the Giants have been linked to Soto, it was reported last week by Andrew Baggarly of The Athletic that their offseason is ""expected to be marked by austerity measures."" That wouldn't seem to mesh with an all-out pursuit of Soto, who could get a contract worth $600 million or more. Nov. 12, 9:40 a.m. While the Dodgers are interested in Soto, it seems unlikely they'll be serious players for his services. ESPN's Jeff Passan reports that the Dodgers ""won't chase after Soto,"" adding that they would ""gladly consider him"" if his market softens. Soto's market softening is highly unlikely, with the 26-year-old being heavily pursued by most of the biggest-spending clubs in the sport. The Dodgers have the wherewithal to sign any player, but their long-term salary obligations (to Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts, and others) and current needs (starting pitching) make them a dubious fit for Soto. It has also been reported that Soto has a strong preference for the East Coast, which could bode well for the Mets, Yankees, and Red Sox. Per Passan, the above three teams and the Blue Jays have meetings set up with Soto this week. Passan notes that Soto could sign before the Winter Meetings begin on Dec. 9. Nov. 6, 10:40 p.m. The Juan Soto sweepstakes continues and the teams vying for his services are reportedly becoming more clear. According to Jon Heyman of The Post, the Tampa Bay Rays are among seven known teams that have checked on Soto. The 80-82 club joins the Yankees, Mets, Giants, Blue Jays, Dodgers and Red Sox looking to bring the outfielder in. There are at least four other mystery teams that reached out to Soto's camp, bringing the total number to 11. SNY's Andy Martino reported Wednesday that there's a sense Soto ""enjoyed the Yankee experience and will return if the team presents what he considers a fair offer."" What that number is, is still unknown. As for the Mets, Martino says he has the ""impression that the Mets are willing to be very aggressive financially"" in their attempts to acquire Soto. Oct. 31, 9:23 p.m. Although MLB free agency is still days away, teams have already begun courting Soto just hours after the Yankees' season ended in Game 5 of the World Series. Up to 11 teams have checked in on the star outfielder, and the number that may get a contract done with him is $700 million, Jon Heyman of the NY Post reports. Teams cannot discuss money until five days after the end of the World Series. One of those reported 11 teams is seemingly the Mets. The Mets are interested in acquiring Soto in free agency, according to The Post's Mike Puma. It doesn't come as any surprise, as a lot of money from contracts to Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander comes off the books this offseason. ""We've got financial flexibility,"" president of baseball operations David Stearns said at Citi Field on Wednesday during his end-of-season news conference. ""It means that pretty much the entirety of the player universe is potentially accessible to us. That's an enormous opportunity. I envision us taking advantage of that opportunity, and being aggressive in certain spaces."" Soto said after Game 5 that he desires to go to a winning team, but won't close the door on any organization and that ""every team has the same opportunity."""

Denver Broncos kicker Wil Lutz was the highest scorer on the week with a 22-point performance. Unfortunately, not many were able to take advantage of that big performance, as he was rostered in just 21% of Yahoo leagues last week.

He accounted for just over half of the team's total scoring in the win, as the Broncos improved to a 7-5 record. It does appear that big kicker performances are becoming a pattern up against the Las Vegas Raiders, having allowed 10+ fantasy points to opposing PK's in all but two games this season. Next up on their schedule are the Kansas City Chiefs, who are rolling out Spencer Shrader at kicker while Harrison Butker is out due to injury.

It's time we acknowledge something very important. We, the fantasy football community, may have given up on Miami Dolphins TE Jonnu Smith too early. After several years of awaiting his big breakout season, most had lost all hope that he'd ever return fantasy value. Now, with Tua Tagovailoa under center, he's had a resurgence, sitting as the TE4 overall this season in half-PPR scoring formats. Since Tagovailoa's return to the lineup in Week 8, Smith is tied for the third-most receptions (28) and receiving yards (299) and the second-most receiving TDs (3) among all tight ends.

Addison's 26.2 fantasy points marked the second-most he's had in a single game over his two-year career, and perhaps what's more impressive is the fact that this breakout game took place alongside a now-healthy T.J.

There's a tone change inside the Browns organization regarding their starting QB situation. And Broncos coach Sean Payton knew exactly what he was doing.,"It’s Thanksgiving week in the NFL and a good time to take stock of the AFC’s quarterback outlook with a pinch of optimism. For every team. Even the Las Vegas Raiders. No need to punch anyone in the cranberries this week. So off we go with thankful thoughts … I’m thankful for the potentially heated MVP debate that Josh Allen sparked with a dramatic win over the Kansas City Chiefs and Patrick Mahomes and is going to facilitate down the stretch. Between Allen, Baltimore Ravens Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson, Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley, Detroit Lions quarterback Jared Goff and whoever else shows up to the party, the 2024 vote could be one of the most interesting and split that we’ve seen in years. The schedule lines up nicely for Allen to have a big finish, with his two center stage moments coming against the San Francisco 49ers in prime time on Sunday night, and then against the Lions and Goff on Dec. 15. If Allen and the Bills win those, they likely won’t lose another game the rest of the season. I’m thankful the Dolphins and quarterback Tua Tagovailoa had two cakewalk wins heading into the Thanksgiving Day game at Lambeau Field against the Green Bay Packers. They’re likely going to have needed them. Predictably, the Thanksgiving game is expected to be frigid — in the low 30s — and with a high possibility of snow. That’s the cruelest of Tagovailoa’s kryptonite weather, showcased by his much-discussed 0-7 record whenever the game temperature descends to 40 degrees or lower. Tagovailoa is clearly sick of talking about it, but he also knows it’s a real thing, adjusting some of his training toward colder climates. There are few bigger stages to snap a losing streak than in front of a Thanksgiving audience. This is Tagovailoa’s shot. I’m thankful the Patriots didn’t buy into the late-stage personnel community nitpicking last spring, which framed quarterback Drake Maye as a raw project who lacked the ability to throw accurately downfield. I always thought Maye was the most overthought pick amongst the 2024 draft’s quarterbacks — likely because he’d had attention on him for so long. At one point, some evaluators were even focusing some of their criticisms through the NFL performances of Sam Howell and Mitch Trubisky. New England’s staff never bought into that, and despite not having a roster that was ready to support him, they chose talent over timing. There’s still a lot of work to do and the results have been a grind at times, but Maye is elevating one of the most talent-thin skill position groups in the league, while surviving a bad offensive line. If the Patriots can get to the offseason with him healthy, they can use their league-leading 2025 salary cap space (more than $139 million at this point) to start wrenching on the pieces around him. As disappointing as it turned out, I’m thankful the Jets’ failed Aaron Rodgers experience isn’t dragging out another season. After firing head coach Robert Saleh and general manager Joe Douglas, there was no reason to keep stringing along a situation that really ended when Rodgers ruptured his Achilles. There was no putting this back together again if Rodgers was never going to be able to reclaim something close to the MVP form of 2021 … which, looking back, was probably never going to happen regardless of his Achilles injury. The underlying reality now is that the Jets do have ample young talent on the roster and can support the right quarterback at some point. Of course, that’s going to necessitate team owner Woody Johnson making the right leadership hires and then getting out of the way. In that respect, maybe the Jets are doomed no matter what. But at least a curtain can be dropped on the current charade. I’m thankful the Baltimore Ravens could see running back Derrick Henry for what so many other franchises couldn’t: a powerful running back and an extremely useful wingman for a quarterback that brings some run-pass versatility to the table. Granted, Henry likely wouldn’t have been this perfect a fit for every NFL team. But there are quite a few other playoff contenders that he could have done damage for, like the Washington Commanders, Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs, to name a few. But it is Lamar Jackson who has ultimately reaped the rewards of the very affordable free-agent addition — and who will likely continue to reap those rewards next season, too, even if Henry’s contract requires an offseason pay bump for 2025. This seems like such a no-brainer now. And yet so many teams lacked the brains to make the move themselves last offseason. I’m thankful Joe Burrow has stayed relatively healthy through 11 games this season and once again reminded everyone — including Bengals ownership — that he’s a special player who deserves uncommon investment in the pieces around him. Yes, Burrow is on pace for one of the best seasons of his career. And while it may ultimately come in a lost year for the franchise, it should at the very least shame ownership into paying No. 1 wideout Ja’Marr Chase at the top of the receiver scale and maybe even take one more pass at a Tee Higgins extension. Regardless, the way Burrow is playing, Chase has got to get done. And if Higgins leaves, the Bengals should use that money on adding to the running back room and beefing up the offensive line. The franchise could have as much as $70 million in cap space next offseason. Burrow has shown he’s worth spending all of it to make sure a season like this doesn’t happen again. I’m thankful there has been a tone change inside the Browns organization when it comes to the future of Deshaun Watson. Gone are the days where there’s no question that Watson will be the starter moving forward. Now it’s very much up in the air, which feels like progress. We don’t necessarily know what that change will produce, but it’s clear that the Cleveland brain trust is finally weighing an alternative path after three straight dreadful seasons. Maybe that’s drafting a rookie or trading for a young veteran to compete with Watson. Maybe it’s redesigning the offense to completely tilt away from him in his remaining days as a starter. While the math certainly isn’t pretty, Cleveland really only needs to get through one more year with Watson on the roster before his dead cap number is low enough to absorb over the 2026 and 2027 salary caps. The snow game loss to the Cleveland Browns was rough, but I’m thankful the Steelers are going to get a good remaining look at what Russell Wilson brings to the table under immense pressure. Pittsburgh’s last six games of the season are going to be a meat grinder, with three Super Bowl-caliber teams remaining (the Philadelphia Eagles, Ravens and Kansas City Chiefs), two against a Bengals team that can score with seemingly anyone, and one more against the Browns team that just beat the Steelers in the snow. If Wilson is still worth a contract extension and 2-3 year window as a starter, he’s going to have every chance to prove it … starting now. I’m thankful that the Texans and C.J. Stroud have a Week 14 bye that couldn’t be coming at a better time. The Texans’ young quarterback has been sacked 17 times in the last four games, producing a 1-4 record in which Stroud’s touchdown-to-interception ratio has been a rough 3-to-5. After this week’s road game against the Jacksonville Jaguars — which is suddenly much more important than what we would have assumed a month ago — the Texans will get a chance to sit down, get a little healthier, and assess protection adjustments going into the home stretch. And they’ll need it, with the three post-bye contests coming against a Miami Dolphins defense that has beaten up opponents for three consecutive wins, a brutal December game at Arrowhead against the Kansas City Chiefs, and then a home game against a Baltimore Ravens team that could be fighting for the AFC North. Even the road finale against the Tennessee Titans seems unexpectedly uncertain, with Titans quarterback Will Levis suddenly showing some progress and beating Houston this past weekend. Again, thankfully the Texans get a listless Jaguars team this week and then a bye to come up with something for that offensive line. I’m thankful the Colts have a potential bumper crop of quarterbacks coming in 2027, when this Anthony Richardson project finally wheezes its last bit of life in 2026 and a new regime will likely be looking for a reset. As much as I want to share the optimism of Richardson believers — who are continually searching for any signs of a breakthrough — I don’t think he’s ever going to be accurate enough to light a match and lift off the way Josh Allen did with the Buffalo Bills. I truly hope I’m wrong about that. But I think the Colts will have a house-cleaning by the 2027 draft and likely a very high pick in that class. The upside? I think there’s a very real chance that multiple special quarterbacks could emerge in that class. From South Carolina’s LaNorris Sellers (remember that name), to Texas’ Arch Manning (if he doesn’t declare for the 2026 draft) and Nebraska’s Dylan Raiola. Not to mention a handful of others that could emerge. It’s a long way out, but the 2027 class could mirror the 2024 class in the number of first-round quarterbacks. And thankfully for the Colts, if this Richardson plan fails, the downfall will position the franchise for a potentially special quarterback in 2027. I don’t have much faith in a Jaguars coaching staff and front office that is pretty clearly at odds right now, but I’m thankful this (latest) lost year for quarterback Trevor Lawrence has at least produced the clarity of two other long-term building blocks on offense: rookie wideout Brian Thomas Jr. and young bruising running back Tank Bigsby Jr. Not to mention a 2025 draft in which the Jags currently have at least 10 picks in, prior to compensatory picks being awarded. I’m not sure what to say about the Jaguars and Lawrence at this point, aside from the reality that the quarterback has yet to play for an organization that has both a competent — and aligned — front office and coaching staff. Despite that problem, the organization did manage to find Lawrence a true, bonafide No. 1 wideout in Thomas Jr., and a tone-setting running back in Bigsby whose game looks very similar to the Detroit Lions’ David Montgomery when Bigsby is healthy and used properly. It’s not exactly a mega millions lottery win, but it’s something. One great draft similar to what the Lions pulled off in 2021 and Jacksonville could be in business very quickly. So long as ownership cleans up the considerable number of problems between the coaching staff and front office. As with all quarterbacks who have immense talent but seem destined for the scrap heap, I’m thankful quarterback Will Levis has suddenly shown life in three straight games against playoff-caliber competition — including two outings on the road. Granted, those games have produced a 1-2 record, but Levis has seemed to settle down and look more comfortable in the pocket. His late third-quarter pick 6 against the Houston Texans on Sunday was bad, but Levis didn’t sink into the abyss afterward. Instead, he kept fighting and the Titans produced an improbable 32-27 win. In the expanse of NFL history, the path to being a good or even great NFL starter is rarely the stuff of instant success. Usually it takes either sitting on the bench and learning, or some ups and downs until a player finds their footing. Physically and from a skill standpoint, Levis is the kind of quarterback you would build in a laboratory. Until now, he’s been undermined by staggeringly poor decision-making. If he can battle through that and get to the other shore, everything is there for him to be successful. I’m thankful Broncos coach Sean Payton knew exactly what he was doing when he drafted rookie quarterback Bo Nix. History will probably forget some of the assessments that Nix had too many talent limitations, was too old or simply wasn’t worthy of anything close to a high first-round pick. An interesting side story, I remember meeting with a Broncos source before the draft and he was adamant that they weren’t going to trade up for a quarterback and would instead just let their guy come to them. I knew then that Nix had to be their guy. Then when I visited with Payton in the summer, he was relaxed and almost giddy about what he thought he had gotten in his next QB. Nearly four months later, we can see why. Chiefs fans might not like it, but I’m thankful that Kansas City and Patrick Mahomes have had to slog through this kind of inconsistent season to achieve their 10-1 record and remain on track for their third straight Super Bowl. It’s good for the rest of the NFL for Kansas City to at least seem mortal, even if the result is still a nearly perfect record heading into December. With the Bills knocking the Chiefs out of the undefeated ranks and the Carolina Panthers oddly playing pretty effective football against them, there’s some blood in the water. I still think the Chiefs are the likeliest Super Bowl winner this season, but if they do pull off the three-peat, it will have been a much tougher path than the record suggests. And I’m betting Chiefs fans will appreciate this one more than any of the others before it. I’m thankful that Brock Bowers will already be in place for whatever rookie quarterback gets selected by the Raiders in the 2025 NFL Draft. Whether it’s Shedeur Sanders or Cam Ward or some other prospect that catches the fancy of owner Mark Davis, they’re going to have an immense uphill climb ahead of them. Thankfully for that player, tight ends are often the first best friends of rookie quarterbacks, and there is no better playmaking tight end in the NFL right now than Bowers. And he fits basically any quarterback style, too. I cant find a litany of positives for any quarterback that goes to Las Vegas at this point, but at least Bowers is a pretty significant head start on building out the Raiders’ skill position group. I’m thankful Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh sticks to who he is and protects his quarterbacks through investment in the offensive line and the running back room. When Harbaugh took over the Chargers and kept dropping hints that he was going to be the same guy he’s always been, it induced some eye-rolling simply because it sounded, well, old. But here we are about to enter December with running backs and running games suddenly feeling trendy again. That approach has helped temper the amount of pressure put on quarterback Justin Herbert after the wide receiver depth chart was retooled with younger players the last two drafts. The results? Herbert is getting back to that dynamic and exiting passer and athlete that had us so encouraged his first few seasons in the league. And it’s not going to stop here, either. Get ready for Harbaugh’s next old-school-rules addition this offseason: a dynamic tight end to help bring it all together."

One of those players who's bound to be the topic of that pondering heading into Week 13 is what to make of Tyreek Hill's recent slump. Hill's road to production this year has been bumpier than usual; not only has he been dealing with a wrist injury, but he's also dealt with a stretch of inadequate QB play in the absence of Tua Tagovailoa, who spent four games on IR with a concussion. Now, it seems he's dealing with a shift in offensive focus following a monster game from teammate Jaylen Waddle and a recent surge for TE Jonnu Smith. Hill has scored more than 13.2 full-PPR points just once since Week 1, in Week 11 with a 7-61-1 line to save the day for fantasy managers. But given the low floor he's had in his age-30 season, is he a must-start each and every week ... or is he more of a matchup-dependent flex play? Find out where Hill stands in our team's Week 13 flex rankings for full-PPR scoring league formats. Who are your favorite flex plays in Week 13? And who are you sitting to play them?"

This is according to head coach Brian Daboll, who told reporters on Tuesday that he's ""hopeful"" that DeVito will be able to play, but that it's ""not 100%"" that he will. Backup Drew Lock will get reps at practice with Giants starters on Tuesday. DeVito is coming off his first start in place of longtime starter Daniel Jones, whom the Giants benched and subsequently released last week for poor play. Lock was the No. 2 quarterback behind Jones, but Daboll promoted DeVito from third-string to starter over Lock, raising questions about the decision in New York. This is DeVito's second stint as New York's starting quarterback. He completed 21 of 31 passes for 189 yards without a touchdown or turnover in Sunday's 30-7 loss at home to the the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Giants drew boos from the home crowd on Sunday as they went into halftime trailing, 23-0. DeVito started six games last season when Jones was injured. The Giants went 3-3 in his starts as DeVito completed 64% of his passes for 1,101 yards (6.2 yards per attempt) with eight touchdowns and three interceptions over the course of the season. The Giants signed Lock to a one-year, $5 million deal in the offseason. A fifth-year NFL veteran, Lock spent last season backing up Geno Smith in Seattle and was previously a backup and starter for the Denver Broncos. He's started 23 games in his career, completing 59.5% of his passes for 5,292 yards (6.7 yards per attempt) with 28 touchdowns and 23 interceptions. The Giants fell to 2-9 with Sunday's loss to the Bucs and are tied for the worst record in the NFL."

Mascherano, whose contract runs through the 2027 season, replaces Tata Martino, who stepped down last week due to personal reasons. The 40-year-old Mascherano comes to MLS after coaching Argentina's U-20 and U-23 men's teams since 2021. Most recently, he guided Argentina to the knockout stage of the 2024 Paris Olympics. “This job requires somebody with the experience to be able to maximize our unique collection of talent - from our global superstars, to our burgeoning homegrown players, to our young international prospects, and everything in between,"" said Inter Miami managing owner Jorge Mas in a statement. ""Javier has amassed unmatched experience in his career, from playing on the world’s biggest stages, to coaching at the youth international level; he has the blend of skills and experience we were looking for, and even has had direct coaching experience with Tomás Avilés, Facundo Farías, Federico Redondo, and Benjamin Cremaschi. We believe Javier is an important addition to our club as we continue on our quest to be among the world’s elite, setting a new standard for fútbol in North America."" Before he entered management, Mascherano had a long playing career featuring for such clubs as River Plate, Corinthians, West Ham United, Liverpool and Barcelona, where he won five La Liga titles, as well as the Champions League, UEFA Cup and FIFA Club World Cup championship twice. During his eight seasons with Barcelona, Mascherano was part of a Barça side that also featured current Inter Miami stars Lionel Messi, Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets and Luis Suárez. He also represented Argentina 147 times at the international level, playing in four World Cups and five Copa América tournaments alongside Messi. They also both featured on La Albiceleste's gold medal-winning team at the 2008 Olympics. Mascherano joins an Inter Miami team coming off a disappointing 2024 season. After earning 74 points and the MLS Supporters' Shield during the regular season, the side crashed out in the first round of the playoffs to Atlanta United. Will there be changes to the roster for 2025? The contracts of Alba and Suárez expired after the season and Inter Miami is reportedly negotiating to bring them both back. Busquets and Messi have one year left on their deals and Mas said last week that he expects Messi will stay beyond 2025 as the club moves into its new stadium ahead of the 2026 MLS season."
"Yahoo!

A Rafael Devers position change could play a key role, writes John Tomase.","Moving Rafael Devers off third base could unlock Red Sox offseason originally appeared on NBC Sports Boston Might Rafael Devers move off of third base? Craig Breslow could've dismissed the question by now, but he has answered carefully and consistently all fall. ""We have not had those conversations,"" Breslow said in September. ""Those conversations, if they were to occur, would definitely happen internally before I discuss them here."" It's not exactly a denial, and Breslow has since repeated some version of that answer. Perhaps now we know why. It sure sounds like a discussion between player and team is looming, which could have major implications for the 2025 season. Both Jon Heyman of the New York Post and Sean McAdam of MassLive recently have reported that the Red Sox are open to moving Devers, presumably across the diamond to first base, but also possibly to designated hitter. Despite pockets of passable play, on the whole Devers has delivered subpar defense throughout his career. As the Red Sox assess how to top .500 for the first time since 2021, infield glovework is clearly top of mind, and Devers has contributed to brutal metrics. He just led American League third basemen in errors for a record seventh straight season, and is the active leader in that ignominious measure with 141. His advanced stats are no better, with negative run values every year except an outlier 2019. He rated six runs worse than average last year alone. Really the only justification for leaving Devers at third at this point is not wanting to offend the team's highest-paid player. Anyone else with his history of defensive mediocrity would've been benched or shifted elsewhere by now, but most players with his defensive resume don't make $30 million annually. If that's belatedly going to happen now, the Red Sox have options. They've been linked to free agent third baseman Alex Bregman, who just won his first Gold Glove with the Astros, and also is willing to move to second base. Per McAdam, they might consider St. Louis third baseman Nolan Arenado, a 10-time Gold Glover who's one of the best defenders of this generation. He'd have to be acquired in a trade, because his nine-year, $275 million contract runs through 2027. It's also worth noting that his production has dipped considerably over the last two seasons, but he'd still be a huge defensive upgrade on Devers, and his right-handed power would balance the lineup. A third option is free agent shortstop Willy Adames, who has expressed a willingness to move to third. If Devers moves, dominoes will start falling. He could assume first base duties and make young slugger Triston Casas available in a trade. Breslow sounds understandably disinclined to trade Casas, however, since the youngster boasts 40-homer power and has his entire prime in front of him. That means either Devers or Casas could slide over to DH and make incumbent Masataka Yoshida expendable, even though there's three years and more than $50 million remaining on his contract. Considering how little bang for the buck the Red Sox have received on Yoshida -- 1.4 WAR each season and an average of 12 homers and 65 RBIs a year -- perhaps they could get back in the business of using their financial resources to cut their losses on overpaid, underperforming players. Put another way, Yoshida should not be the impediment to a Devers move, and his presence definitely shouldn't contribute to a Casas trade. Before this discussion can exit the land of the hypothetical, however, the Red Sox will need to talk to Devers about a move. And reading the tea leaves, it certainly sounds like that conversation is coming.

Are some of these No. 1's doomed to perform like No. 2's from here on out? Analyst and neuroscientist Renee Miller dives in to help us sort it out!","Week 12 certainly brought a lot of excitement, starting with the snow game Thursday night, continuing with a thrilling fourth quarter leading to overtime in Chicago, KaVontae Turpin’s muffed-punt-turned 99-yard touchdown and a near upset in Carolina. Tampa Bay, Detroit, Miami and Green Bay showed their beleaguered opponents who’s boss with statement victories while Arizona Cardinals not named Trey McBride (12/133 on 15 targets) might just as well have stayed on bye. The star players showed up on Sunday Night Football but that wasn’t necessarily the case for the rest of the league. A lot of our No. 1s let us down in Week 12, which made for an ugly fantasy week given all of the byes and injuries we were already navigating. Today, we’re going to take a look at the No. 2 guys who had big days and figure out whether the tables have turned for these teams (fact) or if the stars will be shining brightly again soon (fluke). Coming off the bye in Week 10, Smith-Njigba has been the clear Seahawks WR1 for fantasy. In these two games, he has 16 catches on 18 targets, while Metcalf has 11 catches on 14 targets. Smith-Njigba has the lone receiving touchdown in that span. Tyler Lockett, meanwhile, has been an afterthought, with just six targets in the two games. With the second-highest average passing yards per game (257.2 yards), Geno Smith can certainly maintain two high-end fantasy receivers. In one sense, it doesn’t really matter who is the 1A and who is the 1B; both are every week fantasy starters. While Smith-Njigba, in his second year, may seem like the wave of the future, it’s important to remember that Metcalf is only 26 years old. In PPR leagues, Smith-Njigba’s elite target share gives him the edge over Metcalf going forward. However, Metcalf’s speed and physicality at the catchpoint are going to net him big fantasy games, occasionally at Smith-Njigba’s expense. In Week 13, Seattle travels to face the NY Jets, whose stout defense ranks second in passing yards and passing touchdowns allowed to opponents, and first in completions allowed. It’ll be a classic offensive strength vs. defensive strength on display in the Meadowlands, but I expect to see a lot more of Kenneth Walker III and Zach Charbonnet given that the Jets are an average rush defense (at best), allowing the third-most rushing touchdowns per game. Temper your expectations on the Seahawks’ WRs this week but expect both Smith-Njigba and Metcalf to have value in better matchups during Weeks 14 and 16, especially. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Just when the fantasy world was ready to give up on Waddle, he finally had his big game (8/144/1) while Hill’s effort in the Dolphins’ massive victory over New England was forgettable (5/48). This screams fluke on the surface, especially if you factor in Hill’s lingering wrist injury. But Waddle isn’t just a flash in the pan; he was WR13 in 2022 and WR23 in 2023 (fantasy points per game). When Tua Tagovailoa is “on,” this offense can easily support 3-4 fantasy starters, a group that includes Jonnu Smith (9/87/1 on 11 targets in Week 12) and of course, De’Von Achane, who had two receiving touchdowns in the win. It’s a quick turnaround for Miami as they face the Packers in Green Bay on Thanksgiving night. It’s a poor matchup for wide receivers, but even in a week without byes, I’m not sitting Waddle or Hill. The agony or awesomeness about this is that people actually started Addison because of all the bye weeks and injuries. If you faced him, like me, it was an early end to your hopes of winning. If you started him, it was clear sailing. Only Saquon Barkley and Josh Jacobs surpassed Addison in terms of half-PPR fantasy points this week, as Addison put up a sparkling 8/162/1 line against the Bears. On the other end of the spectrum, Jefferson caught only two of five targets for 27 yards. Realize that the Bears have been one of the best defenses against the pass this season. It’s worth holding on to the knowledge that they’ll sell out to stop the opponent’s best receiving weapon, willing to get beat by the next man in line. (Side note: the Bears get Detroit next, which could spell a nice day for Jameson Williams in Week 13). Minnesota, meanwhile, gets two very fantasy-friendly WR matchups in the next two weeks so you’ll likely get the best of Jefferson as you make your final playoff push. Both Addison and Jalen Nailor are favored end-zone targets for Sam Darnold, so should the Week 14 byes get you down, either would be worth another start vs. Atlanta (which gives up the third-most fantasy points to WRs). Gray has burst onto the TE scene in the last two weeks, scoring twice in each game. Kelce still leads him by a mile in targets, catches and yards, but it’s been clear for some time that we are not dealing with the same old fantasy goldmine this year. The Chiefs will do what they have to to win, and they have their eyes on another Super Bowl, so if that means keeping Kelce more fresh in his age-35 season, that’s what they’ll do. Based on his generally good target share (Buffalo was an outlier among the last five games), you have to start Kelce. But based on his 90% catch rate and end-zone magnetism, you can also consider Gray an upside fill-in, especially vs. the Raiders in Week 13. Pickens leads all Steelers receivers in targets, catches and yards, more than doubling up Austin, who is second in each category. Yet Austin has four touchdowns to Pickens’ two and looked to be Russell Wilson’s go-to guy for some chunk yardage plays and a touchdown that gave Pittsburgh the lead in the snowy Week 12 game. However, he did only see three targets to Pickens’ seven, and I tend to go with the usage. Austin probably will have another ceiling game or two this season, but he’ll also have the duds. Such is the nature of a WR2 on a shaky offense. Pickens is going to bounce back for his fantasy managers, likely starting in Week 13 against a Bengals defense that is not great at fantasy points allowed to WRs. Although Anthony Richardson sort of came through for his fantasy managers, he didn’t really help those rostering — and starting — his top WR. Josh Downs had emerged as the WR1 in Indianapolis, with six more targets, eight more catches and two more touchdowns than Pittman, but it was Pittman who came away with the better fantasy value in Week 12, for the first time this season. As far as deep threats go, Alec Pierce is one of the best. He actually leads the Colts in receiving yards, averaging 13.1 yards per catch. Given that Pittman was drafted well ahead of Downs, and Pierce wasn’t drafted at all in most leagues, do we buy the Week 12 “breakout?” First, Pittman’s 6/96 on seven targets doesn’t inspire awe, but they were among the most catchable passes Richardson threw in Week 12 (per FantasyLife Utilization Report). Richardson had a terrible completion percentage last weekend, 39.3%, and only salvaged his own fantasy day with 61 rushing yards. Second, it now appears that Downs (shoulder) will not play in Week 13. The Colts were completely outclassed by Detroit in the brutal loss, but with a better matchup ahead — NE can definitely be beaten through the air, as Tua Tagovailoa just showed — I’m starting Pittman. No one out-performed Lamb in Week 12, but he sure put up a dud in non-PPR leagues (10/67 on 12 targets). The Cooper Rush effect has not been overly kind to Lamb’s managers so far. Still, the massive usage is there, and better matchups are ahead, including the Giants on Thursday. This is a frustrating season for Lamb between Dak Prescott’s poor play, a defense that can’t get off the field and now Rush, but aside from screaming into the void, what can you do? Lamb remains a must-start. I could just copy and paste the Lamb blurb here. Über-talented WR1, bad QB play, now worse QB play. I won’t pick on New York’s defense since they’re mostly league-average. The 2024 Tommy DeVito experience did not get off to the best start, but he didn’t commit any turnovers and at least threw the ball to the right person. Nabers saw nine targets, catching six for 64 yards in Week 12. The bad news is that the Giants faced one of the league’s best fantasy matchups for QB/WR in the Bucs. They’ll get another crack at a good matchup as they head to Dallas for Turkey Day. The Cowboys defense, as alluded to above, ranks in the bottom of the league in opponent time of possession, yards per game and points per game. Nabers is a bright light in a very dim offense, but like Lamb, still a must-start."

Check out who I'm vibing with, and let me know in the comments or @DanTitus about what's got you feeling a type-of-way about fantasy basketball. Let’s talk about a consensus first-round draft pick who’s struggled to meet expectations in the first month of the season. I’ve fielded many questions about whether Haliburton is a buy-low, someone to trade or a hold. I have him rostered too, and I can say I’m holding onto better days because, while he’s been inconsistent, there've been plenty of moments where he’s looked like a first-round talent. However, I can’t get my head around what’s going on with Haliburton’s success at home versus on the road this season. Take a look at the stark differences between these scenarios: 8 home games: 22.5 points, 9.4 assists, 46.3 FG%, 43.0% 3PT, .617 TS% 10 away games: 12.5 points, 8.3 assists, 31.8 FG%, 22.7% 3PT, .435 TS% Clearly, something’s amiss with his scoring and efficiency numbers dipping so drastically when he’s away from the Fieldhouse arena. Haliburton was visibly frustrated following the Bucks game on November 22: Some of Tyrese Haliburton postgame: pic.twitter.com/aMWSxbOOFN — Tony East (@TonyREast) November 23, 2024 There have been rumors that he is possibly still dealing with lingering back issues from last season, but he's clocking 34 minutes a night and has played in every game this year. So whether that’s the case or not, he’s willingly playing through it. He's fourth in the league in touches per game, and top 10 in assists and steals — he's hooping despite his road woes. Still, fantasy managers must decide whether it's worth riding out, selling or buying low. I can argue all three, but considering he’s fresh off dropping a Hali-esque 34-points (12-23 FG, 9-18 3PT, 1-1 FT) with 13 dimes and three steals on Monday night, I’d be holding or buying after this next home stand to get a better price. He’s figuring it out. Speaking specifically about Jalen Duren and Isaiah Stewart, Duren started every game he’s been active this season, but Pistons HC JB Bickerstaff hasn’t been shy about dolling out a handful of minutes to Stewart because of his defense and 3-point shooting. I'm not saying Stewart is good at shooting them, but he’ll at least hoist ‘em. Floor stretching matters nowadays, so it’s another reason to spell Duren. However, it’s time to recognize that Beef Stew isn’t going away. Duren’s block and assist percentages are up, but the downtick in minutes, shot volume and usage has soured his fantasy value, and I’d be looking to sell. Taking Monday’s matchup versus the Raptors as an example, Duren put up strong numbers, scoring 13 points with 12 boards, 4 assists and 4 blocks in 25 minutes. Stewart finished with 9 points (3-6 FG, 3-3 FT), 7 boards, 2 dimes, 3 blocks and a steal in 23 minutes. Counting stats aside, Stewart's imprint was all over the game, helping mount a comeback and making plays in crunch time over Duren — an important factor when assessing the significance of Stewart’s role. The Pistons won that game by way of Jaden Ivey, but Stewart’s hustle and grit impacted the game beyond the box score. It’s why I think we should be concerned about having Duren shares. Look at the splits for the two centers this year: Minutes: 24.8 Points: 8.9 Rebounds: 10.1 Assists: 2.5 Steals: 0.3 Blocks: 1.2 True Shooting Percentage (TS%): 71.3% Free Throw Percentage (FT%): 69.7% 3-Point Percentage (3P%): 0.0% Plus/Minus: -43 Minutes: 22.3 Points: 6.9 Rebounds: 6.9 Assists: 2.1 Steals: 0.6 Blocks: 1.6 True Shooting Percentage (TS%): 60.0% Free Throw Percentage (FT%): 86.2% 3-Point Percentage (3P%): 30.8% Plus/Minus: +9 Stewart has been more impactful on a per-min basis in fantasy and, with his edge in stocks and efficiency, he should be rostered in more leagues than he is. Stewart is 24% rostered in 9-cat leagues and ranks 103rd coming into Tuesday. Alternatively, Duren ranks 182 with a 96% rostership. The Pistons are 8-11, but the East is terrible, so they’re hunting for a play-in spot. It’s great to see them competing and winning. They’ll need just as much from Beef Stew as they do Duren to keep that going. The margin between the two continues to lessen game over game, so if Stewart is around on waivers, make that move. If you have Duren, I’d try to find a deal after stringing together a few double-doubles. I’ve given more than enough time locking Smith into my lineup to put up with the rollercoaster of inconsistency any longer. Despite starting in all 18 games, he ranks 149th in 9-cat leagues and 161 in points leagues while sporting career lows in minutes, usage, points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks — five categories! That’s far from ideal and with his shot volume decreasing and Tari Eason playing some of the best two-way basketball in the league; Smith’s workload and outlook looks sus. The upside to Smith was his ability to hit 3s, rebound and swat shots. He’ll continue seeing minutes in the high 20s, but with the Rockets having a ton of depth and Smith playing worse than last year, there’s not much appeal to holding him in fantasy."

But both backs are considerably behind starter De'Von Achane, and if Achane were to get hurt, there's no guarantee the 32-year-old Mostert would assume a heavy workload. I'm not saying you have to drop him, but you should at least consider it. Johnston has only secured two of his last 13 targets, and he was a hot mess during Monday's bagel (multiple drops, no catches). He's stuck on zero touchdowns for the season and he only saw two catches in Week 12, understandable with Nico Collins healing up. Houston also has a Week 14 bye to deal with."

This is a Super Bowl-winning coach. Mike McCarthy has been there and done that. He’s got great ideas. So, the bottom line is in no place in my body language or anything else have you seen any indications about what we’re going to be doing relative to this staff at the end of this year. And we shouldn’t."" Under McCarthy, the Cowboys have won two division titles and made three straight playoff appearances since he was hired in 2020. This season, however, has been one to forget. Dak Prescott is out injured until 2025, the running game has been abysmal (31st in total rushing yards and 32nd in rushing touchdowns) and they're 0-5 at home with the New York Giants coming to town on Thanksgiving Day. With McCarthy in the final year of his contract, there was speculation that he would not return next season and one name that is out there as a possible replacement is Colorado head coach and former Cowboy Deion Sanders. But Jones might be looking at the circumstances of how the Cowboys have won only four of their first 11 games and may not be so eager to pull the plug on McCarthy. He said earlier this month that he's regretted letting coaches go — Chan Gailey and Wade Phillips, for example — and not giving them more time to succeed. That could explain his comments on McCarthy's future and the fact that he's optimistic about the Cowboys' final six games with Cooper Rush at quarterback. After the Giants this week, the Cincinnati Bengals, Carolina Panthers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Philadelphia Eagles and Commanders are left on their schedule. ""We’ve got a lot of football left,"" Jones said. The Cowboys snapped a five-game losing streak Sunday by defeating the Washington Commanders 34-26. They are three games behind the Commanders for the seventh and final playoff spot in the NFC, but six teams are ahead of them in the race."

This season, games will be split across five major networks: ESPN, ESPN2, TNT, ABC and NBA TV — with even more games streaming on NBA League Pass. To make it easier to watch every NBA game live this season we’ve broken down which channels and platforms offer the most comprehensive viewing coverage and where to find the complete season schedule below. You can also check out our NBA Survival Guide which includes a season preview, power rankings, team-by-team outlooks and much more. Dates: Oct. 22, 2024 - June, 2025 TV channel(s): ABC, ESPN Network, TNT, NBA TV Streaming: DirecTV, Amazon Prime Video, NBA League Pass, Fubo, Hulu with Live TV and more You can check out the full NBA season schedule (complete with which channel every game is airing on) here.  This season, NBA games will air across ESPN and ESPN2, ABC, TNT, and NBA TV. These channels are all available on platforms like DirecTV, Sling, and Hulu + Live TV. (Fubo TV carries all of these channels with the exception of TNT.) Looking ahead to the NBA playoffs in 2025, games will be broadcast on ABC and/or ESPN as well as TNT, and the NBA finals will be broadcast on ABC. So, what do you actually need to sign up for to watch or stream this entire upcoming NBA season with ease, without paying a ridiculous amount of money? You've got a few options. Here’s what we recommend for the best ways to watch the NBA season: While we typically love Fubo for most sports, there's one caveat when subscribing to Fubo specifically for NBA access, and that's the fact that the platform doesn't carry TNT. TNT will be broadcasting 65 regular-season games this year, including an opening night doubleheader on October 22 featuring a battle between the New York Knicks and the returning champion Boston Celtics and the Minnesota Timberwolves vs. L.A. Lakers. Fortunately, you can tune in to TNT, as well as ESPN, ABC, NBA TV and ESPN2 on DirecTV and Hulu with Live TV, which will give you access to the majority of nationally broadcast games, as well as games in your local market.   DIRECTV has the channels you need to watch basketball games live, including ABC, ESPN, TNT, FOX Sports, NBA TV & 40+ regional sports networks, making it one of the most comprehensive places to watch the NBA. You can also add on a subscription NBA League Pass so you won't have to miss a single out-of-market game. After a free trial, packages start at $74.99/month.    Max has been ""the one to watch"" for entertainment fans for quite some time, but now it's got sports fans covered, too. For an unspecified limited time, Max subscribers can get the new B/R Sports add-on totally free. That means you can watch live NBA games on TBS, TNT, and truTV, included in your Max subscription!  Back in July, news broke of an 11-year deal between the NBA and Amazon Prime Video for the streamer to carry 66 regular season NBA games on the platform starting with the 2025-2026 season. But fans can still watch dozens of NBA games on the platform during the 2024-2025 season with the help of NBA TV and NBA League Pass. While watching these on Prime will cost an additional subscription fee, they offer one of the more comprehensive ways to catch most regular season games that aren't subject to a regional or national location restrictions. NBA League Pass is ideal for fans to watch NBA games for teams outside of their local area. An add-on League Pass subscription runs between $13.99 and $16.99/month. NBA TV is also available as an add-on to a current Prime subscription of $8.99/month (after a free 7-day trial). Up to 100 live NBA games per season, classic games and commentary shows are all available with a subscription to NBA TV.   This year, Amazon Prime Video will stream dozens of NBA games via add-on subscriptions to NBA League Pass or NBA TV.  On top of Amazon Prime Video, an Amazon Prime subscription includes free shipping, exclusive deals, access to the Prime Day 2024 sale event, Amazon Music, a year of free GrubHub+ and more. A standard Amazon Prime subscription is $15 monthly or $139 annually, but discounts are available for students and those on qualified government assistance. You can try Amazon Prime free for 30 days.   With NBA League Pass, you can stream out-of-market NBA games (certain national exclusions and local blackouts apply), get access to full-length and condensed replays of every game, rewatch hundreds of past classic games and use the platform’s live game DVR. NBA League Pass starts at $110 for the season, but the platform offers a 7-day free trial as well as a $9.99/month student rate."

The Big 12 said Tuesday that it was fining the school $25,000 and issuing a public reprimand for the field storm near the end of the 28-23 victory. Arizona State fans swarmed the field thinking the game was over, however there was officially still one second to go when they rushed the field. The Sun Devils haphazardly tried to end the game by running out the clock instead of scoring a touchdown for a two-score lead with less than a minute left. On fourth down, QB Sam Leavitt heaved the ball out of bounds in an attempt to end the game. But the ball landed in the stands with one second remaining.

It was a wild scene as the replay review took place with fans crowding around officials and an irate Arizona State coach Kenny Dillingham watching over the officials’ shoulder.

However, Jake Retzlaff’s pass to Chase Roberts was short of the end zone. The Big 12’s fine for Arizona State is a quarter of the fine that the SEC levies on its teams when fans storm the field for the first time. Auburn and Oklahoma were each fined $100,000 for their fans’ field storms in Week 13. Oklahoma was fined twice because, like Arizona State’s fans, their fans stormed the field too early and caused the game to be delayed before the final play could be run. The win means Arizona State is in a four-way tie for first in the Big 12 heading into the last week of the regular season. However, the Sun Devils have the best tiebreaker chances of anyone in that tie. ASU is in the Big 12 championship game if it beats Arizona on Saturday no matter what anyone else does."

The Warriors on Saturday in San Antonio led by 17 points in the third quarter and wound up losing by 10. After one day’s worth of rest, the Warriors enjoyed an 18-point lead over the Nets in the third quarter. That lead then was down to only five going into the fourth quarter. Just a little more than three minutes into the fourth, the lead was gone. The Warriors never got it back, losing 128-120. Brooklyn outscored Golden State 41-28 in the fourth quarter. Steph Curry scored a team-high 28 points, going 8 of 16 on 3-pointers. Andrew Wiggins added 18. Moses Moody had 15, but all in the first half. Lindy Waters gave the Warriors 13 points, 10 of which were in the first half. Inexcusably, the Warriors again were crushed at the free-throw line. The Nets made 26 of their 30 free throws. The Warriors however, shot 11 of 17 on free throws, making 15 fewer free throws in an eight-point loss. Here are three takeaways from Golden State's second consecutive frustrating loss. 3-Point Party As it often does in the NBA, the deciding factor between these two teams clearly was going to be the 3-point line. The Warriors and Nets entering Monday both ranked in the top seven in 3-point attempts per game. While Brooklyn was seventh, averaging 40.6 attempts per game, Golden State was slightly above at 41.6 tries – fourth in the NBA. Right away, it was clear it was going to be a 3-point shootout at Chase Center. The first quarter saw the Warriors and Nets combine to take 48 shots, and 31 were beyond the arc. Though the Warriors were more accurate to start the game, the Nets held a six-point advantage from deep through the first 12 minutes and led by four. The advantage at halftime then belonged to the Warriors. They hit two more 3s than the Nets in the first half and led by nine points. Six Warriors had already cashed in from deep. Both teams then were tied at 15 3s apiece going into the fourth quarter as the Nets outscored the Warriors 29-25 in the third quarter. The final tally was 20 3s for the Nets, and 19 for the Warriors – with nearly half coming from Curry. Nets coach Jordi Fernandez gave time to nine players, and each made at least one three. Paint Night  The Nets, when healthy, are a much longer and taller team than the Warriors. But down multiple big men, coach Jordi Fernandez turned to 6-foot-9 small forward Ziaire Williams to be his small-ball center and the Warriors took advantage. And more than their post players like Draymond Green and Trayce Jackson-Davis contributed to the action. Whenever Andrew Wiggins is playing downhill, that’s a positive for the Warriors. Within the first two minutes, he had a diving layup and didn’t shy away from contact. Moses Moody had several reasons to flex on the Nets, too. Gary Payton II, at 6-foot-2, showcased his uniqueness in many ways. With around four minutes remaining in the first half, Payton sprinted down the court after a Nets missed layup and sealed off Cam Thomas (6-foot-4), getting in position for a fastbreak layup after Brandin Podziemski found him for an easy bucket. Later in the first half, Payton threw down a dunk off a Curry missed three. The Warriors in the first quarter had eight more points in the paint than the Nets, 12 to 4. By halftime, those numbers rose to 30 points in the paint for the Warriors, 16 more than the Nets’ 14. In their Saturday night loss against the Spurs, the Warriors feasted in the paint early but settled far too often as their lead unraveled. The Warriors scored more than twice the Nets’ points in the paint, 52 to 34, but other aspects of the game were too much to overcome. Dynamic Duo For more than a decade, the combination of Curry and Draymond Green have completely changed the way basketball can be viewed, offensively and defensively. One sequence in the third quarter showed exactly how. Roaming like an All-Pro free safety, Green scoured the Nets’ offense before surprising their sensational scorer Cam Thomas. As Thomas sprinted off a dribble-handoff with the shot clock running down, he thought he’d have an opening for a three. Green thought otherwise. The legendary defender jumped the switch, closed out on Thomas and forced an errant deep off the back of the rim. The ball then bounced to Curry, who took it down the court and let it fly from the left wing, splashing a triple on Thomas and Jalen Wilson. Fouled on the shot by Wilson, Curry completed the four-point play after celebrating on the floor. STEPH 4-POINT PLAY 🤑 pic.twitter.com/KgbykTNbKh — Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) November 26, 2024 Those 30 seconds perfectly showcase the kind of impact only Curry and Green can have on the game.

But he found trouble anyway. On Nov. 24, while eating at Houston's, a family restaurant in Scottsdale, Arizona, Bissonnette was assaulted by six men in an altercation that spilled out of the restaurant and eventually ended at the CVS parking lot next door. ""There was an altercation inside the restaurant with six adult men and the management,"" Scottsdale Police Sgt. Allison Sempsis said. ""Reportedly, Paul Bissonnette tried to help management calm the men and get them to leave. The situation escalated to the men assaulting Paul Bissonnette both inside and outside of the restaurant."" Bissonnette confirmed the police statement on Monday in a video he posted on X. Thanks for your calls & messages. Love you fuckers.

See you tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/5WOxkxARvx — Paul Bissonnette (@BizNasty2point0) November 26, 2024 Bissonnette said he is a regular at Houston's, eating there several times a week, and is friendly with the staff. He said he got involved when he saw one of the men in a group begin to get physical with the restaurant manager. ""The bar where I normally sit was packed. I sat in the dining area, and at one point, there was a bit of a ruckus going on in the bar. It was a bunch of drunk golfers. Things obviously continued to escalate. They asked one guy to leave, and then one guy kept getting in the manager's face, put his hands on 'em,"" Bissonnette said. Seeing that the manager was vastly outnumbered, Bissonnette got up to help. He says he told the men: ""Sir, if you continue to harass and assault the staff, we're going to have problems."" It escalated quickly from there. As Bissonnette put it, ""They just started chuckin'."" ""Got taken down a couple times. Luckily, didn't get knocked out. I did go to the hospital, so that's probably what everybody is reading about."" ""All is good guys, it sucks,"" he said. ""Could have been a lot worse."" Bissonnette, 39, spent six seasons in the NHL, playing one year for the Pittsburgh Penguins before being claimed off waivers by the Phoenix Coyotes. He played for them until 2014, which is when they changed their name to the Arizona Coyotes. They are currently known as the Utah Hockey Club due to their move to Salt Lake City over the offseason."

According to the conference, nine of its 16 teams have a shot to make the title game. Four teams are tied atop the conference at 6-2 while five teams are at 5-3. Arizona State, BYU, Colorado and Iowa State are the four teams at 6-2. Baylor, Kansas State, TCU, Texas Tech and West Virginia are in the five-way tie for fifth. All four of the teams in first place are favored in Week 14. If they all win, the conference can’t go to head-to-head tiebreakers because they didn’t play each other. In fact, Arizona State’s win over BYU in Week 13 was the only game between teams in the top four. The conference will have to use common opponents among the four teams to start breaking the four-way tie. The tied teams all played Cincinnati, Kansas, Kansas State and UCF. Arizona State won all four of those games, Iowa State and BYU went 3-1 and Colorado lost to KU and K-State. That tiebreaker eliminates Colorado and would also take out the Buffaloes in a three-way tie for first place with two of the other first-place teams. Arizona State would get to the conference title game via common opponents, while Iowa State would win another tiebreaker over BYU based on the winning percentage of its conference opponents. Iowa State’s conference opponents have 28 wins compared to BYU’s 25. The Cougars have played both Utah and Oklahoma State, teams that have combined to go 1-15 in Big 12 play so far. ASU wins any three-way tiebreaker it’s in. The chaos scenario is unlikely, but still possible. Eight teams could end up tied for first place in the conference if Oklahoma State beats Colorado, Baylor beats Kansas, Arizona beats Arizona State, TCU beats Cincinnati, Kansas State beats Iowa State and Houston beats BYU. The seven aforementioned teams with a shot at the title would be joined by the winner of West Virginia at Texas Tech. An eight-way tie with a Texas Tech win would produce a matchup between Baylor and Texas Tech for the conference title game. Seriously. There are too many other permutations to go through because so many teams are still alive for the title. So we’ll be succinct. If you want a straightforward final weekend, you’re rooting for at least two of the 6-2 teams to win. If you want chaos, then you’re looking for some upsets and that eight-way tie."

Williams, who has been suspended twice now in his three seasons in the league, was facing arrest on a gun charge when he was pulled over after midnight on Oct. 8 in the Detroit area. But Williams was not taken to jail or charged in the incident, and a police sergeant who happened to be a Lions fan arrived on the scene. Williams and his brother had two handguns in the car when they were pulled over. The guns were registered properly, and Williams’ brother has a concealed pistol license. Williams, however, does not and was facing a charge of carrying a concealed weapon in a motor vehicle. But Williams was seen on body camera footage reportedly telling the officer that he played for the Lions. He was placed in handcuffs and put in a police car, but a sergeant later released Williams. The sergeant immediately recognized Williams, and had the Lions logo wallpaper on his phone. He was reportedly pleased to be releasing Williams, too, after speaking to a lieutenant on the phone. “OK. Beautiful. I’m good to let him go?” the sergeant asks before hanging up. “You’re a [expletive] hero. Thank you so much.” Wayne County prosecutor Kym Worthy said in a statement, via ESPN, that they were not going to file charges. They also said that they still acted objectively despite Williams being a member of the Lions. ""We did not consider that Mr. Williams is a Detroit professional athlete in our decision making,"" she wrote, via ESPN. ""We have charged Detroit area athletes before and would not have hesitated to do so again if the facts of this case could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. ""When it comes to charging decisions, we do not take into consideration who the potential defendant is, how much power and influence they have, or how beloved they may be. We deal with the facts and the law only."" The Detroit Police Department issued a similar statement, too. ""This case illustrates just how challenging on-scene arrest determinations and subsequent charging decisions can be in new and unique situations, such as the one here,"" the statement read. ""While no charges will be issued in this case, as an agency, we echo Prosecutor Worthy's sentiment that no one is above the law."" The Lions selected Williams with the No. 12 overall pick in 2022. He missed most of his rookie season recovering from an ACL tear he sustained in college, and then was suspended during his second season for violating the league’s gambling rules. He was suspended two games earlier this season for violating the NFL’s performance-enhancing substances policy, too. Williams has been great since his return. He racked up a career-high 124 yards and a touchdown in their win over Jacksonville two weeks ago. He had a team-high 64 yards on five catches in their 24-6 win over the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday. That brought him to 602 yards and four touchdowns on the season. The Lions will take on the Chicago Bears next on Thanksgiving. They currently sit at 10-1 and lead the NFC, which marks their best start since 1934."

The Giants, as many know, always seem to find themselves in the race for MLB’s superstar free agents and international prospects but never end up landing them in San Francisco. In appearing on The Athletic’s “Starkville” podcast with Jayson Stark and Doug Glanville, Posey explained the lessons the Giants have learned from missing out on free agents such as Shohei Ohtani, Aaron Judge and Carlos Correa in recent offseasons. “I think for me, the lesson is -- or maybe it’s not even a lesson -- if you have an opportunity to after that type of caliber player -- what’s the alternative, right? If you’re not going after them, then you’re definitely not getting them at that point,” Posey told Stark and Glanville. “I know there’s a sense with the fanbase, some frustrations on not being able to go land those guys. But from my seat [and] what I can tell the last couple years is really putting a strong foot forward. “I think ownership -- again, from my vantage point -- made it very clear the priority to try to target those types of players. And unfortunately, it just didn’t work out. So, we look at this, we’re trying to build a complete team. [We] go into this offseason looking at some areas where we feel like there might be holes. I’m a big believer in pitching and defense…” Posey didn’t point any fingers at his predecessor, Farhan Zaidi, but the retired catcher remained honest. San Francisco has tried to contend for MLB’s stars and it just hasn’t worked out thus far. Last offseason, the Giants signed third baseman Matt Chapman, pitcher Blake Snell, center-fielder Jung Hoo Lee and slugger Jorge Soler. But San Francisco’s acquisitions didn’t match that of their NL West rivals, the Los Angeles Dodgers, who signed Ohtani and pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto en route to their 2024 World Series victory. Superstar right fielder Juan Soto, followed by pitchers Corbin Burnes, Roki Sasaki and Snell, of course, headline the current free-agent class. Posey made it clear that his phone is on at all hours, and his eyes are monitoring the globe for upgrades. “You’re exploring all avenues and angles,” Posey said. “There’s unquestionably an immense amount of talent coming from the international side, so there’s no question we want our hat in the ring there, and we’re going to try our best to convince those great talents to come to San Francisco.” Despite the Giants’ 80-82 record in 2024, Posey also is confident in what the current roster offers. He cited San Francisco’s pitching, particularly the youngsters, as something the Giants laboriously will ride next season. “I’m really excited about some of the young arms we have,” Posey said. “Obviously, [Logan] Webb leading the way; Robbie Ray’s not a young arm at this point, but I think we’re expecting big things from him coming back this year, being a couple years removed from injury; Hayden Birdsong, Landen Roup, Kyle Harrison, we got Keaton Winn, Tristan Beck; there’s some really quality arms. “I think for us to make a big leap, we’re going to have to rely on some of these younger arms to carry some of the bulk for us.” Perhaps Posey will focus internally on pitching upgrades. Still, all options are on the table for San Francisco and its first-year decision-maker. And recent shortcomings with big-time free agents won’t keep Posey and the Giants from shooting their shot and staying invested. San Francisco very well could look different come Opening Day of the 2025 MLB season. Download and follow the Giants Talk Podcast"

One of the reasons for the Pacers' sluggish play has been the performance of star point guard Tyrese Haliburton. Amid reports that he's struggled with hamstring and back injuries, Haliburton has averaged 15.8 points and 8.5 assists, far below last season's 20.1 points and 10.9 assists per game. However, if injuries have been holding the two-time All-Star back, he may have finally broken through in Monday's 114-110 win over New Orleans. Haliburton hit a season-high nine 3-pointers (shooting 9-for-18 from 3) and scored 34 points with 13 assists and three steals. That's one short of his best point total this season, which was 35 against the New York Knicks on Nov. 10. And his nine 3s were one short of the franchise record he set last season. Haliburton hit his 7th 3PM of the game and got the stamp of approval from @CaitlinClark22 🎯 pic.twitter.com/Md9eAypn3M — NBA (@NBA) November 26, 2024 Since scoring only four points in a 130-113 loss to the Houston Rockets on Nov. 20, Haliburton has scored a combined 73 points in his past three games (an average of 24.3) and shot 46% (18-for-39) on 3s. The Pacers have now won two straight after losing three in a row and five of their past eight. Following Monday's game, Haliburton admitted to reporters that he was frustrated by his play and basketball was getting into ""job territory,"" which led to bad energy on the court. Tyrese Haliburton just laid a whole lot out there about what the early part of the season has been like. Got going for like 10 minutes there. Said the frustration did get to him and basketball started to get into ""job territory,"" and he's reminded himself of the joy he has ... — Dustin Dopirak (@DustinDopirak) November 26, 2024 ""I think what I just have to keep is my joy for the game of basketball,"" Haliburton said, via Tony East. ""Everyone wants to say be happy, have fun. That's hard to do when you're losing."" Myles Turner added 17 points and nine rebounds in the Pacers' win, while Pascal Siakam scored 14 with seven rebounds and seven assists. Quenton Jackson scored 12, shooting 4-for-6 on 3-pointers. The Pelicans were led by Trey Murphy III's 24 points, followed by CJ McCollum's 23. Elfrid Payton dished out 21 assists, the highest total in a game since Haliburton notched 23 assists last season and tied for ninth all-time."

Thankfully for Morant and the Grizzlies, the injury didn't result in a lengthy absence. In eight games prior to his absence, Morant averaged 20.6 points, 9.1 assists and five rebounds while shooting 44.8% from the field and 25.8% from 3-point distance. The Grizzlies led the entire way on Monday night en route to the 25-point win. They opened the game on a 15-4 burst, and then built up a 20-point lead without much issue just minutes into the fourth quarter. Jaren Jackson added 21 points and and six rebounds, and Jay Huff put up 12 points off the bench. The Grizzlies now sit at 11-7 on the season with the win, which marked their third straight. Shaedon Sharpe led Portland with 15 points, and Deni Avdija added 17 points and eight rebounds off the bench. The Trail Blazers shot just 8-of-46 from behind the arc as a team. They've now lost three of their last four, and sit at 7-11 on the year. Morant and the Grizzlies will host the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night."

He'll decide about his future at Utah after this season is over.,"Utah's Kyle Whittingham is unsure if he'll return to the program in 2025 for a 21st season as head football coach. Whittingham addressed his future in his news conference Monday. ""I will obviously evaluate after the season's over, see what the situation is,"" Whittingham said. ""My decision will be made on what's best for the program, not what's best for me. It'll be completely determined on how I feel this program is best served going forward."" Whittingham, 65, has been the head coach at Utah since 2005. He joined the program in 1994 and previously worked as an assistant coach and defensive coordinator. He took over as head coach in 2005 after Urban Meyer led the Utes to consecutive Mountain West championships, including a 12-0 2004 campaign that concluded with a win over Pittsburgh in the Fiesta Bowl. Meyer left Utah for Florida, leaving the program in Whittingham's hands. Twenty seasons later, Whittingham is tied with Oklahoma State's Mike Gundy as the second-longest tenured coach in college football behind Iowa's Kirk Ferentz (26 years). Whittingham has coached the Utes to a 166-86 record that includes seven 10-plus win seasons and 17 seasons with a winning record. He coached Utah to another undefeated season in a 13-0 2008 campaign that ended with a Sugar Bowl win over Alabama. Utah was not selected to play in that year's BCS championship game that saw Florida defeat Oklahoma for the national title. The Utes finished No. 2 in the final AP poll behind Florida (13-1) despite securing the only undefeated season in the FBS. Utah took a step back this season and enters Saturday's season finale against UCF with a 4-7 record and on a seven-game losing streak. The Utes are 1-7 in Big 12 play in their first season in the conference. Whenever Whittingham decides to step away, a succession plan is in place. Defensive coordinator Morgan Scalley is the designated head coach in waiting and is expected to take over whenever Whittingham retires. Whittingham addressed Scalley's role in the event that he decides to return for another season. ""I can tell you right now that Coach Scalley will be involved in decisions going forward,"" Whittingham said. ""It's only right that he does that because he's the coach in waiting. And when that time comes, we'll make sure he's had input on big decisions. ""It'll be a team effort as far as hiring, recruiting and that type of thing."""

She spent 11 years with the team, winning two World Cups and one Olympic gold. We're just one month into the NBA season, but early impressions matter. Here are the current frontrunners for each awards race, according to Yahoo Sports' Kevin O'Connor. MVP: Nikola Jokić (Nuggets) is picking up right where he left off: He's the best player in the NBA, an unstoppable scoring force who's the symphony conductor of Denver's offense and the linchpin of the team's defense. He's setting career-highs in points, assists and steals while shooting a ridiculous 52.7% from 3-point range. Runners-up: Jayson Tatum (Celtics), Anthony Davis (Lakers), Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (Thunder), Stephen Curry (Warriors) Defensive Player: Victor Wembanyama (Spurs) has taken his defense to another level in his sophomore season. Opponents are shooting 38.8% within six feet of the rim when defended by Victor, which is an absolutely ridiculous 23.1% worse than their norm. Players often won't even test him because when they do it obviously goes poorly. Runners-up: Draymond Green (Warriors), Dyson Daniels (Hawks) Rookie: Jared McCain (76ers) looks like Steph Lite, relocating for 3s, pulling up and facilitating within the flow of the offense. He averaged 25.2 points on 63.8% true shooting while Tyrese Maxey was sidelined, and he's remained a focal point with Maxey back in the lineup. Runners-up: Dalton Knecht (Lakers), Bub Carrington (Wizards) Most Improved: Christian Braun (Nuggets) is scoring the hell out of the ball, while also playing versatile defense on the perimeter and at the rim. Denver let Kentavious Caldwell-Pope walk and that opened a starting spot for Braun, who has responded by playing the best basketball of his life. Runners-up: Bilal Coulibaly (Wizards), Bennedict Mathurin (Pacers) Sixth Man: Payton Pritchard (Celtics) provides something positive to the Celtics every night — with his shooting, with his midrange fadeaways, with his paint penetration, with his gritty defense. He's the best backup point guard in the NBA, and so far, the best Sixth Man. Runners-up: Tari Eason (Rockets), Buddy Hield (Warriors) Coach: Kenny Atkinson (Cavaliers) is 17-1 in his first season at the helm, and he has Cleveland's top-four of Darius Garland, Donovan Mitchell, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen looking more cohesive than they ever did under former head coach J.B. Bickerstaff. Runners-up: Ty Lue (Clippers), Steve Kerr (Warriors) Los Angeles — Derrick Henry (140 yards, TD) and the Ravens ran wild in their 30-23 win over the Chargers on ""Monday Night Football"" as John Harbaugh improved to 3-0 against his little brother Jim. Lahaina, Hawaii — Memphis stunned No. 2 UConn, 99-97 (OT), in their Maui Invitational opener, handing the defending champion Huskies their first loss since Feb. 20 to snap their 17-game win streak. Buenos Aires, Argentina — Fans of Racing Club celebrate their team's first Copa Sudamericana championship, which ended their 36-year international title drought. Incredible scenes. Chongqing, China — What a shot. For the first time ever, college athletes will be paid to participate in a sporting event… sort of. Players Era Festival: The first-of-its-kind tournament tips off today at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, where eight teams will be eligible for a total of $9 million in NIL opportunities. Who's in: No. 6 Houston, No. 9 Alabama, No. 20 Texas A&M, No. 21 Creighton, San Diego State, Oregon, Rutgers and Notre Dame play 12 total games between today and Saturday. Each participating school gets $1 million worth of NIL opportunities, which players may earn through various activities outside of the competition. An additional $1 million worth of opportunities will be available to players from across all eight schools. Pay for play? This tournament further blurs the lines between NIL and pay-for-play, which remains forbidden by the NCAA. That's why none of the payouts are tied to on-court performance, and why the mechanics of the payments are somewhat convoluted. The NIL deals themselves will look just like the thousands of deals that have nothing to do with a tournament (think: autograph signings, charity work). To ensure NCAA compliance, the presenting sponsors (Starbucks, Eli Lilly, MGM Resorts) will pay the tournament organizers, who'll distribute that money to each school's NIL collective. Then it's up to coaches how much each player receives. Looking ahead: The Players Era Festival wants to eventually expand to 18 teams, add a women's tournament and potentially apply this framework to other sports. In all, they plan to distribute more than $50 million in NIL opportunities over the next three years. The World Chess Championship began Monday off the coast of Singapore. Notably absent: the two best players on the planet, Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana. Where are they? Carlsen (widely considered the G.O.A.T.) and Caruana played their own match in Singapore last week — in a new version of the ancient game called Fischer Random chess, where the pieces on the back rank of the board are lined up in random order. From the Wall Street Journal: Their match is more than a gimmick. It's a loud statement about why the game is booming in popularity — and it's not because of painstaking matches that take hours and leave audiences cold. Top players and casual hobbyists alike want games that are spontaneous tests of chess skill rather than endless duels of memorized sequences. That's where Fischer Random comes in. Popularized by the American champion Bobby Fischer, the 960 possible starting positions mean that every game poses a fresh set of problems that require creative, improvised solutions. And Carlsen's new Freestyle Chess startup, already backed by millions in venture capital money with 25 of the world's top players committed to play on the tour, underscores his belief that the format can grip fans across the globe. ""What we're playing now is in many ways a purer, long-form game than normal classical chess,"" Carlsen says. ""You're sitting down at the board, and you have to think from the very beginning, and it just feels fresh.""

Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Celtics ooze familiar machismo with Porzingis back on the court,https://sports.yahoo.com/celtics-ooze-familiar-machismo-porzingis-161100494.html,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 16:11:00 GMT",Chris Forsberg explains how Kristaps Porzingis made an impact well beyond the box score in his Celtics return Monday night at TD Garden.,"Celtics ooze familiar machismo with Porzingis back on the court originally appeared on NBC Sports Boston Kristaps Porzingis is back. And so too are the championship-level Celtics. Porzingis’ surprise return lived up to every bit of the hype. From a goosebump-inducing walkout from the Celtics locker room, to the anticipatory rumble inside TD Garden when Porzingis emerged from the tunnel, to the full roar when the 7-foot-2 big man threw his arm skyward to acknowledge the crowd. With a final swig of his double espresso, Porzingis hit the parquet and immediately helped the Celtics serve notice to the rest of the league that this team truly is the favorite to repeat as NBA champions.      View this post on Instagram       A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston) It feels weird to say that, on a team overflowing with talent -- including All-Stars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown and the All-Defense tandem of Derrick White and Jrue Holiday -- Porzingis is the most important piece. Maybe it’s better to suggest that he's more like the final infinity stone, the one piece that transforms the Celtics from great to something that often feels untouchable. The numbers suggest the Celtics are just fine without Porzingis. Boston owns an .833 regular-season winning percentage when Porzingis has been sidelined (35-7 last season including playoffs; 14-3 this year). That mark actually dips to .758 when he’s on the court, having posted a 44-14 record with him in the lineup. But the eye test tells a different story. The Celtics are just a different beast with Porzingis on the court, from the rim protection that seemingly unlocks a different level of defensive aggression to his offensive versatility that makes a historic Boston offense even more difficult to defend. Consider this: Boston ranked 24th in the NBA while allowing opponents to shoot 65.6 percent inside five feet in its 17 games this season without Porzingis. That number plummeted to 51.5 percent in Porzingis’ debut against the Clippers. Boston is able to gamble more with Porzingis on the back line, and that manifested itself in a combined 21 steals and blocks, the second highest stocks output of the season for Boston (22 stocks in a 30-point win over the Hawks). When the Celtics erupted for 51 points in the second quarter while tying an NBA record with 12 3-pointers, you could feel the air come out of a Clippers team that had won five straight and was playing some of the NBA’s best defense this season. Even with Porzingis on the bench, Payton Pritchard and Sam Hauser took turns peppering the Clippers with triples in a quarter that brought back a lot of memories of Boston’s dominance a season ago. The final score was a 126-94 shellacking of the Clippers in Porzingis’ return. The real result was a firm message to the rest of the league that the champion-level Celtics are back, too. Not that they ever really left. Boston was cruising at 14-3 including a signature win last week over the previously undefeated and Eastern Conference-leading Cleveland Cavaliers. But the Celtics hadn’t quite looked like the team that steamrolled opponents for much of last season, then rumbled their way to a 16-3 record in the postseason. Porzingis was huffing and puffing early but showed less rust than you might imagine after a five-month rehab from ankle surgery. He finished with 16 points on 6-of-12 shooting (he was 5 of 6 from inside the arc) to go along with six rebounds, two blocks, two assists and a steal over 22:37. There is simply a joy when Porzingis is on the court that permeates this team. The Celtics are not adverse to fun, regardless of player availability, but from Derrick White checking his pockets for 3s after his fifth trifecta of the night to Al Horford screaming, ""Pritch please!"" after Pritchard made one of his six triples, the Celtics wore Porzingis’ perma-grin throughout Monday’s tilt. With Porzingis back in the lineup, the Celtics oozed a familiar machismo.      View this post on Instagram       A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston) It's not always going to look as good as it did in that dominant second frame. The start of the third quarter showed that Boston is still more than capable of losing its focus for a maddening amount of time. But the Celtics caught themselves and tore the game open yet again. If the rest of the NBA was hoping that the Celtics might fall victim to a championship hangover, Porzingis’ return might just be Boston's IV therapy. After bringing back virtually the same roster from a season ago, the Celtics were always a threat to repeat. Their play on Monday night was a reminder that the gap between them and other contender might just still be a chasm. It’s hard to watch this team and not wonder how an opponent can possibly beat them four times in a seven-game series. There’s just too much talent. Boston must stay healthy -- with Porzingis at the top of that preservation list -- but his return gives the team a jolt at a point in the calendar when it would have been easy to get caught daydreaming. Porzingis’ return hit like his beloved double espresso Monday night. The Celtics felt whole again, even while playing without the backup big man combo of Horford and Luke Kornet. There are still plenty of steps to get back to where they want to go. But getting Porzingis back was a big one. And it sure feels like these Celtics are still many steps ahead of the pack early in the NBA calendar."

U.S. District Judge Kato Crews denied a motion seeking emergency injunctive relief to ban the San Jose State player, strip the Spartans of six league wins obtained by forfeit and prevent the team from participating in the Mountain West tournament. In his 28-page ruling, Crews hardly addressed the alleged fairness and safety issues raised by San Jose State co-captain Brooke Slusser and other Mountain West women’s volleyball players. Crews instead focused on the timing of the plaintiffs’ complaint, filed less than two weeks before the Mountain West tournament was slated to begin this Wednesday in Las Vegas. The Mountain West’s transgender participation policy has been in place since 2022 and all teams were made aware of it, Crews noted. The judge argued that the plaintiffs “could have have sought injunctive relief much earlier” since they’ve been aware of San Jose State’s alleged transgender player for months. “The Court finds the movants’ delay was not reasonable,” Crews wrote. “There is no evidence to suggest they were precluded from seeking emergency relief earlier, and the rush to litigate these complex issues now over a mandatory injunction places a heavy lift on the MWC at the eleventh hour.” San Jose State is seeded second in the Mountain West tournament and will receive a first-round bye. The Spartans on Friday are scheduled to face the winner of a quarterfinal match between third-seeded Utah State and sixth-seeded Boise State. Utah State and Boise State were among the four Mountain West schools that forfeited matches against San Jose State during the regular season. Nevada and Wyoming also chose to boycott rather than face an opponent believed to have a transgender player among its top attackers. “The vast majority of our team decided this is something we wanted to take a stand on,” University of Nevada outside hitter Sia Liilii told Yahoo Sports last month. “We didn’t want to play against a male player. “In all of our team meetings it just kept coming back to the fact that men do not belong in women’s sports. If you’re born a biological male, you don’t belong in women’s sports. It’s not even about this individual athlete. It’s about fair competition and safety for everyone.” Yahoo Sports is not naming the San Jose State volleyball player in question because neither she nor her university have publicly commented on her gender identity. San Jose State has said that all its women’s volleyball players are eligible to participate under NCAA and Mountain West Conference rules. The NCAA allows transgender women’s athletes to compete if they meet the eligibility criteria set by their sport’s individual governing body. For women’s volleyball, that means transgender women’s athletes must submit documentation of their testosterone levels for at least the previous year to prove they do not exceed the “normal female reference range for their age group.” “We are gratified that the Court rejected an eleventh-hour attempt to change those rules,” San Jose State said Monday in a statement. “Our team looks forward to competing in the Mountain West volleyball tournament this week.” Before it found itself at the center of the national firestorm surrounding transgender athletes, San Jose State women’s volleyball could not have been more obscure. This is a program that last won a conference title in 1985, last made the NCAA tournament in 2001 and that seldom draws more than a few hundred fans to home matches. The player believed to be transgender had already played at San Jose State prior to this year for two seasons without incident. She didn’t make an all-conference team, nor was she among the Mountain West leaders in kills or kills percentage. Her presence first drew attention last April when Reduxx published a story alleging that a San Jose State women’s volleyball player was transgender and had withheld her biological sex from teammates and opponents. The self-described “pro-woman, pro-child” outlet said it had begun reporting the story after receiving a tip from the mother of an opposing player. In September, Slusser joined a federal lawsuit challenging NCAA policy allowing transgender athletes to participate in women’s sports. Slusser roomed with the player in question after transferring from Alabama last fall but learned about her teammate’s alleged gender identity only after Reduxx outed her. In the legal filing, Slusser insisted that her allegedly transgender teammate strikes the ball with such power that it provides San Jose State “an unfair advantage” and poses a safety risk to other players during practices and games. Slusser claimed the player’s spikes in practice were traveling “faster than she had ever seen a woman hit a volleyball.” Those comments from Slusser tossed a lighted match on a pile of kindling. Local and national media outlets began covering the story, activist groups attacked San Jose State and right-wing politicians exerted their influence. On the eve of its Sept. 28 match at San Jose State, Boise State released a 48-word statement revealing it would not play and would accept a forfeit loss. Wyoming, Utah State and Nevada followed suit. In each instance, the schools chose not to explain why they weren’t playing. In each instance, the announcements were followed by a social media post from a state senator or governor applauding the decision. The lingering question since then has been how that quartet of programs would react if they drew San Jose State in the Mountain West tournament. Would they boycott again knowing that an NCAA tournament bid was at stake and that a loss would likely end their seasons? That question still remains now that Crews has denied injunctive relief. Wrote the judge, “The Emergency Motion would risk confusion and upend months of planning. … On balance, the equities favor the MWC’s interest in conducting and proceeding with the tournament as planned.”"

The Packers lucked out when their former QB decided to leave. The Saints might be bad at the right time to land a generational talent with a connection to the area.,"It’s Thanksgiving week in the NFL and a good time to take stock of the NFC’s quarterback outlook with a pinch of optimism. For every team. Even the New York Giants. No need to beat the stuffing out of teams this week. So off we go with thankful thoughts … I’m thankful that the 2025 NFL Draft is absolutely loaded with quality running backs, which is going to be a position Dallas needs to address in serious fashion to help balance out the offense and help quarterback Dak Prescott. Take a spin around the league and look at how much running backs have been making a difference for quarterbacks this season: Derrick Henry in Baltimore, Saquon Barkley in Philadelphia, Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery in Detroit, Bucky Irving in Tampa, etc. The Cowboys haven’t scared anyone or pushed anyone around in the run game since the 2022 season. Dallas needs to get back to that baseline, and there is an array of running backs in this draft that can get that job done. I’m thankful the Giants did two things with the release of quarterback Daniel Jones. First, they meaningfully committed to moving off a situation that was neither working nor getting better. Now they can focus on whatever veteran quarterback migration presents itself this offseason, as well as a shallow draft class that is going to require some very smart evaluation. The second thing the Giants did was free Jones up to move along with his career, rather than burying him on the bench and carrying out a selfish charade. Jones may not have worked out as the franchise centerpiece that New York was looking for, but he handled things with class and dignity. He earned the right to finish the 2024 season learning from someone else. I’m thankful the Eagles found a way to balance out their scheme with a dynamic running back in Saquon Barkley, who has taken a significant amount of wear and tear (and risk) off Jalen Hurts’ body. As indispensable as Barkley and wideout A.J. Brown are in the short term, Hurts remains the centerpiece that the next decade will be built around. From the moment he started and had the ability call his own number in the run game, Hurts was cranking the odometer on his legs and incurring more punishment on his body than he or the Eagles were letting on. General manager Howie Roseman couldn’t let that continue, so he went and got Hurts the best running partner he could find. Hurts will be around far longer than Barkley will be, but Barkley will have helped make that longevity possible by taking some of the punishment off Hurts’ seasonal grind. I’m thankful the Washington Commanders are going to have anywhere from $104 to $130 million in cap space next offseason to help fortify the offense — and most especially the offensive line — with some depth and talent around quarterback Jayden Daniels. That cash spent in free agency will help to balance out a set of draft picks that are bottom-heavy, with three of Washington’s seven 2025 picks sitting in the seventh round. There will also be some interesting options in the wide receiver group, helping the Commanders to find a higher-end talent to pair with Terry McLaurin. Daniels had the Commanders ahead of schedule the first half of the season, but you can feel the depth chart needs weighing right about now. While I don’t want to celebrate a firing, I’m thankful the Bears made an aggressive move in favor of saving the rookie season of Caleb Williams, moving on from Shane Waldron and elevating Thomas Brown to the offensive coordinator position. Brown got caught in a Hunger Games situation with the Carolina Panthers, with a coaching staff that was pitted against itself and a roster that wasn’t very good. For the rest of this season, he’s the best thing that could have happened for Williams mentally. It has already shown as Brown has pushed Williams to get back to accessing the running part of his skill set. He’ll engineer confidence back into Williams. Just watch. I’m thankful that when Sean McVay gave up on Jared Goff, the Los Angeles Rams sent Goff to a front office and general manager in Brad Holmes that built a monster around him. Consider the 2024 offensive pieces that were all added in the months or years after the Lions traded for Goff in March of 2021: offensive tackle Penei Sewell and offensive guard Kevin Zeitler, wideouts Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams, running backs David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs, and tight end Sam LaPorta. That’s seven high-level performers on offense. It’s no wonder Holmes swept the Pro Football Writers’ Association and Sporting News Executive of the Year honors in 2023. I’m thankful Aaron Rodgers absolutely had to get himself out of Green Bay in 2023, clearing the way for Jordan Love to finally get his career moving. Looking back, this all could have gone very, very differently if Rodgers had simply decided that he was going to stick it out with the Packers through the 2023 season. If Rodgers had remained in the fold rather than pushing for a trade to the New York Jets, the Packers were not going to pick up Love’s fifth-year option for the 2024 season, and he likely would have left the franchise in that spring's free agency cycle. Instead, Rodgers pushed his way out, Love and the Packers compromised on a two-year extension (rather than Green Bay picking up his fifth-year option) and the rest is history. But all it would have taken to sink the Packers at the quarterback spot was Rodgers sticking around just a little longer. I’m thankful Sam Darnold chose his backup quarterback opportunity very carefully in March of 2023, when he was coming off a career-flattening two-year run with the Carolina Panthers. Despite Brock Purdy having the starting job and needing to beat out former No. 3 overall pick Trey Lance for backup duties, Darnold trusted his instincts and went to a place that historically had a strong run game commitment under Kyle Shanahan — not to mention a scheme that created a solid supply of open receivers and tight ends. Going to the 49ers and learning Shanahan’s offense resurrected Darnold’s career and made this 9-2 Minnesota Vikings season possible. The franchise couldn’t have asked for a better outcome following the season-ending knee injury to rookie J.J. McCarthy, who has spent his first season learning from a guy who has seen a lot of frustrating situations in his career. I’m thankful Kirk Cousins and the Falcons got a bye week just before arguably the most important back-to-back of the season to kick off December — versus the Los Angeles Chargers and then on the road in an emotional return to Minnesota for Cousins. Cousins’ last two games for the Falcons stand as his worst two-game stretch so far in Atlanta, and falling flat in the next two could prove disastrous with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers getting Mike Evans back and looking like a different team in Sunday’s commanding win over the Giants. Having the bye to work with Cousins and also plenty of time to prepare for a playoff-contending Chargers team could end up being vital. Because if the next two games go in the same direction as the last two, it’s going to get tense in Atlanta. I’m thankful some of the September reports after Bryce Young’s benching — which suggested he could have played his last snap for the Panthers and was headed for an offseason trade — will very likely turn out to be wrong. Those in the organization who still believed in him after this season’s rough start were adamant that Young just needed a mental pause to reset himself and regain some confidence. Since taking back the starting job and shedding two underwhelming wide receivers before the trade deadline, Young has gotten better with each passing week, culminating in one of the most encouraging performances of his career against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday. Young’s size is never going to change, but the skill set that made him the No. 1 pick in the 2023 NFL Draft is still there. And the Panthers’ best-case scenario is turning in the right direction, and they can build around it in the offseason. I’m thankful Arch Manning could be coming in the 2026 NFL Draft class, or potentially the 2027 class. The Saints feel like a franchise that is on the cusp of a total rebuild inside one of the next two seasons. It might not be in 2025, given that Derek Carr could still be the starting quarterback and keep the Saints from sinking into the total abyss. But 2026 could be bleak with the age of the backfield and injury history of some of the skill position pieces on offense and pillars on defense. There’s a very real likelihood that the Saints have another top-15 pick in the upcoming draft, start bottoming out in 2025 and have top-five picks in both the 2026 and 2027 drafts. If that’s the case, Manning — who starred at New Orleans’ Isidore Newman High School, and is the grandson of Saints royalty Archie Manning — could end up near the top at either of those drafts. And the Saints will likely have a quarterback need, barring Spencer Rattler blossoming. I’m thankful Baker Mayfield’s 2023 “prove it” year didn’t turn out to be fool’s gold and he’s finally reaching the full potential that made him the No. 1 overall pick in the 2018 draft. Interestingly, Mayfield’s first seven seasons and first 100 games stack up pretty solidly with the first seven seasons or first 100 games of Drew Brees when it comes to sheer production. While the three-game stretch without Mike Evans showcased how much he means to Tampa Bay’s offense, it also showed that Mayfield could still keep the Buccaneers competitive without Evans and Chris Godwin. Yes, the Bucs had a four-game losing streak from mid-October to mid-November. But no, they were never really an embarrassing offense in that span. Mayfield had everything to do with that — and the remaining schedule now looks extremely winnable when it comes to mounting a playoff run. A 5-1 or even a 4-2 finish could win the NFC South. Despite it not being perfect, I’m thankful that Kyler Murray is through 11 games of the season and still playing healthy football for the first time since 2020. That has been one of the big priorities inside the franchise, to keep Murray healthy as the program pragmatically learns how to become a contender. While the Seahawks loss certainly toed the line of letting things get out of control — and that offensive line has to figure out how to reincorporate Jonah Williams — Murray remains upright. On top of that, the Cardinals have once again figured out how to consistently beat bad teams. Next, they need to learn how to consistently beat good teams down the stretch this season. Playoffs or not, that would be a step forward and momentum into a 2025 season where things can really turn a corner. I’m thankful that the Rams have options at the quarterback spot moving into 2025. Coming into the season, with Matthew Stafford shrewdly dictating an adjustment to his contract in training camp, I wasn’t sure that would be the case. But several months later, Stafford is playing well enough to have sought some additional guaranteed money this season — and also well enough to make a return in 2025, at the age of 37, a real possibility. Stafford certainly hasn’t been a liability for the Rams this season, and has played at a fairly high level when Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua have both been on the field. Of course, the rub to all of this is that Stafford could still walk away after this season. A few months ago, there weren’t many enticing options on the table. Now? Sam Darnold is running McVay’s offense in Minnesota for former Rams offensive coordinator Kevin O’Connell. He’s slated to be a free agent in March. I refuse to believe a 27-year old Darnold would not be a serious topic of conversation for the Rams if Stafford departs. I’m thankful the 49ers have some time to continue figuring things out with Brock Purdy before he gets his next extension. He’s already had one surgery on the elbow of his throwing arm, and now he’s feeling shoulder soreness. Maybe more than some of Purdy’s up-and-down games as a passer, the health of his arm — and not fully trusting everything the organization says about it — has me white-knuckling a little bit. Purdy’s next contract has the possibility to be an astronomical mistake if the health of his arm goes south or he simply levels off as a starting quarterback. Really, he needed a clean season with the arrow consistently pointed up to land the $60-million-per-season deal that is going to be sought by his representation. That has not happened thus far. But like Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys before them, the 49ers have a fourth year left on Purdy’s rookie deal to make sure the circumstances for an extension are ideal, not to mention franchise tags. Right now, there’s reason to lean into a continuation of the measurement. I’m thankful the Seattle Seahawks have a trap door to get out of the final year of Geno Smith’s contract if his regression since his banner 2022 season continues. This is the second straight season Smith’s arrow has pointed a little further down. His interceptions have weighed on the Sehawks four straight weeks, with the defense being more responsible for keeping together a 2-2 record in that span. Smith turned 34 in October and it’s fair to wonder if there’s an upward reversal in the cards for him at this stage. The rest of the season will likely dictate the feeling about that. But if it’s looking like he is what he is … and likelier to get worse than better in 2025, the Seahawks can get out of his deal with a modest $13.5 million in dead salary cap. Given that Seattle can save some money walking away from Smith after this season — and given that Seattle is in rough cap shape if they keep him — it’s a useful option on the table."

It might make plenty of sense.","In roughly a week, Aaron Rodgers's exit from the Jets has gone from a possibility to a given. The only question at this point is whether the release happens before or after the season ends. Already, folks in league circles who are inclined to connect dots are curious about a potential partnership between Rodgers and . . . Bill Belichick. Belichick wants to coach next year. If he ends up in a spot where a long-term quarterback isn't under contract, Rodgers could be a quick fix for a year (maybe two) at the most important position in the game. Some will say that it won't work, because Rodgers wouldn't tolerate the constant hassles and harangues of playing for Belichick. Belichick had no qualms about muthereffing Tom Brady in front of teammates. Rodgers probably wouldn't respond well to that. But Belichick is smart enough to know that a different approach will be needed for Rodgers. And Belichick will happily tiptoe around the delicate genius, if that's what it takes to get the most out of Rodgers. Obviously, two of the most likely destinations for Belichick — Jacksonville and Dallas — wouldn't allow for a Rodgers acquisition. Trevor Lawrence and Dak Prescott received massive, market-level contracts this year. They couldn't be traded or released, and benching them would make no sense. So where are the places where Belichick could bring Rodgers with him? The places without a quarterback in place for 2025? The only apparent options would be the Raiders, the Saints. And, yes, the Giants. Think about that one. Belichick has been linked to the Giants for years. Rodgers wouldn't even have to move. And co-owner John Mara, reeling from a season more embarrassing than most, would be able to stick it to the Jets and Woody Johnson. Ditto for Belichick (who has made no effort to hide his disdain for Johnson) and Rodgers (who is potentially in the process of exiling his current boss to ""the island""). It's far from being probable. But it's possible. Consider this comment from Belichick about Rodgers, from last week’s Let’s Go! podcast: “It's really hard when you're not on the inside with these guys. You're not sure exactly what they're being told, maybe whether they have some physical limitations but they're playing through theem. Certainly Rodney Harrison was a good example. When we got him from the Chargers he didn't have a great year the previous year, but he was playing injured. He was playing through it because he is a tough, competitive physical player. Once he was healthy, he was probably our best defensive player when he was there with the Patriots. And certainly after [Lawrence] Taylor, the next best defensive player I've coached. So what they look like physically sometimes can be a little bit tainted. With Aaron, you know, I mean, I'm not sure. You still see the snap in his throws. You still see the ball come out quickly and accurately. Maybe a little less mobile than he was, but doesn't look like it should be that limiting of a factor. So, I don't know. I think being on the inside is, certainly there's been a lot of turbulence at the Jets this year, and it's probably negatively affected a lot of people, not just him."" Rodgers, who loves to run a short, quick passing game, would fit well with offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels's (if he re-joins Belichick) short, quick passing game. And Rodgers has previously praised Belichick. ""We played [Belichick in 2018 and 2022 and both times he waited to make sure that he saw me after the game and I just thought that was one of the classiest things ever,"" Rodgers told Pat McAfee after Belichick was fired by the Patriots. ""I have so much respect for him doing that."" ""I don't think he's done,"" Rodgers separately said in January. ""I think the NFL is better with him in it and I'm thankful for all the little moments I've gotten to share with Bill over the years."" Each guy would benefit from the other. Rodgers needs to turn around what has been a disastrous final act of his career. And Belichick wants to catch Don Shula on the all-time wins list. (Belichick also should be thinking about holding off Andy Reid.) It could be a win-win for both guys. And, if nothing else, it would be entertaining for the rest of us. Especially if it happens in New York."

Still, we can’t afford to take a break from the waiver wire. Each week around here, we highlight the top potential waiver pickups who remain available in at least 50% of Yahoo fantasy football leagues. Add as needed. It’s winning time, people. Recommended FAB offer (assuming $100 budget): $7 Wilson passed for 270 yards and one score in a losing effort in that delightful snow globe game on Thursday night. Ideally, we wouldn’t be seeing quite so many snaps and carries for Justin Fields, but it’s obviously a smart and proper use of a talented player. Fields’ usage is hardly a deal-breaker for Russ. On Sunday, Wilson gets a date with a Bengals defense that allows the fourth-most fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks. Cincinnati has given up 19 passing touchdowns and 225.6 passing yards per game. If you’re simply looking for a streaming option with a reasonably high floor, Wilson is your guy. Cooper Rush was cooking on Sunday, in his way. He tossed a pair of TDs against Washington in an all-time weird win, finishing with 247 yards on his 32 attempts. Rush has now thrown for 601 yards over the past two weeks and he has a series of friendly matchups ahead: NYG, CIN, at CAR, TB. Drake Maye certainly didn’t play his cleanest game in Sunday’s loss (22-for-37, 4 sacks, INT); his team didn’t get on the scoreboard against Miami until the fourth quarter, trailing by 31. However, Maye’s dual-threat ability is well-established, and he’s been a steady-if-unspectacular fantasy contributor. He’s headed into a matchup with Indy, a defense allowing the eighth-most fantasy points to QBs. Derek Carr had produced consecutive games with 200-plus passing yards and multiple touchdowns ahead of his bye, and his team’s schedule down the stretch is full of opportunities (LAR, at NYG, WA). If you’re just looking for a tolerable floor and not a season-saver, he can help. Recommended FAB offer: $26 If circumstances forced you to drop Bigsby at some point over the past two weeks, no judgment. We get it. His team is coming off a bye and he was sidelined by an ankle issue in Week 11. This time of year, availability is a pretty big deal. Let’s just please recall what it looked like earlier this season when Bigsby was fully operational: Tank Bigsby runs so freaking hard. It’s so nice seeing him bounce back this season from such a tough rookie season. Dude has a ton of talent. pic.twitter.com/ndH6l4vIXU — Charles Robinson (@CharlesRobinson) October 6, 2024 Bigsby is averaging 5.5 YPC on the season and an outrageous 4.33 yards after contact per attempt, the best rate in the league. He’s forced 27 missed tackles on just 95 rush attempts per PFF. Basically, he’s been one of the league’s most dangerous and explosive runners this season, and it’s perfectly reasonable to expect a return to fantasy relevance after two weeks of rest. He looked healthy enough this weekend, at least to those of us with no medical training. Travis Etienne Jr. has been far less efficient than Bigsby this season, undeserving of featured status. The primary concern with Tank has been his minimal receiving role. When the Jaguars fall behind by multiple scores (as occasionally happens), Bigsby is returned to storage. But this team will close its season with a string of matchups in which the run should generally remain in play: HOU, at TEN, NYJ, at LV, TEN, at IND. On talent and ceiling, Bigsby deserves a roster spot in all formats. Recommended FAB offer: $21 J.K. Dobbins was having yet another excellent game on Monday night, gaining 59 yards on his first nine touches against the Ravens, but he checked out with a knee issue just before halftime. In his absence, Edwards not surprisingly served as the primary runner for the Chargers. He finished with only 11 yards on nine carries with a late short-yardage score against one of the league's top run defenses. In his previous two games, Gus had rushed for 82 yards on 16 carries, looking more or less like the vintage version of himself. If Dobbins is unavailable for the Week 13 trip to Atlanta, Edwards would obviously be in line for a substantial workload against a bottom-half run defense that allows 127.2 rushing yards per game. For what it's worth, Dobbins appeared close to returning in the second half on Monday and he reportedly reappeared on the sideline in a brace. Let's not assume a worst-case scenario. Recommended FAB offer: $8 McNichols has made four house calls this season, so he should be well known to fantasy managers at this stage, though mostly as a nuisance to Brian Robinson Jr. managers. He finished with a modest 22 yards on three carries on Sunday, but he could be headed for a significant uptick in workload in the upcoming matchup with Tennessee. The Commanders just lost both Robinson (ankle) and Austin Ekeler (concussion) to injuries, which could force McNichols into a beefier role in Week 13. It’s hardly a friendly spot — the Titans have only allowed one back to rush for 70 yards this year — so let’s not get too reckless with your remaining FAB unless the situation is dire. Recommended FAB offer: Let’s say $6 apiece We’re grouping these three together because the argument for each of them is essentially the same. It’s a trio of premium backups, all of them proven commodities. Any or all of these three could emerge as decisive players in fantasy if an injury created a path to significant touches. Mason was an unstoppable force over the first seven weeks of the season, Allgeier has a 1,000-yard campaign on the resume already, and Davis had that one magical week against the Jets (along with various other highlights). As we approach the money weeks in fantasy, we want our benches to be loaded with high-upside lottery tickets. All three of these backs certainly qualify. Recommended FAB offer: $4 Yup, he’s still in the league — he’s 31 years old, in his 10th NFL season and surprisingly relevant. Abdullah was the next-man-up for Vegas on Sunday with both Alexander Mattison (ankle) and Zamir White (quad) sidelined by injury, and he was plenty effective against an excellent Denver defense. He finished with 65 total yards on 13 touches with five receptions and an early highlight TD: Ameer Abdullah! What a catch for the @Raiders TD!📺: #DENvsLV on CBS/Paramount+📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/AvxOSvAMMV — NFL (@NFL) November 24, 2024 Abdullah’s fantasy appeal is of course tied to the availability of other backs, but Sunday’s performance offered confirmation that he can help us when reasonable volume flows his way. The matchup ahead is somewhat problematic (at KC), but it’s not as if the Broncos defense was a layup, either. Devin Singletary has clearly been leapfrogged by Tyrone Tracy Jr. in the backfield hierarchy for the Giants, but we should note that the rookie lost another fumble in a key situation on Sunday. Tracy wasn’t shelved after the ball security gaffe against the Bucs, but he did sit for a series, allowing Singletary to reach the end zone. If Tracy remains fumbly, Brian Daboll may feel compelled to do the usual coach-thing and dial back his touches. Roschon Johnson only handled three touches for the Bears in the overtime loss to Minnesota, but he continues to serve as a preferred option in goal-to-go situations. Sunday’s touchdown was his sixth of the year. Tyjae Spears (concussion) was unable to go in Week 12, but we should note that he’s played 35-45% of the offensive snaps when healthy this season. His team’s schedule in the closing weeks is awfully inviting: at WAS, JAC, CIN, at IND. Kimani Vidal should resurface as a potential flex option if J.K. Dobbins is sidelined for any significant length of time (see above). He's clearly behind Gus Edwards in the Chargers' backfield committee, however. Trey Benson, Blake Corum, Jaylen Wright and Braelon Allen are all highly stashable rookie understudy backs who would step into substantial workloads if the vets ahead of them were to miss time. All four deserve roster spots as what-if fliers in leagues with 12 or more teams. Recommended FAB offer: $8 Here’s another case in which fantasy managers understandably mass-dropped a player due to the fact that A) he was dinged and B) the six-team mega-bye hit. Coleman is nearing a return from his wrist injury, however, which means he is very much back on the fantasy radar. Coleman actually delivered the two best performances of his rookie season after Amari Cooper joined the team via trade, so let’s not fret too much about competition for targets. He’s been effective in contested situations and his passer-rating when targeted is a healthy 117.5. It’s no great surprise that he’s entered Josh Allen’s circle of trust. Buffalo has a series of potential shootouts ahead against the Niners, Rams and Lions, so we should be aggressive in finding ways to invest in this team’s offense. The Bills are averaging 29.1 points per week, the league’s third-highest total. We haven’t seen the last big game from Coleman, assuming good health. Recommended FAB offer: $6 Ertz ran the most routes among all Commanders pass-catchers on Sunday and saw the second-most targets (8), so we certainly aren’t worried about his role. The vet has also reached the end zone in back-to-back weeks. He’s been the most reliable secondary option for the Commanders this season behind Terry McLaurin, averaging nearly six targets per week. If you’ve been wandering the tight end wilderness, he’s a viable option with a bankable weekly role. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. DeMario Douglas produced his usual 5-for-62 line in Sunday’s loss, which was never considered a notable fantasy performance until modern science developed PPR scoring. Today, we’re enlightened enough to appreciate it. Douglas gets the Colts in the week ahead, so yet another 4-6 grabs are incoming. Marquez Valdes-Scantling has touched the ball five times in the last two games for the Saints, converting those opportunities into 196 yards and three scores. You should not need to be told that a zero-point week is definitely within the range of outcomes for MVS, but the man still clearly has big-play potential. Devaughn Vele is a gigantic slot receiver (6-foot-5, 210) who’s emerged as a reliable secondary option for Bo Nix and the Broncos. He’s coming off single-game highs in targets (9) and receiving yards (80). Denver has a home date with Cleveland ahead of their Week 14 bye. Adam Thielen passed the eye test in his return from injury on Sunday, catching three balls for 57 yards, drawing a key flag and generally looking like a useful weapon. Carolina is fielding a functional offense these days, so we no longer need to back away from this team in fantasy. Nick Westbrook-Ikhine has somehow managed to overcome his team’s regrettable quarterback situation, reaching the end zone six times over his last seven games. It’s one of the wildest achievements by any receiver this season, considering the fact that he’s only caught 17 passes on the year. We keep warning you that his scoring streak is unsustainable, yet it simply refuses to obey the normal rules. The Colts don't have a perfect one-for-one replacement for Josh Downs on the roster, but we can expect both Alec Pierce and Adonai Mitchell to see additional opportunities while the team's receptions leader is sidelined by injury. Pierce has been a downfield favorite for Anthony Richardson this season, averaging a league-high 23.3 yards per catch. Noah Gray has scored four touchdowns while catching eight passes over his last two games, which might be enough to make him a top-10 tight end on the season. (I’m afraid to look it up, because I don’t want to see where he ranks relative to Sam LaPorta.) Gray has actually run the fourth-most routes on the team this year, and it’s not like KC’s receiving room is overloaded with playmakers. We likely haven’t seen his last house call. There’s nothing Andy Reid loves half as much as drawing up opportunities for his weirdest players near the end zone. Hunter Henry has drawn 17 targets over the past two weeks, catching 11 for 107 yards. He’s not a scoring machine like Gray, but c’mon, that’s an impossible standard to meet. Recommended FAB offer: $1 No, this is not a great defense in the traditional sense, but the Cowboys delivered a huge point total against the Commanders on Sunday, in one of the more wild/intoxicated games in recent memory. Micah Parsons is back to being a game-wrecker and KaVontae Turpin is the most dangerous return specialist in the league. Dallas will host the spiraling, dysfunctional Giants on Thursday, so this D likely has another productive week ahead."

In the Celtics' 126–94 win, he finished with 16 points, six rebounds and perhaps most importantly, two blocks in 23 minutes.

The 7-foot-2 center has had a lengthy recovery after undergoing surgery on his ankle in June. The surgery repaired a torn retinaculum and dislocated posterior tibialis tendon — a rare ankle injury that Porzingis suffered during Game 2 of the NBA Finals. Porzingis missed Games 3 and 4 of the Finals with the injury, but was later available for Game 5 in a limited capacity. Boston went on to win the NBA Championship with a definitive 4-1 series win over the Dallas Mavericks. The Latvian big man has missed the first 17 games of the season while recovering from the surgery. Boston is off to a 14-3 start coming off its NBA championship, good for second place in the Eastern Conference, but is certain to get a boost from Porzingis' return."

There is only NFL history, which Muse and his older brother, Tanner, have now made. Nick Muse, a tight end, was waived by the Minnesota Vikings on Monday, which also happened to be his birthday. What makes that significant, and not just an unfortunate coincidence, is that Tanner Muse, a linebacker, was also waived on his birthday three years ago by the Las Vegas Raiders. ""Look at that!

""I mean, it's the wrong side of NFL history but, hey, you win some, you lose some. Appreciate the birthday messages."" Kudos to Muse for being able to make light of the situation when it has to sting to be cut by the Vikings just two days after the team activated him from injured reserve and opened his 21-day practice window under NFL rules. Muse, 26, was in his third season with the Vikings after being selected in the seventh round of the 2022 NFL Draft out of South Carolina. He appeared in three games with Minnesota this year. For his career, he played in 15 games, notching one reception for 22 yards. Tanner was not only infamously waived on his birthday, but the move occurred after the Raiders wished him a happy birthday on social media. (Unfortunately, it appears that the Vikings did the same thing.) Tanner was cut during the 2021 preseason after missing his entire rookie campaign due to injury. He has played four NFL seasons with the Seattle Seahawks, Los Angeles Chargers and Jacksonville Jaguars. The Jaguars waived him Nov. 5."

This year, that was not the case for many of the players low in the reorder category of the Tour’s priority list, mainly the bottom half of the Korn Ferry Tour graduates and all five Q-School qualifiers, most of whom missed out on seven of the year’s first 10 tournaments. While the percentage of KFT grads who kept their card ended up above average, at 50% (15 of 30 including Grayson Murray, who died in May but won the Sony Open in January), 13 of the bottom 15 players in priority from KFT/Q-School to start the season lost their full status by failing to finish in the top 125 of the final FedExCup standings, including all five Q-School grads.

Not only will they struggle to get into early-season open events such as the Sony Open, WM Phoenix Open and Cognizant Classic, but they could find other tournaments – maybe American Express and the pre-Masters run of Valspar, Houston and Valero – more difficult to earn spots in as everyone plays more to make the top 100, which will be the new cutoff to maintain fully exempt membership. Looking at this season’s final FedExCup standings, only 10 of the 42 DPWT/KFT/Q-School grads in the reorder category finished in the top 100, with four of them being winners – six of those players finished between Nos. 81-100.

Rodgers, despite the Jets’ struggles and his apparent injuries in recent weeks, will ""absolutely"" be the team’s starting quarterback on Sunday in their game against the Seattle Seahawks. Jets interim coach Jeff Ulbrich said Monday that Rodgers is the healthiest he’s been in the past month coming off their bye week, and the team isn’t yet considering shutting him down for the rest of the season. ""All I can say — and you'd have to ask Aaron if he's fully healthy — but he's better off today than he's been as of late,"" Ulbrich said, via ESPN. ""So he's definitely feeling healthier than he has for probably the past month. And a healthy Aaron Rodgers is an Aaron Rodgers we all love. So I'm excited about what that looks like."" Ulbrich also denied knowing anything about reports that Rodgers has been resisting medical scans offered by the Jets. The NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported earlier this week that Rodgers didn’t want to “reveal the severity of his injuries out of fear of having to come off the field,” which is why he apparently has denied the medical scans. While Ulbrich didn’t say the report was inaccurate, he insisted he knew nothing about it. ""News to me,"" Ulbrich said. This season has not gone well for Rodgers or the Jets, who are now committed to a full rebuild after firing both their head coach and general manager. The Jets sit at just 3-8 headed into Sunday’s game, and they’ve lost seven of their last eight. Rodgers has thrown for 2,442 yards with 17 touchdowns and seven interceptions this season, his first full one with the Jets after he went down with an Achilles injury just four plays into his first game with the organization last season. The 40-year-old has dealt with numerous injuries this season, too. He sustained a knee injury, a “significant” hamstring injury and a low ankle sprain, though he’s played through all of them. Rodgers has been described as “banged up” by Rapoport, which is a very general term, but it’s unclear how severe those injuries actually are — especially if Rodgers is indeed refusing to undergo testing. While Rodgers’ future with the organization isn’t clear, and the team is all but certain to miss the playoffs this season, Rodgers will take the field on Sunday at MetLife Stadium. What happens next, for both him and the Jets as a whole, is still anybody’s guess."

The injury leaves the Raiders with just Desmond Ridder at quarterback. The Raiders placed Aidan O'Connell on injured reserve in October with a fractured thumb. O'Connell was reportedly given an initial timeline of 4-6 weeks to return, but could play Friday against the Chiefs if he's able to ramp up without issues. The Raiders announced on Monday that O'Connell had returned to practice. His status for Friday's game remains unclear. Minshew suffered his injury on the Raiders' penultimate drive with 2:57 remaining on the game clock and Denver leading, 26-19. Cody Barton and Jonathon Cooper combined to sack Minshew on the first play of the drive. Barton's tackle drove Minshew's left (non-throwing) shoulder into the turf.

Ridder finished the game at quarterback. He fumbled on a sack on his second drop back. The Broncos recovered and converted the turnover into a field goal to extend their lead to two possessions with 1:56 remaining. The Raiders signed Ridder off the Falcons' practice squad in October when O'Connell injured his thumb. Depending on O'Connell's status, the Raiders may be in the market to sign another quarterback in the aftermath of Minshew's injury. Former Toledo and South Alabama quarterback Carter Bradley is on the Raiders' practice squad. He's never thrown an NFL pass. The Raiders dropped to 2-9 with Sunday's loss and further out of the playoff picture. Minshew's injury will instead impact the race for the No. 1 pick in the draft.

With two weeks left before the first iteration of the expanded field is set, that is not the case.","The College Football Playoff selection committee enters its final two weeks of deliberation with a host of consequential decisions thrust on the 13 members. (1) Who are the final at-large selections into the field? (2) Which teams receive a first-round game at home? (3) Which four conference champions receive a first-round bye? The first two are causing plenty of angst. But it is the third stress point that, perhaps, offers the most intriguing debate. The five highest-ranked conference champions earn a bid into the 12-team field, and the top four champions are seeded Nos. 1-4 and receive a bye into the quarterfinals. Many presumed that the champions of the four power leagues would annually get those first-round byes. The CFP selection committee’s last rankings paint a different picture. In its rankings released last week, Boise State (10-1) was ahead of all Big 12 teams, paving the way for the Broncos to receive the No. 4 seed and the first-round bye in a Group of Five-over-Power Four leap. Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark said such a decision would be the wrong one. “Based on where we sit today, I see no rationale for the Big 12’s champion not getting a first-round bye,” Yormark told Yahoo Sports. “The winner of our championship should receive a bye. I have a lot of trust in the selection committee and I’m sure they’ll see it that way. Just look at the data. The data doesn’t lie. From a strength-of-schedule standpoint, all four of our schools at the top of the standings are ranked ahead of Boise State.” At the center of the debate is a comparison not only of the individual teams but of the two leagues. The argument is fascinating in an era of college football where the power leagues continue to separate themselves from the five others: the Mountain West, Sun Belt, Conference USA, American and Mid-American. Yormark is loaded with Big 12 data points. His league has 42 wins over teams with a winning record. The Mountain West has 11 (five of those from Boise and UNLV). Nine Big 12 teams are bowl eligible. The Mountain West has five. Boise’s strength of schedule is ranked 81st, 12 spots behind the worst of the Big 12’s top four teams (Iowa State at 69). The two leagues have actually met on the field eight times this season. The Big 12 is 6-2 with an average margin of victory of more than three touchdowns. UNLV holds both of the Mountain West wins (at Houston and Kansas). “Arizona State defeated Wyoming by 41 points. BYU beat them by 20. Boise struggled against Wyoming in a four-point win,” Yormark said. “There is no rationale for us not getting the bye.” In an interview Monday with Yahoo Sports, Boise State coach Spencer Danielson isn’t looking that far ahead — a message he hammers home to his team. ""We still have two more games to even continue this conversation,” he said. ""That’s where I am with it. We’ve been playing playoff football since the Oregon game. I believe in our schedule. We’ve played well. We played well against Oregon. Are we suited for a bye? That’s up to the committee."" Seven of Boise State’s 10 wins have come by at least two scores, including a 21-point victory over a Washington State team that beat Texas Tech by three touchdowns in Week 2 of the season. But Boise State’s strongest arguments are, perhaps, its one loss and its best player. The Broncos led No. 1 Oregon for much of their game on Sept. 7, eventually losing on a last-second field goal. Boise State has the nation’s leading rusher, Heisman Trophy candidate Ashton Jeanty, who has run for nearly 600 yards more than the next best rusher. ""There have been multiple teams in the rankings that are no longer in the rankings because they got caught up in this stuff,” Danielson said. “It’s hard for me to lobby on things with two games left. You control what you can control."" Mountain West commissioner Gloria Nevarez declined comment aside from gesturing to similar data points for the Broncos, most notably that three-point loss in Eugene. The CFP selection committee meets again early this week before its rankings are revealed Tuesday night on ESPN. Over the weekend, the Big 12’s two highest-ranked teams, No. 14 BYU and No. 16 Colorado, lost. Boise State, ranked No. 12 last week, survived that scare from Wyoming. In the updated AP poll released Sunday, Arizona State was the highest-ranked Big 12 team at No. 14. Boise was No. 11. “What's going on right now isn't fair to the Big 12,” Kansas State coach Chris Klieman told reporters on Monday. “Other teams can lose in other leagues and it’s ‘That league is really good!’ We lose in this league and it’s ‘This league stinks!’ I don’t understand that. As a conference, we need to get together and figure some things out. For a bunch of teams to be 9-2 and we can’t get any [benefits] in the College Football Playoff, then we need to cancel one of these [conference] games and then go to eight games.” The decision from the selection committee related to the first-round bye is not insignificant. The fourth highest-ranked conference champion, the No. 4 seed in the bracket, gets an additional week to rest. The team would play one of the winners of the No. 5-12 seed matchups in a bowl site quarterfinal matchup. The fifth highest-ranked conference champion, at least according to how the rankings project, is likely to be seeded No. 12. That means playing a first-round game at the No. 5 seed on the road. The No. 5 seed, for now, projects to be the Big Ten championship game loser, likely Oregon or Ohio State, the two top-ranked teams in the nation. Before any decision from the committee, though, the remaining schedules must be played out. Boise State hosts Oregon State (5-6) and then meets Colorado State or UNLV in the Mountain West championship game, played in Boise. The Big 12, meanwhile, is a lot less certain. Billed as having the most parity of any power league, the 16-team conference is certainly delivering. Nine teams remain eligible for the conference championship game, with four of them in the best position. BYU (9-2), Iowa State (9-2), Arizona State (9-2) and Colorado (8-3) are tied at 6-2 in the conference atop the standings. All four are favored to win their regular season finale, a result that would put Arizona State and Iowa State in the title game. “I said in July we have great depth and parity and I thought it would play out and it has,” Yormark said. “I said that the month of November would be magical and it has. It’s been made-for-TV viewing.” The debate over the CFP’s final first-round bye is an extension of a long-running tussle between the power leagues and those from the lower-resourced level of the Football Bowl Subdivision. The gaps between the two continue to grow, both from decisions made by power leaders and from the courts. The decisions have accelerated the concept of schools directly compensating athletes — a much more difficult endeavor for Group of Five programs. Their budgets are normally fractions of those schools in power conferences that reap more lucrative television contracts and generate more internal revenue through donations and ticket sales. In fact, the Group of Five is having its most difficulty winning games against the power leagues this season, according to data from ESPN. Group of Five programs — including independents UMass and UConn, as well as Oregon State and Washington State — are 8-87 against power teams. The winning percentage of .084 is believed to be the worst in modern history. The decision to incorporate a fifth conference champion into the field — assuring a Group of Five spot — is a subject that has drawn heated debate and scrutiny over the years from leaders of the power leagues. Craig Thompson, the former Mountain West commissioner, was part of a four-man working group that originally created the current 12-team format. He was the only representative from the G5 ranks. “What’s happening with Boise State possibly getting a bye is not surprising,” Thompson said in a recent interview with Yahoo Sports. “The Group of Five champion, if they have a big year, gets rewarded in the system.” The five auto-bids and the first-round byes were not designated to specific conferences to avoid the scrutiny of congressional lawmakers, who, in the past, skewered the old BCS concept for creating a caste system. This past spring, CFP leaders — the 10 conference commissioners and Notre Dame’s athletic director — re-evaluated the format when they agreed on a new six-year extension that begins with the 2026 playoff. They didn’t settle on a format, instead only agreeing to protections that guarantee (1) the five highest-ranked champions an automatic berth, (2) the field to be 12 or 14 teams in size and (3) Notre Dame to receive an at-large bid if it is ranked inside the top 12 or 14, depending on the field size. During discussions, debate raged over whether to keep the Group of Five’s access spot. Speaking to Yahoo Sports from her conference football media days in July, Nevarez said that power conference leaders “threatened” to remove the G5’s bid in the spring. But, “to their credit, it never came off the table.”"

Coach Kyle Shanahan understands the sense of urgency the 49ers must play with over their final six games after falling to 5-6 following Sunday's 38-10 loss to the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field. “Yeah, without a doubt. I think everyone knows,"" Shanahan told reporters on a conference call Monday when asked if every game left is viewed as a must win. ""You’ve just got to look at it for a couple minutes to realize where we're at. It’s nice when you're one game out of first in your own division. So that does say a lot, especially being able to play two of those teams left of our six games. ""But you also know, you look at the whole NFC picture and if you don't win the division, it's 10-7 not guaranteed to get in as a wild card by any means this year. So I think everyone understands completely outside and inside what the situation is."" Two weeks ago, San Francisco sat at 5-4 with a chance to significantly improve their standing in the NFC West. Shanahan explained how the 49ers' brutal last-minute loss to the Seattle Seahawks particularly stung. ""That's why that Seattle game was so tough of a loss and that's why last night was even worse,"" Shanahan said. ""We know what we got ahead of us. We know exactly what that playoff situation is. That is what it is. But really all that matters is this week. When you do need to go on a run and put a lot of wins to even think of that, then you better make sure you're only thinking of one thing and that's Buffalo. And so, we've had to take care of a lot of stuff today. I’m hoping that guys will take care of their bodies stuff here over the day and a half they're away from us. ""We'll come back Wednesday fully understanding the situation we're in and coming back ready to fight because that's all we can do right now is just fight our butts off. And I'll be very surprised that not every guy in this building when I see them Wednesday isn't ready for that exact mindset that we're going to need to pull off what we feel we can.” Sunday's loss to the Packers dropped the 49ers to the NFC's No. 11 seed, creating a daunting path for San Francisco to reach the postseason. Entering the 2024 season with championship aspirations, the 49ers' campaign has been a massive dissappointment thus far, particularly for a franchise that has reached at least the NFC Championship Game in four of the last five seasons. With a difficult matchup against the Buffalo Bills looming, Shanahan and the 49ers must find a way to turn their season around, and do so quickly. Download and follow the 49ers Talk Podcast"

The 15-time major winner announced Monday afternoon that he will not be playing in the Hero World Challenge, his annual charitable tournament in the Bahamas. I am disappointed that I will not be able to compete this year at the Hero World Challenge, but always look forward to being tournament host and spending the week with @HeroMotoCorp. Excited to welcome our exemptions @JustinThomas34, @JDayGolf and @NickDunlap62 into the field. — Tiger Woods (@TigerWoods) November 25, 2024 “I am disappointed that I will not be able to compete this year at the Hero World Challenge,” Woods tweeted, “but always look forward to being tournament host and spending the week with @HeroMotoCorp.” Woods noted that Justin Thomas, Jason Day and Nick Dunlap — who earlier this year won a PGA Tour event as an amateur — would be joining the field. Woods only played in five events in 2024: the Genesis Invitational, from which he withdrew, and the four majors. He finished solo 60th at this year’s Masters and missed the cut in all three of the succeeding majors. Woods hasn’t been seen swinging a golf club in months, and in September underwent another of the many procedures he’s had on his back. The microdecompression surgery was intended to relieve nerve pain, though there was no timetable given for recovery. “The surgery went smoothly, and I’m hopeful this will help alleviate the back spasms and pain I was experiencing throughout most of the 2024 season,” Woods said after the September surgery. “I look forward to tackling this rehab and preparing myself to get back to normal life activities, including golf.” This year marked the first time since 2020 that Woods played in all available majors in a season; he suffered a catastrophic car wreck in February 2021. He has continued to insist that he wants to play golf as long as he is able, despite the fact that there are growing calls for him to retire from some segments of the golf universe. Woods is helping to develop TGL, an indoor golf league scheduled to begin play in January. He is a member of one of the six four-man teams, but has not yet indicated whether he will play in the league."
CBSSports.com Headlines,"Jayden Daniels, Caleb Williams and other rookies for which each NFL team should be thankful",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/jayden-daniels-caleb-williams-and-other-rookies-for-which-each-nfl-team-should-be-thankful/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 18:37:19 +0000",Raiders rookie TE Brock Bowers has the second most receptions in the NFL,"The Thanksgiving holiday is upon us and while several teams are out of the playoff picture, there is still a lot for which to be thankful. Upon exploring situations around the league, CBSSports.com has identified the one rookie for which each NFL team should be thankful for as the 2024 season reaches Week 13. It's been a pretty good season so far for rookie quarterbacks Cincinnati has not gotten a lot from its draft class this season, but Mims has had some good moments. He is a long-term starter for the organization and that is important because protection issues were a point of discussion for most of Joe Burrow's early career.  Tight end Erick All is a net positive for the run game and could be the tight end of the future when healthy.  Options are limited with the Browns. They expected to be competing for a playoff berth and therefore had loaded the roster with veterans; burying rookies in the process. Hall has been unavailable for the majority of the season as a result of his own choices and, now, an injury. Hall consistently applied pressure when in the game, but Cleveland needs him to be more readily available.  Teams are hardly throwing in Wiggins' direction; that is the level of respect that he carries across the league. Among players with at least 250 coverage snaps, the rookie out of Clemson ranks No. 24 in defensive passer rating, according to TruMedia. He has three pass deflections on the year, but is still looking for his first career interception.  Rookie right tackle Roger Rosengarten has been volatile, but could be a long-term starter in that role.  Pittsburgh's draft class was loaded with contributors, including three offensive linemen that have started at one point or another. Frazier has been the most consistent and he is a tone-setter for the rest of the unit. TruMedia credits him with one sack allowed on 297 pass blocking snaps.  Right tackle Troy Fautanu, offensive guard Mason McCormick, linebacker Payton Wilson and undrafted free agent cornerback Beanie Bishop Jr. have also made valuable contributions.  Latu has four sacks and three forced fumbles on the year. He is putting the opponent behind the chains, but also giving his team an opportunity to get extra possessions.  Injuries have forced multiple rookies -- Matt Goncalves, Tanor Bortolini and Dalton Tucker -- onto the starting offensive line and the results have been as one might expect. Wide receive AD Mitchell has looked good at times, but has been a victim of the instability at quarterback. Thomas has consistently been a downfield threat even in the absence of Trevor Lawrence. The rookie ranks No. 17 among all players in receiving yards (689) and No. 8 in yards per reception. Cornerback Jarrian Jones has had a good game or two as well.  Houston landed two pieces of their secondary in the same draft class. Bullock ranks No. 16 in defensive passer rating among players with at least 250 coverage snaps, according to TruMedia. His teammate, cornerback Kamari Lassiter, actually ranks No. 10 in the same metric and parameters. Those two players have accounted for seven interceptions  this season.  Brownlee ranks No. 54 in defensive passer rating (66.1) among players with at least 250 coverage snaps, according to TruMedia. He has been a good option across from the acquired L'Jarius Sneed.  J.C. Latham's transition from right tackle to left has not been seamless, but he has been an upgrade over solutions from recent seasons. Defensive tackle T'Vondre Sweat has been an effective run stopper to pair with Jeffery Simmons.   Coleman's role in the offense has grown as the season progressed even though Amari Cooper was acquired via trade. If running back Ray Davis were given more opportunities, he would probably be the runaway choice because he has been more effective in a smaller sample size. Buffalo has a collection of young offensive skill talent to pair with Josh Allen.  There are not many rookies on Miami's roster to consider. Robinson is still trying to put it all together as a pass rusher, but his burst off the line of scrimmage is remarkable. If he can start finishing some of those plays, then he could be a really impactful pass rusher for the Dolphins. Contributions from New York's rookie class have not exactly been plentiful. Allen had a bigger role through the preseason and early in the regular season, but that has tapered off. Offensive tackle Olu Fashanu was called into duty when injuries impacted veterans. TruMedia credits him with having allowed one sack on 195 pass blocking snaps.  The supporting cast around Maye has been really bad. When Jacoby Brissett was in the starting lineup, the offense was unable to matriculate the ball down the field. With Maye, he has forced defenses to remain honest. He has made good on New England's confidence to insert him into the starting lineup.  Wide receiver Ja'Lynn Polk and offensive guard Layden Robinson have gotten a lot of playing time as well.  Nix has not been afraid to take chances in Sean Payton's offensive scheme. Most would assume that the Oregon product has been dinking and dunking his way down the field, but his 7.6 air yards per attempt is just below average and inline with Josh Allen and Joe Burrow. Wide receivers Troy Franklin and Devaughn Vele have been integral in his growth.  McConkey is a route-running savant. He is able to create separation as well as anyone in the league. Expectations for the Chargers receiver room were low coming into the season, but the emergence of McConkey and development of Quentin Johnston have contributed to Justin Herbert's MVP caliber season.  Right tackle Joe Alt, as well as cornerbacks Targeeb Still and Cam Hart, have also been really good for the AFC West contender.  Kansas City's 2024 rookie class has not been overwhelming, but they are getting explosive plays from Worthy. There is room for improvement as a route-runner, but that skill set is complimentary to DeAndre Hopkins, Juju Smith-Schuster and others.  Safety Jaden Hicks has seen the field a good bit too.  Bowers is currently second in the league in receptions (74). He is also first among all tight ends in receiving yards (744). Las Vegas' quarterback competition has been unsavory this season but, as the name of who is under center changes on a weekly basis, Bowers' production remains consistent. They desperately needed someone to step up in the absence of Davante Adams and Bowers has been that player.  Offensive linemen Jackson Powers-Johnson and DJ Glaze have also played a lot this season.  Williams has looked more like the No. 1 overall selection in his two games with new offensive coordinator Thomas Brown than he had at any point with Brown's predecessor, Shane Waldron. At points this season, Williams has struggled holding onto the ball too long and trying to do too much. His foot speed allows him to extend plays and stretch the field with pass-catching options like Keenan Allen, D.J. Moore, Cole Kmet and fellow rookie Rome Odunze. Edge rusher Austin Booker looks more powerful now than he had at Kansas. He has found more ways to win and could be an actual building block for the defense. Punter Tory Taylor has a defined role as well.  Detroit's defense has been more formidable this season because of additions in the secondary, including Arnold. The rookie has been a bit handsy in coverage but teams are targeting him at a high rate because of Carlton Davis opposite him.  Green Bay re-made its safety core in the span of one offseason signing Xavier McKinney and drafting Bullard and Evan Williams. Bullard has been a difference maker on a much improved Packers defense. The franchise has gotten solid production from offensive guard Jordan Morgan and linebacker Edgerrin Cooper. Running back MarShawn Lloyd is returning from the injured reserve and could play a role in the final stretch of the regular season. First-round rookie quarterback J.J. McCarthy suffered a season-ending injury in the weeks leading up to the regular season. The other first round selection, Turner, has not had a big impact either, but Minnesota has not exactly been flush with rookie contributions.  Irving has seen his role expand as the season has progressed. He is a dynamic runner that has added 32 receptions for 252 yards. Among players with at least 100 rushes this season, Irving is second in tackle avoidance rate (31.5%), according to TruMedia. Tampa Bay has been looking for a running back like him for several years.  Center Graham Barton and safety Tykee Smith have also had a positive impact on the season.  Atlanta's rookie class has had little impact on the season. Dorlus made his debut a little over a week ago against Denver and recorded two tackles. The team's first-round selection, Michael Penix Jr., has sat the bench for most of the season as Kirk Cousins leads the NFC South contender.  Carolina has embraced the youth movement this season trading away pass rusher Brian Burns and wide receiver Diontae Johnson. They have gotten contributions from wide receiver Xavier Legette, linebacker Trevin Wallace, tight end Ja'Tavion Sanders, wide receiver Jalen Coker and others. Running back Jonathon Brooks made his debut last week and could be more of a factor in the remaining weeks.  Fuaga made the transition from right to left tackle. He has the ninth-highest beaten rate (6.1%) in the NFL this season, according to TruMedia. It has not been smooth sailing, it was still an upgrade over last season's situation at left tackle. Cornerback Kool-Aid McKinstry and wide receiver Mason Tipton have also played a lot this season.  Daniels was a runaway for Offensive Rookie of the Year early in the season. He was setting rookie records on a weekly basis over the first half of the season, but has fallen back to the pack in the last month. The LSU product has completed 68.4% of his pass attempts for 2,613 yards, 12 touchdowns and 5 interceptions, in addition to 556 rushing yards and 5 rushing touchdowns.  The Commanders had more draft capital in the Top-100 overall than any other team. They made the most of those opportunities by also landing left tackle Brandon Coleman, defensive tackle Johnny Newton and cornerback Mike Sainristil.  Dallas' offensive line has not played up to expectations this season. Yet, it is Beebe with the Cowboys' fourth-best beaten rate (2.7%), according to TruMedia. Beebe replaced Tyler Biadasz, who is having a revival of sorts in Washington.  Offensive tackle Tyler Guyton, edge rusher Marshawn Kneeland and cornerback Caelen Carson are other rookies that have had varying levels of impact on the Cowboys' season.  Mitchell has not only been the best rookie cornerback, but he has been one of the best cornerbacks in the NFL. According to TruMedia, he ranks No. 37 in defensive passer rating among NFL players with at least 250 coverage snaps.  His teammate, fellow rookie cornerback Cooper DeJean, has been a big reason for the defensive units rise as well.  The infusion of young secondary talent in the NFC East continues with the Giants. New York has been wildly frustrating, as a whole, but Phillips has been consistent. He is a plus contributor in the run game and is sticky in coverage. His teammate, safety Tyler Nubin, also ranks in coverage categories.  Despite all of the public outrage regarding the offense, there are reasons to be optimistic as they have identified key contributors, such as wide receiver Malik Nabers, tight end Theo Johnson and running back Tyrone Tracy Jr. Nabers already has 67 receptions on 103 targets for 671 yards and 3 touchdowns.  There is something to be said for culture and a setting of expectations. San Francisco consistently finds impact performers on Days 2 and 3 of the draft. Mustapha is one of the most exciting young players in football. He plays the game with maximum effort and is always around the football.  The hits fortunately kept coming for the 49ers, however. They also landed offensive guard Dominick Puni and cornerback Renardo Green; both of whom have been starters. Wide receiver Ricky Pearsall has been up and down since returning from a gunshot wound.  Harrison has been what Arizona expected he would be when they drafted him No. 4 overall. He has been a downfield threat and a big body that can go get the ball against single coverage. The Cardinals are another team that held ample draft capital on draft day. Cornerback Max Melton and safety Dadrion Taylor-Demerson have filled roles while the franchise awaits the debut of first-round defensive lineman Darius Robinson.  When exploring the types of pass rushers finding early success in the NFL, it is most often those known for their power. Verse was not regarded as the most twitchy or the most bendy at the high side of his rush entering the draft. However, he has multiple ways to deconstruct blocks and uses his strength to collapse the pocket. Among players with at least 200 pass rushes this season, Verse has the third-highest pressure rate (17.9%) behind Myles Garrett and Trey Hendrickson, according to TruMedia.  Defensive tackle Braden Fiske ranks No. 20 in pressure rate (14.1%). The presence of safety Kamren Kinchens, center Beaux Limmer, cornerback Jaylen McCullough and offensive guard Justin Dedich have allowed Los Angeles to absorb a long list of injuries sustained this season. No member of Seattle's 2024 draft class has reached superstar status yet, but there are worse situations across the league. Murphy has 24 tackles and 0.5 sacks. Linebacker Tyrice Knight and tight end A.J. Barner are two players that have taken on larger roles as a result of circumstance. Injuries and personnel changes have led to expanded roles."

In a statement, the CHP said that Robinson showed ""objective signs and symptoms of alcohol impairment,"" Rams head coach Sean McVay confirmed the arrest during his press conference Tuesday.  ""We're gathering all the appropriate information,"" McVay said, via NFL.com. ""I'll let the legal process kind of take place. I do want to acknowledge that we were made aware of it. What you've seen out there is accurate.

Now in the third year with the current playoff format, MLB set a record with a postseason pool of $129.1 million, absolutely crushing the 2023 pool of $107.8 million, reports the Associated Press.   The monetary pool here is from 60% of the ballpark gates from the first four games of the World Series and LCS, first three games from the divisional round and first two games from the Wild Card Series. The World Series champ gets 36% of the pool to divide up among its players while the losing World Series team gets 24%. The LCS losing teams get 12% apiece, division series losing teams get 3.3% and Wild Card losing teams get 0.8%.   The Dodgers awarded 79 full shares and 17.49 partial shares; those who got a full share walked away with $477,441 each.

Fortunately for them, they will be able to get back on the field in short order to try and erase that sour taste of the Week 12 loss as they'll square off against the Dallas Cowboys as part of the NFL's Thanksgiving tripleheader. Unfortunately for them, their starting quarterback's status for this game is up in the air.  On Tuesday, head coach Brian Daboll told reporters that Tommy DeVito is dealing with a forearm injury, per The Athletic. He also noted that he is ""hopeful"" that DeVito plays on Thursday, but it is not ""100 percent."" The Giants signal-caller, who briefly left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter but returned after missing a single snap, was not listed on Monday's projected injury report (which was a walkthrough).  DeVito, who was making his first start of the season after New York benched and later released Daniel Jones, took several hard hits during Sunday's loss. In all, he was sacked four times and hit nine times overall.  Specifically, DeVito left the game for one play on the Giants second-to-last possession of the day after a second-and-15 incompletion to Jalin Hyatt (which was negated due to a penalty). Backup Drew Lock came in for the second-and-10 snap, completed a 3-yard pass to running back Tyrone Tracy, and DeVito then trotted back out for third down, where he was sacked for a 2-yard loss. DeVito finished his day completing 21 of his 31 pass attempts for 189 yards.  If DeVito was unable to play in this upcoming game against Dallas, it would be Lock who ascends into the starting role. Lock has been the primary backup throughout the season, even when Jones was under center, and has 23 career starts under his belt (9-14 record as a starter)."

Tammy Abraham received the ball around the halfway line and saw Pulisic making a run right in front of him, playing a ball that the American had no problem catching up to. Pulisic then outpaced the defender marking him and ran almost the entire length of Slovan's half, making his way into the penalty area before scoring from an angle and slotting the ball into the bottom left corner of the goal. Watch the strike below. Christian Pulisic with pace to burn 🔥Another Champions League goal for Milan's in-form man ⭐️ pic.twitter.com/DP1l96qWLR Pulisic now has three goals in Champions League play this season, already reaching a career-best statistic just five games into the campaign. He also equalled a decades-old record for Americans in the Champions League, matching DaMarcus Beasley's three goal season for PSV during the 2004-05 season, a run that included a fourth goal in their qualifying campaign. The American has easily been Milan's most consistent contributor in front of goal this season, scoring eight goals and notching four assists in 18 games across all competitions this season. He's on track to outdo last season's 16 goal, 10 assist showing, which marked the best club campaign of his career. His impressive form has translated to the national team, scoring two goals and two assists in his last five games for the USMNT."

Oats has produced current NBA players such as Brandon Miller, Noah Clowney, Kira Lewis, Josh Primo, Herb Jones, Keon Ellis, J.D. Davison and more since arriving in Tuscaloosa.  Freshman guard Labaron Philon could be the next player on the radar of NBA teams. While Alabama's roster features CBS Sports' preseason Player of the Year Mark Sears, Philon has been arguably Oats' most impressive player thus far. Philon is Alabama's leader in assists (5.2) and steals (1.4) per game. Philon was a late addition to Alabama's 2024 recruiting class. The former Kansas signee flipped his commitment late in the recruiting cycle to Alabama to solidify the program's standing as the No. 2 recruiting class in the 2024 recruiting cycle behind Duke. Philon was the third-highest-ranked recruit behind five-star forwards Derrion Reid and Aiden Sherrell and is emerging as one of the best first-year players in the sport. Let's jump into our rankings and get to our CBS Sports/USBWA Freshman of the Week for the 2024-25 college basketball season. Welcome back to the Frosh Watch, our weekly ranking of the ten most impressive freshmen in college basketball. CBS Sports has once again teamed up with the United States Basketball Writers Association and its Wayman Tisdale Freshman of the Year Award to present this every-Tuesday feature. Each week we'll start by announcing the national Freshman of the Week honoree. The cycle for FOTW runs Tuesday-Monday.  The former No. 34 recruit in the 2024 recruiting cycle by 247Sports is coming off a standout performance against Illinois. Philon recorded 16 points, nine assists and seven rebounds in the 100-87 win. Philon logged 33 minutes in his fourth career start and played a huge role in the victory. True freshman Labaron Philon in a win over No. 25 Illinois: ▪️ 16 PTS ▪️ 7-13 FG ▪️ 9 AST ▪️ 7 REB pic.twitter.com/qhb0QUIYqq Philon also played well on the road against Purdue in Alabama's first loss. He recorded 18 points, five rebounds and four assists and knocked down 7 of his 10 shot attempts. He has scored in double figures in four of his first five games. Even when USF transfer Chris Youngblood returns to the lineup, it will be hard to keep Philon off the floor if he keeps playing like this. Stats: 17.8 PPG | 8.8 RPG | 3.8 APG Flagg is off to a historic start to the season. The No. 1 recruit in the country leads Duke in every major statistical category, as Global Scouting noted over the weekend -- making him the only current Division I player to be doing so right now. Flagg recorded 24 points, six rebounds and three assists in a win over Arizona. Last week: 1 Projected No. 1 pick Cooper Flagg against No. 17 Arizona:▪️ 24 PTS▪️ 6 REB▪️ 3 AST▪️ 2 BLK pic.twitter.com/a5oxNmvsOh Stats: 19.8 PPG | 5.0 RPG | 5.2 APG Rutgers suffered a tough loss over the weekend to Kennesaw State, but Harper was a bright spot. The combo guard recorded 21 points and a career-high nine assists in the loss. Harper also recorded a career-best in field goal makes (10) and attempts (18). The Scarlet Knights have two big matchups against Notre Dame and Alabama this week. Last week: 2 Stats: 15.2 PPG | 7.2 APG | 4.0 RPG Demin scored a season-low eight points but recorded six assists and six rebounds in a blowout win over Mississippi Valley State. Demin continues to be one of the best first-year players in the sport for coach Kevin Young. BYU is off to a 5-0 start and faces Ole Miss later this week. Last week: 3 Stats: 21.2 PPG | 2.5 RPG | 2.0 APG Johnson has scored at least 16 points in his first six games. Johnson scored 17 points in a win over Saint Joseph's and recorded 16 points the day before against Syracuse. Johnson continues to be one of the best shotmakers in this class and has helped the Longhorns win their last five games. Last week: 4 TRE JOHNSON🔥🔥🔥Legends Classic MVP 💍🏀😈 pic.twitter.com/hDtCZzcQ6E Stats: 12.5 PPG | 6.0 RPG | 3.5 APG Edgecombe had the best offensive performance of the season against Tennessee. Edgecombe showed flashes of why he's such a highly regarded prospect by scoring 20 points on 8 of 16 shooting against Tennessee. Edgecombe has scored in double-digits in the last five games after dropping four points in a blowout loss to Gonzaga on opening night. Last week: 9 VJ Edgecomb's standstill burst and downhill speed make him an enticing creator bet.

Bailey shot 6 of 17 from the floor (35.3%) but knocked down four 3-pointers on 10 attempts. Bailey is regarded as one of the best shotmakers in the class, but the highs and lows of good and bad shooting nights are bound to come during his freshman season. Last week: 5 Stats: 17.4 PPG | 5.4 APG | 3.0 RPG While Fland's scoring has been impressive (double digits in all six games) his assist numbers are equally impressive. Fland dished out six assists in a blowout win over Maryland Eastern-Shore last week and has recorded at least six assists in four games this season. Fland is on track to become the next NBA-level guard coach John Calipari produces. Last week: 6 Stats: 13.5 PPG | 7.0 RPG | 1.0 APG McNeeley helped lead the charge in UConn's near comeback win over Memphis. McNeeley knocked down both of his two 3-pointers in the final three minutes of regulation to help force overtime. McNeeley also hit a pair of free throws in the opening minute of overtime. Last week: 7 Stats: 14.4 PPG | 4.6 RPG | 2.8 APG Knueppel played a key role in Duke's 69-55 win over Arizona. McNeeley scored 13 points — the second-most on the team outside of Flagg — and grabbed a team-high seven rebounds. Knueppel knocked down 3 of 6 attempts from beyond the arc. Last week: 8 Stats: 16.2 PPG | 7.8 RPG | 2.7 APG Queen recorded the second double-double of his young career (22 points and 11 rebounds) - and first since scoring 22 points to go along with 20 rebounds in an opening night win over Manhattan. Queen also dished out five assists - the most in his career - in the 76-75 victory over Villanova. Queen made two go-ahead free throws with 19 seconds left, and his team got a stop on the final possession to seal the win. Last week: 10 Derik Queen vs Villanova today in a Big W for Maryland..22 PTS (9-14 FG)11 REBS5 AST1 BLKTOP 5.. he’s locked in.. no debate!!!! pic.twitter.com/p9pK7nBndU"

Embiid has played in just four games so far this season for the 3-13 76ers, and Wednesday's matchup will be his third missed game in a row after he played in three consecutive games. Paul George remains sidelined as well. George hyperextended his left knee for the second time in a month last week and has not played since Nov. 20 against the Grizzlies. George ""partially participated in practice"" this week, the team said, but he will miss his ninth game of the season on Wednesday.  George, a six-time All-Star, has struggled by his standards when he has been on the court so far. In his first season in Philly, George is averaging 14.9 points per game and shooting just 38.3% from the floor and 27.8% from 3-point range. Prior to the start of the season, Embiid mentioned that he didn't see himself playing in both games of back-to-backs for the rest of his career, as he tries to prioritize being healthy for the playoffs. Embiid will miss 13th game of the season on Wednesday, and the team still has 13 back-to-backs on its regular-season schedule.  The 76ers have one of the worst records in the NBA after a turbulent five weeks to begin the 2024-25 season. But seven of their next 12 matchups are against teams with losing records, including two meetings with the Hornets, as well as meetings with the Jazz, Trail Blazers and Spurs.  It won't be a cakewalk to beat all those teams, especially if Embiid and or George keep missing time, but the 76ers will need to use the easier December schedule to start racking up some wins and moving up in the weak Eastern Conference."

Use the Trade Chart to make deals that improve your team,"Fourteen seasons ago, the Fantasy Football Trade Chart was created by CBS Sports with the sole purpose of helping you make fair trades in your non-PPR, PPR, and Superflex/2QB leagues. No one has to be scared to make a trade anymore.                         What is the Trade Chart? The values assigned to the players below reflect a long-term measurement of their Fantasy value. Values are determined by expected future performance, future schedule, and, most importantly, public sentiment. Past performance isn't a major factor in the Trade Chart.   By adding two players' values, you could determine what one player you should be able to get in return. However, Fantasy managers should take off 10% of the value in any trade where one side has three or more players than the other. Also, a handful of others only carry legitimate value in two-QB or full-PPR leagues (and thus have no value listed in one-QB or non-PPR leagues).                        This list also works as a ""rest of season"" ranking for the 2024 season.                         Finally, any player not on the chart should be considered valued at no more than four points.

They have jumped out to a quick  37-27 lead against Detroit.  Tulsa entered the  matchup with three straight  defeats and they're well on their way to making it four. Can they turn things around, or will Detroit hand them another  loss? Only time will tell.  Detroit Titans @ Tulsa Golden Hurricane Current Records: Detroit 3-3, Tulsa 3-3  The Tulsa Golden Hurricane will face off against the Detroit Titans at 12:00  p.m.  ET on Tuesday at Florida State College Jacksonville South. Neither of those teams managed to put together many  points in their previous contests, so the offenses might be a little more motivated than usual.  Tulsa is headed into Tuesday's   match looking for a big change in momentum after dropping their third straight game  on Saturday. They were dealt  a punishing  89-53 loss at the hands of Loyola Chi. The  matchup marked the Golden Hurricane's lowest-scoring  contest so far this season.  Perhaps unsurprisingly given the score, Tulsa  struggled to work together and  finished the game with only seven  assists. That's the fewest  assists they've posted since back in February.  Meanwhile, Detroit came up short against Wake Forest on Saturday and fell  67-57.  The loss doesn't tell the whole story though, as several players had good games. One of the most active was  Orlando Lovejoy, who  had 15 points plus eight  rebounds and six  assists.  Tulsa's defeat dropped their record down to 3-3. As for Detroit, their loss dropped their record down to an identical 3-3.  Rebounding is likely to be a big factor in this contest:  Tulsa has been smashing the glass this season,  having  averaged 39  rebounds per game. However, it's not like Detroit struggles in that department as   they've been averaging 44.5. With both teams battling to corral missed shots, we'll see if one team can grab an edge.  Tulsa is hoping to beat the odds  on Tuesday, as the experts think they're headed for a loss. Currently 4-1 against the spread, Detroit has been a solid investment this season; on the other hand,  Tulsa is only 1-4 ATS.  Detroit is a big 9.5-point favorite against Tulsa, according to the latest college basketball odds. The line has drifted a bit towards the Titans, as the game opened with the Titans as a 7.5-point favorite. The over/under is 143.5  points.

Both sides need to win with the Germans in 17th on six points and the French 25th with only four points from as many games.  Even a win for Vincent Kompany or Luis Enrique will not disguise that this has been a sluggish start for both sides this edition, but things will look a lot worse if they lose. Bayern have won six consecutive games coming into this one since a 4-1 loss to Barcelona earlier this season.  A 3-0 win over Augsburg means that the Bundesliga giants are six points clear at the German summit as they seek to win back their title from Xabi Alonso's Bayer Leverkusen. Meanwhile, PSG also lead the way in Ligue 1 after a 3-0 win over Toulouse on Friday which has also created a six-point advantage. Bayern beat PSG home and away in the last 16 of the 2022-23 UCL edition while the Germans also won 1-0 in the 2020 final although Les Parisiens exacted some revenge the following year with a quarterfinal win on aggregate after a 3-2 win in Munich. Although history favors Bayern, Luis Enrique's Parisiens have shown that they can pull big performances out of the bag in Europe and they badly need it now. Here's our storylines, how you can watch the match and more: Bayern have won nine and drawn two of their 11 games to be unbeaten so far in the Bundesliga but the Champions League has proven problematic with Aston Villa and Barcelona both winning to leave Kompany and his players in 17th spot. French opponents will be good news for Bayern with 12 wins from 18 against teams from France with 12 wins from 14 on top of 11 wins from 27 home UCL games with that last home defeat a 3-2 loss to PSG back in 2020-21. Paris went down 2-1 to Atletico Madrid in the Champions League last time out to go with defeat to Arsenal and a draw with PSV Eindhoven. A win over Girona is only good enough for 25th in the standings with just three goals scored so far. Just one win from seven away games against German opposition with eight losses from 15 on the road against Bundesliga clubs. PSG have won just 15 of their last 37 European games with 14 losses so this is as tough as it gets for Les Parisiens. Bayern: Joao Palhinha is out while Mathys Tel took a knock and Aleksandar Pavlovic as well as Josip Stanisic are at least now training. Hiroki Ito is a long-term absentee so Leon Goretzka may replace Palhinha while Serge Gnabry and Konrad Laimer should return to the XI after missing the Augsburg win. Harry Kane has 20 goals from 17 appearances with five of those goals in four UCL outings. Possible Bayern XI: Neuer; Laimer, Upamecano, Kim, Davies; Kimmich, Goretzka; Olise, Musiala, Gnabry; Kane. PSG: Senny Mayulu and Lucas Hernandez are out although Nuno Mendes, Goncalo Ramos and Presnel Kimpembe are back in for Luis Enrique. Marquinhos was suspended against Toulouse but is back while Vitinha, Gianluigi Donnarumma and Willian Pacho should also start. Bradley Barcola has been in stunning form while Marco Asensio and Ousmane Dembele could form the rest of the attack. Possible PSG XI: Donnarumma; Hakimi, Marquinhos, Pacho, Mendes; Zaire-Emery, Vitinha, Neves; Dembele, Asensio, Barcola. Neither side can afford to lose and PSG must find their shooting form with Bayern expected to make the most of home advantage against their vulnerable visitors. Pick: Bayern 2, PSG 2.

Why Salah, Van Dijk, and Alexander-Arnold face defining week",https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/end-of-liverpool-era-looming-after-this-season-why-salah-van-dijk-and-alexander-arnold-face-defining-week/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 18:05:06 +0000",Liverpool are flying high but with three stars on expiring contracts is this the last hurrah for Liverpool as we know it?,"Eras never quite tie themselves in as neat a bow as those with an eye on the history books might like. Even a storybook ending like Michael Jordan and a documentary production team wrote for themselves in ""The Last Dance"" has to brush over those extra two years with the Washington Wizards. For a time, at the start of 2024, you could convince yourself that Liverpool were approaching their natural end point too. Jurgen Klopp was going, and he was going in style. His side were top of the Premier League, set fair in a Europa League that was taking them to their adoring masses in Dublin, a meeting with the heir apparent in Xabi Alonso, leading an undefeated Bayer Leverkusen side, seemingly inevitable. But football rarely allows itself to be hammered into such straightforward stories. Liverpool stumbled down the stretch, falling out of the title race, and losing in the quarterfinals of the Europa League to eventual winners Atalanta. Xabi Alonso opted to stay in Germany, leaving Arne Slot as Klopp's successor. The end of an era started to look more like just any other Liverpool year.  Now, however, as Liverpool face the biggest week of their season, with matches at Anfield against Real Madrid (you can catch the action only on Paramount+) and Manchester City looming, another question emerges. Doesn't this season feel much more like the natural end point for this great Liverpool side? After all the end of it may bring the departure of anywhere up to three times as many decisive figures as Klopp in Virgil van Dijk, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Mohamed Salah. All three are out of contract at the end of the season. It is hard to imagine Liverpool would have enjoyed quite the success they did under Klopp without even one of them. Meanwhile, it is eminently plausible that they could do something special indeed this season. They're eight points clear at the top of the Premier League table and the last team with a 100 percent record in the Champions League. Liverpool supporters have surely grown tired of hearing that every week is the one where Slot's chops are really tested. Frankly, they've aced enough examinations from Bayer Leverkusen, Chelsea and Aston Villa. A different opportunity confronts them now. Beat Real Madrid and Manchester City and Liverpool have as compelling a case as anyone to be the best team in Europe. Keep that up and, well, talk about some Liverpool legends potentially going out on top. Of the triumvirate perhaps the one over whom there is the most doubt, and whose exit would be felt most profoundly on an emotional level, is Alexander-Arnold. When he addresses the imminent expiry of his contract he speaks of ""the most important thing"" as being ""trophies.""  ""I'm a player who is highly motivated by winning things and being elite,"" he told reporters in September. It rather makes you ask why his pen is not already over the dotted line.  Slot's arrival has not quelled Liverpool's ability to compete for trophies. If anything this season now looks like it will end with at least the Premier League crown. Most prediction models have their chances at over 50 percent, the bookmakers too. Beat Manchester City on Sunday -- it remains to be seen whether he will be fit either for that game or the earlier meeting with Madrid -- and it would be only somewhat premature for Alexander-Arnold to start rearranging his trophy cabinet. The 26-year-old might be true to his word and Liverpool might one day wake up to the news that their homegrown superstar has committed the remainder of his prime years to Anfield. ""I have been at the club 20 years now,"" he said in his last public utterance on his future, ""I have signed four or five contract extensions and none of those have been played out in public. This one won't be either."" He might surprise many in the football world. That, however, is the point. It would now feel like a surprise if Alexander-Arnold began 2025-26 in Liverpool red rather than Real Madrid white. There is the lure of playing with his close friend Jude Bellingham, of course, but the appeal would be no less profound if he were to be the lone Englishman. Win the Premier League this season and Alexander-Arnold might reasonably question what worlds there are left to conquer with his boyhood club. He has more than done his fair share: bringing the English championship back to Anfield, adding a sixth European Cup, shattering expectations for what a player can contribute to attack from full back. A player of Alexander-Arnold's excellence will want more. Why shouldn't a player of his quality aspire to not just win different team prizes but also the biggest individual honors? No elite footballer will need telling which club affords its players the greatest opportunity to compete for the Ballon d'Or. Alexander-Arnold has his best years ahead of him. Do the other two? Van Dijk seems to play like a man who has grasped that his physical abilities are fading. He is all the more impressive for it. No longer can the 33-year-old simply apply the afterburners to catch a forward that might be sprinting away. He reads the situation so that the pass through to the opponent never reaches its target. Van Dijk is averaging half as many tackles as last season and more than 50 percent more interceptions.  Salah summed up Van Dijk to a tee in what were rather more underreported comments than the ones about his own future at St. Mary's on Sunday evening. The two of them will, he vowed, ""play at the highest level for as long as possible."" Watch him in action and he is as imperious as ever. Age will slow him, but it will only heighten his understanding of the game. It is no wonder that Liverpool appear to be the most advanced in securing Van Dijk's services for the long term, with confirmation last month that talks had been opened between the club and his representatives. No such public progress has been made with Salah, though in saying ""I have not received any offers yet to stay in the club"" the Egyptian did leave the door open for the possibility that his agent Ramy Abbas Issa has been in touch Liverpool. Salah has not been afraid of negotiating in the open previously and hints at possible moves to Spain in the past have been followed by fresh terms being agreed at Anfield. The 32-year-old is not a mixed zone regular by any stretch of the imagination, he will surely have understood the impact that came with saying he was ""probably more out than in."" Salah will know he is not going to be short of takers when he is free to negotiate terms with clubs outside England from January 1. CBS Sports understands that PIF, who own four leading Saudi Pro League clubs, have reaffirmed their interest in the Egypt international. Were he to make the move to Saudi Arabia, he would be one of the highest paid players in the league. It has, however, been suggested that he is reluctant to leave the top level of the club game while he still feels he can excel as he has this season. Every indication is that Liverpool want to keep their star forward. He evidently wants to stay too. But any new deal ought to bet on his future production, not just his current form. For now he is playing like a £350,000-a-week superstar, ten goals and six assists in 12 Premier League games. Will that output hold into 2026? He is scoring and assisting more frequently than he has in years, but tinker under the hood and the key attacking metrics -- expected goals (xG), expected assists (xA), chances created, shots taken -- are down even while he's getting more touches in the penalty box. It might be as simply explained as a little bit of variance or even Salah adjusting to his first new coach in seven years. Certainly he is making a sizeable impact to a winning team. Still, it might be that over the next two years, this season's 10% drop in non-penalty xG, and 30% lower xA becomes the first sign of a gradual decline in production. Liverpool's greatness over the last decade was defined as much by their ability to pick talent on the rise. Wouldn't it be appropriate if this era ended with Michael Edwards spotting that his superstar was on the downslope just as everyone else was heralding his enduring brilliance? Certainly there will be a price at which it is just too expensive to gamble that Salah can defy the age curve. Salah himself seems to understand that that could come sooner rather than later.  And that's really the story of this season for Liverpool. Even in a year where they look ready to win the biggest prizes, an ending to a glorious era appears to be approaching. However many trophies they might collect this season with Alexander-Arnold, Salah and Van Dijk, its possible they will be the last ones, truly marking the end of Liverpool's latest era."
CBSSports.com Headlines,"Ranking NFL wild-card playoff contenders, plus NFC North overtakes Prisco's Power Rankings and Week 13 picks",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/ranking-nfl-wild-card-playoff-contenders-plus-nfc-north-overtakes-priscos-power-rankings-and-week-13-picks/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 18:04:20 +0000",Here's everything you need to know about the NFL for Nov. 26,"Welcome to the Tuesday edition of the Pick Six newsletter!  If you're getting together with your family for Thanksgiving this week and you plan on playing games against them, I hope you live by the words of Jim Harbaugh.   ""I'd lay down my life for my brother, but I would not let him win a football game.""  Those words came from Jim before facing his brother John on Monday night. I have three brothers, and my goal in life is to never let them beat me at anything, so I know exactly how Jim feels.  The problem for Jim is that he ended up losing to John with the Ravens topping the Chargers, 30-23. In today's newsletter, we'll be grading both teams, plus we'll be making some early Week 13 picks and unveiling Prisco's latest power rankings.  Oh, and I should note that the rest of this week is going to be a little different around here. We won't have a newsletter on Thursday (Thanksgiving), so the next time you'll hear from me after today will be on Friday. Cody Benjamin, who regularly handles the Wednesday newsletter, will once again be manning things tomorrow so that I can get an early start on my Thanksgiving wine drinking.  As always, here's your daily reminder to tell all your friends and neighbors to sign up for the newsletter. To get them signed up, all you have to do is click here.  The third edition of the Harbaugh Bowl went down Monday night, and for the third time, John Harbaugh was able to beat his brother Jim. This was a close game at halftime with the Ravens leading just 14-13, but Baltimore (literally) ran away with things in the second half on the legs of Derrick Henry, who rushed for 140 yards in the 30-23 win.  Here are our grades from the game:  RAVENS GRADE: A John Harbaugh improved to 3-0 against his brother, and he went all-out to get this third win. The Ravens head coach made several bold calls in the game, including a decision to go for it on fourth down from his own 16-yard line on a drive that ended with a Baltimore touchdown. Harbaugh's aggressive coaching made a dangerous Ravens offense even more dangerous. The Ravens won this game by putting the ball in the hands of Derrick Henry, who steamrolled the Chargers defense for 140 yards on a night where the Ravens rushed for 212 as a team. Lamar Jackson didn't put up huge numbers, but he was efficient and he made several big plays. The biggest story for the Ravens may have been the way their defense played in the second half. The much-maligned unit held the Chargers to just 83 yards in the second half. This was an impressive win over a possible playoff team, and that's something that should give Baltimore confidence come January. Ravens note CHARGERS GRADE: C+ For the first two quarters, the Chargers went toe-to-toe with the Ravens, but then the wheels fell off the wagon in the second half. Justin Herbert completed just 44.4% of his passes during a second half where he was under constant pressure, which led to three sacks. The Chargers struggled to move the ball on the ground, and it didn't help that they lost J.K. Dobbins to an injury in the first half. The biggest surprise was that the Chargers' vaunted defense, which had surrendered the fewest points in the NFL heading into Week 12, got bullied by the Ravens offense. The Chargers got a reality check, and the reality is that they've struggled to beat the NFL's best teams. They've faced five teams that currently have a winning record this year, and they've gone 1-4 in those games. Jim Harbaugh has turned this team around, but the Chargers are going to have to kick it into another gear if they want to be a dangerous team come January. Chargers notes Finally, you can check out our full takeaways from the game here.   We have a new team in the top five this week and that team is the Minnesota Vikings. The NFC North has actually taken over Prisco's Power Rankings this week, as the division has three teams ranked in the top seven.  Let's check out Prisco's top five. Actually, let's just check out the top seven: I'm not going to spoil the rest of the Power Rankings here, but I am going to give you a few nuggets. Here's what has changed since Prisco's last Power Rankings:  If you want to know where your favorite team ended up in Prisco's Week 13 Power Rankings, be sure to click here. If you want to argue with Prisco over his rankings, you can do that on Twitter by clicking here. I argue with him all the time about everything.  It's Thanksgiving week and because of that, I thought about ranking my favorite Thanksgiving side dishes instead of handing out picks, but I hate side dishes. That being said, I do like pumpkin pie. And I like wine. If those count as side dishes, then those are my favorites. And I will also eat anything that has sweet potatoes in it.  OK, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get to three of my picks for Week 13:  If you want to check out the rest of my picks for Week 13, be sure to click here.  We already unveiled Prisco's Power Rankings today, but we're not done ranking things because we're also going to rank wild-card contenders. Cody Benjamin went through and ranked all the wild-card contenders in the NFC. Since only three teams will earn a wild-card berth, we'll take a look at the top three teams in his rankings, aka the teams Cody expects to get in.  1. Packers (8-3). ""They are 8-3 despite an imperfect and occasionally injury-riddled year from Jordan Love, which speaks to the balance of Matt LaFleur's attack, also headlined by a bruising Josh Jacobs."" 2. Vikings (9-2). ""Somehow 9-2 after a string of ugly wins over inferior foes, the Vikings have elite skill talent, and are still getting mostly above-average stuff from Sam Darnold under center. Brian Flores' bend-but-don't-break defense may have to do more heavy lifting when it's time to play dominant offenses."" 3. Commanders (7-5). ""Careening back to Earth at 7-5 after a red-hot start from Jayden Daniels and Co., the Commanders lack consistency under Kliff Kingsbury's offensive direction. Dan Quinn's defense has also been leaky through the air. Daniels' athleticism should keep them competitive until the end, though."" First team out: Buccaneers (5-6) You can check out Cody's full rankings here. We also ranked the AFC playoff contenders, which you can see here.  With the NFL season heading into December this week, now seems like a good time to break down the playoff picture.  Here's a look at the top-seven teams from each conference: AFC1. Chiefs (AFC West leader): 10-12. Bills (AFC East leader): 9-23. Steelers (AFC North leader): 8-34. Texans (AFC South leader): 7-55. Ravens: 8-46. Chargers: 7-47. Broncos 7-5First teams out: Dolphins (5-6), Colts (5-7), Bengals (4-7) The Chiefs are currently in the top spot, but there's no guarantee  they're going to hold onto to it due to their tough schedule down the stretch. Over their final six games, the Chiefs have to play four teams who currently hold an AFC playoff spot (Steelers, Chargers, Texans, Broncos). On the other end of the AFC, the Dolphins are one of the hottest teams in the NFL with three straight wins, while the Colts have the easiest remaining strength of schedule, so it won't be easy for the Broncos to hold on to that final spot.  NFC 1. Lions (NFC North leader): 10-12. Eagles (NFC East leader): 9-23. Seahawks (NFC West leader): 6-54. Falcons (NFC South leader): 6-55. Vikings (9-2)6. Packers (8-3) 7. Commanders (7-5) First teams out: Cardinals (6-5), Buccaneers (5-6), Rams (5-6), 49ers (5-6) At this point, it feels like four of the seven spots in the NFC are locked up with the Lions, Eagles, Vikings and Packers all likely getting in. To miss the playoffs, one of those teams would have to totally collapse. The race for the top seed in the NFC will also be interesting to watch. The Lions are currently in the driver's seat, but they have the sixth-toughest remaining strength of schedule. Four of their final six games will be coming against the Bills, Packers, Vikings and 49ers. If the Lions slip up, that could open the door for the Eagles to steal the top seed, and it could also open the door for Minnesota or Green Bay to win the NFC North.  If you want a full look at the playoff standings, we've got the right here.    It was a busy 24 hours in the NFL, and since it's nearly impossible to keep track of everything that happened, I went ahead and put together a roundup for you."

CBSSports.com Headlines,"What's next for Marta? After Orlando Pride's NWSL title, the legendary Brazilian is officially a free agent",https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/whats-next-for-marta-after-orlando-prides-nwsl-title-the-legendary-brazilian-is-officially-a-free-agent/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 17:57:04 +0000","Is it a foregone conclusion that Marta will return to Orlando or could another team, or retirement be in her future?","Marta, the Brazilian international soccer superstar, added another trophy to her award case on Saturday. The 38-year-old midfielder can now add the NWSL Championship to her long list of sporting achievements. An eight-year journey to the title came down to No. 1 seeded Orlando Pride and second place Washington Spirit in the biggest game of the year, and a lone goal by Barbra Banda was the difference maker.  The title is another record marker for the Pride, along with an unbeaten streak, it is the first championship for the city of Orlando. The Florida community is set to honor the club with a parade on Monday where fans will get a chance to celebrate their local team and get a glimpse of Marta with uncertainty around her next steps. The veteran hinted at uncertainty ahead of the championship final. ""No matter what happens in the final, this season, for me and for the team, has been the best season so far. Orlando never had played a consistent game as we have done in this season from beginning to end,"" Marta told CBS as she began to hold back tears. ""It's crazy sometimes to find an explanation, like 'How?' I think for me, it's special because it's the answer that I try to find every single year because from 2017, I am the only player that is still on the team. I ask myself 'Why? Why am I still looking to do something special here, you know?' Eight years. In my life, there was always something crazy. The first time I won [FIFA World Player of the Year], of course, I was much younger than I am now, but I did it for five times [in a row], then took a break and won it after eight years. It's been eight years here with Orlando, and it's the first time that we go to a final. It's a coincidence, but I don't know. It's some answer for me, for myself. Why am I still here? Why am I looking to build something special for this team? I don't know if I'm going to be here next year, but I'm already so happy with what I have given to the club and the players."" So, with lingering questions about where her career will take her next, let's take a look at what might come next for Marta From someone who always brings fun energy, Marta also flat-out said she needed a vacation after this season. Winning is awesome, but it so clearly zaps one's stamina and takes everything. It's always after the big games that we find out the aches and pains that players pushed through to get to their big moments, and Orlando, had several of them this year. So primarily, the player will take some time off before any big decisions.  Marta began taking steps away from the international stage ahead of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. Ahead of the tournament in Australia and New Zealand, she announced that it would be her final World Cup performance, but kept the door open to the Olympics with the Summer Games immediately following the World Cup.  After making the Olympic roster with Brazil, she reiterated that the tournament would be her final Olympics with Brazil. It signaled perhaps that her career would come to a close on major global stages, though she has only hinted at international retirement and has not made an official decision, and joked that she almost made the roster that went to Australia to close out the calendar year. Ahead of the 2023 season, Orlando signed Marta to a two-year contract, through 2024. It was a key signing that came one month after the Pride promoted Seb Hines from interim to official head coach and signaled a commitment by the club to the long-time player who was still rehabbing from an ACL injury at the time.  Option 1: Return to OrlandoWhile free agency is still relatively new to the league, the Pride and Marta, have re-upped together fairly seamlessly in the past. She has been vocal about the city becoming a home to her, its Brazilian community, and a place she'd like to stay. She and the club are also no strangers to one-year deals with options. It could be the most likely outcome between the two sides but there are always different options for a player in free agency. Option 2: Other NWSL teamsAt 38 years old, casuals would assume that team options are limited, but that's not necessarily the case for Marta. She's coming off her best NWSL season with 11 goals scored and the savvy attacker is just as effective in creating for her teammates as well.  A club team that wants to find value and productivity while landing a marquee name on a short deal could find themselves in the mix for Marta's services. West coast teams Angel City FC or San Diego Wave FC come to mind as potential landing grounds to extend the Brazilian's time in the United States. Bay FC could also be an option as the expansion franchise enters its sophomore season off a quarterfinal appearance and looks for its next big signing. Option 3: Retirement?A final option is just retirement altogether, but after getting a taste of the glory, maybe Marta will give it one more shot."

This occurred during the second quarter of the Kings' 108-103 loss against the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday. Upset about a non-call, Brown got in an official's face and may have inadvertently bumped him. Here's a video of the incident, via Fox40's Sean Cunningham: Kings head coach Mike Brown was shown some grace by the official after not calling a foul on a driving Colby Jones, a few moments before the triple by Noah Clowney. Brown assessed just a technical foul. pic.twitter.com/Hqy92cdEbi And here's the non-call that set Brown off: Brown told reporters postgame that, in the moment, he wanted to fight for -- and galvanize -- his team. ""I thought Colby [Jones] got hit going to the rim, and I just wanted to show our guys that, hey, we all need to fight. I'ma try to fight, you guys try to fight and see if we can find a way to get ourselves back into the game. And if we're going to go down, we're going to go down swinging."" In a way, this worked: Sacramento was down 19 at that point, and it cut the deficit to eight points by halftime. Had Brown pursued the official a bit less aggressively, though, he could have saved himself $35,000. The Kings fell again on Monday against Oklahoma City and have slipped below .500 (8-10) during a three-game losing streak."

CBSSports.com Headlines,"Cowboys, Micah Parsons 'don't plan on tanking' after halting five-game losing streak, Jerry Jones loves it",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/cowboys-micah-parsons-dont-plan-on-tanking-after-halting-five-game-losing-streak-jerry-jones-loves-it/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 17:44:55 +0000","While many fans might feel Dallas should wave the white flag on its 2024 season, Parsons guarantees that won't happen","The Dallas Cowboys were in a tailspin entering Week 12 with a 3-7 record, the worst 10-game start to a season since 2020, and in the midst of a five-game losing streak, their longest since the 2015 season. Many football fans, who root for the Cowboys and other teams, would probably agree that their free fall was actually an ideal occurrence for a franchise that could use an infusion of talent following injuries to quarterback Dak Prescott (hamstring), edge rusher DeMarcus Lawrence (foot), right guard Zack Martin (ankle/shoulder), cornerback Trevon Diggs (groin/knee) and cornerback DaRon Bland (foot), just to name a few. Even though that sentiment prevails around the football world, it isn't held in the Cowboys locker room even with coach Mike McCarthy and his staff playing out the final season of their current coaching contract. That was evident in Dallas' shocking and chaotic 34-26 road win over Dan Quinn and the Washington Commanders on Sunday afternoon in Week 12.  ""I'm not done yet. I don't plan on tanking,"" three-time All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons said, via The Athletic, postgame on Sunday. ""If the higher-ups are looking for a draft pick, I hope that's ruined, because we got a lot of football left to play. As long as I'm a part of this team, we're always going to fight.""   Dallas' owner and general manager Jerry Jones, who famously touts the Cowboys as a draft and develop team, loves Parsons' mindset and feels ""there's a lot of ambiguity with those draft picks."" Jones and the Cowboys notoriously spent $20.13 million in free agency -- where there is less ambiguity -- this past offseason. That figure was the lowest in the entire NFL per OverTheCap.com by over $10 million, in Dallas' ""all in"" offseason. ""Love it. Just absolutely love it,"" Jones said Tuesday, on 105.3 FM The Fan via The Athletic, when asked about Parsons' tanking comments. ... ""I just think the game is too important. The win is too important. ... A win is a very satisfying thing under any circumstance. It helps you build. There's a lot of ambiguity with those draft picks.""   Washington and No. 2 overall pick quarterback Jayden Daniels entered Sunday averaging the fourth-most points per game in the NFL (28.0), but Dallas stifled them for the most, limiting them to just nine points through the first 57 or so minutes of action. That was an incredible effort especially since the Cowboys first six offensive drives went like this: blocked field goal, missed field goal, lost fumble, and then three consecutive punts. Dallas won the turnover battle 3-1 by hauling in two interceptions off of Daniels and recovering a fumble by tight end John Bates.  ""I think we had to make a statement as a defense and as a team as a whole,"" Parsons said, via the Dallas Morning News, postgame on Sunday. ""I don't think it was particularly a player or a coach. I just think it was like, 'When is enough, enough?' You got to make that decision and today it was a direction, we said 'enough is enough, we're going to play all four quarters.'""   However, there's still plenty of teaching moments available in the victory, which the Cowboys coaching staff will certainly enjoy as they review the tape on Sunday night and Monday before turning the page to the New York Giants (2-9), their Thanksgiving Day opponent.  ""We did a great job,"" Parsons said, via the Dallas Morning News, postgame on Sunday. ""I wish we would have finished better, letting them get that touchdown at the end, that really bothered me. But that's what I mean, we're a good team, we're slowly putting games together. We did it in all three quarters, I just wish we could have finished the fourth quarter but we're definitely on our way to being the team we want to be.""   COMMANDERS 86-YARD TOUCHDOWN WOW📺: #DALvsWAS on FOX📱: https://t.co/waVpO909ge pic.twitter.com/apaNEKNCkh While the Cowboys needing to become the first team in NFL history, per CBS Sports Research, to return multiple kickoffs for touchdowns in the fourth quarter was an enjoyable turn of events for fans, Parsons hopes to never need KaVontae Turpin's and Juanyeh Thomas' heroics to close games out going forward. It's an understandable approach, but in a snake bitten 2024 season for the 4-7 Cowboys, many would understand Parsons taking some time to briefly smell the roses. However, that's just not how he is wired.  ""Yeah, I mean obviously you feel good because you're in the position to win the game if you get another stop, but the point is you shouldn't even get there,"" Parsons said, via DallasCowboys.com, postgame on Sunday about McLaurin's touchdown. ""That's the reality. We shouldn't even get to hoping that they miss a field goal. ... We should be able to end the game on defense, get off and take a kneel down.

The Brazilian superstar has 12 goals and six assists across all competitions and will be a big miss for Carlo Ancelotti and Los Blancos with the Italian possibly on the hook for this given that the Spanish and European champions were 2-0 up after 66 minutes, yet Vini Jr. went the full 90. The South American's absence is a huge opportunity for Kylian Mbappe, who opened the scoring in the victory at Butarque with his ninth goal across all competitions to go with two more assists as the France international seeks to improve upon his start to life with Los Merengues. Vini Jr. did provide Mbappe with the assist for the goal over the weekend, but the Spanish giants' firepower has now been seriously dented ahead of an important trip to face Liverpool who have won 100% of their UCL games so far. ""Kylian is more used to playing out wide,"" said Ancelotti postgame on Sunday. ""It was better for the team to have him there as it is more tiring out wide than it is through the middle. Vinicius only arrived back from international duty on Thursday and he trained with us. Kylian was fresher than Vinicius and he did a good job with the goal which was fantastically assisted by Vinicius. Both are improving little by little."" Complicating matters further for the Italian tactician is the injury to Rodrygo which has kept him out of late and will also rule him out on Merseyside and essentially dictates that Mbappe is suddenly back to being the main man in attack as used to be the case for Paris Saint-Germain. There can be no underestimating just how big an opportunity this is for Mbappe to really make a statement for Real given that Arne Slot's Reds have four wins from four in Europe and therefore are not exposed to the same level of risk as the defending champions. 📋✅ Our squad for the match!  🆚 @LFC#UCL pic.twitter.com/7icPnnJYEF Positionally, it is complicated for Ancelotti who just played Vini Jr. through the middle to make the most of Mbappe's greater freshness, only to see the Brazil international struck down at a time when both attacking stars were required. Unless Real get adventurous with their setup, the French superstar will logically have to be the main focal point of the attack given that there is no credible alternative despite playing in from the left suiting his game better. Jude Bellingham can step up and provide impetus more similar to that of last season, but there is no guarantee that it is a seamless transition with Mbappe given that Vini Jr. and Rodrygo had a lot longer to get used to it. There is also an excellent support cast of Arda Guler, Endrick and Brahim Diaz who could all also benefit from more opportunities which also offers Ancelotti the possibility to go with Mbappe as part of a front two or three as well as on his own. Considering his assist against Leganes, Guler is arguably best-placed to benefit from this unexpected change in plans but Endrick also has the possibility of sending a reminder why Real spent big to bring him in alongside Mbappe having recently fallen out of favor with Brazil this past month. Brahim Diaz perhaps has the experience over the Turkiye international but Guler's precocious talent and the need to have Fede Valverde at right-back should force Ancelotti's hand somewhat ahead of what could be the defining game for Mbappe's time with Real so far."
CBSSports.com Headlines,Quentin Johnston's case of the dropsies: Justin Herbert defends Chargers WR after nightmare game vs. Ravens,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/quentin-johnstons-case-of-the-dropsies-justin-herbert-defends-chargers-wr-after-nightmare-game-vs-ravens/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 17:41:31 +0000",Johnston had his worst performance of the season in a big spot,"Los Angeles Chargers wide receiver Quentin Johnston had a rough game Monday night. He was targeted five times by Justin Herbert in the team's loss to the Baltimore Ravens, and he came away with zero catches.  Going 0-fer in a big game would be bad enough, but the struggles didn't end there for Johnston. He actually dropped three of the five passes thrown his way, including one on a crucial third-and-6 early in the fourth quarter that led to a Chargers punt and then the Ravens driving down the field to make it a two-score game. Following the game, Herbert stood up for the second-year wideout despite the drops, and also praised his improvement from Year 1 to Year 2, after Johnston had a really tough rookie season. Here's Herbert's entire answer, via BoltBeat: I think that's the tough part about the NFL. He's a playmaker. He's done an incredible job all year. You never want to see that. Just like when I throw an interception or when I miss a throw, he's gonna come up to me and tell me, 'Hey, it's the next play'. And that's the way it is. Everyone in that locker room is professionals. Q will do a great job. I can give him better placement, better balls. It's on all of us. It's not just on him, it's on me for the way I gotta deliver the ball. I gotta make sure we're all on the same page. He's an incredible player and I'm gonna keep throwing him the ball... He's a fighter. You trust him. And I'm gonna keep throwing him the ball. That's what we did out there. Unfortunately, it didn't go our way tonight. But I know he's gonna be the first one in the building and he's gonna do everything the right way. He's a truly great teammate, great guy. And he's gonna go make some plays. He's got a lot of good football left in front of him. After posting 38 catches for 431 yards and two touchdowns in 17 games a year ago, Johnston has 22 grabs for 354 yards and six scores in his nine games this season. He's raised his yards-per-catch average by nearly five full yards, and he has done better work with the ball in his hands after the catch. (He already has more YAC this year than he did a year ago.)  He's had a few blow-up performances in Chargers wins -- five catches for 51 yards and two scores against the Panthers and 4-118-1 against the Browns being the most notable among them. Monday night's disappointing showing was more reminiscent of his rookie year, but as Herbert noted, Johnston has shown improvement. We shouldn't necessarily expect this to be the norm, even if we also shouldn't necessarily expect Johnston to live to his lofty draft status, either."

Multiple Power Four programs are making a push toward the postseason and await each precious rankings release with bated breath.  Then there's the opposite end of the spectrum. The teams that have already been eliminated from even bowl contention, with nothing but pride to play for and one more game to look forward to in Week 14.  Then there's Purdue, which is so far below every other power conference program -- and a good majority of the FBS -- that it deserves its own category. The Boilermakers are one of the worst teams that the Big Ten has seen this side of 2010.  They rank near the bottom, or at the very bottom, of the Big Ten in most major statistical categories:  Those defensive numbers are especially appalling when you remember that Purdue coach Ryan Walters was a DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR before taking his current job. The Boilermakers axed offensive coordinator Graham Harrell just four games into his second season. Somehow, that didn't fix anything. It's almost like Purdue's issues are more deeply rooted than a singular scapegoated coordinator.  There's not a ton of hope that the Boilermakers are going to avoid their first 11-loss season since 2013. They close the year against an Indiana team that -- much to Purdue's chagrin -- is enjoying arguably its best season in program history under first-year coach Curt Cignetti.  Cignetti has the Hoosiers well-situated in most major top 10s and on the brink of the College Football Playoff. Purdue has been outscored 195-17 in its four games against top-10 teams this year.  Purdue has been an excellent addition to the Bottom 25 this year and, without spoiling too much, the Boilermakers are setting a new bar in futility for a Power Four team.  All sports betting odds are courtesy of Fanatics.

CBSSports.com Headlines,College basketball rankings: Penny Hardaway guides Memphis into Top 25 And 1 after upsetting UConn in Maui,https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/college-basketball-rankings-penny-hardaway-guides-memphis-into-top-25-and-1-after-upsetting-uconn-in-maui/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 17:47:55 +0000",The Tigers are undefeated after what Hardaway called the biggest victory of his coaching career,"Penny Hardaway gathered his players early Monday before they took the court against the back-to-back champs in the opening game of the Maui Invitational, and in a plain white T-shirt and blue Memphis hat, the seventh-year coach delivered a final message.  ""The toughest team wins,"" Hardaway said, slapping his hand with each word in a video posted by longtime college basketball insider Andy Katz. ""That's why we're 4-0. Let's go 5-0.""  Would you believe they did it?  Final score: Memphis 99, UConn 97 in OT.  The Tigers, listed as 8.5-point underdogs by FanDuel Sportsbook, shot 54.7% from the field, including 54.5% from 3-point range, en route to snapping UConn's 17-game winning streak that dated back to last season, when the Huskies rolled through the NCAA Tournament while winning their second straight national championship. It was an incredible run for Dan Hurley's blue-blood program. But this UConn team is not that UConn team, in part because this UConn team is down four starters from that UConn team.  Against Memphis, it showed.  UConn trailed for much of the game and by 12 points with just 2:56 left before rallying to force OT. If you knew nothing about anything, and just turned on the television and watched, you would've had a difficult time figuring out which program is attempting to win a third straight national championship and which program was recently picked by American Athletic Conference coaches to finish second in the AAC behind UAB, which is currently 4-4 with losses to High Point and Longwood.  Was UConn overrated? Was Memphis undervalued?  It all seems on the table after Day 1 in Maui.  ""We knew it was going to be a physical game. That was the gameplan. We knew they wanted to make it physical,"" said UConn forward Alex Karaban, the lone starter from last season's team who returned to try to three-peat. ""It wasn't surprising [to] us that it was physical. We just had to match their toughness and, for most of the game, we didn't.""  When the 45-minute back-and-forth affair was over, Hardaway described it as the biggest win of his coaching career — and, given the context, I agree. It's actually hard to argue otherwise when considering A) what Hardaway predicted when he was hired in March 2018, B) everything that's happened since, and C) the pressure he carried into this season.  There have been some highs over the past six years, sure — everything from top-ranked recruiting classes to a win over Boise State in the 2022 NCAA Tournament. But the truth is that it's mostly been a roller coaster featuring zero conference championships, an unusual amount of staff changes, an investigation tied to improper benefits, an investigation tied to academic fraud, suspensions and more off-the-court nonsense than I care to list.  It's grown tiresome for fans. So, with just one returning scholarship player and a team that received zero votes in the preseason Associated Press Top 25 poll, Hardaway seemingly entered this season with real pressure to make good on some of the promises he made when he was introduced as Tubby Smith's replacement. Whether he'll ultimately deliver or not obviously remains uncertain. Seasons are long and often filled with twists and turns, and no fan base should understand this better than the Memphis fan base given that the Tigers were ranked 10th in the AP poll last January before going 7-8 in their final 15 games and missing the NCAA Tournament.  Nobody is chicken-counting quite yet.  But, that acknowledged, very few coaches, and possibly none, needed to get off to a good start this season more than Hardaway, who remains the most-beloved living Memphian despite the uneven nature of his first six years guiding his alma mater. As I wrote during the offseason, if things don't eventually calm down and get better, some hard decisions will have to be made. But, as I also wrote during the offseason, the best thing for Memphis — both the university and city — is still for Hardaway to figure out how to get things back on the so-called track and run the program competently and successfully.  So far this season, so good.  The Tigers are 5-0 with four victories over top-100 KenPom teams and ranked 13th in Tuesday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings. UConn is down to No. 14. Memphis going from unranked to No. 13 caused Indiana, Wisconsin, Baylor, Arkansas, Pitt, Texas A&M, Ohio State, Texas, Arizona, Florida, Cincinnati and Ole Miss all to be pushed down one spot each, no fault of their own. Mississippi State, previously No. 26, is now what amounts to No. 27. All odds via FanDuel. Check out the latest FanDuel promo code to get in the game."

But after a whacky Week 12, several teams slated to own top-10 picks saw their draft positions change.  The New York Giants and Carolina Panthers each moved down three spots after losing Sunday. Conversely, the Tennessee Titans and Cleveland Browns both climbed four spots (which isn't a good thing if you want the top pick) after upsetting the Houston Texans and Pittsburgh Steelers, respectively. These are just a few of the teams that saw their draft status shift this past weekend.  Here's a look at five Week 13 games that could determine the No. 1 overall pick, along with the current top of the draft order. Click here to check out which player our CBS Sports NFL Draft analysts currently have your team taking in the first round of the upcoming draft.  The draft order below was determined using the current 2025 NFL Draft order.

For more draft coverage, you can hear in-depth analysis twice a week on ""With the First Pick"" -- our year-round NFL Draft podcast with NFL Draft analyst Ryan Wilson and former Vikings general manager Rick Spielman. You can find ""With the First Pick"" wherever you get your podcasts: Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, etc. Listen below! 1. Jacksonville Jaguars (2-9)2. New York Giants (2-9) 3. Las Vegas Raiders (2-9) 4. New England Patriots (3-9) 5. Carolina Panthers (3-8) 6. Tennessee Titans (3-8) 7. New York Jets (3-8) 7. Cleveland Browns (3-8) 9. New Orleans Saints (4-7) 10. Cincinnati Bengals (4-7)  Dallas actually fell out of the top 10 after Sunday's upset win over the Commanders. As noted above, the Giants improved their odds at getting the top pick after they got whacked by Baker Mayfield and the Buccaneers in Tommy DeVito's first start of the season.  New York's rocky season will likely continue during its the final six games of the season, but as the Cowboys showed this past Sunday, anything can happen in a rivalry game. Expect the Giants to put their best foot forward Sunday agains their longtime rival. Specifically, one would think that Giants head coach Brian Daboll will try to get rookie wideout Malik Nabers involved in the offense early.  This year's Black Friday game will pit two longtime rivals against one another. It will also be a matchup that will undoubtedly have an impact on who gets this No. 1 overall pick.  Las Vegas has become a legitimate challenger in the race to get this year's top pick. Its odds of doing so increased when starting quarterback Gardner Minshew was lost for the season after injuring his collarbone during this past Sunday's to the Broncos. Minshew's injury soured what was a solid performance for the silver and black.  Will the Raiders (with Desmond Ridder playing in place in Minshew) put together another strong showing Friday, or will the Chiefs return to form after needing a last-second field goal to defeat the Panthers this past Sunday? We'll find out the day after Turkey Day.  The Chiefs may get an early Christmas gift Friday if running back Isiah Pacheco is able to play for the first time since getting injured back in Week 2.  Jacksonville is in the driver's seat to land the top pick, but Doug Pederson's team could be primed for an upset this Sunday. The Jaguars are coming off a bye week, and the Texans have dropped three of their last four games that includes this past Sunday's five-point loss to the Titans.  A big reason for Houston's recent skid has been C.J Stroud's dip in play. Stroud has completed more than 61% of his passes just once in his last four games. He's also thrown more interceptions (5) than touchdown passes (3) over that span. Sunday will give Stroud a chance to get back on track, as the Jaguars are 31st in the NFL in passing yards allowed and 32nd in touchdown passes given up.  Like Stroud, Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence has also had a forgettable stretch of games. He and the rest of the Jaguars' offense scored just 13 points in their last two games entering last week's bye.  This has the potential to be among the most compelling games on the Week 13 slate. Tampa Bay is coming off a resounding win as it looks to keep pace with the first-place Falcons in the NFC South division race. Carolina just played arguably its best game of the season against the two-time defending champion Chiefs.  It was an especially good game for 2023 No. 1 overall pick Bryce Young, who made several big throws against Kansas City while leading his offense on six scoring drives. It'll be interesting to see if Young and Co. can keep their momentum going against a division rival that has a lot to play for.  If the Panthers win, expect running back Chuba Hubbard to have played a large role in said upset. Hubbard, who recently signed a contract extension, is fifth in the NFL in rushing and 11th in yards-per-carry average.  Two decades ago, this was the NFL's best rivalry. Now, it's a matchup between losing teams, with the Patriots in the running to land the No. 1 overall pick.  After a 4-3 start, the Colts are now 5-7 after dropping four of their last five games. Anthony Richardson's continued erratic play has been a big reason for the Colts' slump. The Colts have also struggled to get Jonathan Taylor going lately, as the former league rushing champ ran for 92 yards on 35 carries in the Colts' last two games.  While it's been a lost year for the Patriots from a record standpoint, New England fans have gotten the chance to watch the continued growth of rookie quarterback Drake Maye. Not only has he continued to develop as a starting quarterback on the NFL level, the former No. 3 overall pick has also blossomed into a vocal leader. The Patriots may be down, but Maye and his teammates will give the Colts their best shot Sunday."
CBSSports.com Headlines,"North Carolina coaching candidates: Jon Sumrall, Barry Odom, Dan Mullen among options to replace Mack Brown",https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/north-carolina-coaching-candidates-jon-sumrall-barry-odom-dan-mullen-among-options-to-replace-mack-brown/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 18:42:31 +0000",The Tar Heels are preparing to make only their second football coaching hire since 2011,"North Carolina coach Mack Brown will not return in 2025, capping off one of the most legendary careers in college football history. Brown, 74, was one of only three coaches in the FBS who have won a national championship and he became the first UNC coach to ever win 100 games, which was accomplished across two stretches.  But while Brown leaves big shoes to fill, North Carolina prepares to enter as the top job opening on the market. The Tar Heels have posted 13 winning seasons in the last 16 years and are positioned perhaps as well as anyone in the ACC for the future of college football.  Whomever takes over at North Carolina will inherit strong recruiting territory, a talented roster and an invested alumni base. Still, there are many different directions athletic director Bubba Cunningham could go -- from successful sitting head coaches to an exciting young coordinator up north.  Here are the top potential candidates to replace Brown at North Carolina.  Jon Sumrall, Tulane coach: Frankly, Sumrall should already be a power conference coach after leading Troy and Tulane to a combined 32-6 record and 21-2 against conference competition. In his first season, Sumrall has Tulane humming as the AAC favorite and a potential College Football Playoff team. The former Kentucky linebacker comes from a defensive background but also developed NFL running back Kimani Vidal and Tulane quarterback Darian Mensah. The biggest question about Sumrall on this list simply comes down to whether he would take this job now or wait for more opportunities to open, especially at his alma mater. Barry Odom, UNLV coach: Odom was a solid Missouri coach, earning bowl eligibility three times in four years despite existing NCAA issues, but he has hit another level since reaching UNLV. The Rebels are 18-7 in two seasons under Odom and have held nine of their 11 opponents under 30 points. UNLV had only two seasons of nine or more wins in program history prior to Odom's arrival. However, Odom's inconsistent record at the power conference level could be a damper. Additionally, the Rebels have played well behind offensive coordinator Brennan Marion. He could be up for head coaching jobs and unavailable to join Odom in Chapel Hill.  Jamey Chadwell, Liberty coach: Chadwell is one of the kings of the Carolinas. Prior to taking the Liberty job in 2023, 13 of Chadwell's 14 seasons as a head coach were spent in South Carolina. At the FBS level, Chadwell is 60-25 between Liberty and Coastal Carolina, including a trip to the Fiesta Bowl with the Flames in 2023. Chadwell would immediately step back into his familiar recruiting terrain and bring both innovative offense and a strong recruiting mind to Chapel Hill. However, a two-game losing streak in the middle of the season this year won't help his case.  Andy Kotelnicki, Penn State offensive coordinator: Kotelnicki is a turnaround specialist and was part of Lance Leipold's staff as he turned both Buffalo and Kansas into winners. His misdirection offense is one of the most innovative in the game and helped the Nittany Lions move from No. 55 to 21 in total offense. Unlike every other coach on this list, Kotelnicki does not have head coaching experience and he has only been at the power conference level for four years. Still, Kotelnicki is an obvious rising star that could be worth a swing.  Dan Mullen, former Florida coach: Mullen has worked as a television analyst since getting fired from Florida in 2021, but he is regarded as one of the top offensive minds in the sport. Mullen helped Mississippi State reach No. 1 in the nation for the first time in 2014 and left as the second-winningest coach in program history. His .600 win mark was the best of any MSU coach since Darrell K. Royal in 1955. Even at Florida, Mullen recorded three straight New Year's Six bowl trips and top 10 finishes in the CFP Rankings. The combination of North Carolina and a post-payment recruiting world could prove a winning combination.  Deion Sanders, Colorado: Sanders is unlikely to be the next coach at North Carolina, but it's worth consideration for both sides. The Colorado coach has led one of the top two-year turnarounds in college football and has the Buffs competing for a Big 12 title. He would supercharge recruiting at UNC and add brand value at a time where the Tar Heels are looking to maximize their value. However, it's highly unlikely that Sanders would be given the amount of latitude in branding and public relations at UNC as he does at CU. It's probably a poor fit for both sides."

CBSSports.com Headlines,"Nolan Arenado trade rumors: 10 landing spots for Cardinals All-Star, including infield-needy Yankees and Mets",https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/nolan-arenado-trade-rumors-10-landing-spots-for-cardinals-all-star-including-infield-needy-yankees-and-mets/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 17:18:39 +0000",Arenado would reportedly consider a shift to first base for the right situation,"Though it might have to wait until a litany of free agents find their homes, all signs point to Cardinals third baseman Nolan Arenado being traded this offseason. That's the direction the Cardinals are headed and Arenado himself seems on board -- so long as he likes the destination enough to waive his no-trade clause. He's reportedly even open to moving to first base. Arenado is owed $59 million over the next two seasons, though $10 million of that is being paid by the Rockies and it's always possible the Cardinals pick up some of the remaining money in order to facilitate a trade. Then, in 2027, Arenado is set to make $15 million in his age-36 season.  The eight-time All-Star and 10-time Gold Glover hit .272/.325/.394 (101 OPS+) with 16 homers, 71 RBI and 2.5 WAR last season all while continuing to prove a very capable defender at third base. There's more concern with his drop in slugging, especially with the higher offensive bar a move to first base would entail. That said, he also posted 7.7 WAR and finished third in MVP voting just two years ago, so it's possible there's something left in the tank.  Here are 10 teams that might make sense as a trade partner for the Cardinals. Purely speculative, of course, but enough lines up that it would be doable for any of these ballclubs.  The Astros immediately come to mind because Arenado is a pull-heavy hitter (per FanGraphs, last season Arenado ranked 23rd in MLB in pull% and it wasn't an outlier) and the Crawford Boxes in Houston could help resurrect his slugging. Arenado will want to join a contender and there aren't many teams listed as obvious contenders in the way the Astros are, given that they haven't missed the playoffs since 2016. There could be an opening at third base if Alex Bregman walks in free agency, but the Astros could also take Arenado up on his offer to move to first base and try to fit both in their payroll. Last season, Houston rolled out a combination of José Abreu and Jon Singleton at the cold corner. In other words, an upgrade wouldn't be difficult. The top priority this offseason for the Yankees is obviously Juan Soto. Once the dust settles there, we'll see where they stand. They have an opening at first base after letting Anthony Rizzo walk in free agency. They could also put Arenado at third and play Jazz Chisholm Jr. at second. Such a move would improve the Yankees' defense -- which proved to be their undoing in Game 5 of the World Series -- but the ballpark doesn't do Arenado's bat any favors, given how little he ever hits the ball to right field.  Pete Alonso is a free agent while the Mets are hot on the trail of Soto. This means the Mets surely wouldn't be a factor here until after at least Soto is signed and maybe even after Alonso signs. If the Mets bring back Alonso, it doesn't really seem like there's a fit with Arenado. If Alonso signs elsewhere -- yes, even if the Mets land Soto -- Arenado would work.  Mark Vientos, coming off a breakout power season with 27 homers and 71 RBI in 111 games, is probably better suited to play first base than third long term. Moving him across the diamond and putting Arenado at third works.  The component of going to a contender would be satisfied with the Mets' run to the NLCS last year in addition to how they appear set up for the future.  The D-backs made the World Series in 2023 and improved to 89 wins last season, though this time around it meant they missed the playoffs. They would probably much rather just bring Christian Walker back in free agency, but if he signs elsewhere, the D-backs would have a void to fill. They could either put Arenado at third and move Eugenio Suárez to first base or just plant Arenado at first.  We know Arenado is plenty familiar with the NL West and Chase Field is a hitter-friendly environment, even if it isn't Coors Field.  The Mariners are in a situation where they've grown accustomed to contending. They've won 90, 90, 88 and 85 games, respectively, each of the last four seasons. They have pitching to spare and desperately need offense. We know Jerry Dipoto isn't bashful about trade talk.  It looks like Gold Glove winner Dylan Moore might be slotted at third, but he won the award as a utility player, not a third baseman. Luke Raley could be the first baseman, but, again, he's more of a utility guy. The Mariners have enough flexibility to make Arenado fit and they certainly have the money.  Would Arenado go there, though? T-Mobile Park was the single worst park in the majors for hitters from 2022-24. He's already dealing with declining offense and has a no-trade clause. It seems like this is something he might want to avoid.  The Jays are in a tough spot in that they are trying to convince Vladimir Guerrero Jr. they are doing enough to contend so that he'll sign a long-term contract extension. They're also trying hard to convince Juan Soto they are set up well enough that he'll sign there. If you're going all-in, it can't hurt to make a play for Arenado.  Ernie Clement is currently slotted in at third, but he's a utility man. Arenado could stay at third here beside Bo Bichette -- who is surely in line for a bounce-back season here in his final year before free agency -- with Guerrero at first.  Could the Jays pull of a Soto signing and Arenado trade? That would be pretty interesting.  There have already been whispers about the Red Sox moving Rafael Devers off third and across the diamond to first. The opening at third would be an easy fit for Arenado and, coincidentally enough, it would be next to his former Rockies teammate Trevor Story. Remember how I mentioned above that Arenado is one of the most pull-heavy players in baseball? Hello, Green Monster. Arenado would have plenty of fly balls to left field turned into home runs or doubles. The ballpark is a great fit.  Such a maneuver -- Devers to first, Arenado to third -- would likely trigger the Red Sox to deal Triston Casas, unless they wanted to use the DH spot heavily with this trio and move an outfielder. It's a trickier fit, but it could happen and a Casas deal could be used to shore up the pitching staff.  The Tigers are coming off a run to the ALDS and are looking to capitalize on the momentum, at least in theory. They don't have much money on the books moving forward, so this should be a fit. Adding Arenado would either block Jace Jung at third or move Spencer Torkelson from first to permanent DH at a young age, so it might not sound ideal, but there's a fit in there. Jung wasn't good in 34 games as a rookie last year, so it's not like he's a sure thing who must play every day in 2025.  The 2024 Royals had one of the most remarkable turnarounds in MLB history, going from 106 losses to the ALDS in a single season. They are set up to contend again behind MVP candidate Bobby Witt Jr. and a pair of aces in Cole Ragans and Seth Lugo. They already traded from strength by sending pitching for offense, acquiring Jonathan India. Vinnie Pasquantino is at first, so this would be another team who would, correctly, leave Arenado at third base. Maikel Garcia is the incumbent third baseman, but he hit .231 with a 72 OPS+ and 1.2 WAR last season. Arenado is an upgrade. It would be a pretty fun move.  No way, right?  Well, we know the money won't be an obstacle and Arenado would surely jump at the chance to play for them. They'd have to lose out on Soto and concede that Betts was going to be their right fielder, but then the Dodgers could use Max Muncy at second, Gavin Lux at shortstop and Tommy Edman in center field. That leaves third base open for Arenado.  It actually works. Don't count it out."
CBSSports.com Headlines,Michael Malone rips Nuggets after blowout loss vs. Knicks: 'Playing like you actually care would be great',https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/michael-malone-rips-nuggets-after-blowout-loss-vs-knicks-playing-like-you-actually-care-would-be-great/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 17:12:49 +0000",The coach said Denver was 'embarrassed' and needed more leadership from Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray,"The New York Knicks crushed the Denver Nuggets on Monday. Denver's 145-118 loss at Ball Arena was its worst defensive performance of the season -- and New York's best offensive performance -- and it elicited a series of angry postgame comments from coach Michael Malone. Here's a sampling: A couple of weeks ago, after winning a wild game against the Dallas Mavericks, Denver was 7-3. Then Jokic was away from the team for a week, during which time he welcomed his newborn son. The Nuggets lost to the New Orleans Pelicans and split a pair of games against the Memphis Grizzlies without Jokic, and they've gone 1-2 since he returned: A close loss against Dallas, a blowout win over the Los Angeles Lakers and the debacle against the Knicks, all at home. They're now 9-7 on the season. Despite this slide, it hasn't been all doom and gloom for Denver. Jokic has again been the best player in the world this season, Westbrook has fit in better than many expected and young wings Christian Braun and Peyton Watson have largely given the team what it needs from them. The roster isn't particularly deep, though, and the Nuggets are feeling the absence of Aaron Gordon, who is out indefinitely with a calf injury. The further they get into the season without Murray's efficiency improving (he's averaging 17.8 points per game while shooting 40.2% from the floor and 33.7% from 3-point range), the more concerning it will be. It's good news that Denver's next game is against the 4-12 Utah Jazz on Wednesday. The Nuggets can't just show up in Utah and expect to win, though. Two days before demolishing Denver, New York lost by double digits there."

Kansas has won four of the last five matchups against Duke and leads the all-time series 6-8. The Jayhawks improved to 5-0 last week with an 84-66 win over UNC Wilmington. Kansas knocked off North Carolina at home earlier this season and defeated Michigan State in the first leg of the Champions Classic. Kansas All-American center Hunter Dickinson is averaging 17.8 points, 10.4 rebounds, 1.8 blocks and 1.8 steals through the first five games.

One of the biggest issues that plagued the Jayhawks' 2023-24 season was the lack of depth. That doesn't appear to be an issue this season due to the robust talent the program brought in via the transfer portal and high school recruiting. Flagg is the biggest key to this game for a Duke win. If he plays aggressively and wrecks the game on defense like he's capable of, the Blue Devils, who are favored by 3.5 points by sports betting experts, will leave Las Vegas with another big nonconference win. Pick: Duke -3.5"

McGregor took to X, formerly Twitter, to again claim innocence in the assault of Nikita Hand, to whom the jury awarded roughly $258,300. McGregor took responsibility for cheating on his longtime partner Dee Devlin with Hand but maintained his stance that the situation was consensual. ""People want to hear from me, I needed time,"" McGregor wrote. ""I know I made mistakes. Six years ago, I should have never responded to her outreaches. I should have shut the party down. I should never have stepped out on the woman I love the most in the world. That's all on me.  ""As much as I regret it, everything that happened that night was consensual and all the witnesses present swore to that under oath. I have instructed my legal team to appeal the decision."" McGregor then turned his attention to claims that he would return to the UFC Octagon, where he has not fought since back-to-back 2021 losses to Dustin Poirier. ""I can't go back and I will move forward,"" McGregor wrote. ""I am beyond grateful to my family, friends and supporters all over the world who have stayed by my side. That's it. No more. Getting back to the gym -- the fight game awaits!"" In the wake of the jury's decision, McGregor has seen some outside-the-cage interests take a hit in response. Video game developer IO Interactive announced that they will pull all sales of content featuring McGregor, who appeared in the popular ""HITMAN World of Assassination"" featuring his likeness and voiceover work. In light of the recent court ruling regarding Conor McGregor, IO Interactive has made the decision to cease its collaboration with the athlete, effective immediately. We take this matter very seriously and cannot ignore its implications. Consequently, we will begin removing all… Similarly, major Irish retailers such as Tesco, SuperValu, Centra, Costcutter, Carry Out, BWG Foods and others have all made the decision to stop stocking Proper No. Twelve Irish whiskey, the brand which McGregor sold to Proximo Spirits in 2021 but which still featured McGregor in its branding and marketing, and Forged Irish Stout, which McGregor owns. Promixmo Spirits has since released a statement claiming, ""Going forward, we do not plan to use Mr. McGregor's name and likeness in the marketing of the brand."" McGregor has stated that he instructed his legal team to appeal the recent court decision."

As of early Tuesday, I have 32 running backs projected for double-digit PPR Fantasy points and 24 of them are projected to score at least 13. There are even two backs available in more than half of leagues that you might not hate starting. It's a good thing, but it feels a little strange. Just not as strange sa what's going on with Chuba Hubbard and Christian McCaffrey. A month ago we all thought McCaffrey was returning to be a league winner and Hubbard's value was about to get destroyed by the return of Jonathon Brooks. Heading into Week 13, both of those ideas look foolish. McCaffrey has been back for three weeks now. He is still looking for his first touchdown of 2024 and he currently ranks WR19 per game. This is not a case of him just needing to warm up, his worst game of the season came last week, when he scored just 9.8 PPR Fantasy points against the Packers. He's averaging a career-low 3.5 yards per carry and his longest run in three games is 13 yards.  Hubbard just played his first game with Brooks active, against the Kansas City Chiefs who have been one of the best run defenses in football. Hubbard scored 13 Fantasy points on 17 touches while Brooks played five offensive snaps and did nothing to suggest he should be playing more.  All of that is to say that when you look at the Week 13 running back rankings and projections, you'll see Hubbard ranked as a top-12 back, while McCaffrey is a mid RB2. Yes. if I had both of them and only one starting spot available I would start Hubbard. No, I can't believe I just typed those words. As always, you can find my projections for every position and every player on the slate over at SportsLine. Now, let's get to the rest of the Week 13 RB Preview:

The Bills are on the cusp of clinching the AFC East title, and it could happen as soon as Sunday if two things go their way this week.  The Bills only have one scenario for clinching a playoff berth this week: 1. Bills win over 49ers + Dolphins loss to Packers If both of those things happen, the Bills would clinch the AFC East.  In that situation, Buffalo would become the first team since the 2009 Colts to clinch a division title with five weeks left in the season. That Colts team was led by Peyton Manning, who got Indianapolis all the way to the Super Bowl before losing to the New Orleans Saints."

State Cougars Current Records: Fresno State 3-2, Wash. State 5-1  The Fresno State Bulldogs will face off against the Wash. State Cougars on Wednesday at Acrisure Arena. The Cougars are favored, but seeing as the odds didn't stop the Bulldogs in their last game, maybe the  team has another upset up their sleeve.  Fresno State is headed into the  contest having just  posted their closest  victory since February 10th on Saturday. They had just enough and edged LBSU out  72-69. The  win was all the more spectacular given the Bulldogs were down by 17 with 7:00 left in the first  half.  Fresno State's win  was the result of several impressive offensive performances. One of the most notable came from   Mykell Robinson, who  had 16 points along with seven  rebounds and five  assists. The team also got some help courtesy of  Amar Augillard, who  scored 25 points.  Fresno State  smashed the offensive glass and  finished the game with 18  offensive rebounds. That's the most  offensive rebounds they've posted  since  the start of last season.  Meanwhile, Wash. State didn't have too much trouble with Eastern Washington  on Thursday as they won  96-81. The  victory made it back-to-back  wins for the Cougars.  Wash. State's success was the result of a balanced attack that saw several players step up, but  Dane Erikstrup led the charge by  going 6 for 8 from beyond the arc en route to 24 points plus eight  rebounds. Cedric Coward was another key player,  almost  dropping  a double-double on 22 points and nine  rebounds.  Fresno State's victory  ended  a  five-game drought on the road  dating back to last season and  puts them at 3-2. As for Wash. State, their win bumped their record up to 5-1.  Rebounding is likely to be a big factor in this contest:  Fresno State has been smashing the glass this season,  having  averaged 38.6  rebounds per game. However, it's not like Wash. State struggles in that department as   they've been averaging 40.7. With both teams battling to corral missed shots, we'll see if one team can grab an edge.  Wash. State and Fresno State pleased both fans and bettors in their last  games by winning and covering the spread. Going forward, Wash. State is the favorite in this one, as the experts expect to see them win by 13.5  points. They might be worth a quick bet   since they're sitting on a four game streak of covering the spread when  expected to win.  Wash. State is a big 13.5-point favorite against Fresno State, according to the latest college basketball odds. The oddsmakers were right in line with the betting community on this one, as the game opened as a 13.5-point spread, and stayed right there. The over/under is 158.5  points.

Cori Close has a very deep roster, and it was on full display against the reigning national champions. UCLA's 77-62 victory snapped a 43-game winning streak for South Carolina. The Gamecocks did a good job limiting Lauren Betts, but as Dawn Staley put it, they ""got killed by everybody else."" Another big game took place in Los Angeles this past weekend, and that one saw USC fall to Notre Dame. Hannah Hidalgo was shining as usual, and so was Olivia Miles, who has not missed a beat this season despite having been sidelined for 627 days. However, Sonia Citron also deserves credit because she did a solid job guarding USC star JuJu Watkins. Notre Dame had a strong argument to take the No. 2 spot, but UConn stayed put because of its undefeated record. Texas is having an impressive start to the season, but the Longhorns were a casualty of all the movement this week and fell out of the top five. However, this makes their game against Notre Dame on Dec. 5 a lot more interesting.  Baylor completely fell out the rankings after an unexpected loss to Indiana, a team that was held to just 39 points by North Carolina on Monday.  Audi Crooks has been one of the most impressive players this season, but Iowa State dropped eight spots to No. 16 after losing to Northern Iowa last week. The Cyclones almost suffered another upset loss, but a game-winning shot by Crooks helped them skate by Drake with a 80-78 win on Sunday.  Meanwhile, Iowa had been knocking at the door all season, and they finally entered the top 25.

The fart walk is a practice coined by Mairlyn Smith, a 70-year-old cookbook author, who evangelizes on social media about eating lots of fiber and walking after dinner to pass gas …Of course, cultures around the world have been going on walks after dinner for centuries, from Italy, where they call it la passeggiata, to China, which has the ancient proverb: ‘If you take 100 steps after each meal, you'll live to 99.'

And, uhh, yeah, you fart when you walk …  By walking for as little as two minutes, usually walk for about 10, 15, 20 … we are helping reduce our chances of developing type 2 diabetes.Why?

Specifically, the study investigated the prevalence of mental health conditions, such as anxiety and suicidality, among transgender people in India. It sought to understand what variables were contributing to the occurrence of those conditions. The framework used by the team of Drexel researchers aimed to 'put the gender back into transgender health,' according to the grant's description.The researchers argued that their work is necessary because the 'transgender community is experiencing major socio-legal changes that may affect mental health' in India. The researchers argued that their work is necessary because the 'transgender community is experiencing major socio-legal changes that may affect mental health' in India. Not to be dismissive, but why does the United States need to be spending money to find out why transgender people in India are depressed? Is this really a proper use of government resources? One of the policy recommendations made in the final report produced by the team of researchers was to implement public funding for 'gender-affirmative healthcare,' including hormone therapy and sex change surgeries.

I can see why Make America Healthy Again was such a popular movement. Step 1: Feed Americans unhealthy food with questionable ingredients. Step 2: Encourage sloth and gluttony on a popular level. Step 3: Big Pharma creates a ""cure"" for obesity. Step 4: Taxpayers money goes to pay for this miracle cure. Step 5: Big pharma profits. The same folks in the Biden administration who are calling RFK Jr. a ""kook"" for MAHA are pushing these big pharma weight loss drugs because the American people would rather take shots to lose weight than buckle down and actually be healthy. RFK wants to remove additives, remove chemicals, and other unnatural ingredients from our food supply to help make Americans healthy. The regime wants to keep all that stuff but sell ""health"" in the form of a pill. Or a shot in this case. Okay, let me get to this proposal to have Ozempic covered by Medicare and Medicaid. The costly proposal from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sets the stage for a potential showdown between the powerful pharmaceutical industry and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an outspoken opponent of the weight-loss drugs who, as President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to lead the agency, could try to block the measure.While the rule would give millions of people access to weekly injectables that have helped people shed pounds so quickly that some have labeled them miracle drugs, it would cost taxpayers as much as $35 billion over the next decade. While the rule would give millions of people access to weekly injectables that have helped people shed pounds so quickly that some have labeled them miracle drugs, it would cost taxpayers as much as $35 billion over the next decade. We're willing to spend $35 billion to give people weight loss drugs? And the Biden HHS is doing this on the way out the door? Why? Is it to possibly make Trump and RFK look bad when they stop this wasteful program? Could that be the motivation? 'It's a good day for anyone who suffers from obesity,' U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told The Associated Press in an interview. I just want to pause here and recognize the fact that the Health Secretary of the US just opened a statement essentially saying that it's a good day to be a fatty. Anyway, he continues: 'It's a game changer for Americans who can't afford these drugs otherwise.This proposal would allow Americans and their doctors to determine the best path forward so they can lead healthier lives, without worrying about their ability to cover these drugs out-of-pocket, and ultimately reduce health care costs to our nation,' the White House said in a statement. This proposal would allow Americans and their doctors to determine the best path forward so they can lead healthier lives, without worrying about their ability to cover these drugs out-of-pocket, and ultimately reduce health care costs to our nation,' the White House said in a statement. Yeah, it will just come out of YOUR pocket as a taxpayer. But not out of the welfare recipient's pocket. By the way, as the great philosopher of our time, Oliver Anthony, pointed out, our taxes are also going to pay for these welfare recipients to fatten themselves up. If you're five-foot-three and you're three-hundred poundsTaxes ought not to pay for your bags of Fudge Rounds And now we're paying for the Ozempic and Wegovy as well.   More from CBS News: Becerra estimated that an additional 3.5 million people on Medicare and 4 million on Medicaid could qualify for coverage of the drugs. But research suggests far more people might qualify, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimating roughly 28 million people on Medicaid are considered obese ...Kennedy, who as Trump's nominee for HHS secretary is subject to Senate confirmation, has railed against the drugs' popularity. In speeches and on social media, he's said the U.S. shouldn't cover the drugs through Medicaid or Medicare. Instead, he supports a broad expansion of coverage for healthier foods and gym memberships.

Especially in this day and age. And that is why the UK Supreme Court is going to hear a case on just that: The definition of the word ""woman.""    This has been a long legal battle out of Scotland. The Gender Representation on Public Boards Act was passed in 2018. It aimed to get more women onto public sector boards. Of course, then non-women (you know who I'm talking about) tried to make themselves a part of the ""women"" group. A group called ​​For Women Scotland challenged in court the right of these non-women to be included in the ""women"" group and won. The Scottish government amended the bill, but also laid out new guidance, which stated that the law would include ""women"" as defined by the UK's Gender Recognition Act. This let the men back in, as long as they had a gender certificate. According to Google, ""A gender recognition certificate (GRC) is a legal document that recognizes a person's preferred gender."" A judge then ruled in 2022 against For Women Scotland, saying that the definition of sex is ""not limited to biological or birth sex,"" and even non-women with one of those GRCs could be considered women. This is what led to the supreme court case. It will set out exactly how the law is meant to treat trans people, and what it really means to go through the gender recognition process.And it could have implications for the running of single-sex spaces and services, and how measures aimed at tackling discrimination will operate in future.

You may remember if you're a Coloradan the story about now-Mayor Yemi Mobolade being intimidated with this sign and accompanying burning cross leading up to his 2023 election victory.  Yes, that's the n-word. Initially, this was a terrible scene - something only a white supremacist would do. Or was it?   And it may have won Mobolade the election.  On Nov. 12 the Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado announced that three of Mobolade's supporters had been charged with writing the n-word on one of his campaign signs, erecting a burning cross in front of it, and sending video of the spectacle to the news media to turn out the black vote for Mobolade, an African immigrant. Mobolade, a left-wing candidate, went on to defeat a white Republican in a closely fought election in the conservative-leaning city. The FBI began an investigation, and would eventually refer the case to the DOJ. But what did the DOJ do in response? They came to Mobolade's aid. ‘The initial response from the Department of Justice was ""we can't indict the first black mayor of Colorado Springs,""' the official said, adding ‘In my experience if anyone had been in that position they would have been charged with lying to a federal agent.' The DOJ worked to remove Mobolade from the case altogether. Earlier this month, arrest warrants were issued against the three suspects, and on November 12, the case was unsealed and made public.Acting U.S. Attorney for Colorado Matt Kirsch put out a press release that day that misrepresented the candidate's role. It said Bernard sent a message 'to the other defendants' that said he was 'mobilizing my squad' for 'black ops.' But that message, according to the actual indictment, was sent to the now-mayor, not to Blackcloud and West. The message also notified Mobolade that 'I spoke with some of my friends in other places and theirs [sic] a plot amidst.'When The Daily Wire asked the U.S. Attorney's Office for Colorado for comment on the allegation that it rejected an FBI criminal referral for false statements and included a false statement in its press release, a spokesman said 'we have no comment' and stealth-edited the press release to strike the phrase 'to the other defendants.'Yet Mobolade seemed to expect even more from the Justice Department. On November 13, The Daily Wire emailed the mayor's spokespeople asking about his communications with Bernard. That day, he personally called the Justice Department to request that it put out a second press release saying he was not a subject in the hoax hate crime investigation, the official said.The Justice Department seemed open to doing so, and consulted the FBI about it. But the FBI was taken aback by the request, because the mayor was, in fact, on investigators' radar, the official said.

Wait, you're telling me that corporations and schools pushing the woke mind virus contributes to negatives in society?  And you're telling me that two of America's major news publications decided to spike the story on it?  According to Colin Wright's report, The New York Times and Bloomberg were both working on stories that would have tied Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion policies at work to some really dangerous (some would say psycho) stuff. If you're someone on our side of the aisle who has paid a lick of attention you know that DEI trainings which serve to reinforce the Marxist oppressor/oppressed matrix would obviously breed hostility, authoritarianism, and extremism. It's the nature of the Commie beast. Here's more from Wright: The study was conducted by the Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) in collaboration with Rutgers University. It investigated the psychological effects of DEI pedagogy, specifically trainings that draw heavily from texts like 'How to Be an Antiracist' and 'White Fragility.'  These are books recommended by corporations, schools, and government agencies across the US, by the way. We are creating radical lefties with tax dollars and store dollars every day. The findings were unsettling, though perhaps not surprising to longstanding opponents of such programs. Using carefully controlled experiments, researchers found that exposure to anti-oppressive rhetoric consistently amplified perceptions of bias where none existed.In one experiment, participants read excerpts from Robin DiAngelo and Ibram X. Kendi, juxtaposed against a neutral control text about corn production. Afterward, they were asked to evaluate a hypothetical scenario: an applicant being rejected from an elite university.Those exposed to the DEI materials were far more likely to perceive racism in the admissions process, despite no evidence to support such a conclusion.Those exposed to the DEI materials were also more likely to advocate punitive measures, such as suspending the admissions officer or mandating additional DEI training.

Those exposed to the DEI materials were also more likely to advocate punitive measures, such as suspending the admissions officer or mandating additional DEI training.  Again, not shocking to conservatives. But should be eye opening for the average, unengaged American who thinks DEI is just about being diverse and friendly. Colin goes on to show that the same pattern shows up in anti-Islamophobia studies and Caste studies, where people who took the trainings assumed discrimination when there was no evidence to support it. And the people who were influenced by all these trainings, it made a big impact in their mindset. Those people were also more likely to endorse dehumanizing rhetoric, including adapted quotes from Adolf Hitler where the term 'Jew' was replaced with 'Brahmin.'The findings suggest that these programs may not only fail to address systemic injustice but actively cultivate divisive and authoritarian mindsets. The findings suggest that these programs may not only fail to address systemic injustice but actively cultivate divisive and authoritarian mindsets.

California, the golden state, the former land of opportunity, is hiring. But only the state itself appears to be hiring. No one's doing business there.  Here's more to put that in perspective from the Hoover Institute: Between January 2022 and June 2024, employment in US private businesses increased by about 7.32 million jobs. Of these 7.32 million jobs, about 5,400 were jobs created in California businesses — representing about .07 percent of the US figure. Businesses like Elon Musk's companies are fleeing California due to insane taxes, political lawfare, and over-the-top regulation. California's job creation record has been even more dismal over the last 18 months. Since January 2023, private-sector employment in the state declined by over 46,000 workers. California's private-sector job collapse is unprecedented, and with the state representing nearly 12 percent of the country's population, it is a drag on the nation's economy.Part of California's job weakness reflects the number of people and businesses leaving the state. California's population declined by about 75,000 between 2022 and 2023 (the latest data available), and a number of business headquarters have departed.

We showed you back in 2021 how Younger still had a chance to keep his son intact:  But now that hope has sadly fizzled out.

Last year, Younger begged his ex-wife not to chemically castrate their son after she moved to California. Mom is a pediatrician who enjoys dressing her son up as a girl. She fled Texas for California after she split with her husband, and it looks like, as far as the chemical castration of her son goes, that worked out in her favor. Younger is understandably devastated.   To lose your kids in a custody battle is one thing; but to lose your son to the cult of transgenderism is a whole other ballgame. It's all over for Jeff Younger. He'll have to wait until ""Luna"" (that's really his son's name now) grows to adulthood in order to have an impact on his life.

""Intro to Fat Studies: Fatness, Blackness and their Intersections"" is taught by Dr. Sydney Lewis, and is advertised as follows: The course examines fatness as an area of human difference subject to privilege and discrimination that intersects with other systems of oppression based on gender, race, class, sexual orientation, and ability. This course will particularly highlight the relationship between fatness and Blackness. We approach this area of study through an interdisciplinary humanities and social-science lens which emphasizes fatness as a social justice issue. The course closes with an examination of fat liberation as liberation for all bodies with a particular emphasis on performing arts and activism as a vehicle for liberation and challenging fatmisia.  This read to me like someone took every woke word in the woke dictionary and just printed them in random order. Lewis is a senior lecturer at the Harriet Tubman Department of Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, and students who enroll in her course will earn three general education credits. Comrade Lewis Some of you still think this is a joke so here's the enrollment page Richard Vatz, a professor at a nearby university, said this area of study was ""kind of a laughable, laughable subject"" and ""just ludicrous."" Pretty fatphobic there, Rich. I don't think if you went into a job interview and the interviewer said 'what have you taken recently?' and the respondent said 'well, I'm taking a course in fat studies, but the intersection of a blackness and fatness,' that this would put you in a position to get much of a job, so the utility of this and the job market is probably pretty questionable Follow Ian on Substack or X (@ighaworth).

Not the Bee,Courts gagged the doc who exposed Texas Children's Hospital.

Chris Rufo of City Journal and the Manhattan Institute exposed multiple doctors at Texas Children's Hospital who were giving cross-sex hormones to children, in direct contradiction to Texas law.  After the story broke, the Biden Department of Justice investigated and charged the anonymous whistleblower, surgeon Dr. Eithan Haim, with four counts of violating HIPAA. The hospital also fired a nurse that helped reveal the hospital's illegal program - that is, after FBI agents showed up to her door to harass her. Texas AG Ken Paxton is investigating the hospital, but gag orders remain on information related to the case against Dr. Haim. We want to know why Biden's government refuses to explain itself. From Harmeet Dhillon's link: The Dhillon Law Group, on behalf of client Not the Bee, LLC, has taken legal action to unseal critical documents in the criminal case against Dr. Eithan Haim, a whistleblower accused of exposing controversial transgender medical practices on minors, at Texas Children's Hospital. Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, the motion aims to make public docket entries 101, 104, 107, and 108, which were sealed without clear justification. Dr. Haim's revelations about these medical procedures have ignited fierce debate across the country, drawing attention from politicians, legal scholars, and media outlets. Critics have labeled the prosecution of Dr. Haim as retaliatory, claiming it seeks to silence dissenting voices in an area of intense public and political concern.  Whether it's the manifesto of the school shooter in Nashville or whistleblower documents related to gender surgeries on Texas kids, courts absolutely love to shut down the release of information related to transgenderism so that no one gets the idea that radical gender theory is incorrect or to blame for any of society's ills. But lack of transparency doesn't make the problems go away. Not the Bee Co-Founder and CEO Dan Dillon explains why it is essential for the American public to have all the facts about this case. 👇 At Not the Bee, we make a living from finding humor in the absurd, but this case is no laughing matter. When a doctor risks everything to shine a light on medical practices involving children, especially in the controversial realm of gender transitions, the public has a right to see the full picture. The sealed documents in this case could provide the public with evidence that this case was justified - or, it could show that the government is harassing Dr. Haim without any justification other than blind obedience to the woke religion. Here are a few reasons that the whole thing is sketchy, straight from the motion we have filed with the U.S. District Court in Southern Texas: First, immediately after the hearing and before the second superseding indictment was filed, a filing was made under seal, with no description. Second, a government attorney filed a motion to withdraw as counsel of record for the United States. Though the filing was entirely under seal, the court then granted the motion and provided the title of the motion. Third, on November 20, 2024, the government moved for a gag order to prevent Dr. Haim and his counsel from making public statements or talking to the press, except for statements that merely recite, without any characterization, matters of public record. For this motion, the government filed two exhibits under seal and described them as tweets from Dr. Haim and his counsel. The government characterized the tweets as demonstrating that the 'defendant and his counsel have now crossed a line, bombarding social media with inaccurate and inflammatory descriptions of pretrial proceedings that would never be admissible before a jury.' We believe none of these elements provide justification for the government's efforts in quieting information regarding this case, especially considering the fact that we live in, well, AMERICA. Sealing a document constitutes a prior restraint, and it is 'constitutional only if the government demonstrates that the protected speech restrained poses a ‘clear and present danger, or a serious or imminent threat to a protected competing interest.'"" Davis, 78 F.3d at 928 (quoting CBS Inc. v. Young, 522 F.2d 234, 238 (6th Cir. 1975)). Furthermore, '[t]he restraint must be narrowly drawn and cannot be upheld if reasonable alternatives are available having a lesser impact on First Amendment freedoms.' Harmeet Dhillon has this to say about the motion: Transparency in this case is essential -- not just for justice but for public trust in the system. The requested sealing these documents is inconsistent with applicable law, violates the public right to examine the government's conduct, and further would deprive the public of the First Amendment right to hear commentary about a matter of significant public interest -- namely, the prosecution of a whistleblower raising alarm about alleged medical misconduct and mistreatment of minors in Texas. Thanks to Dhillon Law Group for their work in filing this motion.  I'll leave you with this January interview with Dr. Haim that outlines why he decided to be brave and say something about what was happening at Texas Children's Hospital:  People need to hear the truth. People need to hear what happened.

A whopping 33% of Republican women own guns, compared to just 29% of Democratic men.  And I love this headline from Gallup:   Here's what the poll found. According to six-year groupings of Gallup's annual measurement of personal gun ownership since 2007, the percentage of Republican women who own a gun has increased from 19% in 2007-2012 to 33% in 2019-2024. Meanwhile, the rate has fallen seven percentage points among Democratic men, to 29%, and is down five points among independent men, to 39%. Republican men remain the most likely gun owners among gender and party identification subgroups, at 60%. Not at all surprising ... if you've been paying attention. Some other interesting finds in this poll: While the gender gap has shrunk, the political party gap has expanded. In 2007-2012, personal gun ownership rates differed by 16 points among Republicans (38%) and Democrats (22%). Now the gap is 28 points (47% and 19%, respectively).…gender is the strongest predictor of gun ownership. However, the influence of gender is weaker today than it was in the past.The model estimates that the statistical odds of a man owning a gun are 3.1 times greater than the odds of a woman owning a gun, after taking into account the effect of other variables. That compares with a much larger 4.5 ""odds ratio"" for men versus women when applying the same model to the 2007-2012 data.Republicans are currently 1.5 times more likely than non-Republicans to own a gun, after controlling for the effects of other factors such as gender, region or place of residence.

Listen to CBS News explain how that meanie Donald Trump is going to send them all home:  Notice that this segment doesn't consider the perspectives of the native Americans who have lived in Springfield for generations.  It ignores the effects of putting tens of thousands of migrants from a very different culture into a small community and instead focuses on the plight of the foreigners who are only supposed to be here temporarily. Take Springfield, Ohio, where Trump accused Haitian immigrants without any evidence of eating pets.    No evidence at all! Ketlie Moise fled unspeakable violence in her homeland of Haiti hoping to find peace and a slice of the American dream, settling in Springfield, Ohio.'I stay here,' Moise told CBS News. 'I do two jobs to make my business. That's why I don't go back to Haiti.'Moise saved money for years and recently opened a restaurant. She is one of the thousands of Haitian migrants building a life in Springfield who now find themselves in the crosshairs of the incoming Trump administration. 'I stay here,' Moise told CBS News. 'I do two jobs to make my business. That's why I don't go back to Haiti.'Moise saved money for years and recently opened a restaurant. She is one of the thousands of Haitian migrants building a life in Springfield who now find themselves in the crosshairs of the incoming Trump administration. Moise saved money for years and recently opened a restaurant. She is one of the thousands of Haitian migrants building a life in Springfield who now find themselves in the crosshairs of the incoming Trump administration. Moise, like most fellow Haitians in Springfield, is here legally through Temporary Protected Status, which Trump has vowed to end. The TPS program allows federal officials to grant deportation relief and work authorization to migrants from countries beset by war, environmental disaster or another 'extraordinary' crisis. Is CBS News in favor of the president circumventing Congress and the courts? Do they believe the ""temporary"" in ""Temporary Protected Status"" actually means ""forever""? Is Moise actually at risk of being deported, considering that Trump has repeatedly said he wants hard-working immigrants to continue to come to America, just not illegally? Moise says she knows about 10 friends and neighbors who have recently left Springfield, along with several restaurant employees.  Trump's not even in office yet and Springfield is already seeing relief! Here's where some people will accuse me of being mean and uncharitable.No. What I'm doing is pointing out how CBS News is trying to manipulate you with emotions, and jarring you out of the propaganda takes a bit of brute force.A recent YouGov survey of Americans found that 73% approve of mass deportation and 57% agree with deporting ALL illegal aliens.As the writer of this particular article, I've personally resettled refugees. I've worked on multi-million-dollar grants to assist in war-torn nations overseas. My church sponsors a village in Haiti!Are we evil and mean ... or might we be operating on compassion for our neighbors who have been drastically affected by importing the entire world into their neighborhoods?A truly compassionate person might say we should find a path that leads to good outcomes for both our neighbor and the refugee.Faith is fueling Moise's motivation to remain in Springfield and run her restaurant, while her business and her future hang in the balance.'We're hoping that everything works out the way it's supposed to work out,' she said. 'God has a way of working everything out.'Amen to that.No thanks to the activists at CBS News!

This is Ryan Borgwardt, a 45-year-old man from Watertown, Wisconsin. You might remember him from this story we published a few weeks back:  This adventure began on August 12th when Ryan vanished while kayaking in Green Lake, Wisconsin. Authorities searched for 54 days, spending nearly $40,000 in the process, assuming he'd drowned in the lake. But it turns out that Ryan wasn't at the bottom of the lake! He was basically living out a weird Eastern European spy thriller fantasy in Europe. ""Great news, we know that he's alive and well,"" said Green Lake County Sheriff Mark Podoll in a press conference. ""And, well, the bad news is that we don't know where Ryan exactly is, and he has not decided to return home."" Ryan has been in touch with investigators via email and even sent a video to prove he's alive. In the clip, he casually says, ""I'm in my apartment. I am safe, secure.""  The case was cracked back in early October, with investigators discovering that he had staged his August kayak flipping, paddled to shore in what was described as a child-size inflatable boat, and hopped on an e-bike to a bus station. From there, it was Detroit to Canada to a plane bound for Europe. And all this while syncing his laptop to the cloud, replacing his hard-drive and scrubbing his search history. What are the chances ""how do you fake your death"" was a recent search? Then there's the $375,000 life insurance policy he conveniently took out in January, the foreign bank account, and the airline cards. Oh, and a mysterious woman in Uzbekistan.  Now, police are trying to persuade Ryan to return home to his devastated family. ""Christmas is coming, and what better gift he could give his kids is to be there for Christmas with them,"" Podell said. Because nothing says holiday cheer like Dad flying home after faking his death and fleeing the country for a months-long bender in Uzbekistan.  Follow Ian on Substack or X (@ighaworth).

CBS News and YouGov polling shows that the American people, despite media hysterics, have a generally positive view of the future in Trump's America and are supportive of his agenda. What's somewhat surprising, however, is how many Americans want the deportations to begin, quickly.  That's about 3 out of 4 Americans who want Donald Trump to start the mass deportation program soon.  45% think it's a high priority, 28% say medium priority which = 73% say it's a priority.  Now, of course, you have to dig for this number. Here's how CBS covered this polling subject in their writeup.  Even this has to be mind-blowing for CBS, because that's a majority of Americans who think Trump needs to start rounding up ALL illegal immigrants for deportation. Never mind the 3/4 of the country who want to make deportation a priority. One thing that is clear, however, is that Americans say they'd be fine with deportations ... unless the military gets involved.  (Because American soldiers are supposed to be used for fighting pointless wars overseas, not protecting the homeland!)  These reflect the numbers now, before deportations start. When CBS and the news mafia start running photos of crying border crossers being put into vans, expect these numbers to drop quickly. Additionally, the poll found 55% of Americans are happy or satisfied with Trump's victory, 59% are happy with Trump's transition efforts so far, and 52% support Trump's tariff plans.

Jeffrey Arthur Moynihan Jr., 56, of Florida, tricked an elderly Texas woman into believing she'd befriended Elon Musk on Facebook and then he stole at least $250,000 from her by tricking her into investing in his business. His business, she would later find out, was scamming her out of hundreds of thousands of dollars. A Florida man has been arrested after impersonating tech billionaire Elon Musk in a bid to scam an elderly woman out of at least a quarter of a million dollars, according to police …While reportedly operating under the guise of the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, the 56-year-old businessman befriended the victim, a 74-year-old Texas resident, on Facebook and began messaging her in 2023.The victim was allegedly promised a $55 million return on investment.

The victim was allegedly promised a $55 million return on investment. ""Elon"" began messaging her on Facebook in 2023, and built rapport with the elderly woman by giving her regular updates on how Elon was doing. Moynihan used up-to-date news on the real Elon Musk to formulate these updates. Eventually, he reached out to the elderly woman offering her an investment in his business. Records obtained by authorities show the victim transferred $250,000 to accounts belonging to Moynihan and his own business, Jeff's Painting and Pressure Washing LLC. Yeah, I'm thinking Elon Musk doesn't spend his time on painting and pressure washing. Though I could be wrong. The woman's husband claims she sent the man $600,000, though there's no telling where the rest of that money went if it was, in fact, part of the scam. Here's how authorities caught wind of this: Detective Jim Curulla of the Bradenton police was tipped off by authorities in Frisco, Texas, who were investigating an incident in which a woman had reportedly given a large sum of money away to an entity posing as the tech billionaire, according to a department spokesperson.Nearly half of that money could be traced back to banks in Bradenton, and the accounts were determined to belong to Moynihan, the spokesperson continued.

Normally, if a male police officer were to conduct a strip-search of a female suspect, it would be considered sexual assault. Authorised in September by the assistant chief constable for network policing, it reads: 'British Transport Police recognises the status of transgender and non-binary detainees/staff from the moment they permanently identify in that gender with or without a GRC. (It would be fun to join the British police for the sole purpose of identifying as something different every hour, just to clown them)  'This means that even when a person has not legally changed their sex, we should continue to use the correct pronouns and recognise the person's gender. BTP officers/staff will only search persons of the same sex as either their birth certificate or GRC.' The Transport Police tried to implement the new guidance back in January, but were stopped by the conservative government of Rishi Sunak. However, in July the far-left Labour Party took control, and this is what the British people have won for voting in the side that systemically hates women. Here he was a decade or so ago:  Then he was featured in a puff piece to try to normalize allowing men with mental illnesses and fetishes to police their communities:  And then he was celebrated for ""blazing a trail"":  And now he's speaking in a weird voice with crazy eyes:  Cathy Larkman, retired police superintendent and national policing lead for the Women's Rights Network, said, She said: 'British Transport Police think that the possession of a GRC conveys some sort of right for a male officer to strip-search a woman, or for a female officer to be pressurised into searching a male detainee.'Their eagerness to bring this in despite the clear warnings made indicates that they have forgotten about women's rights, or at best that these can be dispensed with. But women have human rights too.'It is appalling that police chiefs are so intent on disregarding the law and shocking that it is left to women to hold them to account and to remind them that not so long ago, they promised to rebuild women's trust. Those were hollow words.'This is state-sanctioned sexual assault and police chiefs have lost their mind bringing this in. They have failed women, it is absolutely unforgivable. It cannot go on.'

	Four injured All-Stars are all expected to return to the court this week.","Injuries: They’re not fun! For the first month or so of the season, fans have lamented that some of the biggest stars in the league have missed time due to knocks they suffered this season. Fortunately, we haven’t seen too many long-term injuries that are set to cost guys extended periods of time, and this week, a handful of former All-Star selections who have spent time on the sidelines are slated to return to action. Arguably the biggest beneficiaries of this are the Phoenix Suns, which have spent the last seven games without Kevin Durant due to a calf strain and have looked awful with him sidelined. Over the last five games, Phoenix has also dealt with the absence of Bradley Beal due to his own calf strain. Fortunately for the Suns, both are expected to be back for Tuesday’s NBA Cup game against the Los Angeles Lakers, according to Shams Charania of ESPN. The Memphis Grizzlies, meanwhile, have seemingly been in a state of injury crisis for the last year, with Ja Morant getting caught up in that. After only appearing in nine games last year due to a suspension and a shoulder injury that he suffered in practice, Morant has only played in eight games this year due to a hip injury, but that is going to change on Monday night, according to Chris Haynes. Morant, who has not played since Nov. 6, is in line to return for the Grizzlies’ game against the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday night. In a good bit of news for the New Orleans Pelicans, Haynes also reported that their high-profile offseason acquisition, Dejounte Murray, is slated to return to action after suffering a hand fracture in the team’s season opener — although he won’t play in Monday’s game against the Toronto Raptors, Murray is expected to return on Wednesday against the Indiana Pacers. The team traded for Murray in a deal with the Atlanta Hawks, but he’s only been able to give them 30 minutes this year due to his injury, which is part of the reason why New Orleans is off to a Western Conference-worst 4-13 start to the year."

	Porzingis has not played this season after suffering a foot injury during the 2024 NBA Finals.","The Boston Celtics have been on a role to start this season, as the team is 14-3 at this early juncture, sits in second place in the Eastern Conference behind the scorching hot Cleveland Cavaliers (who Boston has already beaten this year), and looks to be in as good of a position to defend a championship as any team in recent memory. All of this has happened without the services of Kristaps Porzingis, who has not played this season after suffering a foot injury during the NBA Finals that required surgery. Fortunately for the Celtics, their time without Porzingis on the floor is about to come to an end. According to Shams Charania of ESPN, Boston is going to get Porzingis back during Monday night’s game against the Los Angeles Clippers. “Porzingis has been making rapid improvements in his recovery from foot surgery in late June, completing scrimmages in recent weeks of practices with the Celtics and their NBA G League affiliate, Maine,” Charania wrote. Porzingis joined the Celtics via a trade with the Washington Wizards last offseason and immediately became a perfect fit for how Joe Mazzulla wants to use his centers. His three point shooting and ability to protect the rim were invaluable when he was able to play, but a calf injury limited him to only seven games in the team’s run to a championship last year. Not long after his return in the NBA Finals, the Celtics announced that Porzingis suffered a torn medial retinaculum allowing dislocation of the posterior tibialis tendon in his left leg during Game 2, which the team deemed a “rare injury.” He was able to play 16 minutes in their Game 5 win that sealed a championship, but needed offseason surgery."

	The Cowboys led 20-9 with just over three minutes to play and ended up with a 34-26 win thanks to the dumbest finish to a game this year.","The Commanders and Cowboys played in. one of the funniest games in the NFL this season, as the two divisional rivals went back and forth with each team being on the wrong end of some massive blunders in what ended up a 34-26 Cowboys win.  The final three minutes was particularly insane, as it saw the game go from 20-9 Dallas to 34-26 with a truly outrageous sequence of events. The first was a touchdown from Jayden Daniels to Zach Ertz, with Daniels running in the two-point try to make it 20-17. On the ensuing kickoff, Kavontae Turpin let the ball bounce in front of him and had it roll past him for a near-disaster, before turning it into a touchdown return with a quick spin move and outrageous speed, making it 27-17.   A post shared by NFL (@nfl)  The Commanders would then kick a field goal with just under two minutes to play to make it 27-20. A failed onside kick figured to be about the end of things, but it was truly just the beginning. Washington’s defense got the three-and-out needed to give their offense a chance at a miracle, and Daniels delivered for the second time this season as Dallas’ defense melted down, allowing Terry McLaurin to catch the ball and evade everyone on his way for an 87-yard touchdown. However, Austin Seibert had already missed an extra point earlier in the game, so it was anything but a guarantee they would tie the game, and sure enough a bad snap led to a rushed operation and Seibert hooked another left of the uprights to keep it a 1-point game (videos below).   A post shared by NFL (@nfl)  On the ensuing onside kick, the Cowboys scooped it up and ran it back for a touchdown, which was the one thing that could keep the Commanders hopes alive, as they would get the ball back with time on the clock and a chance at another Hail Mary. Alas, this time Daniels’ efforts at a miracle ended up being caught by Dallas and the game finally ended with a Cowboys win that became far more difficult than it ever needed to be."

	Fred VanVleet did not like getting ejected and definitely earned a fine with how he went out at the end of Blazers-Rockets.","The Houston Rockets have had a phenomenal start to the 2024-25 season, entering Saturday’s game against Portland at 12-5 on the young season, but things did not go as planned against the scrappy, young Blazers in a 104-98 loss.  The frustrations of that loss were evident late in the fourth quarter when Fred VanVleet got ejected after getting into it with the officials, telling them all that they suck, but then took things a step further after getting run by walking directly to the official that tossed him, pointing in his face, and telling him “you’re a b*tch.”  pic.twitter.com/wtHPtHgSMc — Diamond Scar (@diamondscar22) November 24, 2024  From the TV angle, it wasn’t clear if VanVleet made contact with the official’s face, which was of concern to the Rockets broadcast crew as that would’ve been an auto-suspension. However, a side angle showed that he did not make contact, but did still point his finger right in the ref’s face in a moment that wasn’t exactly his finest. This will definitely lead to VanVleet paying a hefty fine to the league office, and we’ll have to wait and see if, even without actually poking the ref, this crossed enough of a line to earn him a night off without pay. VanVleet is averaging 14.9 points and 6.2 assists per game this season for Houston."

	The Warriors tend to have very good seasons when Kendrick Lamar puts out an album.","Kendrick Lamar stunned everyone on Friday afternoon. There had been hopes for months that a new album was on the way following his high-profile feud with Drake, and it looked like we were going to get another sign that something big was on the horizon when he released the music video for “GNX.” And then, Kendrick took things a step further by just releasing his sixth studio album, which is also titled “GNX.” Because it is an album that Kendrick Lamar released out of nowhere, people went from being stunned to praising the project. And it’s possible that no one ends up being happier about this than the Golden State Warriors. Why, you may ask? Well, as it turns out, good things tend to happen to the Warriors — which entered Friday night’s game against the New Orleans Pelicans with an 11-3 record, good for first place in the Western Conference — when Kendrick puts out an album. Each of the last four times that has happened, the team has gone on to win an NBA championship, with To Pimp a Butterfly coming out in March 2015, Damn. getting released in April 2017, and Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers dropping in April 2022. There was also the soundtrack to Black Panther, which came out in February 2018 and featured songs that were either performed or curated by Kendrick. As for his other two studio albums, Section.80 and good kid, m.A.A.d city, the former came out a few weeks after they drafted Klay Thompson, and the latter was released in Oct. 2012, one week before the start of the 2012-13 NBA season, which marked the first time that Golden State made it to the postseason with Steph Curry on the team. Now, the overwhelming likelihood is that this is a bunch of insane coincidences, but if the Warriors do end up winning a championship, we’re going to think something weird is going on … and Kendrick will probably be a little bummed, as he’s a well-documented fan of the Los Angeles Lakers, which are currently the 4-seed in the West and find themselves 1.5 games back of Golden State."

	Jones, the No. 6 overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, was benched by the Giants earlier this week.","The New York Giants made the decision to bench starting quarterback Daniel Jones earlier this week amid a brutal year where the offense has struggled to find any sort of consistent rhythm. Now, in a shocking turn of events, the team announced on Friday afternoon that the sixth overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft asked for and was granted his immediate release. In a statement, which you can read in its entirely below, Giants president John Mara praised Jones for his handling of his benching, and made clear that parting ways was a mutual decision. Daniel came to see me this morning and asked if we would release him. We mutually agreed that would be the best for him and for the team.  Daniel has been a great representative of our organization, first class in every way. His handling of this situation yesterday exemplifies just that. We are all disappointed in how things have worked out.  We hold Daniel in high regard and have a great appreciation for him. We wish him nothing but the best in the future. Jones has had a tumultuous tenure in New York, as the decision to draft him that high was largely based on his perceived upside. While he’s certainly flashed the ability to be an accurate passer and a threat with his legs — so much so that the team gave him a $160 million extension in 2023 that was cited as a reason why they could not bring back Saquon Barkley in free agency this offseason — he’s never been able to become the face of the franchise the team envisioned. The Giants sit at 2-8 on the season, and are playing host to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday afternoon. The team has already announced that Tommy DeVito will start under center. To add some intrigue to this, the Giants face the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving this year. Dallas has had its own QB struggles this season as Dak Prescott is out for the year with the injury, and if they wanted, it would make sense to bring in Jones and try to get him up to speed ahead of Thursday."

	Miller made one of the best defensive plays you will ever see to stop an alley-oop by the Pistons.","The Charlotte Hornets and the Detroit Pistons squared off on Thursday night in a battle of two up-and-coming teams that hope to take a step forward in the Eastern Conference this season. While neither of them are expected to compete for a championship or anything, both are built around promising young players and hope that better days are on the horizon. One of the brightest young stars in Thursday’s game was Brandon Miller, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft who flashed as a rookie and has built on that in a big way during his second year in the league. Unfortunately for the Pistons, that meant finding out that Miller is a freak of nature, as evidenced by him making one of the best defensive plays you will ever see when he single-handedly blew up an attempted alley-oop by picking a Wendell Moore lob out of mid-air.  A post shared by NBA (@nba)  If Miller became horizontal during this, it’d look an awful lot like Odell Beckham Jr.’s famous one-handed catch from when he played for the Giants. Anyway, the Hornets won in overtime, 123-121, with Miller leading the way, as the former Alabama standout went for 38 points, seven rebounds, four assists, four steals, and a block in 42 minutes of work."

	Gobert got a 3-second call as he pouted over not getting the ball late in a tie game, and Anthony Edwards was not happy.","The Minnesota Timberwolves were one of the best teams and stories of the 2023-24 season, as Anthony Edwards made the leap into superstardom, Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert figured out how to play off of each other around him, and they made a run to the Western Conference Finals.  The vibes in Minnesota were, as they say, immaculate, but then a week before training camp they traded Towns to New York for Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo in a trade that has seen both the Knicks and Wolves struggling to build chemistry early in the season. Both teams are still hovering around .500, but the Knicks can get away with that in the East and still have a good look at a top-4 seed. In the West things are very different, as the Wolves came into Thursday’s game in Toronto with a tenuous hold on sixth at 8-6, needing a win to avoid dropping to a tie for 10th early this season.  In theory, the 3-12 Raptors should’ve been a good spot to get a win for the Wolves, but Minnesota found themselves in a dogfight with Toronto (on their incredible alternate court) late in the fourth quarter. With the game tied at 95-95 and five minutes to play, the Wolves chemistry issues became apparent when Randle waved off Gobert who had deep post position under the hoop, and the 4-time DPOY responded by walking to the other side of the lane to get a 3-second violation.   A post shared by LeagueAlerts Inc. (@leaguealerts)  While Gobert’s frustration is understandable, as he had two feet in the restricted area with a seal on a smaller defender and didn’t get the ball, you also can’t purposefully get a turnover in a tie game in the fourth quarter. That was what Anthony Edwards was thinking, as he got on Gobert as they came down the floor, letting him know that’s not an acceptable reaction to not getting the ball. That turnover proved to be important as the Wolves saw the Raptors pull away late for a 110-105 win, dropping Minnesota to 8-7 and a tie for 10th in the West with Dallas and Sacramento."

	To celebrate Hubie Brown calling it a career, we looked back on how old he was during major events that happened in his lifetime.","Basketball fans are going to see broadcasts get a little worse sooner rather than later. That’s because Hubie Brown, the legendary former coach who has turned into a stalwart on ESPN’s coverage of the league, will only call one more game before he retires at 91 years old. “We are going to give Hubie one last shot on a game,” ESPN president Burke Magnus told Jimmy Traina of Sports Illustrated. “He deserves that. We think the world of him. I think it is absolutely remarkable the level in which he still calls games at age 90-plus. I don’t mean to be purposely mysterious here but we are going to honor Hubie during the regular season at some point to be determined and send him off in style.” That he is still capable of working at 91 is remarkable, but Brown is still sharp as a tack and as good as it gets calling basketball games, and while no one has deserved retirement more, it’s always a tough day when someone as highly-regarded as him calls it a career. There is, still, no one better at seeing something, pointing it out, and explaining why it’s a big deal than Brown, and he has terrific chemistry with his broadcast partners. We’re all going to miss Hubie, and to celebrate the end of his time in the booth, we wanted to celebrate him by having some fun and looking at everything he’s seen over his extraordinary life. You see, Hubie was born on Sept. 25, 1933, which means he has been around for, quite literally, every single game that the NBA has played — the league was founded in June of 1946, when he was 12 years old. That got us wondering: How old was he during some of the biggest moments in world, American, and NBA history over the last century or so? Let’s dive in. Start of WWII: 5 years old (Sept. 1, 1939)
End of WWII: 11 years old (Sept. 2, 1945)
The first NBA game: 13 years old (Nov. 1, 1946)
Jackie Robinson breaks baseball’s color barrier: 13 years old (April 15, 1947)
The first NBA Draft: 16 years old (April 25, 1950) Bill Russell plays in his first NBA game: 23 years old (Dec. 22, 1956)
Wilt Chamberlain plays in his first NBA game: 26 years old (Oct. 24, 1959)
John F. Kennedy Assassination: 30 years old (Nov. 22, 1963)
Super Bowl I: 34 years old (Jan. 15, 1967)
First moon landing: 36 years old (July 20, 1969) End of the Vietnam War: 41 years old (April 30, 1975)
Hubie Brown’s first game as an NBA head coach with the Atlanta Hawks: 42 years old (Oct. 21, 1976)
The first time Larry Bird and Magic Johnson played in the NBA Finals: 51 years old (May 27, 1984)
First NBA Draft Lottery: 52 years old (May 12, 1985)
End of the Cold War: 56 years old (Dec. 3, 1989)
Michael Jordan retires for the first time: 60 years old (Oct. 26, 1993) 9/11: 67 years old (Sept. 11, 2001)

LeBron James plays in his first NBA game: 70 years old (Oct. 29, 2003)
Hubie Brown coaches his final game before resigning from the Memphis Grizzlies: 71 years old (Nov. 25, 2004)

	ESPN content president Burke Magnus explained that the network's biggest star ending up on its newest property is a bit tricky.","ESPN has about a year to figure out how it’s going to handle Inside the NBA. As part of Warner Bros. Discovery’s deal to remain in the NBA’s media ecosystem, it was announced that Turner will continue to produce Inside, but license it out to ESPN, which solves the network’s longstanding issues trying to put together a pregame, halftime, and postgame NBA show that viewers enjoy. An unsurprising question that popped up after this was whether Stephen A. Smith — who is in the middle of some high-profile contract negotiations with ESPN — would find a way onto the show. Smith is the guy ESPN has built its NBA coverage around, and while that has come under plenty of criticism, he’s famously close with the Inside crew and has appeared on it in the past. But apparently, as of now, the network doesn’t have any intetion of putting Stephen A. on their newest property. “We have no plans to do that,” ESPN content president Burke Magnus told Jimmy Traina of Sports Illustrated. “And that’s because, frankly, the construct of the deal really doesn’t — that’s not how it was conceived. What is conceived is that Turner, as they have always done with this show, with this cast, with the people involved behind the scenes, are going to continue to do what they’ve always done. And we’re going to distribute it on the ESPN platform. Frankly, that’s exactly what we want. We don’t want to change it. We don’t want to interject new talent into it. We don’t want to really do anything to it.” It is worth mentioning that the scuttlebutt around Smith’s contract negotiations revolves around him wanting to do more NFL stuff for ESPN, but considering how big Inside is and his relationship with the guys, it is fair to wonder if he’d want to have any sort of presence on the show as part of a new deal (if, of course, he comes to terms with the network on one). For now, the complexities of the deal with Turner gives ESPN a way to say they have no plans of putting him on Inside in any capacity, but we’ll certainly be waiting to see if that changes as Smith and ESPN sit down at the negotiating table.

	Come get these winners.","In many circles, Week 11 has been described as the best slate of games so far when it comes to the 2024 NFL season, and it is hard to argue. There was entertaining action in every window other than Monday night and, on a week-to-week basis, that is not always the case. In this space, we also found success with a third winning week in the last four. Granted, it came with a hilarious investment in a team that lost by approximately 100, but a loss counts the same by a half-point or 30 points, right? Before we get to the Week 12 schedule and five picks against the spread, let’s take a look at the (unfortunately negative) season-long progress. Come get these winners. We struck with our principles last Thursday to success, and we’re doing it again here. It is unsightly to bet on Cleveland right now, and I won’t argue that. The Browns are 2-8 and having a season from hell. With that said, the market is too high on the Steelers in this spot. Pittsburgh continues to be unreal in an underdog role under Mike Tomlin, but the Steelers are 33-41-3 (44.6%) as a road favorite under his watch. Do I think the games from 2008 impact this week? I do not, but I can’t get this to more than a field goal on a short week in Cleveland. Let’s go Browns. This is a space that prides itself on taking the stands that few others will take. This is another example. The Lions are dominating everyone. We found that out the hard way last week. But this is really a 7.5-point number on the road? Detroit’s ATS record (8-2) is stellar but things have gone too far. Or maybe we’ll lose this bet and swear off fading the Lions for a while. Either way, I like the home dog here. Our Wong teaser of the week is here. Tennessee’s defense has been spunky this season, but the Titans still have Will Levis and a rudderless offense that gives us hope in the Texans at home with the move through key numbers. On the other side, I’ve actually been a touch low on the 49ers compared to the market this season and, while that has been the right stance on the whole, this is a principle play to take it up to 8.5. Remember when the 12th Man meant something? Well, the Seahawks are 2-4 at home this season, and the word is out on that. While I am not suggesting that home-field advantage is the reason for this play, I like Seattle to keep it going after a strong performance in an upset over San Francisco a week ago. Arizona is off a bye and on a four-game winning streak but, no matter what I do, I can’t get this to a pick’em, much less than +1 available at BetMGM right now. I don’t give out many road favorites, but I tend to make exceptions for when the Chargers are the home team. Granted, a lot has changed in Los Angeles, with Jim Harbaugh immediately turning the Chargers into a very competent and effective outfit. However, the Chargers still might have the least significant home-field advantage in the NFL, and Baltimore is at least slightly undervalued here coming off a loss to Pittsburgh."

	Charles Barkley wasn't gonna let the night go by without making a joke about their upcoming move to ESPN next fall.","Over the weekend, some exciting news broke regarding the future of Inside the NBA, as ESPN is adding the beloved studio show as part of a new licensing agreement with Warner Bros. Discovery. The show will continue to be produced independently by TNT Sports from their Atlanta studio, with Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, Shaquille O’Neal, and Charles Barkley remaining employees of WBD — well, so long as they get Shaq’s contract done — but they’ll be part of ESPN and ABC’s coverage of the Playoffs, Finals, and major regular season games. That was stunning news to many fans, largely because ESPN has been trying to figure out how to create a competitor to Inside for decades to no avail, and the fellas have never been afraid of making fun of ESPN — particularly Barkley. Chuck has taken ESPN and their analysts to tasks a number of times over the years, and while I doubt that stops in total, he knows times are changing soon for he and the rest of the fellas. On Tuesday night, after the Spurs beat the Thunder in the late game on TNT, Chuck couldn’t help but crack a joke to Kenny Smith that they’ve gotta “go back to kissing ass” ahead of their move to ESPN next fall.  No one has been more outspoken over the last six months about the contract negotiations with the NBA than Barkley, sometimes to the chagrin of his colleagues. He’s been extremely vocal about his frustrations with TNT not keeping NBA rights and has noted his biggest concern is trying to figure out how to keep everyone at TNT employed. That mission seems to have been accomplished with this latest news of the show being licensed to ESPN, and he showed still going to be Chuck and poke fun at the new arrangement."

	Another case of Vince Staples, being Vince Staples.","Vince Staples isn’t afraid to voice his opinion regarding anything and anyone. No one is exempt from the “Little Homies” rapper’s blunt takes—not fellow musicians, fans, or content creators. Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum is the latest person to feel his humorous wrath. Today (November 19), Vince Staples and Jayson Tatum came face-to-face in a new commercial for the Jordan brand (viewable here). Instead of using his beloved lyricism on full display, Vince channelled his words for another reason. As highlights of Tatum’s Championship season took over the screen, Vince gave Tatum a piece of his mind. “What type of dude is Jayson Tatum,” asked Vince. “The type of dude who’d crush a team and then say some cold sh*t like, ‘We just played our game and the rest took care of itself.'” As Vince pointed out, Tatum is a many of few words but when he does speak out against his opponents it cuts deeps. However, Tatum manages to keep a cool head or so Vince argued, saying: “The type that have a whole city and internet, booing him. And he’s just smiling.” Before the clip ends, Vince has one more grievance to air as a long-suffering Los Angeles Clippers fan. “That sh*t really message me up, man,” he said.  Unfazed by it all, Tatum laughs off Vince’s monologue. In Tatum’s eyes, it doesn’t matter who hates him because his partner, singer Ella Mai and their child provides more than enough love to make up for it."

	After a loss dropped the Sixers to 2-11 on the year, the team held a players-only meeting where Maxey voiced a gripe about Embiid.","The Philadelphia 76ers have been the biggest disappointment in the NBA to start the 2024-25 season. While there have been injuries to Joel Embiid, Paul George, and Tyrese Maxey that have prevented them from taking the court as a trio, Philadelphia has gotten off to a 2-11 start this year, which is tied with the openly tanking Washington Wizards for the worst record in the NBA. For a team that entered this season with championship aspirations, it’s pretty shocking to see just how bad Philly has been. And following a 106-89 loss to the Miami Heat on Monday night where the team blew a 19-point lead, Kyle Lowry called for a players-only meeting, according to Shams Charania of ESPN. And per Charania, the meeting included Maxey confronting Embiid with a message that the former NBA MVP “accepted.” Via ESPN: In the meeting, Maxey challenged Embiid to be on time to team activities, calling out the former league MVP about being late “for everything” and how it impacts the locker room, from other players to the coaching staff, sources briefed on the meeting told ESPN. Maxey and Embiid have a close friendship and have a history of holding each other accountable, according to those around the team. Embiid was listed as doubtful to play against the Heat with an illness, but eventually took the floor and struggled, going for 11 points, eight rebounds, and five assists in 31 minutes of work on 5-for-11 shooting from the field. Maxey, meanwhile, was unable to play, as he’s working his way back from a hamstring strain he suffered earlier this season. Charania also noted that Sixers players addressed head coach Nick Nurse, saying that “they want to be coached harder, and coaches in turn said they want players to practice with purpose and attention to detail.”"

	Powerhouse Hobbs has a list of aspirations after spending seven months out with a knee injury.","Powerhouse Hobbs wasn’t sure how fans were going to receive his return. Recency bias is a real thing in the wrestling industry, and any extended absence comes with the reality that you’re out of sight and out of mind.  When he walked out of the tunnel to the roar of the live audience as Ricochet’s surprise partner just two weeks ago, any anxiety over what the reaction would look like evaporated. For Hobbs, it was like he’d never left.  “It was one of those things where it let me know how special this business is, how special the fans are,” Hobbs tells Uproxx Sports. “When it comes down to it, we do it for them. We do it for their entertainment. We do it for their reactions. We do it because we love it. We all love to go out and perform in front of them. But then when they go ahead and give you that love back, man, it makes you want to go even harder.” As smooth as he looked in his return to the ring, the prior seven months were anything but easy.  He ruptured his patella tendon in a main event match, going from the high of being prominently featured on television on Wednesday night to having surgery the following Monday. The next day, he flew across the country, and just a week later was back in the gym determined to return stronger.  “I probably had a few days to be in my feelings and soak everything in,” Hobbs says. “But my main objective was to come back better than when I left. This recovery, I would get up at five, eat, in the gym by six on one leg for two hours, come home, eat, then off to PT for three hours a day, Monday through Saturday.” There were moments Hobbs says he felt helpless. He couldn’t bend his knee at all. He remembers the emotions of asking his three-year-old daughter to help take his sock off, asking his son to help him stand, or making sure he had something to hold onto so he didn’t fall in the shower.  The experience, Hobbs says, humbled him. Small accomplishments compounded. A strong support system that included conversations with wrestling legends like Sting, Mark Henry, and Billy Gunn helped him prepare for the ups, downs, and evolving mindset in how he’d navigate his return.  In his time away, Hobbs focused on the things he could control and put extra effort on how he could elevate other areas of his game.  “I got a lot of promos just sitting on the couch watching wrestling. I was very angry, not being able to do what I want to do,” Hobbs says.  Practicing patience is something Hobbs has had to learn over his four years in AEW, and especially now in what’s essentially a fresh start. You can’t manufacture many of the special moments in wrestling — they’re going to happen organically, like the infamous Meat chants last year. “You’re going to hear the people tell you what they want,” Hobbs says, “so it’s on you to capitalize on it.” Hearing the crowd react to his return, and feeding off their energy over the past few weeks, should give him confidence that he’ll be able to be successful in his career refresh. He created a list of aspirations during his time away, including another singles championship reign.  There’s no order to how he goes about checking off his accomplishments, but admits the primary focus is a “longer, stronger reign.” His path to wearing championship gold again comes with confidence, believing in himself, and turning the volume up on his character.  Before his injury, Hobbs says there were discussions about how he could start bringing who he is in real life to his character. Now that he’s had time to sit and stew on the future, he’s ready to show the world who he is.  “I’m going to start bringing my life into my character, the things that I hate, the things that I love. I’m just gonna show everyone how much more intense I can be, how destructive I can be, how I don’t give a shit at times who’s in my way,” Hobbs says. “In the end, this business, there only can be one. It’s going to come to a point where I’m going to show everybody that it’s all about me. They’re either going to be with me or be against me. It doesn’t matter. They boo me, I’m just going to start tearing everything up in front of them.  “And I think that’s what wrestling is missing a little bit. That one guy who makes people afraid, but they want to see him kick someone’s ass. I feel that it’s time to bring it out.”"

	Jake Paul's boxing fit in his match against Mike Tyson was one of the most expensive in boxing history. Here is what he wore.","Over the weekend, social media sensation turned legit boxer Jake Paul faced off against the mighty (if aged) Mike Tyson, attracting the eyes of 60 million viewers for what was undoubtedly the fight of the year. The two fighters, aged 27 and 58 respectively, lasted the entire eight rounds, with Paul ultimately besting Iron Mike, crushing the hearts of pretty much everybody over the age of 30. But we’re not here to talk about the fight, we’re here to talk about Jake Paul’s fit, which Paul revealed on the “Talk Tuah” podcast was worth over $1 million. “This outfit that I’ve made for the fight is the most expensive fight outfit in the history of boxing,” said Paul. The fit was a custom piece designed by Dominic Ciambrone’s Surgeon Studios and featured metallic silver shorts with diamond tennis chains, and a graphic of Mr. Monopoly holding a money bag. The full outfit was completed with a jewel-encrusted gray jacket prominently featuring the logo of Paul’s new body care line W. It’s flashy, brash, and eye-catching, a perfect reflection of Paul’s whole vibe. Love him or hate him, you can’t deny that this fight helped to solidify Paul’s status as a pop culture icon of the 2020s, and despite Tyson’s advanced age, being able to go toe to toe with the GOAT and come out on top is no easy feat. This is also a big win for Ciambrone, who we’ve been keeping a close eye on since the days he was simply referred to as the Shoe Surgeon. Check out the fit in action below."

	Tyrese Haliburton took over the NBA Cup last year. Which young, up-and-coming player is most likely to do that this year?","Tyrese Haliburton entered last season in an interesting spot. Yes, everyone knew he was a really good, really talented basketball player — he even made it onto the 2023 All-Star team. And yet, Haliburton was mostly a guy who did some cool things on a not great Indiana Pacers team, which came on the heels of him doing some cool things as a rookie and a second-year player on a not great Sacramento Kings team. And then, last season happened. More specifically, the inaugural NBA Cup (known at the time as the In-Season Tournament) happened, and Haliburton was the driving force behind an upstart Pacers team that took it to everyone and made the championship game, where they fell to the Los Angeles Lakers. It was the exact sort of springboard to stardom that a cup competition should provide, as a young, up-and-coming team led by a young, up-and-coming star went on a run and nearly won the whole thing. Haliburton averaged 26.7 points, 13.3 assists, and 4.9 rebounds in seven tournament games, and while he cooled off a bit as the year went on due to lingering injury issues, he was still able to use his NBA Cup performance as a springboard to an All-NBA Third Team nod and an appearance in the Eastern Conference Finals. Now, with this season’s NBA Cup underway, it’s worth wondering which young star is going to use this edition of the tournament as a way to assert themselves as a superstar, and today, we wanted to look at some of the frontrunners to do just that on teams that have already gotten off to good starts in Cup play. The Rockets have been one of the best up-and-coming teams in the league so far this season, and while you can toss a few guys in as their answer (Jalen Green would be a good fit here, too), we’ll go with Sengun, who was great last year but was sidelined with an injury during their big run later in the calendar. Anyone who watches Houston knows that Sengun is good, but ever since they traded James Harden, the Rockets haven’t gotten a ton of attention. The NBA Cup is a chance to change that — they steamrolled the Clippers in their Group A opener last week — and if they can win their game in Minnesota next week, they’re going to be the overwhelming favorites to move out of their group. Add in that Houston has a net rating of +12.98 when Sengun is on the floor this season and while depth is one of their biggest strengths, we’re willing to bet that he’s the guy who will carry them to Cup wins if they come. Atlanta beating the Celtics in their NBA Cup opener was a shock, and they followed it up with a win over Washington in their second game. The craziest thing about the game against Boston: Trae Young didn’t play, as Daniels was a two-way menace (28 points, seven assists, six steals) and Johnson stuffed the stat sheet (18 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists, three steals, a block). Young is, obviously, the face in Atlanta, but on the heels of the Dejounte Murray trade, there’s space for someone to blossom into his star running mate. Daniels’ ability to just ruin opposing backcourts and Johnson’s ability to do anything Atlanta needs on a given night both fit well alongside him, and they’ll both have to be great if the Hawks go on a run. Things have been completely dire in Detroit for a while now, and as a result, Cunningham hasn’t lived up to his billing as a No. 1 overall pick. But things are starting to change — Detroit is 2-0 in Cup play, with Cunningham going for 21 points, nine assists, seven rebounds, and two blocks against the Heat before putting up a 21-point, 10-rebounds, 10-assist triple-double with five steals and a block against the Wizards. He has to cut down on his turnovers, but he’s spearheading the Pistons as they try to take a big step forward under JB Bickerstaff. So far, so good, and if Detroit goes on an improbable NBA Cup run, it’ll be because Cunningham took a big leap towards becoming the face of the franchise the Pistons have craved for years. The most likely option to go on a Haliburton-esque run. Orlando is 2-0 with wins over Charlotte and Philly, even though Paolo Banchero is out with a torn oblique. The ball has been in Wagner’s hands a lot as a result, and the decision has paid off in a big way. He’s starting to find his shot after he couldn’t hit anything last season, while he looks really comfortable as a scorer and a facilitator. The Magic being good without Banchero is only possible because of Wagner, and a trip to the knockout rounds of the NBA Cup is within reach — their game in New York on Dec. 3 looms large, and we cannot wait to see what Wagner does under the bright lights of Madison Square Garden. You might have heard this by now: The Cavs are the best team in basketball this year at 15-0, and they won their only NBA Cup game so far against Charlotte. All eyes are on Tuesday night’s trip to Boston to take on the defending champs, which is the exact sort of high-profile stage Cleveland could use to emphatically say they’re championship and NBA Cup contenders. A big reason for the success? Mobley, as the decision to bring Kenny Atkinson on board as head coach has led to him looking more comfortable on offense and his usual brilliant self on defense. He has to continue to do that if the Cavs are going to be championship contenders, and the NBA Cup is a great place for him to show that he’s taken a step forward in his fourth season. If you want, you can also make a case for Darius Garland here, who has been nothing short of spectacular this season and is showing why he’s one of the best young guards in the league. However, Garland has been an All-Star and Donovan Mitchell is a known commodity, so we’ll go with the young big man as the Cav most likely to turn heads.  The Thunder are in a tricky spot due to the injuries suffered by Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein, so it’s possible they are just not big enough to go on an NBA Cup run. If they can, though, our hunch is it’s because of Williams stepping up and being the perfect running mate alongside Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. He keeps getting better and better the more experience he gets under his belt, and so far this season, Williams has done that again, as he’s putting up career-best marks in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks per game. He won’t unseat Shai as the man in Oklahoma City any time soon, but the Thunder are the exact sort of team that can use the NBA Cup as a chance to announce their arrival to the rest of the league. Williams can do the same."

We pick up the HBCU Homecoming series with only a day left before Director of Bands Chancellor Mills gets to prove himself in his first year in the position with the help of more than 100 band members and his staff. “It’s all in the planning, first and foremost,” Mills said in preparation for the event. “We don’t want to throw anything together and just put it out there; it’s huge this year.” As Mills said, the planning is critical, as the pressure of the occasion couldn’t be any higher, with current students and alumni all expecting a great show. “This performance is just going to signify where this program is,” said Mills. “It’s going to dictate how we’re going to move for the next 3-5 years. It’s significant in terms of what we want to give back to our community.” Fortunately, the hard work pays off as the band comes out at halftime to give the crowd their best with renditions of hip-hop classics produced by Just Blaze, including Joe Budden’s “Pump it Up” and “What We Do” by Freeway, who appeared to perform the song in-person. “I’ve had my songs played at a million sporting events,” Blaze said of the performance. “This is just kind of a great add-on to that part of the legacy. It sounded amazing.” As Blaze says in the episode, the party was far from over after the performance. Check out additional footage from the band’s night performance and more to see how the performance was received."

	Apparently, Shaq is a little upset with things, although he would like to remain on the show.","Basketball fans got some pretty monumental news over the weekend. As part of the agreement that will keep Warner Bros. Discovery as one of the league’s broadcast partners during its upcoming media right deal, Turner Sports will continue to produce “Inside the NBA” but license the show out to ESPN, which will air it going forward. The deal officially got announced on Monday, and there are some pretty big questions that continue to hang over the agreement that ESPN and Turner will have to get sorted out between now and the start of the 2025-26 season. As it turns out, there’s one especially big one that hangs over the deal, as Jimmy Traina of Sports Illustrated reported that Shaquille O’Neal is out of a contract on July 1, 2025. And apparently, there’s a bit of tension on the Hall of Fame inductee’s side of things right now. While sources say Shaq wants to remain on the show, he’s frustrated that there has been congratulations and press releases hyping that Inside the NBA is remaining the same while he is currently not under contract to be with the company next season. As Traina noted, Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, and Charles Barkley all do other things for Turner, so their deals are different from Shaq’s, who exclusively does NBA work for the network. It goes without saying, but Inside without Shaq would not feel the same, although we’re optimistic that Draymond Green joining the show whenever his playing career ends would be a good fill-in for him. Still, whether it’s agreeing to another deal with Turner or working something out with ESPN, here’s hoping that Shaq is at the desk with the rest of the guys when Inside airs on the Worldwide Leader for the first time."

	There's no word on whether the league will have a high-profile halftime show for its other Christmas game.","The NFL has started to have a larger and larger presence on Christmas Day over the years. This season, the league will put a pair of marquee games on Dec. 25, as the Kansas City Chiefs will travel to Pittsburgh to Take on the Steelers in the 1 p.m window, while the Houston Texans will play host to the Baltimore Ravens at 4:30 p.m. ET. Late on Sunday night, the NFL decided to announce that it has something special up its sleeve for the late afternoon game, as it was revealed that Beyonce will perform at halftime in her hometown.  A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce)  There’s no word on whether the league has a similarly huge name lined up for the early game, but lining up Beyonce — who headlined the Super Bowl halftime show back in 2013 — for a performance during a showcase game like this makes a ton of sense. Of course, there is a potential problem that will be monitored throughout the Christmas Day schedule, as the games will be aired on Netflix, which just struggled mightily with its broadcast of the boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul. Adding Beyonce to what will already be a highly-anticipated NFL game should only bring more eyeballs onto the platform, and there’s going to be a whole lot of interest in whether or not Netflix will be able to keep up with the demand."

The ping-pong balls fell in favor of the Wings, who will get the opportunity to select Bueckers first overall next spring and figure to create one of the WNBA’s most exciting backcourts immediately with Bueckers joining established Wings star Arike Ogunbowale in Dallas. For the second straight year, the Sparks will hold the No. 2 overall pick and the Sky will pick at No. 3, while the Mystics will have the fourth pick. The fifth pick will go to the expansion Golden State Valkyries, followed by the playoff teams from a year ago — aside from the Aces, who forfeited their draft pick as part of a league punishment.

	Jon Jones successfully defended his UFC Heavyweight championship at UFC 309 in New York.","Jon Jones (28-1) knocked out Stipe Miocic (20-5) in the third round to retain the heavyweight championship at UFC 309 from Madison Square Garden in New York.  Jones opened with a couple shots up top, a leg kick, and eventually a takedown. On top, Jones worked the ground and pound, refusing to give Miocic any room on the ground in a dominant first round — but while it looked like Jones could have ended it early, Miocic was able to hang on. Miocic opened the second round with a more measured approach, waiting for his own opportunities to attack without being taken down. The former heavyweight champion was relatively flat-footed before opening a more active approach in the third, but as Miocic moved, it was Jones who picked apart Miocic.  Jones hurt Miocic with a big right hand midway through the round, but kept the champ at bay with a combination of his own. Jones hurt Miocic with a spinning back kick to the body, then finished him off with lefts and rights on the ground before the referee stoppage.  Jones’ return to the UFC on Saturday was just his second bout in the heavyweight division. He hadn’t fought since last year, claiming the UFC Heavyweight belt in his debut in the heavyweight division against Ciryl Gane. Jones is arguably the greatest fighter in UFC history, but his background is riddled in controversy amid two victories over another greatest of all-time contender, Daniel Cormier. Miocic hadn’t fought since 2021, when he suffered a second-round knockout at the hands of Francis Ngannou.  Jones as the winner has an interesting path forward. On one hand, the interim champ, Tom Aspinall, is waiting in the wings and ready to prove himself against an all-time great. On the other hand, Alex Pereira seems prepped to climb to the heavyweight division, making possibly two weight jumps in three year as the former middleweight and current light heavyweight champion. Jones hasn’t seemed as interested in Aspinall recently, but opened the door to that fight after the win.  After his loss, Miocic retired from the UFC."

	Chuck, Shaq, Kenny, and Ernie will continue covering NBA games in 2025, as ESPN will license the show from TNT starting next year.","When TNT Sports lost the rights to the NBA this summer, with the league opting for a three-network deal with ESPN, NBC, and Amazon, the biggest question from fans was what would the future look like for ‘Inside the NBA’. After initially sounding as though it would end after this season, TNT was able to get Charles Barkley to agree to stick around for the remainder of his contract, with plans to continue the show in some capacity.  Now, we know what that will be, and instead of TNT airing the fellas talking about various sports (as was rumored at one point), they will continue to cover the NBA as part of ESPN’s NBA coverage in a unique licensing deal between Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery. According to the Wall Street Journal and Andrew Marchand of The Athletic, the deal will see TNT Sports continue producing the show, but it will air on ESPN.  Separately, Warner Bros. Discovery struck a deal with Disney to license the TNT show “Inside the NBA” to ESPN and ABC starting next season, according to the people familiar with the matter. The show, which features the former players Charles Barkley and Shaquille O’Neal, has an enthusiastic and large following. The show will air throughout the course of the season. This all happens alongside a larger settlement between the NBA and WBD, with Bleacher Report and House of Highlights maintaining rights to NBA videos. That is all excellent news for those at TNT Sports and those outlets, and sources inside TNT Sports tell Dime that they are “considering it a best case scenario” after losing NBA game broadcasts. [UPDATE: This post previously stated WBD would continue operating NBA TV and the league’s digital platforms, as was reported by the WSJ, but that was incorrect. NBA Digital and WBD will continue their current relationship but will not be operated by WBD (as is the current structure), while NBA TV will not be operated by WBD in the future.] For NBA fans the biggest news is that Charles Barkley, Shaquille O’Neal, Kenny Smith, and Ernie Johnson will still be on our televisions — one would assume from Studio J in Atlanta still if TNT is producing it — each week during the NBA season. One would expect they’ll move from their Thursday slot to Wednesday for ESPN’s biggest night of games — as the other options are Friday and Sunday and I have a hard time imagining them moving to either of those. The move allows the best show to continue without any changes to talent in front of or behind the camera, which is particularly important, and one would think if ESPN is adding the show they will understand what makes it so good and give it the kind of space and time it deserves, rather than what they currently do with their studio offering. It remains to be seen what happens with NBA Countdown, as they’ll still need to have something for those Friday and Sunday games, but may shake up their main crew with the Inside fellas becoming their A-crew and Finals team."

	The NBA has big plans for how it wants to build on 2024's shooting competition between Steph Curry and Sabrina Ionescu.","The NBA struck gold at All-Star weekend in 2024. While the game itself was bad enough that the league is considering a major shake-up in its format and the Dunk Contest was a dud, a shooting contest between Steph Curry and Sabrina Ionescu injected a whole lot of excitement into the festivities on Saturday night — Curry was able to win, but it was awfully close. With the 2025 edition of the All-Star Game taking place in the Chase Center, it would make a ton of sense for the league to run back a Steph vs. Sabrina shootout. According to Shams Charania of ESPN, that is, indeed in the works, but there’s a catch: They may not be the only NBA and WNBA players involved. Curry and WNBA star Sabrina Ionescu of the New York Liberty participated in the first NBA versus WNBA 3-point challenge at All-Star Saturday night this February in Indianapolis. Curry and Ionescu are in strong conversations to return in a variation of the shootout, which could include other NBA and WNBA players such as Klay Thompson of the Dallas Mavericks and Caitlin Clark of the Indiana Fever, sources said. Expanding on the competition and including Thompson and Clark always made far too much sense, so it’s good to see that the NBA might do something that would obviously be a huge draw."

	The NBA is considering a shakeup to make the All-Star Game a 4-team tournament like Rising Stars -- and include the Rising Stars winners.","The last really good NBA All-Star Game was in 2020, which was both the first year of the Elam Ending format and just a few weeks after Kobe Bryant’s tragic death. Players took the game more seriously than we’ve seen in quite some time, as it was a league-wide celebration of the Lakers legend, but since then the game has fallen back into old habits of being a glorified pickup run with barely a hint of defense being played.  That has led to fans tuning out and TV networks being upset, and Adam Silver seemed like a broken man after last year’s game was the highest scoring in history, handing Giannis and the East the All-Star Game trophy with the glowing praise of “you scored the most points. Well, congratulations.” The truth is, the All-Star Game just isn’t important enough for players to go all-out, especially with how much money is at stake for them nowadays. It’s no longer the biggest national stage some of them will get to show out and build their profile, and the result is a bunch of guys trying not to get hurt while producing a few highlights.  For that reason, the league needs to get creative. We offered our thoughts on what that should look like last year, as they’ve bounced back-and-forth between formats and how they pick teams to varying degrees of success. This year we might see a significant change to the format, as ESPN’s Shams Charania brought word that the league is in deep discussions on a new format that would be similar what they did with the Rising Stars Game, breaking the All-Star rosters into 4 teams and having them play a semifinal game and then the winners of those playing in the final. The teams would be 3 teams of 8 All-Stars and the winning team of the Rising Stars Challenge from Friday. Charania highlights how discussions around this format started at Summer League and have included league personnel, team executives, players (including Stephen Curry), and coaches, with significant momentum towards being adopted for the 2025 game in San Francisco. At the very least, you could bet that whatever team of All-Stars got matched up with the Rising Stars winners would likely have a little more juice to not lose, which would yield the intended results of raising the level of competition.  I think anything would be an improvement over a regular four-quarter game, and the Rising Stars games have been improved as a result of this format change. Even if they aren’t suddenly the greatest basketball games in history, they move quicker and when it’s close late the competitive juices get flowing in a way we don’t see often in the current All-Star format."

	Nikola Jokic entered this season as an all-time great already. Somehow, someway, he keeps getting better.","There’s this fun thing I like to do sometimes that I affectionately call the Barry Bonds game. How it works: You go onto baseball-reference, pull up the page for the legendary San Francisco Giants slugger, and just look at how ridiculous it was that Bonds was able to put up the numbers he did during his prime. Yes, steroids, I know, but even with that caveat, individual players are not supposed to break their sport the way that Barry Bonds was able to break the game of baseball. We’re not fully there yet, but going onto Nikola Jokic‘s basketball-reference page is getting to a similarly very silly point. Ever since becoming the no-doubt cornerstone of the Denver Nuggets back in 2018-19, Jokic has consistently put up some of the wildest numbers in the league. His last four years feature three MVPs and a second-place finish while averaging 26.1 points, 12.2 rebounds, 8.7 assists, and 1.4 steals in 34.1 minutes per game while shooting 58.8 percent from the field and 36.4 percent from three. The advanced stats especially love him — scroll on down to the “Advanced” section, a lot of stuff is bold (led the league) and a few things are gold (all-time career marks). There is no one quite like Jokic, and there has never been anyone quite like Jokic. His career True Shooting percentage is third in league history, behind only Rudy Gobert and DeAndre Jordan, while attempting 1,942 more three-pointers than those two combined. His career total rebound percentage is 15th, right in between ABA legend Mel Daniels and Marcus Camby. He’s 25th all time in assist percentage — the three names directly behind him are Ja Morant, Ricky Rubio, and LeBron James. The dude just has his fingerprints all over games in a way that no one has ever consistently matched. I say all of that to say this: Somehow, someway, on a team that needs him more than ever (which says a lot as the entire franchise is built around having him), Jokic has raised his game through the first stretch of the 2024-25 season. This should not be possible. It’s not even like he’s suddenly adding something new to his bag of tricks, he’s just better than ever at being Nikola Jokic. Small sample size caveats are prominent here, but here’s some stuff to consider: Points per game: 29.7 (fifth in the NBA, his current career-high is 27.1 PPG)
Rebounds per game: 13.7 (leads the NBA, current career-high is 13.8 RPG)
Assists per game: 11.7 (leads the NBA, current career-high is 9.8 APG)
Steals per game: 1.7 (t-9th in the NBA, current career-high is 1.7 SPG) The only players to ever average a triple-double over a full season, of course, are Oscar Robertson (once) and Russell Westbrook (four times). Neither of them, in any of their triple-double seasons, were in the same galaxy as Jokic’s current True Shooting percentage of 66.7 percent — both guys, funny enough, posted a TS% of 55.4 percent in their most efficient season with a triple-double. And all of the advanced stats that tend to show that Jokic is a marvel (PER, win shares per 48 minutes, box plus/minus) are outrageous — if the season ended today, he’d post the highest single-season PER (33.31) of all-time, the highest BPM (15.02) of all-time, and the fourth-highest WS/48 of all-time behind some guys named Kareem and Wilt. So, yeah, Jokic is a joke, the single best basketball player in the world today and the guy spearheading a Nuggets team with some flaws that came as the result of a talent drain over the last few years to an early 7-3 record and, as of this writing, the longest-active winning streak (five games) in the Western Conference. And here’s the funny thing: If Denver did not have Jokic playing like this, they would be in some serious trouble. Have a look at how dire things get when he is not on the floor, via PBP Stats: There is a reason why, when asked what the ideal number of minutes is for Jokic to be on the floor for the Nuggets, Michael Malone said “48.” We’ve seen plenty of teams over the years be totally helpless when the sun around which everything revolves goes to the bench — LeBron’s teams in his prime were famously horrendous when he would sit, the Sixers have an organizational commitment to being awful without Joel Embiid, etc. — but seeing as how Jokic is either scoring or assisting on nearly half of all the points that Denver scores, well, it’s pretty important that he never comes off the floor. That’ll have to change at some point (well, probably), but Jokic playing like this means it’s easier for the Nuggets to slowly bring along their young guys who have to take on bigger roles this season — although it must be said that Christian Braun has impressed as the de facto Kentavious Caldwell-Pope replacement. They can also afford to be patient with Jamal Murray, who still hasn’t quite looked like himself on the heels of a pretty nasty run of injuries that made his postseason and Olympic efforts hard to watch at times, but just got paid in a big way and absolutely has to get on track. Of course, at some point, Denver is going to need to totally round into form, even if there are some really encouraging signs beyond Jokic. Aaron Gordon has been awesome so far this year when healthy, while Michael Porter Jr. continues to just do his thing as a huge dude who can shoot the hell out of the basketball. When 75 percent of the core your team is built around is playing at a high level from the start of the year — and that final member of your core has a reputation for saving his best for when the lights get brighter — you’re usually in a pretty good spot. There are still big picture questions that can only be answered when the playoffs roll around, which is the curse of being a team with title-or-bust aspirations. In the meantime, all anyone can really do is sit back, watch, and marvel at the spectacle that is Nikola Jokic, the best player in the world at the very height of his powers, someone who keeps finding ways to break the game of basketball, and an all-time great who stands shoulder-to-shoulder alongside the greatest players to ever set foot on the hardwood.

	'We’re nothing. We’re just dead. We’re dust.'","Tonight, November 15, is the much-publicized boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul. Ahead of the fight, which will stream on Netflix, Iron Mike was asked by internet-famous teen reporter Jazlyn Guerra, a.k.a. Jazzy’s World TV, for his thoughts on legacy. He took it very seriously.   “Well, I don’t know. I don’t believe in the word ‘legacy,'” Tyson replied. “I just think that’s another word for ego. Legacy doesn’t mean nothing. That’s just some word everybody grabbed onto. Someone said that word, and everyone grabbed on the words, and now it’s used every five seconds. It means absolutely nothing to me. I’m just passing through. I’mma die, and it’s gonna be over. Who cares about legacy after that?”  Tyson somehow wasn’t done. “What a big ego,” he continued. “So I’mma die. I want people to think that I’m this, I’m great. I’m, no. We’re nothing. We’re just dead. We’re dust. We’re absolutely nothing. Our legacy is nothing.” Guerra responded to Tyson’s stream-of-consciousness existentialism with a polite “thank you so much for sharing that,” but 50 Cent had another takeaway. “G*ddam it! Mike ya scaring the kids, WTF chill,” the rapper wrote on X. “Note to self, keep the kids away from Mike.”  You can watch the video here. Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson streams on Netflix beginning at 8 p.m. ET."
Sports – UPROXX,Ranking The 2024-25 NBA City Edition Uniforms From Worst To Best,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/nba-city-edition-uniforms-ranked-2024-25/,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 18:01:22 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	This year's NBA City Edition unis were officially unveiled on Thursday, so we're ranking them from 30 to 1.","The NBA and Nike officially unveiled the 2024-25 City Edition uniforms for all 30 teams on Thursday, and while the designs have been leaked since this summer, I like to wait until we get the official images to rank them. That is because the actual jerseys themselves almost always look better than their 2D mock-ups, which is certainly the case with this year’s crop. The leaks got roasted to no end on social media and while I’m not crazy about this year’s group of uniforms, they aren’t as bad in actuality as the leaks looked.  That said, there are some heaters and some really bad ones, along with a big crop this year of very “meh” looks as it’s fair to wonder if Nike and the teams are running a bit short on ideas — good news guys, at least another 12 years of these! Here we are ranking the uniforms from worst to best, where there’s one that should become part of one team’s permanent look.  NBA
Creating good alternates is hard when you have an iconic jersey set, and that’s the problem the Celtics (and Lakers) run into every year. These are just bad and don’t even seem to be trying to do anything interesting. Wear your normal (and great) uniforms, please.  NBA
Same goes for the Lakers. These are just unbecoming of a once proud franchise.  NBA
I’m honestly kind of stunned they went back to the Heat Culture well again after the reaction to when they did this last year, but it does look a little better on the all red uniform. Still, c’mon guys, stop trying to make this a thing. NBA
On the opposite end of the spectrum from Boston and L.A. is OKC, which has had one uniform in its history that I thought was legitimately good (the 2018 City Edition honoring Oklahoma’s Native American heritage). Everything else has been either “meh” or outright bad. I’ll say this, these aren’t the worst unis they’ve ever had, but I just am not a fan.  NBA
The Pacers have done this look before in black, and it’s just not for me.  NBA
A retro look that just doesn’t really land for me. I will say, I bet the court they have for this color scheme will look great, but I’m just not a big fan of the lettering.  NBA
I wouldn’t call these bad, they just don’t land for me, but that’s also been the case for a number of the Brooklyn City Editions over the years.  NBA
I’m just out on the 5280 thing. I like the mountains on the side and the topographical map thing, and while I think there are better executions, leaning into the rainbow coloring is generally good for Denver. However, I just can’t get on board with the 5280 in place of lettering. NBA
All of the uniforms in this tier have the same issue of not being bad, but also not being particularly inspiring. Dallas’ are particularly plain, which, again, not necessarily bad, but not memorable either.  NBA
I get they’re going for the Chicago musical font here, but it feels like they weren’t willing to go all-in on it and the end result is pretty bland.  NBA
I get what Minnesota’s going for, but I just see an old Windows 98 screensaver in that design.  NBA
They aren’t as bad as the Lakers and Celtics, but they also have a similar problem where their normal uniforms are iconic classics and trying something new often just makes you want them to do what they always do.  NBA
The Magic are at the top of this group by virtue of having the best lettering/logo — the Magic with a star for the A is always great — but Orlando has great uniform looks and this one just falls flat comparatively.  NBA
Like Orlando, Charlotte has some great throwback looks and this just makes me wish they were wearing one of those instead.  NBA
My colleague Mark said the logo looks like it should be for store brand paper towels and I can’t unsee it. I do like that shade of blue though.  NBA
Perfectly fine, even though it’s still a little confusing when the Bucks are wearing all-blue.  NBA
Never seen a more Oklahoma State jersey in my life. Go Pokes.  NBA
I actually kinda like these, but they are giving off strong vibes of made up Houston jerseys for a movie that couldn’t afford NBA licensing.  NBA
If I were to guess, these will be among the most polarizing unis. I dig New Orleans leaning into being a little different and weird, and the herringbone pattern with actual bones certainly does that. They will likely be at the bottom of some folks rankings but I don’t think their standard unis are so good that they can’t get weird and have it work.  NBA
These have grown on me a bit, in part because they at least look like Warriors uniforms — unlike their Michigan/Marquette alternates from a year or two ago. They aren’t the best uniforms in the world, but a solid attempt at playing off something unique to the Bay (the Golden Gate Bridge).  NBA
I really like the District font and this year they put it on a nice color instead of whatever the hell the black and green and orange thing was a year ago. The Wizards won’t be good this year, but I do think they’ll look good in these.  NBA
I like this Spurs font, they’ve done it before but it works for me. I also like this shade of blue. These aren’t as good as their fiesta look in the past, but a solid choice and I just like when the Spurs have a little pop of color.  NBA
I like these, even though I will not immediately spot this color and go “Cavs” in my brain. Part of why these will work is their court that goes with them is phenomenal.  NBA
Another one that gets a big boost from an unbelievably good court design. These play off the old 1995 All-Star logo, and while I’m not crazy about the font, I still dig them. If they incorporated the saguaro cactus into them, they’d be higher.  NBA
The Blazers almost always do a good job with the City edition uni, and this year is another good addition to their rotation. A big part of that is their “Rip City” font just looks good on anything. NBA
The Jazz are finally making the move back to the purple mountains with their full-time uniform set, and this year’s City Edition is a very good version of that.  NBA
The throwback to the Memphis Sounds just looks fantastic. I love that Memphis font and these are going to look fantastic on the floor — even if it’ll take a little adjustment to seeing a team in red and thinking “Grizzlies”.  NBA
The Kings also have another really good throwback look, taking it to the days of the Cincinnati Royals. The royal blue and red just pops, and they didn’t try to do too much with a uniform that doesn’t need much more.  NBA
I’m a sucker for this spectrum Sixers look. I just think it’s so clean and the white edition is even better than the navy look from a couple years back.  NBA
The Vince Carter Raptor doing his legendary between-the-legs dunk is so good and the Raptors need to just make it their permanent logo. These with the purple retro look they brought back this year is a damn-near perfect uniform set and it’s a shame they will move on to something new next season."
Sports – UPROXX,We’re Picking Winners For Week 11 Of The 2024 NFL Season,https://uproxx.com/sports/nfl-picks-winners-week-11-spread-best-bets/,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:03:27 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	Come get these winners.","Sometimes, you simply want to unplug the season and plug it back in. That is where we are when it comes to NFL handicapping in 2024. After a pair of encouraging weeks, the ugliness returned in Week 10, including a Falcons-Saints game that impossibly stayed under with three missed field goals and other malodies. We won’t be deterred from the goal of righting the ship but, hey, you could also fade these picks if you’re feeling spicy. Before delivering this week’s five-pack, let’s take a look at the carnage in 2024.  Come get these winners. A Thursday night Under? Let’s get back to basics. Washington has been an “over” team to the tune of 7-3 this season, but Philadelphia has been quietly stout on defense in recent weeks. This is, of course, a short week for both teams, and Washington has some injury issues along its offensive line. I tend to think the Commanders defense is a touch undervalued in this spot as well, and this is a favorable price. The Saints got the bounce last week after firing their coach and, with the help of one of the worst kicking performances of the season for Atlanta, New Orleans won a game it shouldn’t have won. That could benefit us this week, as the Browns are underdogs in a spot where they probably shouldn’t be. Let’s ride the Jameis roller coaster and hope it goes well. Detroit is a wagon. They seemingly cover every week and, when they don’t like in Week 10, they somehow win the game despite a million turnovers. With that said, getting a full 14 here on Jacksonville is something I can’t pass on. Trust me, I know how ugly it is. Seattle is healthier and coming off a bye, including the projected return of DK Metcalf. I’ve also been a touch low on San Francisco all season, and I simply can’t get this to 6.5 points, even with McCaffrey back for the 49ers. This teaser happens to involve a pair of prime time games, but I would like it even if it didn’t. Candidly, I love each leg here, with the Bengals more than able to get in the backdoor if things go south at the outset. Houston is on the road, which does scare me a bit, but the situation in Dallas is rather dire, and the Texans may be discounted a bit after a maddening loss to Detroit."

	Giannis got called for a foul despite getting all ball. But fortunately for the Bucks, as Rasheed Wallace once said, ball don't lie.","The Milwaukee Bucks played host to the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night, and while there is still a ton of basketball left to be played this season, you won’t find a more insane final 90 or so seconds of regulation than what we got out of these two Central Division opponents. The two teams traded the lead back and forth, and after a Marcus Sasser three tied things up with just under 30 seconds left, Milwaukee got the ball and had a chance to win. A wide open look by Taurean Prince did not fall, and with a hair over a second left on the clock, Detroit called a timeout, advanced the ball, and tried to replicate the magic it found on a sideline out of bounds play on Tuesday night against Miami. It looked like that was going to happen, as Cade Cunningham lobbed one up to Ron Holland near the rim, but Giannis Antetokounmpo was able to break things up … well, at least it looked like he did, but the referees called a foul that stood after a review even though it really did not look like Giannis fouled Holland at all. However, in the words of the great philosopher Rasheed Wallace, ball don’t lie. Holland stepped up to the charity stripe and missed short twice, which ended up sending the game to overtime. It would’ve been an awfully harsh way for the game to end for Milwaukee, but, again, Sheed’s got us covered here."
Sports – UPROXX,Draymond Green Claims Steph Had Extra Juice For Warriors-Mavs Because Klay ‘Ghosted Him’,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/draymond-green-klay-thompson-ghosted-steph-curry-warriors-mavs/,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 23:16:08 +0000","<div class=""upx-component upx-embed-url""><div class=""embed-holder""></div></div>Steph Curry apparently had a little extra motivation for Klay Thompson's return to the Chase Center.","Klay Thompson made his return to the Chase Center on Tuesday night as a member of the Dallas Mavericks. It went the way that things tend to go when teams travel to take on the Golden State Warriors: Steph Curry did some absolutely ludicrous Steph stuff, and the Warriors went on to pick up a 120-117 win to start their NBA Cup campaign. Curry scored all 12 of the Warriors’ points during a 12-3 run to close out the game, and plenty of people noted that he looked especially fired up after hitting a three with 27 seconds left that essentially iced things. It turns out there’s a reason why: According to Draymond Green, Curry was ghosted by Thompson in the lead-up to the game. “I’m stirring the pot, I pissed Steph off,” Green said on his podcast, which you can watch at the 4:30 mark of the video at the top of this post. “He’s like, ‘Yeah, I talked to Klay last night about’ — cause he was supposed to speak before the game. He was like, ‘Yeah I called Raymond and told him I’m not speaking. I just need to lock in on the game, so I ain’t speaking and I talked to Klay about it.’ He tried to check in with Klay about something else, and Klay ghosted him, so he got pissed. And here we go. Locked in.” Steve Kerr said that Curry was supposed to address the crowd before the game, but he and Thompson decided against it, while Green did drop a hint after the game that Thompson isn’t an easy guy to get a hold of when he told the press “You ever try to keep in touch with Klay? It’s very one-sided. The love is there. The relationship is there.”"

	The legendary Spurs coach has been away from the team since Nov. 2.","The San Antonio Spurs have been without the services of legendary head coach Gregg Popovich since the start of November. While the team previously said that Popovich’s absence was due to an illness, on Wednesday afternoon, the Spurs revealed that Popovich suffered what was described as a “mild stroke” ahead of their game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Nov. 2, 2024. “The San Antonio Spurs today announced that Head Coach Gregg Popovich has suffered a mild stroke,” the team said in a statement. “The episode occurred on Nov. 2 at the Frost Bank Center. Popovich, who has already started a rehabilitation program, is expected to make a full recovery. At this point, a timeline for his return to the sidelines has not been determined. During this time, the organization is grateful to the extended community for providing privacy and space to the Popovich family.” Assistant coach Mitch Johnson, who has been part of the Spurs’ famed coaching system since 2016, has filled in for Popovich as he’s been away from the team for the last six games. When asked last week for an update on Popovich, Johnson said that the Hall of Fame coach was “in good spirits,” even though there was no word on when fans could expect to see Popovich back on the sideline. One of the greatest basketball coaches of all time, the 75-year-old Popovich has been at the helm of the Spurs since 1996. He is a 5-time NBA champion, a 3-time Coach of the Year, and is the NBA’s all-time wins leader among coaches."

	Let's be honest, Charles Barkley and Shaq were always going to do this at some point.","It’s been a rough start to the year for the Toronto Raptors. While they were never expected to compete for a championship this year, injuries to a number of key contributors like Scottie Barnes and Immanuel Quickly have played a big role in the team going 2-10, which is the worst record in the league at this early juncture. A bright spot has been the play of Gradey Dick, the No. 13 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft who is shooting 37.3 percent from three and his upped his scoring to 20.1 points per game. He’s a good player whose last name has led to stuff like this happening, and shockingly, it was not until Tuesday night that the Inside the NBA guys had their inevitable meltdown over him.   A post shared by Dime (@dimemagazine)  “This boy’s ballin right here, y’all,” Charles Barkley told the crew. “I think you pointed that out, Gradey Dick,” Ernie Johnson responded. “I can’t say his name,” Barkley shot back. “I just can’t say his name. I’m not gonna say his name, I don’t give a damn what y’all say around here.” It was right around this point that we got one of the consistently funniest things on Inside: Shaq laughing so hard at something insane that Chuck said that he sounds like he’s furiously trying to clear his throat. Anyway, the fellas kept going down this road for a bit longer, because there was never going to be any stopping this riff once it finally happened. As for how the rest of Dick’s night went, he scored a career-best 32 points with five rebounds and three assists in a 99-85 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks."

	There was some extra juice in the building for Klay Thompson's return to the Bay, and Steph reminded the fans whose house it was late.","The biggest game of the night in a packed slate of NBA Cup games was the Mavs taking on the Warriors in Klay Thompson’s first game back in San Francisco since leaving as a free agent this summer for Dallas.  It was an emotional scene as they played a terrific tribute video and had the crowd in captains hats to honor their former star, but once the game got going there was plenty of juice on both sides in a reunion that wasn’t all happy. The two teams went back and forth, as the stars on both sides all played their roles, with Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving combining for 52 for the Mavs, while Thompson hit 6 threes on his way to 22 points in his return, including a big one late that gave Dallas a five-point lead midway through the fourth quarter.  That lead would get up to seven before Stephen Curry took over for the Warriors, scoring 12 points in the final 3:10 of game time, including a personal 10-0 run (aided by some spectacular defense from Draymond Green) that turned a Golden State deficit into a 4-point Warriors lead. His final bucket of that run was a vintage stepback three-pointer over Dereck Lively II, as he hit the Mavs big man with his signature “night night” celebration, before making a demonstrative declaration to the crowd that “this is my sh*t.”  STEPH CURRY HAS THE LAST 10 WARRIORS POINTS. 10-2 run to put GSW up 4 with under 30 seconds. 🏆 DAL-GSW | West Group C action🏀 #EmiratesNBACup on TNT pic.twitter.com/xNxak7xWr5 — NBA (@NBA) November 13, 2024  The Mavs would hit a three to cut the lead to one, but a pair of Curry free throws and a missed Luka three saw the Warriors win in regulation, 120-117. Curry finished with 37 points in the win, and while it’s clear there’s not actual bad blood between either side in the Splash Bros. breakup, there did seem to be a little extra fire from Curry for a mid-November game to make a statement at home with Klay now on the other side. While the “night night” is nothing new, the jersey popping and yelling “this is my sh*t” was more than we ever see from Curry in a non-playoff environment, and while I am a fan of the NBA Cup and think it brings out more competition in these games, I think this had more to do with who was on the other side than the Cup ramifications of this game."

	Shaq, who is never shy about being brutally honest when modern big men come up, did not mince words about Joel Embiid.","Joel Embiid took the floor for the Philadelphia 76ers for the first time this season on Tuesday night. Embiid, who has spent the start of the year ramping up to play after some knee problems, looked like someone who needs to work off a ton of rust, as he went for 13 points on 2-for-11 shooting with five assists and three rebounds in a 111-99 loss to the New York Knicks. It’s probably safe to assume that Embiid will be fine as long as he can manage whatever is up with his knee, while the Sixers — which find themselves 2-8 at this early juncture — have to get him, Paul George, and Tyrese Maxey all healthy and clicking as soon as possible. But even if that happens, Shaquille O’Neal is not optimistic about Philly’s ability to win a ring with Embiid at the center of things, which he expressed at halftime on TNT. “In New York, it’s a tough team to play,” O’Neal said. “But this was the fear I had for Joel Embiid. You announce arrogantly, I’m not playing back-to-backs, Ernie. I’m not injured but I’m sore. I’ll come back when I want to come back. Now, when you say things like that, you’re supposed to come back with extra energy. 0-for-3? I would have been 0-15. But you know what y’all would have said. ‘Hey, Shaq’s not playing well, but he’s playing aggressive.’ The plan that they are having, it’s not working. And not only that, I say this respectfully, Joel Embiid will never win a championship until he gets his mind and his attitude right.” Shaq has essentially staked out a place in the basketball punditry world as the guy who will call out big men when he feels they aren’t living up to what they’re capable of, and clearly, he thinks Embiid is the kind of guy who can lead Philadelphia to a championship. In fairness to Embiid, while he did say he may not play in back-to-backs going forward in an effort to be healthy when the playoffs roll around, he said after the loss to the Knicks that he wants to play in Wednesday’s game against the Cleveland Cavaliers, even if the decision is out of his hands."

	With the game tied in overtime, Miami tried calling a timeout. There was just one problem: They didn't have one available.","The second annual Emirates NBA Cup tipped off on Tuesday night, with a number of teams taking the (very vibrant) floor for the league’s relatively new in-season tournament. In the East Group B, the Detroit Pistons played host to the Miami Heat and looked like they were going to cruise to a win before Miami got hot down the stretch of regulation. With things tied up, the two teams went into overtime, where Miami was able to take a lead with just under two seconds left before things got very, very weird. First, the Pistons drew up a beautiful sideline out of bounds play to get a dunk for Jalen Duren that tied things up. And then, a furious Erik Spoelstra walked onto the court and called a timeout. There was just one problem: Miami didn’t have one, which meant we had a classic Chris Webber situation on our hands — perhaps it was fate that one of Webber’s Fab 5 teammates, Jalen Rose, was in attendance and lost his mind. Malik Bealey stepped up to the free throw line, buried it to put Detroit ahead, then on the ensuing Pistons possession, got fouled one more time with 0.1 seconds left to seal the game. It was, quite frankly, stunning to watch Spoelstra make such a big mistake, but at the very least, we got a really entertaining end to a game that suddenly has some stakes to it because of the NBA Cup."

The only problem for Caitlin at the Eras Tour was that she’s too popular in Indianapolis, which meant she was being constantly given friendship bracelets from other Swifties. That’s a very nice problem to have, but in her effort to wear every one she was given, it started to create an issue, as she explained at the Women’s Leadership Summit.  “Taylor Swift, I just went two nights in a row in Indianapolis. I’ve been three times,” Clark said. “I had a ton [of bracelets], all the way up the arms. I had to take them off, my circulation was getting cut off! Everyone was just chucking their bracelets at me. I’ve seen her three times, and every time the show has just gotten better.”  She showed off her collection on Instagram during one of the shows and it was a lot of bracelets.  Clark has spent the last year or two learning the ups and downs of life as a superstar, but this is certainly a very unique pitfall of fame, being so popular you get too many friendship bracelets and start to lose feeling in your arm."

	The NBA Cup is back for a second season, and here's how it will all work and what groups each team ended up in.","The NBA’s efforts to add a little excitement to the doldrums of its regular season will return on Tuesday evening. For the second straight year, the league will hold its new cup competition, now known as the Emirates NBA Cup. The first year was fun, with the Los Angeles Lakers winning the whole thing by knocking off the Indiana Pacers in Las Vegas, and now, the NBA will continue its efforts to turn this nascent event into a crucial part of its calendar. What does this all mean? Well, we tried to answer that today by explaining what’s new this year, how the whole thing will work, and why we’re excited to watch this as it tries to become a tentpole event on the NBA calendar. So is this just the In-Season Tournament but with a new name? It is! While the NBA has never explicitly said this, my assumption is that they spent the first year calling it the In-Season Tournament so fans would get a sense of what it is before calling it what they always wanted to call it: The NBA Cup, or more specifically, the Emirates NBA Cup. Or maybe they just couldn’t find a sponsor in the first year. What’s that Emirates thing? I’ve seen its logo on courts but never actually looked into what it is. It’s an airline based out of the United Arab Emirates that sponsors a lot of stuff. They’re sponsoring this event, which is the second-best thing that the NBA does, and fortunately, Emirates has plenty of experience sponsoring the second-best thing, as they are the shirt sponsor for Arsenal. What? Just let me cook. Ok, so, any major differences from last year other than the name? A big one are the courts. Last year, they came under criticism from players (who kept slipping on them) and fans (who thought some were huge eyesores, particularly because of the weird, cumbersome stripe they had going down the middle of the courts). They’re not nearly as bad this year, as they replaced the stripe with rings in the center of the floor and got rid of some of the more abrasive designs that just do not work on television. I’m sure not everyone will love them, but I think they are a huge improvement on last year — we just have to see if players struggle with their footing on them, or else the aesthetic changes do not matter at all. What about point differential? I know some players disliked that. Well, that’s still sticking around as a potential tiebreaker for which teams do and do not advance. Frankly, I think it’s fine and we saw last year that some of the European players were trying to egg their teammates on — Domantas Sabonis was the main one I remember — but it’ll still take a bit of a shift for everyone to get on board with it. Remind me how determining how teams advance will work again? Sure! Right from the league: So the easiest way to move on is to just win your group and not worry about any tiebreakers. That is correct. Well then, what do the groups look like? Once again, the NBA broke things up into three groups of five teams in each conference — this will, hopefully, look a lot cleaner when expansion happens, we get up to 32 teams, and they can do groups of four in each conference where each team plays group games home and away. The group games will happen on Tuesdays and Fridays starting tonight and running through Dec. 3. Here’s how it all looks: West Group A: Minnesota, LA Clippers, Sacramento, Houston, Portland West Group B: Oklahoma City, Phoenix, LA Lakers, Utah, San Antonio West Group C: Denver, Dallas, New Orleans, Golden State, Memphis East Group A: New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Brooklyn, Charlotte East Group B: Milwaukee, Indiana, Miami, Toronto, Detroit East Group C: Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington How do these teams qualify for the knockouts? Same as last year — win your group and you get a spot. Both conferences then get one remaining spot for a wild card team, which goes to the best remaining team that did not automatically qualify by winning its group. This is probably where those aforementioned tiebreakers would come in, but you never know. And will the knockouts work like last year, too? Yup! Single-elimination basketball games, with the quarterfinals happening on-site at home arenas and the semifinals and final happening in Las Vegas. The quarters are on Dec. 10 and 11, the semis are on Dec. 14, and the final is on Dec. 17. And are these games all considered regular season games, too? For the most part they are — group games, the quarters, and the semis will all count towards regular season records again, while the championship game will not. So it looks a lot like last year, then. That’s right, the league has, essentially, decided to keep a lot of things the same other than the name and the courts. Oh, also, as a programming note: home teams will wear their Statement Edition uniforms, while road teams wear their Association edition uniforms, according to the league. Huh, well then, ok. You don’t seem enthused about all of this, dear reader. Yeah, I mean, I am still unsure why I should care about this. Well that’s easy: You don’t have to! You’re an adult with agency and the ability to care about whatever you want, times are tough, maybe you don’t want to get super personally invested in a new thing the NBA is doing, that’s fine. But you seem to like this. I do! Why? I think a big split I have noticed here is “fans who like soccer” and “fans who do not,” with the former being more open to the idea of a midseason cup competition — Adam Silver has compared the NBA Cup to the FA Cup in English football, but basically every domestic league has a secondary cup competition. The thing is that these competitions are universally considered not as important as winning the league, but they are still important because it’s an opportunity to win something historic and provide some validation for a team’s season. The NBA Cup is only in its second year, so clearly, it has a way to go before it gets taken that seriously — the whole saga with the Lakers debating putting up a little banner is an example of this. But the FA Cup, for example, is not considered cool because everyone farts around and then Manchester City wins it at the end. It’s considered cool because teams from several levels of English football have a chance to win it, and sometimes, you get magical runs to the very end. We got a glimpse of what that could look like last year when the Indiana Pacers nearly won the whole thing. Hell, if not for the fact that they’re the Lakers, it’d probably be viewed as proof of concept that the final was between a Play-In team and an upstart young squad trying to win something for the first time. That is, to steal a phrase from the English, the magic of the cup. So acknowledging that this isn’t as important as winning the NBA Finals is fine? One-hundred percent. The longer the NBA sticks with this — and, let’s face it, Silver is essentially staking his legacy as a commissioner on this becoming a big deal — the more likely it is that it’ll settle into a spot where fans/franchises like that it is a thing that they can win, all while understanding that the big prize is still waiting for them in June. It helps, of course, that there’s a financial incentive to do well. Remind me what that is. Sure! Players whose teams make the quarterfinals make $50,000, players whose teams make the semifinals make $100,000, players on the runners-up make $200,000, and players on the team that wins the whole thing makes $500,000. Nice. I agree. Anyway, this sounds like, bare minimum, a thing I can have on my television on Tuesdays and Fridays. It is, and really, if that’s all that comes from this for the next year or two, that’s totally fine. Something like this will only become a big deal the more it happens and the more it becomes ingrained as part of the sport’s culture, and as long as this year is a step towards doing that, I’m sure it’ll all work out in the long-run. Nice. Well, I suppose I can tune in. That you can, and if you want to know what games are on, when they’re on, and which networks they’ll be on, you can click right here."

	The NBA Cup starts Tuesday night and we are looking at eight teams that should invest a little extra energy in the early season competition.","The second edition of the NBA Cup (now with a fancy sponsor, Emirates) will begin on Tuesday night as group stage action gets started. Feelings on the NBA Cup vary, but for the most part, it seems to have been at least a mild positive in terms of adding a little juice to November regular season hoops.  Last year, the eight teams that emerged from group play were the Celtics, Bucks, Pacers, and Knicks in the East, and the Lakers, Kings, Suns, and Pelicans in the West. Ultimately, the Lakers beat the Pacers in the final, marking the high point of the season for Los Angeles, while that was just the beginning of a run to the conference finals from Indiana. There are differing views from teams on how they approach the Cup, but because most of the games until you get to Vegas count all the same as regular season games, you should see contenders still trying at least until the quarterfinals where they may punt to avoid adding a trip to Vegas to their schedule.  Not every team has the Cup schedule circled on their calendars, and for some, it gets in the way of the long-term goals (either to get lottery balls or winning a title). But as the Pacers showed a year ago, for a young team without much playoff experience, the Cup can get guys feet wet to that kind of environment and build some confidence for the tournament everyone cares about come April, May, and June.  Here, we’ll look at eight teams that we think should be willing to invest early season energy into trying to get to Vegas and hoist the NBA Cup.   Houston’s gotten off to a strong start this season at 7-4, and I think they’re in a similar position to the Pacers last year, as they can use this as a way to test their young roster without much playoff experience. A successful run to the knockout rounds (and maybe beyond) would be a genuinely big deal for the Rockets, who can assert themselves as a genuine threat in the West playoff race with a strong tournament showing.  We saw that the Lakers were willing to raise their level a year ago in the Cup competition, and it’d be kind of incredible if they went back-to-back. Their group is a bit less daunting now that the Thunder are without Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein (although that’s still an excellent team), and if they make the knockout rounds, a team with LeBron and AD is always going to be a threat in a single-elimination basketball game. We’ll see if they approach it with the same aggression, but this is a team that has to try and chase wins regardless, so I’d expect the effort to be there, even if they can’t replicate the same kind of run.  The Grizzlies want to prove they are fully back as West contenders, and they can make a strong statement if they come out of the aforementioned Group of Death. They are playing at a high level right now, led by Jaren Jackson Jr.’s continued brilliance, and if they can get to Vegas, they’d have a very good chance at lifting the Cup. And if Ja Morant can get healthy and come back in time, absolutely no one will want to see that guy in a one-off. By the time the season is over, the Spurs will likely have filtered out of the Play-In race, but this is the exact kind of team I think should place an overemphasis on the NBA Cup. The Spurs are still building around Victor Wembanyama and figuring out what that should look like, but this team has been fairly competitive early (5-6) and could take advantage of some injury woes for the top teams in their group to try and make a little noise in the Cup. We saw in the Olympics that Wemby loves some heightened competition, and this might be a good chance to turn him loose and make an all-out push for something in November, understanding that they probably don’t have the roster just yet to really threaten the playoffs.  Will the Cavs ever lose? At some point, yes, but why not keep the good vibes rolling as long as possible and try to win the Cup? Yes, they’re a title contender, but unlike, say, Boston, this isn’t a team that’s had any real playoff success. Building some good habits in the knockout rounds could pay dividends down the road, and seeing as how they’re in the same group as the Celtics, I’m sure they’d love to use this as a statement of intent in the event they cross paths in the postseason. The Bucks desperately need something to turn around their season, and maybe the Cup gives them a carrot to chase that can wake things up. I’m skeptical they have the juice to make this happen, as the vibes are just horrendous in Milwaukee right now, but theoretically, Giannis and Dame (who will miss their opener with a concussion) are good enough as a tandem to beat anyone. That will require them to get on the same page, which hasn’t really happened to this point, but perhaps playing on different courts can change the mojo in Milwaukee.  Like every team other than the Cavs and Celtics in the East, the Knicks are off to a sputtering start at 4-5. Their star-studded roster isn’t clicking just yet, the defense has taken a major step back, and the offense hasn’t been quite good enough to make up for it. Their group, at one point, looked like the toughest in the East, but the Magic are without Paolo Banchero and the Sixers … well, we’ll get to them in a second. That cracks the door for the Knicks to try and lay a foundation of winning they can build on as the season progresses and create that chemistry that’s been lacking in games with a slightly bigger game feel. Joel Embiid is back for the Cup games, but Tyrese Maxey is out and Paul George has been on a minutes restriction. This team is desperate to go on a run, and with the big fella back, there’s no time like the present to try and climb out of the East’s basement. Like the Bucks, Philly just needs to stack some wins and get some positivity, and if they can somehow make it to Vegas, they can erase a decent amount of the early season concern about them."
Sports – UPROXX,How Darius Garland And The Cavs Got Their Confidence Back,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/darius-garland-interview-cleveland-cavaliers-confidence/,"Mon, 11 Nov 2024 21:37:23 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	The Cavs are off to an 11-0 start, and we talked to Garland about the work this summer that led to the return of his confidence and smile.","The Cleveland Cavaliers came into the 2024-25 season with plenty of pressure, as this felt like a make-it-or-break-it season for their Core Four. They re-signed Donovan Mitchell and gave contract extensions to Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen, while Darius Garland is entering the second year of his own 5-year deal. A ton of money has been committed to this group, with the expectation that they would take another step forward as a real threat in the Eastern Conference under new head coach Kenny Atkinson.  While they can’t fully answer whether they’ve done that until May and June, the Cavs have made an emphatic statement to open the season, as they are the NBA’s last remaining unbeaten at 11-0. That hot start is the byproduct of confidence and trust in their group, something they’ve built over the years but had to fortify by figuring out how everyone can play to their strengths. One of the difficult tasks of building confidence as a unit is that each player has to first have that confidence in themselves. The story of the young season for Cleveland has been strides in that area by the two youngest members of their core, as Garland and Mobley are playing some of the best basketball of their careers.  For Garland, he’s bounced back after a difficult 2023-24 campaign that saw him suffer a broken jaw early in the year and never get fully back to his peak level. As he explained to DIME over the weekend, after missing a third of the season, he wasn’t too interested in vacations this summer, instead opting to get in the gym and build back the strength, confidence, and wiggle that had been missing at the end of last season.  “It’s a total difference. It’s a big difference,” Garland said of how he feels starting this season compared to the second half of last year. “I’m in a good head space right now. I’m fully healthy — some little nicks, but nothing too major right now. And yeah, just came in with a lot of confidence over the summer, put in a lot of work. Especially after last year, I didn’t play a lot of games, so wasn’t a lot of vacations for me this summer, or a lot of hangout time. It was really just strictly in the gym trying to get better, trying to put some more weight and some more muscle on that I lost from last year, from having to jaw surgery. And yeah, trying to get my confidence back, trying to get my wiggle back, and my ball handling and just trying to stay consistent with it.”  Garland’s summer in the gym helped him remember how much he loves the game. One of the lasting images from the end of last season for Garland and the Cavs was Donovan Mitchell on the bench putting his arm around Garland and saying “I believe in you,” as Garland was mired in the midst of a shooting slump. It was a touching moment between teammates, but also telling of how difficult things were for Garland, who had lost his perpetual smile and was finding it difficult to have that same sense of belief.  This season, his confidence is back, as is his infectious smile, and Garland is looking to spread that positivity beyond the court as well. For Veteran’s Day weekend, that means welcoming a pair of Gold Star families from the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) to the Cavs’ games against the Nets and Bulls, as Garland is helping honor a pair of families of fallen veterans from his hometown of Gary, IN.  “It’s super cool just to have some veteran families around me,” Garland said. “My grandfathers were veterans, so just trying to show some love and support for some of the families, and show that they’re loved and that they mean a lot to us, and we know how it is battling some things that they’ve gone through and that they’ve been through. So yeah, just to have their backs and just show that they’re loved and that we really appreciate it.” Both families have ties to Garland, as his mother went to high school with both of the fallen service members. He wants to take the opportunity his platform provides to show them love and do his favorite thing: put a smile on someone’s face. “I try to do it a little bit more often now, especially to kids and those with special needs,” Garland said. “I was one of the kids growing up looking up to Kobe, LeBron, Dame Lillard, Steph, so when I was growing up and they were giving back to younger kids and other people, I just always wanted to do the same. I know that it’ll just make their whole day and change the way that they look at things. So, trying to do it often and just try to put a smile on somebody’s face. That always means a lot to me, because I always wear a smile on my face.”   A post shared by Cavs Care (@cavscare_)  The way the Cavs have played so far this season has put an awful lot of smiles on faces in Cleveland, and Garland credits their hot start to the connectivity of the group and the confidence that’s instilled up and down the roster. This is the third year together for the Core Four, and many of their reserves have also been part of the team for at least a year or two. That familiarity has created a culture of accountability, with Garland noting that from players to coaches to the training staff, there’s a camaraderie that allows for honest conversations that make everyone better.  The newest face in the room is head coach Kenny Atkinson, as he took over for JB Bickerstaff (now in Detroit) with aspirations of taking this group to the next level. Garland, like everyone else in Cleveland, has been impressed with how Atkinson hit the ground running with the Cavs, and highlighted the way he instills confidence in everyone as the biggest thing he’s brought to the team. “He was a player, so he knows what it’s like playing a lot of games, and just having that confidence out on the floor — I mean, when you have that confidence, I think you just get boosted a little bit more,” Garland said. “You think that you can do anything and make any kind of shot, and that’s what our team has right now. We’re shooting the ball with confidence, making plays with confidence, and we’re doing it on both ends of the floor, and I think that’s where he’s just instilling us. Even at film, when we don’t shoot a shot we’re wide open, he’s going to get on us about shooting the ball, because that might be the only good shot that we have in that possession. So he wants us to shoot every ball with confidence, shoot every open one and just keep continuing to play hard and trust each other.” Garland has always been a good shooter, but last season, that confidence in his shot waned a bit, particularly in the postseason. That gave Garland plenty of motivation this summer, where he stripped his game back down to the basics and built it back up with a focus on the little details that go a long way in the games.  “Just trying to pay attention to details,” Garland said. “Just try to do all the little things to make me a better scorer, make me a better shooter. Literally the smallest things, like getting my feet ready, staying down low before I even get the ball. I mean, just literally everything, all the little things. I really went back from square one, from when I started basketball and just worked my way up until I could really start moving and going full speed for the entire summer. So I really went back to the basics this summer, and just tried to clean everything up and just try to polish everything, and getting some of the results back right now.”  The results are the best shooting percentages of his career from every level, with splits of 53.8/47.5/95.0 through the first 11 games. He’s finishing better than he ever has at the rim, a byproduct of the strength he added over the summer, and he’s shooting threes at a higher rate and making more of them than he ever has as a pro. That’s a lethal combination, and he certainly seems to have found that wiggle off the bounce once again, helped by his decisiveness and confidence with the ball as both a shooter and driving to attack the defense.  Garland is far from alone in having a strong start, as the Cavs are finding a way to feed off each other and recognizing how each of them can make the others better. Along with Garland’s return to All-Star form, Mobley has become a bigger part of the offense and is a big beneficiary of that boost of confidence Atkinson has provided. Mobley playing with more force and freedom on both ends of the floor raises their ceiling, and Garland is quick to note how his play opens up so much of the floor for everyone else, calling him “our catalyst.” “He gets us going on both ends of the floor, and he can do so many things, especially on offensive side of the ball,” Garland said. “We can set a 1-5 pick and roll with him, and I go set a pick-and-roll, or Don go set a pick-and-roll for him, and let him just work off that screen. And when he gets downhill he’s a great decision maker, so he’s going to make the right read. We really have a lot of trust in him. We just want him to continue to be confident in his game, want him to shoot some more threes, which is getting better over the years. And yeah, just to be the leader on both ends of the floor, especially defensively. Hopefully he’s All-NBA or Defensive Player of the Year this year, which he’s super capable of, and especially him and JA back there, it’s really tough to get anything at the rim.” The grind of the NBA regular season is impossible to avoid, but the Cavs have found an early comfort in leaning on their depth. At the top, they can play to the hot hand among their stars, but they’re finding an ability to be more adaptable as a roster to change their approach and lineups as needed based on matchups and game flow. With Mobley and Allen, they’ve always been able to go big, but against Brooklyn on Saturday, they closed with a four-guard lineup and showed how they can succeed going small, with Caris LeVert and Ty Jerome stepping in and playing well to close out their 11th win to start the season. As Garland explains, their experiences together, the highs and the lows, have taught them a lot about how they need to play, particularly in late game situations where slowing down and getting stagnant to let one player operate can be tempting, but ultimately plays into the hands of the defense.  “We have so much talent on this team and a lot of depth, so we just have a lot of confidence in everybody, and we’ve been in these situations before. Like I said, we’ve been around each other for a couple years now, so we know what to do. We’ve seen all different scenarios, from being in regular season or the playoffs, so when it’s late game situations, I think that we’re starting to get pretty good at it. And even with our depth last night, Ty Jerome and Caris, they ended the game with us. And, I mean, they made a difference when we went four guards and Evan at the five. It’s just so many different things that we can do because of because of our depth. And we got so much talent. I mean, you really have to just pick and poison, either you’re gonna give up a wide open three or a layup or a floater or something.” Garland and the Cavs know there are no banners to be hung for a fast start to the season, but for a team that just never seemed to hit their stride a year ago, this stretch is a reminder to both themselves and the rest of the league that they do have the kind of ceiling where they can beat anyone. There are still 71 games left in the season, but building the confidence and trust internally early on figures to pay dividends down the road.  For now, the Cavs will look to prolong their winning streak as long as they can, but as Garland notes, they have “bigger plans in May and June” and hope to keep putting smiles on faces in Cleveland deep into the spring."

	Barrett did a literal double-take and couldn't stop from blurting out ""Game of Thrones!""","There is no team that has more celebrities attend their games than the Lakers (the Knicks being a close second), as the courtside seats at L.A. games often go a few rows deep with stars from the world of entertainment. There are the regulars like Jack Nicholson and Denzel Washington, but on any given night you might find an actor from your favorite TV show or movie watching the Lakers play.  That happened to Toronto wing RJ Barrett on Sunday night as the Raptors made their annual trek to Los Angeles. After finishing through contact for an and-1, Barrett turned to the crowd in the corner to celebrate only to find himself face-to-face with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, best known for playing Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones. Barrett realized this mid-celebration and did a literal double take, turned back to Coster-Waldau, pointed, and blurted out “Game of Thrones!” at him before turning around and walking to the free throw line.   A post shared by Dime (@dimemagazine)  It’s a very funny thing to happen in the middle of an NBA game, but also, that’s exactly how I would react if I turned around and was suddenly face-to-face with the guy that played Jaime Lannister. I feel like this is far from the first time someone has pointed at Coster-Waldau and just yelled “Game of Thrones!” at him, as that is by far the role he’s best known for."

	We caught up with Liv Morgan after she made history as the first Women's Crown Jewel Champion.","Before kicking off the Liv Morgan World Tour, and before becoming the first Women’s Crown Jewel Champion, the current Women’s World Champion sat at home nursing a dislocated shoulder. As Liv Morgan recovered for six months throughout 2023, she says she had a moment of clarity.  Over the first decade of her career, she’d allowed her ring work to speak for itself. During her time away, Morgan took a step back and felt like she had lacked a true voice or character. As she plotted her return to the ring, she created the Liv Morgan Revenge Tour built around the realities of her injury, while envisioning a path back to the top of the WWE mountain.  “The Liv Morgan Revenge Tour,” Morgan tells Uproxx Sports, “gave me such a purpose.” Some of the best stories in professional wrestling have been at least somewhat based in reality, and the way Morgan was injured gave her a motive, direction, and something so personal and true, that it allowed her for the first time in her career to really sink her teeth into a story. “Rhea (Ripley) really did dislocate my shoulder,” Morgan says. “I really sat home for six months watching her ascend to the top of the division. And so it was all really personal to me, and I used all that to come back and do exactly to her what she did to me. But I did that and more.” While she’s navigated trying to find her character throughout a decade in WWE, elements of who Morgan is as a person have helped her continue to chip away at this dream. Her drive, passion, wanting to learn as much as she can, and desire to give herself an opportunity to see what she could achieve has brought her this far.  “(My time away) just gave me the time and space that I needed to really settle into my own, which brought out the best version of Liv Morgan than we’ve seen thus far,” Morgan says.  The last seven months have been a whirlwind for Morgan. She kicked off the Raw after WrestleMania 40 with a beatdown of Ripley that would alter the trajectory of her career. A legitimate shoulder injury suffered in the melee forced Ripley to relinquish the title and led to Morgan beating Becky Lynch for the belt. That win kickstarted the pivotal run of her career, with new twists and turns added by the month.  “I like to believe that everything happens for a reason. Even if you don’t know the reason, I know that’s so cliche, but I really live my life by that. And so even when things happen that I feel are bizarre or even unfortunate things, I always tend to think that on the other side of it, it is going to be for a greater purpose,” Morgan says.  “There’s so much beauty in the madness and it’s cool to be able to pivot and adjust when things aren’t going the way we anticipated it, because we took something that was supposed to be great and we made it even greater. And so I just think that the stars are aligned and everything is happening exactly as it should.” Morgan has embraced the “crazy, messy love triangle” that’s followed her dynamic with Dominik Mysterio and Ripley, “whether they love to hate us or hate to love us.” Mysterio switched allegiances, Morgan joined the Judgement Day while Ripley was ousted, Raquel Rodriguez returned to join her side, and Ripley recently suffered another injury that will sideline her for the foreseeable future. Paired alongside Mysterio and thus far able to hold off Ripley, Morgan isn’t just matching the status quo for a world champion — she’s literally doing things that haven’t been done before.  The latest in her evolution from charting a Revenge Tour to creating a Liv Morgan World Tour came with a championship-worthy diamond ring, after claiming the first-ever Women’s Crown Jewel Championship in a win over Nia Jax last week.  “It means so much to me on so many different levels,” Morgan continues. “We’ve made history in Saudi Arabia. We had the very first women’s title match for the Women’s Crown Jewel Championship. And that is so much progress. I feel like since I’ve started in WWE, all I’ve wanted to do is really carve my own path and see how great I could become. And the fact that I’ve made history and the first and only Women’s Crown Jewel Champion, I am just so proud and so honored. And I just hope that I do it justice.” The opportunities are endless for where Morgan goes from here. She’s open to the idea of a second Evolution all-women’s wrestling show, with a loaded roster across Raw, Smackdown, and NXT.  “I don’t think we need our own show to be more prestigious,” Morgan says. “I think we are prestigious and I think people tune in specifically for the women’s segments and for women’s wrestling. But to give the fans what they want is why I would love to have another all women’s show in Evolution part 2.” A WrestleMania main event is something that’s eluded Morgan across her career, but calls it the pinnacle of wrestling in WWE and is without a doubt an accomplishment she’d love to check off her bucket list. “You can’t get any bigger, higher, better, more prestigious than main eventing WrestleMania,” Morgan says. “I spend a lot of my life dreaming and hoping and wishing. And I’ve been fortunate and lucky and blessed enough to have a lot of those things come true. So yes, main eventing WrestleMania is definitely on my list. With whom, I don’t know what that looks like or what it is but I hope that we can find out together.” Morgan can accomplish just about anything because at this very moment she genuinely has the faith and belief that she can. As she continues to build upon her second world title run, the Liv Morgan we see onscreen every week couldn’t be any more different than the one that was Smackdown Champion two years ago.  “It’s just a different Liv Morgan. The Liv Morgan that won the SmackDown Championship from Ronda Rousey, that girl she was just happy to be there. She maybe didn’t even see herself or believe in herself as a champion yet. She was a girl with just a pipe dream, cash in her briefcase at the right moment in the right time,” Morgan says. “This Liv Morgan is the most confident version of herself so far. This Liv Morgan knows her worth. This Liv Morgan knows she’s the greatest women’s champion of all time. This Liv Morgan knows she’s untouchable. This Liv Morgan knows she has the most dominant faction in all of WWE by her side. That’s the difference.”"

	Holmgren fell hard on his right hip after contesting a shot and had to be helped off the floor without putting weight on his right leg.","The Oklahoma City Thunder entered Sunday tied with the Suns for the top spot in the Western Conference, and figured to face a stiff test with the red-hot Golden State Warriors in town. OKC got off to a strong start, taking a 33-26 lead after the first quarter, but there was some considerable concern about their star big man as Chet Holmgren had to be helped off the floor and into the locker room after landing hard on his right hip after contesting an Andrew Wiggins layup attempt at the rim (watch here).  Holmgren slams down onto the hardwood and immediately grabbed at his right hip in pain. He was ultimately helped off the floor and into the tunnel without putting any weight on his right leg by a pair of Thunder staffers. Holmgren has gotten off to a tremendous start to his sophomore campaign, averaging 18.2 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 2.9 blocks per game coming into Sunday’s contest, asserting himself as a serious threat for DPOY with his work protecting the rim for the league’s best defense so far.  The Thunder will hope Holmgren’s injury was just a painful fall and not something more serious that could lead to an extended absence, as they are already incredibly thin at the center position with Isaiah Hartenstein still out with a fractured hand.  UPDATE: Holmgren was ruled out for the game with what the Thunder officially called a right hip injury. Shams Charania reported later Monday night that Holmgren would miss 8-10 weeks with a hip fracture."

	Giannis played a little prank on Jaylen Brown after catching him with an elbow, but the Celtics star wasn't a big fan of Giannis' antics.","The Milwaukee Bucks and Boston Celtics have had two very different starts to the season, as the defending champs have picked up where they left off with another strong beginning to their repeat bid, while the Bucks have been one of the NBA’s worst teams despite having a healthy Damian Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo.  It has not been the kind of start Milwaukee envisioned, and they were hoping to kickstart a turnaround on Sunday when they played host to the Celtics with a chance to alleviate some of the panic about the team’s start by beating one of the league’s best. As they’ve done on a few occasions this season, the Bucks came out hot, scoring 40 in the first quarter to take a double-digit lead, but couldn’t maintain that offensive output, scoring just 38 in the entire second half to see the Celtics pull ahead and pull away for a 113-107 win.  During the game, Giannis and Jaylen Brown had an interesting exchange, as Antetokounmpo elbowed Brown in the head on a post move and then hit Brown with a fake handshake as they went back down the court, which Brown didn’t seem to appreciate.   A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston)  After the game, Brown gave some brief, but unfiltered thoughts on the exchange. “Giannis is a child,” Brown dead-panned. “I’m just focused on helping my team get a win, and that’s what we did tonight.”  Giannis certainly wasn’t the chief culprit for the Bucks struggles on Sunday, as he had 43 points and 13 rebounds, but this kind of silly exchange doesn’t quite land as well with fans when the team is falling to 2-8 on the season, with the only team worse than them in the East being the Embiid-less Sixers."

	The Chiefs moved to 9-0 after blocking a 35-yard kick by Denver with one second left that would've won the game.","The Kansas City Chiefs entered Sunday as the NFL’s last remaining undefeated team at 8-0, and were heavy favorites to move to 9-0 at home against their divisional rival from Denver. However, the Chiefs offense, which has been sluggish at times this season, could not finish off drives with touchdowns and allowed the Broncos to hang around all game.  On Sunday, it looked like that would finally catch up to them and result in a loss, as the Broncos moved the ball inside the Chiefs 20 on their final drive of the game, trailing 16-14, setting up a 35-yard field goal attempt for the win by Wil Lutz. However, the Chiefs special teams unit still had at least one more miracle in them, as George Karlaftis, Leo Chenal, and company caved in the left side of the Broncos field goal unit and blocked the kick to preserve the 16-14 win.  A post shared by NFL (@nfl)  It’s an insane way for the Chiefs to win that game, as they were completely unable to run the ball (19 carries for 57 yards, 19 yards coming from Patrick Mahomes scrambling), missed a number of big play opportunities and had to settle for field goals, and gave up a critical late game drive deep into their own territory. And yet, they move on to Week 11 at 9-0 on the season with a schedule that isn’t the most difficult if they can get past a road trip to Buffalo next week — although, as Sunday proved, division games can always get weird."
Sports – UPROXX,The Bucks Have ‘Called The Whole League’ Trying To Find A Trade After Their Awful Start,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/milwaukee-bucks-trade-rumors-called-whole-league/,"Fri, 08 Nov 2024 22:30:53 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	The Bucks are trying to find a roster upgrade, but with their cap situation, they're finding it nearly impossible despite their best effort.","The Milwaukee Bucks came into the 2024-25 season hopeful that having both Damian Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo fully healthy and coming off a full training camp together would vault them back into being a threat in the Eastern Conference. Instead, the Bucks are 2-6 with their only wins over the tanking Jazz and the Sixers on opening night — who were without Joel Embiid and Paul George and have also looked awful to start the season.  It’s been rough on both sides of the ball for the Bucks, as they are in the bottom half of the league in both offensive and defensive rating through the first few weeks of the season, and while things should improve if and when Khris Middleton can get back healthy for an extended period of time, it’s also pretty clear this roster has some flaws in need of fixing. The problem for the Bucks is, as a second apron team, making a trade is extremely difficult, as they’ve found out the hard way recently.  On Friday’s episode of NBA Today, Brian Windhorst said the Bucks have “called pretty much the whole league” trying to find a trade that could improve their roster, but have run into the same issues with just about everyone.  “The Bucks are doing something that we don’t see very often, which is scouring the trade market in the first week of November,” Windhorst said. “As I was talking to teams this week, they were like, ‘The Bucks just called. The Bucks just called.’ I think the Bucks right now are just kind of searching and trying to cover their bases. And by the way, Giannis is not on the table, Dame is not on the table, they’re looking to try and (find) help for some of their wing play — Khris Middleton’s absence has been extended.  “I talked to one team who said, ‘Yeah, we talked to the Bucks. We came up with two or three different scenarios and realized we’re not allowed to make any of those trades.’ The Bucks are hemmed in as a second-apron team with the new rules. They can’t aggregate players together, they can’t put like two or three players together in a trade. They can’t do a trade where they bring in more money. They have traded away the next six first round picks, either the picks or the swaps, they have traded away the next six second round picks. They are $75 million in the luxury tax. I don’t think help is on the way through the trade market. But they are making calls, which is interesting because from what I can tell, they called pretty much the whole league.” The two players the Bucks were reported to be shopping over the summer (and even last trade deadline) were Bobby Portis and Pat Connaughton, but as Windhorst notes, being unable to aggregate those salaries together means they have to find a player to trade for that matches salary exactly or makes just a little less than either of those two. Given Portis makes just over $12.5 million and Connaughton makes just under $9.5 million, that’s a tough thing to do if the goal is to add a strong contributor for a contender. As such, Windy doesn’t expect them to find a miraculous deal out there, and it sounds like, despite the front office’s best efforts in working the phones, it’s going to come down to this roster to turn things around in Milwaukee."

	Come get these winners.","More than half of the 2024 NFL regular season is over. That reality is painful for those enjoy consuming every aspect of professional football and, in this space, things haven’t gone particularly well. In fact, it was largely a disaster for the first seven weeks but, after back-to-back winning performances, optimism is beginning to creep in.  Would it have been better if the Cleveland Browns or Green Bay Packers could’ve taken care of business last week? Certainly. But here we are after a 3-2 showing. Before handing out this week’s selections, let’s take stock as we dig out of the hole.  Come get these winners. I am actually quite high on the Bills dating back to the summer, but I can’t get them to -4 here. Buffalo is riding high with a four-game winning streak, which helps to explain the number, and Indianapolis has flopped with two straight losses. Still, Joe Flacco and company shouldn’t be getting a full four at home, and we have to take the candy. This is just a principle play. We’re taking advantage of a Wong teaser here, sending Pittsburgh through a pair of key numbers and doing the same with Kansas City. The Steelers have been a wagon as an underdog under Mike Tomlin. The Chiefs will eventually lose (I think) but it won’t be here.  As noted a week ago, this credit goes to UPROXX editor Robby Kalland, but NFC South overs are unbeaten this season. Perhaps that will come to an end here, but Atlanta’s offense can put up points in bunches and its defense is capable of letting the Saints hang around. Let’s go touchdowns. I have to admit that I hate this. I know my editors will hate this. But Los Angeles is laying more than a touchdown with a total in the 30’s? It isn’t as if the Chargers have a real home-field advantage either. I’m holding my nose as I type this, but I simply must. New York has been a sharp side all week, and that makes sense. I couldn’t quite give out the Jets in an awesome spot last week, but I think this is a sell-high spot on Arizona after their blowout win over Chicago. Take me there, Aaron Rodgers."

The track, a cover of Ron Sexsmith’s “Maybe This Christmas,” got teased on the project’s Instagram account over the last week and on the latest edition of the Kelce brothers’ podcast, and was officially unveiled on Friday.  A post shared by A Philly Special Christmas (@aphillyspecialchristmas)  “There are no words to describe how incredible it is to have Stevie Nicks on this record,” executive producer Conner Barwin said in a statement given to Rolling Stone. “There is so much emotion in this song, and it was thrilling to be with them in the studio and watch her and Jason connect, be creative together, and witness this beautiful song become a reality.” A Philly Special Christmas Party will come out on Nov. 22, 2024, but if you’d like to listen to the new track, you can do that right here."

	In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, Most Valuable Promotions clarified that the record-breaking boxing match was not rigged in Paul’s favor. 
	“It is further illogical and inane that MVP, in the debut of a hopeful long-term partnership with the world’s biggest streamer—an organization that made its first-ever foray into live professional sports with Paul vs. Tyson—would even so much as consider such a perverse violation of the rules of competition,” detailed the statement. 
	Earlier this month, the former YouTube vlogger faced off against the former undisputed world heavyweight champion in a boxing match broadcast on Netflix. The bout, which had viewers fighting streaming issues, resulted in a unanimous decision victory for Paul in the officially sanctioned match.  
	After the fight, Michael Irvin, sports commentator and former NFL player, joined Cam’Ron and Mase’s It Is What It Is talk show and shared his belief that the results of the match were predetermined. 

	








 
	“That fight was a lie,” he exclaimed. “Everybody’s lying […] they had no intentions to really strap it on. If you look through that, I didn’t see one patented uppercut by Mike Tyson. What did Mike Tyson win on? Uppercut.”

He eventually landed on his dad’s Los Angeles Lakers squad in the second round of this year’s NBA draft. After just a few games, however, he was sent to play in the NBA’s G League to build up his skills.  
	Upon his arrival, it was reported that Bronny would “shuttle” between both teams during an undisclosed period of time and will only be playing in G League home games, as to not fly commercial with his South Bay Lakers teammates. It is also reported that Bronny would be skipping road games due to the team staying at affordable hotels like the Courtyard-Marriott, rubbing many, including former NFL star and podcaster Ryan Clark, the wrong way.

	








 
	On his The Pivot podcast, Clark shared his confusion over Bronny’s ability to skip games due to travel and lodging accommodations when he hasn’t earned his stripes as an athlete just yet.

	“What has Bronny James done that he shouldn’t be able to stay at the Courtyard-Marriott?,” Clark questioned. “You say, ‘well, they fly commercial.’ What has Bronny James done where he should be too good to fly commercial? The pros isn’t about where you came from, how you were raised, what your parents had. Professional sports is about how well you can contribute, and you don’t get treated differently because of your parents.” A post shared by The Neighborhood Talk (@theneighborhoodtalk) 
	Many agree with Clark, including ESPN reporter Brian Windhorst, who believes coddling Bronny now will be “detrimental” to his career, adding that he believes the special treatment the former USC student receives from the Lakers has gone “too far,” The Post reports.   
	Another ESPN insider, however, is arguing that the Lakers are treating Bronny differently because, well, he’s different.  
	“Bronny James isn’t just your normal, everyday G League player,” ESPN’s Shams Charania said on The Pat McAfee Show on Tuesday. 
	“I don’t know if it’s a security thing, but there’s a different level of fanfare when he’s on the road for these G League games, a different level of everything when he’s with that G League team. How do you manage that on the road? I don’t think the door is necessarily completely shut on him playing in those road games as the G League season goes on, but as of right now that is the plan that the Lakers have laid out, and they want him to continue to shuttle back and forth, spend as much time on the active roster as possible.”

	Michael Irvin continued his assessment of the fight and rumored contrast terms by drawing a parallel to his NFL career. “That’s like making me play a game without running a slant route in the deep end or the deep out,” he said. “You do what you do best. If they take that away, you ain’t that dude anymore, and they took that away.” 
DJ Whoo Kid supported Irvin’s claims when he recounted a conversation he had with Jake Paul at a fight after-party, saying, “Legally they each cannot go at each other hard.” Despite being disappointed by how the boxing match went, the former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver was happy to see Mike Tyson secure a large payday. “I’m happy he got every dime, or whatever it is,” he said. “I want him to get his money. I just wanted him to free the beast.” 
	Per the final tally of the fight, Tyson threw 97 punches and only landed 18. Paul threw 278 punches and landed 78. Iron Mike was paid $20 million and Paul got $40 million. One valid explanation for the underwhelming bout is the health issues Tyson dealt with in the lead-up, which made them postpone the match as it was originally booked for July. He suffered from an ulcer flare-up and revealed that he almost died in June. 

	








 
	“This is one of those situations when you lost but still won,” Mike Tyson wrote on X. “I’m grateful for last night. No regrets to get in ring one last time. I almost died in June. Had 8 blood transfusions. Lost half my blood and 25lbs in hospital and had to fight to get healthy to fight so I won. To have my children see me stand toe to toe and finish 8 rounds with a talented fighter half my age in front of a packed Dallas Cowboy stadium is an experience that no man has the right to ask for. Thank you.” 
	“I wanted to give the fans a show, but I didn’t want hurt someone who didn’t need to be hurt,” Jake Paul said of the match. “I didn’t wanna hurt someone that didn’t need to be hurt.”  Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox"

According to a press release issued by Netflix, the event raked viewers from 60 million households, making it one of the most-watched sporting events of the year. However, the viewing experience notably wasn’t smooth for a lot of people who tuned in, and the streaming service has been hit with a new lawsuit over the “streaming issues.” 
TMZ Sports reports that Ronald “Blue” Denton filed the class-action lawsuit suit in Florida on Monday (Nov. 19). The outlet reports Denton made the legal move “just three days after he says he and thousands of others struggled to watch Netflix‘s broadcast.”

	








 
	According to court documents obtained by the site, the suit states viewers “were faced with legendary problems, including: no access, streaming glitches, and buffering issues.”

	People’s complaints about the quality of Netflix’s stream were well-documented in realtime on social media during the night of the showdown. One user wrote, “How are y’all gonna have the biggest fight of the year on your platform & y’all stream can’t go longer than 5 minutes without buffering… WTF Netflix.” 
	Another person raised concerns about another major event next month and expressed doubt about whether or not Netflix could handle the traffic. “Netflix couldn’t even stream a Tyson fight right but now they doing a Christmas NFL game. Featuring Beyonce. Ok bro,” they sarcastically typed. 
	The match up resulted in a victory for the famous YouTuber, as Mike Tyson was defeated in 8 rounds by a unanimous decision. A hot topic of the night was the age disparity between the two contenders; Paul is 27 and Mike Tyson is 58, which drew a fair amount of both intrigue and criticism from fans.

Sports,Bobby Portis Offers $40K Reward For “Prized Possessions” Stolen In Burglary,https://www.vibe.com/news/sports/bobby-portis-reward-prized-possesions-stolen-burglary-1234950302/,"Tue, 19 Nov 2024 17:15:11 +0000",Portis is the latest professional athlete to fall victim to a home invasion.,"NBA star Bobby Portis is offering a hefty reward for information leading to the recovery of “prized possessions” that were stolen during a burglary at his Wisconson home.  
	On Nov. 6, Portis, the Milwaukee Bucks forward released a public message via Instagram pleading for the public’s assistance in locating the stolen items, which he’s willing to pay $40,000 cash for. In the video, Portis spoke of his love for the city of Milwaukee, where he became a resident after signing a deal with the Bucks organization in 2020. 
	“Over the last four-and-a-half seasons, I’ve considered Milwaukee as a home,” Portis, 29, said. “I’ve grown here, I come here a boy and elevated into a man. The love you guys have given me here isn’t something I’ve ever felt before in my NBA career.”

	








 
	He continued, explaining the circumstances behind the burglary, which occurred while Portis was out of town for the Bucks’ matchup against the Cleveland Cavaliers earlier this month.

	“While I was at the game yesterday, we had a home invasion and they took most of my prized possessions,” Portis added, expressing the importance that the items, which he did not specify, hold to him and his family. 
	The burglary of Portis’ home marks the latest in a string of home invasions seemingly targeting professional athletes that have occurred in recent months. 
	In September, Minnesota Timberwolves guard Mike Conley’s Minnesota home was broken into and ransacked, with jewelry being listed among the items stolen. Authorities believe the burglary of Portis and Conley’s homes could possibly be connected due to similarities in the two break-ins, despite occurring in neighboring states. 
	NFL stars and reigning Super Bowl champions Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce’s homes were also burglarized in October, within a 48-hour period of one another. While no items were reported as stolen from Mahomes’ residence, the culprits in the burglary of Kelce’s home made off with $20,000 after breaking into the property through a rear door.

	








 
	Drafted in the first round of the 2015 NBA Draft by the Chicago Bulls, Portis has spent time with Bulls, Washington Wizards, and New York Knicks before joining the Bucks, winning a championship with the team in 2021.

	Netflix had its first live boxing event on Friday night (Nov. 15) with a card headlined by the Jake Paul, 27, and Mike Tyson, 58—the widest age disparity in sanctioned boxing history. And the generation divide wasn’t the only stark distinction between the two men. 
	Jake Paul came out to to the ring to Phil Collins’ “In The Air Tonight,” riding in a customized low-rider with his brother Logan Paul. The entrance was jam-packed with thinly veiled jabs at Tyson, with the song referencing the boxer’s appearance in The Hangover, and even a bird, referencing the “Now Kith” meme. Tyson, however, walked out to the ring with pure intention of throwing down and nothing more. And all the built-up tension was released as the two combatants entered the ring for the highly-anticipated showdown. 
	While both Tyson and Paul promised to knock the other boxer out before the 5th round, the match surprisingly went for the entire eight rounds. Tyson came out swinging for the first two rounds but Father Time quickly got Iron Mike together, as the icon began to slow down with each subsequent round. Paul kept to a moderate pace throughout the whole match.

	Jake Paul’s even-keeled strategy allowed him to drastically out-punch Tyson throughout the match. By round four, Tyson’s legs looked tired and shaky, which were tell-tale signs of exhaustion for a boxer. 
	As the fight ended in round 8, Jake Paul began bowing to Mike Tyson out of respect for “being an all-time great in this sport” and for “all that he’s done to allow us to be here.” Tyson kept his guard up but gave Paul some dap as he realized the fight was over. In what played out like more of a sparring match than a headlined main attraction, judges declared that Paul was the winner in a unanimous decision. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox"

Kiyan Anthony, Carmelo Anthony‘s son, has made his college decision, and he’s committing to Syracuse University. The young basketball player appeared on Melo’s 7PM in Brooklyn podcast alongside his dad and his mother, La La Anthony, where he broke the news himself. Kiyan had been stewing over his final schools, consisting of USC and Auburn, but felt like ‘Cuse was where he needed to be. 
	Kiyan explained to everyone that what he loved the most about playing for ‘Cuse outside of the connection to his dad were marquee match-ups against universities like Duke and North Carolina. Anthony expressed that the national spotlight would benefit both him and the rest of his teammates who are looking to restore Syracuse to greatness and possible futures in the NBA. “All that played a part into why I chose Syracuse,” Kiyan said on the podcast. 
	“I’m overwhelmed,” La La said following her son’s announcement during the podcast. “I’m happy because he’s happy…It’s big shoes to fill, but at the same time, this is his moment, his lane and his time to create his own reality.”

	Kiyan Anthony also talked to ESPN about his decision, saying, “Ultimately, it came down to my relationship with the staff. From day one, when they started recruiting me, they made me feel like it was family. My dad’s name on the facility is special, but I want to go in there and create my own name, and I’ve already done that through my dedication in the offseason, with early-morning practices, playing at camps, playing on the circuit.” 
	Kiy then spoke about the culture that Coach Adrian Autry is trying to establish with the Orangemen basketball unit. Anthony expressed to the outlet that Autry, who was named the head coach after the 2022-23 season, had already begun getting to work on the 2025 season. 
	“I’m going to do everything Coach Autry needs me to do,” Anthony added. “We talk a lot, especially late at night, about how we can make Syracuse basketball great. Off the court, Coach is super cool. You could go out with him on a Friday night. He’s still young and connects with all his players; he is very relatable.” 
	While Carmelo Anthony only played one season for the Orangemen, his impact on the university is undeniable. 
	During his lone 2003 season, Melo, a freshman, led the Orangemen to a storybook national championship. His performance was one for the ages, with the Brooklyn native being named both an All-American and the NCAA Final Four’s Most Outstanding Player. Kiyan understands the pressure, but wants to carve out his own page in the NCAA history books.

Thursday (Nov. 14) found the two men doing their final weigh-in and stare down ahead of their Netflix exhibition. Tyson weighed in at 233 pounds and promptly took his spot on stage. Paul was clocked at 220 pounds, a career-high for him, and then began his usual antics. Hitting the stage in a crawling stance, Jake Paul then immediately began running toward Iron Mike, getting directly in his face. 
ESPN reports that around this time, the YouTuber “purposefully” stepped on Tyson’s foot, to which he responded by slapping him in the face. A source close to the event claimed that Mike Tyson had grown “tired” of the content creator’s trash talk in the days leading up to Thursday. So, Paul stepping on the OG’s foot finally set him over the top, resulting in him slapping his opponent. “[Mike Tyson] hits like a bi**h! It’s personal now. He must die!” Paul dramatically screamed to the crowd while Tyson walked away from the stage.

Throughout the event’s rollout, Tyson and Paul have played it fast and loose, keeping the banter semi-playful while throwing in a couple of laughs and jabs here and there. However, as the day of the fight quickly approached, Tyson transformed into something far more intense. On Tuesday (Nov. 12), the boxing legend talked to reporters about the fight, promising to unleash “the devil himself” on Friday night.

Former NBA stars Carmelo Anthony and Rudy Gay recently chimed in on the recent back and forth between Drake and DeMar DeRozan, which was a byproduct of the 6 God’s feud with Kendrick Lamar earlier this year. 
	“I think Drake was hurt a little bit because of the relationship he built with DeMar in Toronto,” Melo said on an episode of his show 7PM In Brooklyn. “Representing the 6, Raptors — you know that was a lot of connection with those two. He’s a Raptor for life from a basketball standpoint. Yes, that jersey should be going up.” 

	








 
	Gay, who just recently retired from the NBA, previously played for the Raptors, and is a new recurring co-host on 7PM, disapproved of Drizzy’s behavior. “That’s wack, man. Drake is wack for that,” he asserted. “You gotta pull up on DeMar if you feel that way before you go on camera.” Melo agreed, especially regarding the Toronto rapper’s comments on taking down DeRozan’s banner if the Raptors ever hung one up for him.

	“Drake did a lot when he said I’ma go up there and take it down. That part is a lot,” Carmelo Anthony said. However, he acknowledged that DeRozan turned himself into Drake’s opposition when he joined Kendrick Lamar on stage at The Pop Out concert and appeared in the “Not Like Us” music video. “Those are shots. You my man, we in the crib, we hanging, we building the 6 up. From that standpoint, that would f**k me up, too. I’m gonna feel a way no matter what, but yes, you do have a conversation. As a man, you have a conversation.” 
	Though Rudy Gay did not like the “First Person Shooter” rapper’s actions, he leveled with Anthony on that part. “If you got a problem, come at me,” he said. “To see your man’s out there dancing with the enemy, that’s kinda crazy.” 
	Drake and DeMar DeRozan went viral earlier this month when the For All The Dogs rapper sat courtside for the Toronto Raptors matchup against the Sacramento Kings. At one point, he was interviewed on air and said, “Unfortunately, we’re playing this goof [DeRozan] tonight, but it is what it is” as well as “If you ever put up a DeRozan banner, I’ll go up there and pull it down myself.”

	








 
	After the Raptors defeated the Kings, Drake could be seen mouthing “F**k outta here pu**y” as DeRozan walked off the court. During a post-game press conference, the six-time All-Star was asked about the comments regarding the banner and said, “Well he gon’ have a long way to climb to take it down, so tell him good luck.” 
	This is a significant change in their relationship, just three years after DeRozan said that Drake would “forever have a friend” in him. When he was traded from the Raptors to the Spurs, despite being told he would not be traded, the five-time Grammy winner invited him to his house and gave him support in his time of disappointment. Even after appearing at The Pop Out and in the “Not Like Us” music video, he claimed that he still had love for the OVO head honcho. Those days are seemingly over.

Let the bidding war for Juan Soto begin.  Five teams have offers on the table for the superstar outfielder, according to multiple reports. Those five teams are the New York Yankees, New York Mets, Boston Red Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers and Toronto Blue Jays. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM New York Yankees outfielder Juan Soto, #22, celebrates after hitting a solo home run in the third inning against the Los Angeles Dodgers during game two of the 2024 World Series at Dodger Stadium. (Jayne Kamin-Oncea-Imagn Images) Those contracts were made late last week, according to the report. The next step in the process will be negotiations between the teams and Soto’s agent, Scott Boras.  Soto, 26, is reportedly believed to be seeking a 15-year contract that is worth more than Shohei Ohtani’s $700 million deal. Ohtani’s deal is 10 years, and he deferred the majority of his contract, whereas Soto apparently is not interested in deferring money.  The four-time All Star is coming off the best season of his already remarkable career, batting .288 while slugging a career-high 41 home runs, finishing third in AL MVP voting while batting in front of the MVP in Aaron Judge.  During the Yankees' run to the World Series, Soto was even better, hitting .327 while having an on base percentage of .469 while hitting four home runs.  The Blue Jays tried to trade for Soto last offseason but could not get a deal done with the San Diego Padres. The Blue Jays also tried to sign Ohtani but fell short in their pursuit of adding a superstar. AARON JUDGE DOESN'T CARE IF JUAN SOTO GETS BIGGER CONTRACT FROM YANKEES: 'IT AIN'T MY MONEY' New York Yankees outfielder Juan Soto, #22, celebrates with outfielder Aaron Judge, #99, after hitting a solo home run in the third inning against the Los Angeles Dodgers during game two of the 2024 World Series at Dodger Stadium. (Jayne Kamin-Oncea-Imagn Images) Some are questioning whether the Dodgers can afford to sign Soto after handing out over $1 billion dollars of total money in contracts last offseason, but with Ohtani deferring a lot of his contract, they have enough money to at least make an offer. The Red Sox met with Soto for three hours in California in their hopes of luring the five-time Silver Slugger away from their bitter rival, according to MLB.com. The Mets have the richest owner in the sport in Steve Cohen and may need every penny they can muster to steer Soto away from the Bronx and over to Queens, where he and star shortstop Francisco Lindor would form a dynamic duo atop the lineup.  Soto met with the Yankees last Monday, when the team sent owner Hal Steinbrenner, team president Randy Levine, general manager Brian Cashman, special assistant to the general manager Omar Minaya and manager Aaron Boone to California, according to NJ.com.

The San Jose State women’s volleyball program has been engulfed in controversy for having a transgender athlete on its roster this season. A federal judge in Colorado ruled Monday that Blaire Fleming will be allowed to play for the Spartans in the Mountain West Conference tournament, putting to rest – at least for now – one of the major controversies that have been the talking point of the season. Fleming led the team in kills during the regular season with 297 and has a team-leading 3.86 kills per set. As San Jose State came under fire for having Fleming on the team, the volleyball star’s play came under scrutiny.

(Andrew Wevers/Getty Images) Fleming raised eyebrows at points during the season with some vicious spikes that ricocheted off opponents. It has led to criticism of how much power Fleming is putting into the kills and whether the player has more strength as a transgender athlete. However, current and former women’s volleyball figures downplayed the criticism surrounding Fleming’s abilities. ""A lot of players that I talk to have been like, 'Have you been in the Nebraska gym? Have you been in the Texas gym?’ These biological women are hitting the ball just as hard or maybe, probably, harder and jumping even higher and all these things,"" Logan Eggleston, a former Texas Longhorns star and AVCA National Player of the Year, told ESPN.  ""That's kind of the conversation I've been hearing, is, 'Yeah, this woman at San Jose State, yes, she might be transgender, but that doesn't make her this superhuman athlete that's crushing other people.'""

""At the end of the day, all these top-25, top-50 big-time programs have male practice players, male coaches constantly playing. If we're talking about danger, I feel like that's not a fair argument to make in this situation."" Penn State’s Serena Gay said she gets hit in the face at practice ""everyday"" and that the type of spikes Fleming has delivered is ""normal."" Fleming’s play has been deemed unsafe, and it was one of the points in the lawsuit filed against the Mountain West Conference. Brooke Slusser, Fleming’s teammate who was one of the plaintiffs involved in the suit, told KTVU-TV in San Francisco before Monday’s ruling she was leaving practices with bruises from getting hit and has needed to dodge balls coming after her.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The New York Jets have brought in a familiar face to help them with their general manager and head coaching search, but it’s a move that’s baffling some because it’s a former executive who the organization fired years ago. Former Jets GM Mike Tannenbaum and his ""The 33rd Team"" were brought in by Gang Green to help them identify, vet and coordinate interviews and candidates for two high-level jobs, according to the New York Post. The Jets are getting a head start compared to other teams that could be in the same position after New York let Joe Douglas go a few weeks after head coach Robert Saleh was dismissed from his duties. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Mike Tannenbaum (Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports/File) Jets owner Woody Johnson will reportedly oversee the search that The 33rd Team will have a hand in, as well as other Jets executives still in the front office. Tannenbaum and former Vikings GM Rick Spielman will be the ""primary representatives"" of The 33rd Team, according to the Post, and the latter had a say in picking a GM and coach last season for the Washington Commanders.  The Commanders appear to be in a great spot after their hires before the 2024 campaign, bringing in Adams Peters as GM and Dan Quinn as their new head coach. Washington is currently in the playoff hunt in the NFC.  FORMER JETS GM JOE DOUGLAS FELT ‘RELIEF’ AFTER FIRING: REPORT The Post reports that The 33rd Team, while helping out with the search, will also provide studies on best hiring practices, data analysis and more from the past five years.  While Spielman helped an organization last season, Tannenbaum is someone who knows what Johnson is looking for personally. He was the Jets’ GM from 2006 to 2012 and oversaw the team’s roster during its last trip to the playoffs. Tannenbaum was responsible for drafting Darrelle Revis, Nick Mangold, D’Brickashaw Ferguson and more Jets that led to those playoff seasons. However, Tannenbaum’s 15-year tenure with the Jets ended after the team missed the playoffs for the second straight season in 2012. And some on social media couldn’t understand why New York would have someone they fired over a decade ago help them now.  New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, center, then-coach Rex Ryan, left, and then-GM Mike Tannenbaum (Kirby Lee/Image of Sport-USA TODAY Sports/File) There were even some thinking Tannenbaum would ""just end up hiring himself,"" one X user said.  ""This is how dumb the New York Jets owner Woody Johnson is,"" another X user posted. ""He is resorting back to Mike Tannenbaum again to decide what’s best for their future as a franchise. He is below average at best with a 57-55 record as the Jets GM."" With Tannenbaum returning to help the Jets, some have even suggested the team get the band back together by hiring Rex Ryan with Tannenbaum going back to GM. Ryan did mention on Barstool Sports’ ""Pardon My Take"" that he has ""some unfinished business with that franchise."" Since leaving the Jets, Tannenbaum served as the executive vice president of football operations for the Miami Dolphins before joining ESPN as an analyst. Mike Tannenbaum (Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports/File) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Jets have hired three GMs since Tannenbaum’s departure: John Izdik, Mike Macaggnan and Douglas, all of whom were unable to deploy a roster to end the team’s playoff drought.

A dozen women jointly filed the suit against the Mountain West and its commissioner, alleging violations of Title IX and their First Amendment rights. Among the women are SJSU co-volleyball captain Brooke Slusser and two former Spartans as well as athletes from other Mountain West schools.  Crews, however, wrote that the plaintiffs’ request for an emergency delay ""was not reasonable"" and ""would risk confusion and upend months of planning and would prejudice, at a minimum, (San Jose State) and other teams participating in the tournament."" ""The movants have failed to meet their burden to show irreparable harm, a likelihood of success on the merits, or that the balance of harms or equities is in their favor,"" Crews wrote in his decision.  Blaire Fleming of San Jose State is shown during the match against Air Force, Oct. 19, 2024, in Colorado Springs, Colo.

They also wanted Fleming banned from the tournament.  Instead, Crews’ ruling allows Fleming to play for the Spartans, who are the No. 2 seed and have a first-round bye.  Boise State, Wyoming, Utah State and Nevada were among the conference teams to cancel games against the Spartans due to Fleming’s presence on the team.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. In the realm of sports media, it came as a surprise news broke that TNT’s famous basketball pre- and post-game show ""Inside the NBA"" would be moving to ESPN.  One of its stars was just as shocked as the rest of us after finding out when everyone else did.  Charles Barkley, who stars on ""Inside the NBA"" alongside Ernie Johnson, Shaquille O’Neal, and Kenny ""The Jet"" Smith, recently said that there was no word from Warner Bros’ Discovery’s Turner Sports about the move before he learned when the news broke.

""They haven’t even told us we lost the NBA. ""We have to hear it through the media. And even this thins with ABC/ESPN, I heard about it on the internet. Scott Van Pelt, Brian Windhorst, Elle Duncan, Bob Myers, all friends of whine who I really like a lot. They texted me welcoming me to the ESPN family. I’m like, ‘What happened?’ TNT didn’t even have the courtesy."" CHARLES BARKLEY SAYS HE TURNED DOWN ‘MINIMUM OF $100 MILLION’ TO STAY WITH TNT Barkley added that it felt like the ""Inside the NBA"" team ""got traded,"" but considering his time playing in the NBA, it’s common courtesy to let that person know before it makes the news.  ""If I was going to trade somebody that I had respect for and appreciate, I would at least give them a heads up,"" he said. ""I wouldn’t let them hear about it from other people or the internet."" Before this move, Barkley had been really vocal about Turner Sports’ rift with its NBA media rights, with ""Inside the NBA,"" a program the famous quartet have been a part of since 2000, potentially closing up shop.  Jan 21, 2023; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Phoenix Suns former player Charles Barkley in attendance at Footprint Center. (Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports) Back in August, after the NBA signed a new media rights deal with ESPN, NBC and Amazon Prime, Barkley said that he could’ve gone anywhere, but wanted to stay with the team he knew for over two decades. He later backtracked his statement that this season would be his last, saying he wanted to work with TNT leaders to develop new shows and more sports content.  TNT felt they weren’t able to fairly match the new deal, leading to a lawsuit that was eventually settled with the two sides inking multi-year agreements that would continue ""Inside the NBA.""  Then, ESPN confirmed reports last week, saying an agreement was struck with TNT Sports where, except when the show goes on the road, TNT would continue independently produce the show from its Atlanta studios with the foursome intact. It will, however, appear on ESPN and ABC starting in the 2025-26 season.   TNT basketball analyst Charles Barkley on air before the NCAA Mens Basketball Tournament Final Four semifinal game between the Purdue Boilermakers and the North Carolina State Wolfpack at State Farm Stadium on April 06, 2024 in Glendale, Arizona.  (Mitchell Layton/Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Next season begins the 11-year media rights extension ESPN has with the NBA.  Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. When you hear a star player say the team played ""soft as f---"" after yet another blowout loss, the head coach is going to be questioned about whether he still has control of the locker room.  That's what happened to Brian Daboll on Monday morning following the New York Giants' loss at home to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 30-7.  Rookie receiver Malik Nabers, frustrated he didn't see a single target from new starting quarterback Tommy DeVito in the first half, was blunt with his team assessment after the game, which Daboll said led to some conversations.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM New York Giants wide receiver Malik Nabers warms up for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers game at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on Nov. 24, 2024. (Vincent Carchietta-Imagn Images)  ""Leek and I talked last night. We talked this morning. He’s a very competitive individual,"" Daboll told members of the media. ""Again, you want to get the ball in his hands, and I gotta do a better job getting the ball in his hands early. He’s a smart young guy who’s very competitive. When you lose like that, it’s a frustrating thing, but we’ve had good communication as we’ve always had."" Daboll added that he was going to keep what was said in-house, but Nabers wasn't the only one who felt the team lacked effort in the first game post-Daniel Jones' release.  STEPHEN A. SMITH'S CLAIM THAT GIANTS REACHED OUT TO ESPN ABOUT ELLE DUNCAN'S CRITICISM IS FALSE: REPORT Team captain Dexter Lawrence, who was vocal about the Jones situation, also said the team was playing ""soft"" on Sunday, while offensive lineman Jermaine Eluemunor said, ""I personally don't think everybody is giving 100%."" With a 2-9 record now and the organization virtually punting on the season with the release of Jones, who many believed was their best quarterback on the roster despite his own struggles, it's hard to rally the troops to finish the year strong.  But Daboll continues to say he believes in the process and culture that he and the coaching staff have in the locker room.  Malik Nabers on the bench during the Giants' 30-7 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at MetLife Stadium. (IMAGN) ""I believe in what we do. Obviously, the results have not shown themselves,"" Daboll said. ""I believe in the people, and we’ll continue to work as hard as we can, but certainly you think about things you need to change, whether it’s plays – whatever it may be. You’re always thinking what can you do better, and obviously there’s things you can do better. ""I feel good about our communication with the players, with the coaches. Certainly not happy about the results, but I expect a lot from those guys, and they should expect a lot from me. Again, there’s good communication process, but when you lose like that, it’s a frustrating thing."" Daboll, of course, doesn't want his players to be speaking about their frustrations publicly, but like he said, he respects their opinions on the matter.  It is tough for the Giants, though, because there are still six games left on the schedule, including a quick turnaround against the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving this week. Players are frustrated with the results, and losing six straight games is strenuous in a locker room no matter the sport.  New York Giants head coach Brian Daboll looks on before the game at MetLife Stadium.

For coaches, finishing strong can be the difference between another year leading the team, or having to look for a new job next season.  That's the unfortunate reality Daboll and some players in the locker room find themselves in with those remaining games on the schedule.  Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

Not everyone was happy at the time.,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. WWE star CM Punk made his return to the company one year ago Monday and the company put together a video showing the behind-the-scenes reactions and interactions with him. It had been a decade since Punk left WWE, walking out of the company after disagreements with then-CEO Vince McMahon and chief content officer Paul ""Triple H"" Levesque. Punk did his own thing for quite a while. He gave MMA a try – in the cage and in the broadcast booth. He returned to pro wrestling in 2021 with All Elite Wrestling (AEW) and had two tumultuous years there. He departed AEW in September 2023.

(Joe Camporeale-USA Today Sports) Two months later, he showed up following the end of Survivor Series: War Games in Chicago – his hometown. It was one of the most shocking surprises in recent memory. Rumors ran rampant in the days and weeks leading into the premium live event, but each thought was met with skepticism. Until, as Levesque put it at the time, hell froze over. The WWE video showed Punk entering the Gorilla Position backstage with executive Bruce Prichard. He greeted Stephanie McMahon and others before he received his cue to go out to the thunderous applause. Fellow WWE stars watched the moment backstage. Wrestlers Bayley and Shotzi were among those surprised. ""What a way to do it,"" Shotzi said. Bayley ran to Gorilla Position to greet her longtime friend when he returned from the stage. ""I’m so happy you’re here,"" she said. Punk greeted nearly everyone who walked out from the men’s War Games match, including Cody Rhodes, Rhea Ripley, Damian Priest, Dominik Mysterio and Randy Orton. Orton also made his return to the WWE on the same night. CM Punk makes a shocking return to WWE on Nov. 25, 2023. (WWE) JOHN CENA TO COMPETE IN 2025 ROYAL RUMBLE EVENT AS WWE LEGEND EMBARKS ON FAREWELL TOUR ""Can I not enjoy 10 minutes of my f---ing return,"" Orton said with a smile. The video didn’t show Seth Rollins and Drew McIntyre’s reactions to Punk’s return. Neither wrestler appeared to be happy to see Punk back in WWE. While pro wrestlers are good at blurring the lines or reality and storyline angles, both acknowledge the real-life tensions they’ve had with Punk in the past. McIntyre told Fox News Digital in October that their issues were very real but had to put business first. ""You can feel the tension,"" he said. ""Everyone could feel the tension when him and I are near each other. We have to be professionals and do our job. We understand, we’ve been doing this a long time, that real personal issues, real hatred draws money. We also know when that bell rings, we can really lean into each other. None of us are going to complain and when we’re on the microphone, we can see how we feel. Both of us have thick skin, unlike a lot of our superstars – they want to cry whenever I tweet about them. I do appreciate that about them. ""But you can feel the tension when we’re around. And I remember there was some picture that came out online recently, and it was the big talk of the internet because Punk and I were close to each other during the day, and it was, ‘Oh my God they really don’t dislike each other.’ I was like, yeah, you frickin’ idiots. You don’t go to your office job and have to stand beside the guy you don’t like in your office occasionally just because someone snapped a picture of that moment because we’re dealing with a situation you have to deal with in your profession even if you can’t stand the p----."" Punk’s WWE return started with the McIntyre feud. It began at the Royal Rumble in January when McIntyre tore Punk’s triceps performing a move on him. From there, Punk tormented McIntyre and even cost him his brief World Heavyweight Championship reign at WrestleMania 40.

When I switched into golf, we were struggling a little bit financially, and so I didn't have the luxury to go out and buy a whole new golf-appropriate wardrobe. And so, I wore what was in my closet, which was workout clothes. That's just how I learned to play the game."" Spiranac said she considers golfers athletes and wondered ""why don’t we dress like athletes?"" She remarked about Lucas Glover sweating through his clothes during a PGA Tour event as why golfers should be able to wear what they are comfortable with. LIV golfers, for instance, are allowed to wear shorts during their competitions. ""That was always my mindset when I got into golf, and it really rubs people the wrong way, which is shocking,"" she said.

Lia Thomas, a transgender NCAA champion swimmer who caused controversy in the sport for competing against and winning races over women during the 2021-22 season, railed against an Iowa law that prohibited trans athletes in women’s and girls’ sports. Thomas spoke at the Trans Athletes and the Future of Sports event at Iowa State University earlier this month. Dr. Kelly Winfrey, an associate professor in women gender studies at the school, moderated the event, and Dr. Christina Roberts, a pediatrics professor specializing in adolescent health, joined One Iowa Policy and Advocacy Director Keenan Crow at the event.

(Brett Davis-USA TODAY Sports) Their talk dove into Iowa’s ban on trans inclusion in female sports, according to the Iowa State Daily. Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds signed the bill into law in March 2022. Several others states have since enacted their own laws against trans inclusion in women’s sports as well. ""With the ban here in Iowa … the state is actively saying to trans kids, ‘You don’t deserve to participate. You are actually being excluded,"" the former UPenn swimmer said at the Nov. 13 event. Thomas underscored the value that participating in sports added to the former swimmer’s everyday life. ""I had a team, a group I could identify with… it gave me that belonging,"" Thomas said. ""Athletics and, for me, the water, was just … a place of peace where I could leave my worries outside."" Crow said the ban on trans inclusion in sports barred transgender women and girls from the positivity sports can provide. ""Excluding trans athletes from sports denies them the chance to participate in a part of life that teaches resilience, teamwork and community… there’s value in just being on a team and being included, especially for young people who might be struggling to find acceptance,"" Crow said.  Roberts downplayed trans athletes having an advantage in women's sports after going through male puberty – pointing to studies that allegedly showed hormone therapy treatments lowering testosterone levels of female athletes in two years.

Paula Scanlan, who was Thomas’ teammate at UPenn, told the House Judiciary subcommittee last year that Thomas’ presence in the locker room created a bigger issue for her as a survivor of sexual assault. ""This is real. I know women who have lost roster spots and spots on the podium. I know of women with sexual trauma who are adversely impacted by having biological males in their locker room without their consent. I know this because I am one of these women,"" Scanlan said. ""I was sexually assaulted on June 3rd of 2016. I was only 16 years old. I was able to forgive my attacker but violence against women still exists. Let us not forget the viral #MeToo movement that empowered female victims to speak up.

Trouba broke his silence about the news Tuesday. “It doesn’t really matter,” Trouba said after the Rangers’ optional practice. “I’m happy to be here. I’m focused on playing hockey. Can’t really control that, I think I learned that throughout the summer. Gotta kind of walk all that out and focus on playing hockey with this group here and being the best we can be.” Trouba said that he and Drury have not spoken about the report. “I think it’s part of the business,” Trouba said. “I don’t know if it’s real or not, I don’t know. My job is to play hockey and that’s what I’m focused on.” Chris Kreider is also one player on the Rangers’ core that is available for trade, though he didn’t practice Tuesday with an upper-body injury. The Rangers tried to trade Trouba over the offseason, but he blocked any potential moves to 15 teams on the no-trade list he possesses as part of his contract. The Rangers subsequently ended up retaining the polarizing defenseman, who has just one year worth $8 million left on his deal after this season. Head coach Peter Laviolette said Tuesda he’d prefer to let the team’s veterans work out of their current rut. “To me, I think you have to give players the opportunity to respond,” Laviolette said. “You address situations that come up, you address things that need attention and then you gotta give them a chance to respond and a chance to work their way out of it. No team will go through the year and be happy with the 82 games that they play.”"

The future Hall of Fame quarterback touched upon his future Tuesday during his weekly appearance on “The Pat McAfee Show,” stating, “I don’t even know if I want to play yet, but New York would be my first option.” The Jets are 3-8 in Rodgers’ second season with the team. “When you’re 40 going on 41, you’re obviously at the end of your career so, obviously if it’s New York, they have to want me to be here, and then new GM, new staff, all have to want me to be with the Jets. And then body-wise, got to see how I’m feeling, and if I want to sign up to go back to the grind,” he said.  Rodgers’ appearance comes on the heels of a dizzying month for the Jets that included the firing of general manager Joe Douglas and speculation about Rodgers’ playing future. The Super Bowl-winning quarterback, who turns 41 next week, expressed interest in playing next year, stating earlier this month, “I think so, yeah.” The Jets are not only in the market for a new GM, but a new coach following Robert Saleh’s firing in October after a 2-3 start.  Rodgers arrived in New York to much fanfare in April 2023, with long-suffering Jets supporters daydreaming of Super Bowl aspirations. The bubble burst just four plays into the team’s season-opener in September 2023, when Rodgers suffered a season-ending Achilles injury. Although the Jets’ playoff fantasies were revitalized in 2024 with Rodgers at the helm, the team has continuously underachieved despite a talented roster that now boasts the quarterback’s longtime friend, star wideout Davante Adams. Rodgers has also been battling ankle, hamstring and knee injuries this season, with NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reporting Sunday how the quarterback “has resisted getting scans done, not wanting to reveal the severity of his injuries out of fear of having to come off the field.” Rodgers said he feels good after the Jets’ bye week. Upon returning to Florham Park for 2025, Rodgers said Tuesday: “If I can stay healthy the rest of the year and play the way I want to play and everybody feels good about bringing me back then there’s a decision there.” The Jets host a surging 6-5 Seahawks team on Sunday afternoon."

The country’s No. 1 men’s college basketball squad is a 2.5-point underdog on a neutral court to No. 11 Duke on Tuesday night.  Both teams should be at full strength as we head into the marquee affair in Las Vegas. KenPom, the gold standard college basketball analytical site, rates Duke as a four-point favorite in this neutral-court matchup.  It also has Duke ranked fourth and Kansas at No. 9.  It could be wise, though, to go against the grain in this one as money begins to come in on Kansas as we get closer to game time.  We all know that Cooper Flagg will be a major piece of the offensive puzzle for Duke, as he’s been the clear Wooden Award favorite in the early going. Flagg impressively put together a 24-point, six-rebound, three-assist game in a dominant 14-point victory over No. 22 Arizona last Friday.  He’s largely considered among the best college basketball players in the country and is expected to be among the first players — if not No. 1 — selected in the 2025 NBA Draft. Where things get a little shaky for the Blue Devils is their size down low, as center Khaman Maluach is the only one receiving true minutes so far.  Kansas’ 24-year-old big man Hunter Dickinson is still leading things for the Jayhawks as a dominant presence down low both on the glass and on defense.  His rim protection is critical to the Kansas game plan. He’s averaging 1.8 blocks per game and a double-double on top of that.  Anchored by  Dickinson and strong guard play featuring Zeke Mayo and AJ Storr, Kansas is very live to pull the upset on a neutral court. Odds say this will be an upset even if the rankings don’t, but put a wager on Kansas’ moneyline. If the Jayhawks can stay out of foul trouble, they should be the more well-rounded squad Tuesday night.   PICK: Kansas moneyline (+130, DraftKings) Erich Richter is a brazilian jiu-jitsu blue belt but he has a black belt in MMA betting. During the football season he’s showcased massive profits at The Post in the player prop market the last two seasons. While constantly betting long shots, his return on investment is 30.15 percent since 2022."

The All-Star outfielder, who has the Yankees, Mets and other heavyweights lined up to give him hundreds of millions of dollars, is off the market — for energy drinks. “The announcement you’ve been waiting for,” Soto, 26, wrote on Instagram, including a video of him at a press conference announcing that he joined Celsius as a brand partner Tuesday. “What? You were waiting for a different announcement?”  A post shared by Juan José Soto Pacheco (@juansoto_25) Fans were hoping Soto would announce where he’ll take his talents next season after a World Series run with the Yankees that fell short to the Dodgers last month.   Many believe Soto will decide to sign his next mega deal sometime around the Winter Meetings, which begin Dec. 8 in Dallas. The Mets have Steve Cohen — the richest owner in the sport — but the Yankees have an advantage of familiarity after Soto wore pinstripes in 2024.  “We’ll see what happens,” Cohen said Monday while at an event for his New York Golf Club in the TGL golf league. “We built a great team last year, I fully expect to do the same this year.”  Yankees slugger Aaron Judge, who won his second AL MVP Award last week, made it clear that he wants Soto back in The Bronx during a meeting with Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner on Friday in Tampa, where they both live.  Soto heard the “re-sign him” chants from Yankees faithful this past season.   Judge also enjoyed it, as seen in a video of the superstars smiling in the outfield back in August."

There will be no need to cater dinner or fill carafes of coffee and tea. And you won’t find her waiting anxiously by the phone to take any last-minute calls.  When the time comes for Nyanin to officially submit her picks Dec. 6 — the official first step in building the Valkyries’ roster — she already will have made peace with those decisions. Nyanin and her staff have put in countless hours creating mock drafts, exploring various scenarios and possibilities, all for next week’s expansion draft.  How many hours exactly? She won’t say.  “Just in case my therapist reads it,” Nyanin jokingly said to the The Post this week.  Nyanin finds herself in a unique situation. While most general managers inherit their predecessors’ teams, Nyanin, whom the Valkyries hired in May, gets to build her roster from scratch.  Not only does Nyanin hold the keys to the next phase of the WNBA offseason, but she also gets to pick what direction the one of the Valkyries go and whom they will build around.  The hype surrounding Golden State is real, too. Even before the WNBA’s 13th franchise has a team in place, the Valkyries are one of the hottest tickets in the league. Earlier this month, Golden State exceeded 20,000 season-ticket deposits. It’s no secret Nyanin wants to get this right from the jump and give fans a team to rally around. That journey publicly starts next week.  No pressure, right? “Being a pioneer in the very short team for the next kind of expansion drafts is exciting and daunting all at the same time,” Nyanin said. “One hundred percent, I want to do right by this organization.”  Warriors and Valkyries owner Joe Lacob’s lofty expectations for the Bay Area’s WNBA franchise have been well-documented. He wants Golden State to win a championship within its first five years. When Lacob bought the Warriors in 2010, he set — and continues to maintain — a similar high bar of excellence with his NBA team, who went several years carrying the highest payroll in the league.  Lacob’s investment and passion paid off. The Warriors, led by Stephen Curry, have won four NBA championships and made six Finals appearances in an eight-year span. Second in the Western Conference standings, they are now in pursuit of their fifth title.  Nyanin welcomes Lacob’s passion and involvement.  “He wants to see us win,” Nyanin said. “He’s bringing his whole self to the conversation because it’s just in him. He’s like, ‘I just know that this can work out. Let’s work it out.’” Warriors executive vice president of basketball operations Kirk Lacob helped with Nyanin’s onboarding process back in May. Since her arrival, he’s been inspired by her dedication to the day-to-day processes and believes the Valkyries future is bright with Nyanin at the helm. “She’s definitely not afraid of the moment, her background has prepared her for this,” Lacob told The Post. “She really enjoys her conversations with [Joe Lacob] and enjoys the pressure because she feels like without pressure you can’t make diamonds.” Success in Year 1 for the Valkyries is “undefined” at this moment, according to Nyanin.  Of course she wants to get off to a good start, but she also knows good things take time to grow and won’t always go to go according to plan.  A post shared by Chase Center (@chase_center) Nyanin said her past five years working with the Liberty — first as a manager of basketball operations and most recently as an assistant general manager working alongside Liberty general manager Jonathan Kolb — have been “paramount” in sculpting her approach to creating a Valkyries team that fans can get behind. “My whole life is consumed by this beginning part of the journey,” Nyanin said. “What’s giving me perspective is this is one area of how we’re building the team. Yes, it’s very public, [but] we have another opportunity during free agency, we have another opportunity during college draft and then any mid-season trades and that type of thing.  “So how I have allowed myself to just focus a lot of hours onto this is to be like, ‘Well, you have other opportunities in the future.’” The WNBA, much like the NBA, is a league of stars. All three of the previous WNBA champions — the Liberty in 2024 and the Las Vegas Aces in 2023 and 2022 — boasted superteam rosters.  The Valkyries are unlikely to pick up any superstars in the expansion draft with each team allowed to protect six players, though the situation does give Nyanin some leverage to pick up future draft assets.  Golden State also likely won’t draft a franchise-altering player at No. 5 in the 2025 WNBA draft. That leaves free agency, the part of this whole roster equation that remains a pivotal piece in Nyanin’s roster construction.  “You can look at a challenge as an opportunity to innovate or you can look at a benefit as an impediment to growth,” Nyanin said. “I see it in both ways. Would I have liked a couple of rules to switch so that I could have a little bit more flexibility? Sure. “… At the end of the day it’s a process that will be painstakingly slow, and I just hope people have enough patience to stay along on the ride for us.”"

North Carolina had other plans.,"Mack Brown wanted to stay.  North Carolina had other plans. Tar Heels athletic director Bubba Cunningham told Brown on Monday he would not return for the 2025 season despite having three years left on his contract, the school announced. Brown will coach the team’s regular-season finale Saturday against rival North Carolina State but its undecided if he would coach in a bowl game. “While this was not the perfect time and way in which I imagined going out, no time will ever be the perfect time,” Brown said in a statement. “I’ve spent 16 seasons at North Carolina and will always cherish the memories and relationships (wife) Sally and I have built while serving as head coach. We’ve had the chance to coach and mentor some great young men, and we’ll miss having the opportunity to do that in the future. “Moving forward, my total focus is on helping these players and coaches prepare for Saturday’s game against N.C. State and give them the best chance to win. We want to send these seniors out and I hope our fans will show up Saturday to do the same.” Brown, 73, is in his sixth year of his second stint leading the Tar Heels after previously guiding the program from 1988-97. The Tar Heels are 6-5 this year and just 44-32 over these past six seasons, and have lost at least five games in four straight seasons. Several uncompetitive losses this season put Brown under the spotlight, including a 70-50 loss to James Madison after which Brown said he told his players he would walk away if he couldn’t fix these issues. The school’s announcement came one day after Brown said he intended to return and he seemed miffed that reporters broached the topic. “You never talk to your athletic director until the year’s over. Everybody always does that. My total focus is on NC State,” Brown said, per ESPN. “What an awful thing to be talking about me when we just played a bad game and need to beat State.” Brown enters Saturday’s game with a 113-78-1 record with North Carolina and a 282-149-1 career record that also includes stints with Texas and Tulane. He won his lone national title during the 2005 season with the Longhorns. “Mack Brown has won more games than any football coach in UNC history, and we deeply appreciate all that he has done for Carolina football and our University,” Cunningham said in a release. “Over the last six seasons – his second campaign in Chapel Hill — he has coached our team to six bowl berths, including an Orange Bowl, while mentoring 18 NFL draft picks.  “Coach Brown has led the Carolina football program back into the national conversation as we improved the program’s facilities, significantly increased the size of the staff, invested in salaries and bolstered our nutrition and strength and conditioning programs. He also has been a dedicated fundraiser, strengthening the football endowment while also supporting our other sports programs. “We thank Coach Brown for his dedication to Carolina, and wish him, Sally and their family all the best.”"

New York City FC fired their head coach just three days after a discouraging 2-0 loss to their cross-river rival New York Red Bulls in the conference semifinals of the 2024 MLS Cup. Cushing, 40, had risen to the managerial role in 2022 and leaves the program with a 31-31-27 record in MLS play. “We would like to thank Nick for his incredible dedication to the club and this city,” NYCFC Sporting Director David Lee said in a statement released by the club. “During his time at New York City FC, Nick has been a true professional, playing an important role in delivering the Club’s first MLS Cup as an assistant coach and then leading the team as interim head coach to a Campeones Cup victory in 2022.” The 2022 season was NYCFC’s best during Cushing’s tenure, though the team slipped after he assumed the head coaching job in June of that year. Coming off a championship in 2021, then-head coach Ronny Delia departed from New York to lead Belgium’s Standard Liege — opening the door for Cushing, then an assistant coach, to assume the top spot.  Under Cushing, who was formerly the head coach of Manchester City’s women’s team, NYCFC struggled to match their pristine early-season form, accumulating a record of 8-8-4 down the stretch. Cushing’s squad entered postseason play as the fifth seed. New York City FC went on to win two matches before falling to the Philadelphia Union, 3-1, in the conference finals.  About three weeks prior to the MLS elimination, NYCFC had defeated Atlas F.C. of Liga MX 2-0 in the Campeones Cup — the annual match between the reigning MLS champions and the winner of the Mexican Super Cup. In 2023, Cushing’s NYCFC finished with a paltry 9-11-14 record and failed to qualify for postseason play. The squad improved to 14-12-8 in 2024, but underwhelmed in the conference semifinals against the Red Bulls. “Whilst we are incredibly appreciative for all he has done for the club, at this current time, we believe it’s best to move the team in a new direction as we plan for the 2025 season and beyond,” Lee said in his statement. In October, rumors surfaced linking Cushing to the head coaching vacancy at Arsenal’s women’s side, though he had said at the time that no one from the organization was in contact with him. NYCFC now join the Atlanta United, Philadelphia Union and Vancouver Whitecaps as one of four MLS teams without a head coach."

A rumor had circulated stating the famous Bears coach had landed in hospice. “But my husband is NOT in hospice,” Diana told the paper while noting that there are caretakers present. Ditka, 85, has battled health issues over the last decade-plus, including a heart attack in 2018 that landed him in a hospital in Florida and a minor stroke in 2012. The unfounded rumor that he had been entered into hospice apparently made its way around social media enough Monday that Jarrett Payton, son of the late Walter Payton, debunked it on X. Later in the day, the Sun-Times posted its exclusive interview with Ditka. He told the publication he had arrived in Chicago a “few” days ago. “I’m finally home! This city is my home. I love it,” Ditka said. “I was born in Pennsylvania and raised in Pittsburgh, but Chicago is my home … and it is my life. It’s the people I miss … miss more than anything. “I can’t tell you how happy I am to finally be home…to be back, although it was mighty cold when we got off the private plane at Midway airport a few nights ago.” The Ditkas are reportedly living in the same apartment complex that they had before, although in a different unit this time. They previously moved to Florida “not long after” his famous Chicago restaurant closed in 2020. “Most of our furniture has yet to arrive, but we are just so happy to be home,” Donna told the outlet. “Thank goodness we have the TV and back in the warmth of a city we call home.” Ditka played for the Bears from 1961-66 before coaching the team from 1982-92. He led the Bears to their only Super Bowl triumph in 1986, a 46-10 demolition of the Patriots fueled by one of the NFL’s greatest defensive units."

Vikings coach Kevin O’Connell praised the former Giants quarterback Monday, the same day he cleared waivers following his release from Big Blue, amid rumors Minnesota is a team to watch in Jones’ free agency. “I’m not going to really get into that today, but I will say tons of respect for Daniel Jones as a player and a person,” O’Connell told the media. “I got to know him through the draft process years ago. I’m sure, now that he’s a free agent, there’s probably a ton of league-wide interest in him. Daniel is going to make the decision that’s best for him in his career moving forward. I’m sure he’s working through that process right now. But I really can’t get into too much short-term or long-term. I can just say, I’ve been a fan of Daniel’s for a long time and hope wherever his next stop takes him, it’s a good opportunity for him.” Jones, the Giants’ sixth overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, was granted his release from the team Friday after being demoted to fourth-string quarterback following a dismal 2-8 start. He was in the second year of a four-year, $160 million contract extension, signed during the 2023 offseason. In the wake of his release, reports suggested the 27-year-old Jones is seeking to join a contender, with ESPN’s Adam Schefter specifically citing the Vikings on Sunday, as well as the Ravens (8-4). Former Jets’ castoff Sam Darnold is currently at the helm for the Vikings, and the team could be seeking to re-up their insurance policy given the lack of firepower behind the former first-round pick on the depth chart. Nick Mullens is the second-string. Brett Rypien is the third. Darnold, the Jets’ third overall selection in 2018, is in his first year under center in Minnesota after signing a one-year deal in free agency.  Prized rookie quarterback J.J. McCarthy, whom the Vikings selected 10th overall in April’s NFL draft, had been sidelined for the season after tearing his meniscus in the preseason.  In addition to the Vikings and Ravens — guided by two-time league MVP Lamar Jackson — the floundering Raiders (2-9) were also named an “interesting” suitor for Jones with quarterback Gardner Minshew now done for the season with a broken collarbone.  The playoffs are very much within reach for Minnesota, a franchise brimming with talent that hasn’t won a postseason game since 2019. And yet, despite a 9-2 record — tied for the second-best mark in the league — the Vikings are still looking up at their division rival Lions. Detroit sits atop the NFC North at 10-1.  If the season ended today, Minnesota would hold the No. 5 seed."

During his postgame press conference, Murray seemed to hint that some players had too much fun in Los Angeles after a 127-102 win over the Lakers on Saturday. “It’s a long season. Guys have lives outside of basketball,” Murray said. “We just beat LA in LA. We’ve got some guys who live in LA, so stayed in LA. Like I said, I don’t think the focus was there from everybody, and that’s what happens when you don’t have the focus.  “Like I said, it’s not on coach, it’s not on what plays we’re running, it’s not on anybody else but the guys that are out there on the court. So, it’s a tough one to go back and watch or even accept. But it was expected if that’s the kind of energy that that whole team is going to bring to start the game and continuously not have a response, then that’s what happens. We’ve been on the other side of it. I’ve been on the other side of it and tonight we were on the wrong end of it.”  Murray later walked back the part about “some guys,” and said he also stayed in Los Angeles with the team.  “We all stayed in LA BTW! and had a great win,” Murray wrote on X. “Not excluding myself guys we didn’t play together tonight.”  Before that, the All-Star guard hadn’t posted on X since August.  Nuggets coach Mike Malone, who dropped an F-bomb and pounded the table in his postgame press conference, said his team got embarrassed by the Knicks. “Nah, f–k that,” Malone said when asked if Denver would “flush” that game and move on. “We’re not flushing. You don’t flush when you get embarrassed, you don’t flush when you gave up 145 points, you don’t flush when you didn’t play hard, when you didn’t play with effort when you didn’t play with physicality. I’m not flushing anything.”  There was no stopping the Knicks’ offense, which shot 60.9 percent from the floor.  Knicks forward OG Anunoby scored a career-high 40 points, while All-Star guard Jalen Brunson had 23 points to go with his career-best 17 assists.  Brunson went on a heater in first quarter, when he scored nine straight points for New York.  The Nuggets dropped to 5-4 at home this season. Denver will face the Jazz in Utah on Wednesday."

When a fan wearing a Nick Bolton jersey approached a railing at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte to greet members of the Chiefs following their 10th victory of the season, the young supporter fell through a gap and was aided by Thurston. In footage of the harrowing incident that has since circulated online, the 26-year-old Wharton can later be seen helping the fan back up to the stands as a stadium worker told nearby spectators to return to their seats. Wharton, who is in his fifth season with the Chiefs, spoke about the ordeal Tuesday during an appearance on “The Pat McAfee Show.” “Usually when I leave a game, try to throw my gloves in the crowd, and I think I heard my name a little bit, and when I heard my name, I seen him coming down. It was two security guards right there, I don’t think they realized what I was doing because they were looking at us but I just had to kinda like push him into the stands a little bit to make sure he didn’t hit too hard,” Wharton detailed. Wharton hopes to reconnect with the young fan, telling McAfee, ” I would like to reach out to him, get him out to the game.” An undrafted free agent out of Missouri S&T, Wharton originally signed with the Chiefs in 2020. He was part of the Chiefs’ Super Bowl-winning rosters in 2023 and 2024 and is now seeking his third consecutive championship with the club. Wharton has 17 tackles and 2.5 sacks through 11 games this season. The Chiefs are operating on a short week as they’ll take on the Raiders at home Friday in an AFC West clash. Although the Chiefs defeated the Raiders on the road in October, 27-20, star quarterback Patrick Mahomes hopes for more dominant performances from the defending Super Bowl champs down the stretch.  “You always want to have some blowouts and be a little calmer in the fourth quarter, but I’ve always said it could be a good thing when you get to the playoffs later in the season knowing that you have been in those moments before, and knowing how to attack it play by play not making it too big of a moment,” Mahomes said Sunday, according to the Associated Press. “But I would say this more than anybody, I would love to win a game not by the very last play.” The Chiefs edged the Panthers on Sunday with a 31-yard field goal from Spencer Shrader in the game’s final seconds to improve to 10-1."

Making the most of live television, Brundle’s grid walk is the must-watch appetizer to every F1 race. Maybe you’ll get a wholesome interview, maybe you’ll get a wild snub, maybe Brundle himself will make a faux pas. Or, like in Vegas, maybe Brundle will show himself to be ice cold. From the outset of the grid walk in Vegas, it was clear it was going to be a tough one with a reported 77 celebrities on the list to walk the grid as well as motorsport personalities and the drivers themselves. A post shared by DMARGE (@dmarge) So Brundle could be picky — and he made the most of it right from the outset. As the camera cut to him, almost immediately he was tapped on the elbow for an interview with former F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone’s daughter Petra. After introducing her, Brundle brushed her immediately, saying: “Cool. Hi, how are you doing? If you don’t mind, I’m going to go this way (pointing in the opposite direction) first and then I’ll … but thank you for the heads up on that,” Brundle added as he walked away. With an absolutely packed grid, Brundle complained about not being able to find anyone, with the drivers all staying in the garage. “I don’t know if we’ll be able to find anyone today,” Brundle said. In his 10-minute segment, Brundle “sidestepped” Gordon Ramsay, who he regularly sees on the grid, and golf star Rory McIlroy, who he interviewed earlier in the week. But he was able to track down the likes of legendary producer Jerry Bruckheimer, who is producing the F1 movie with Brad Pitt, Olympic 100m gold medalist Noah Lyles, “Gladiator II” star Paul Mescal and Sylvester Stallone. However, when he was offered a chat with former Playboy Playmate of the Year turned actor and media personality Jenny McCarthy, Brundle kept moving. “It’s okay, it’s okay,” he said. McCarthy, who is also a judge on “The Masked Singer,” has also been criticized for promoting anti-vax talking points and being called “the face of the anti-vax movement,” a label she reportedly disputes. But F1 fans found the funny side of the situation. “I’m still laughing the guy (sorry I don’t know his name) had nobody to chat with, (someone) leans in and says we have Jenny McCarthy, he replies with no thanks,” one fan wrote. “That was hilarious seeing Martin Brundle curve Jenny McCarthy’s handler on live TV lmao,” another posted. A third commented: “Martin Brundle not having any desire to talk to Jenny McCarthy, despite how laughably desperate her rep/friend was for him to interview her (and Donnie Wahlberg) on the #BrundleGridWalk is the only thing good about this again horribly timed #LasVegasGP.” A fourth wrote: “Jenny McCarthy witnessed the wrath of Martin Brundle’s indifference on tonight’s #LasVegasGP.” A fifth added: “Martin Brundle just passed on interviewing Jenny McCarthy & Donnie Wahlberg to fish for better celebs on the #F1 grid in Las Vegas — funny stuff.” Brundle then made a beeline for Williams driver Franco Colapinto, who crashed out of Q2 in Saturday’s qualifying. The pair had had drama earlier in the season when it appeared the 21-year-old Argentinian had snubbed the Sky Sports veteran. It was later worked out between the pair with both taking the blame of the situation. Brundle’s grid walks often make headlines for all the wrong reasons. In Monaco this season, a security guard tried to keep Brundle from football superstar Kylian Mbappe, with the veteran commentator replying: “It’s alright mate, I’m in charge around here.” Queen guitarist Sir Brian May was also slammed after turning down a chat with Brundle at the British Grand Prix. Brundle brushed off that snub but some fans had questions over the willingness to move on, particularly when the likes of Megan Thee Stallion and Cara Delevingne have been trolled after snubbing Brundle in the past. Megan Thee Stallion’s snub even prompted a rule change where the FIA banned bodyguards from the grid. Ahead of the Singapore Grand Prix, Aussie rookie Oscar Piastri was dealt a brutal burn when the Sky Sports presenter bailed on him mid-answer. In Miami, it was three-time F1 champ Jackie Stewart who stole the limelight after he was almost manhandled during the grid walk shenanigans. But it’s not always bad. Hollywood power couple Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones won fans over with their classy interview ahead of the Spanish Grand Prix. At the British Grand Prix, it was musician Sam Ryder who drew widespread praise for his infectious banter while speaking with Brundle. At the Canadian Grand Prix, fans were blown away after motorsport pioneer Mary McGee had a heartwarming exchange with Brundle."

Over the weekend, Franklin clapped back at McAfee, a former Colts punter-turned media star, for being critical of Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson — and McAfee responded by pointing out a multitude of issues Indianapolis is dealing with.  Franklin squashed their beef when asked Monday by a reporter if he had plans to engage with McAfee on his “The Trenches” podcast.  “To be honest with you, I got a lot of respect for Pat. I understand exactly who he is to the organization, to our city, and quite frankly I think maybe I probably didn’t handle it the right way going into it,” Franklin said. “Now he said some things about me, so that is what it is … We’re all a family. We all want the same thing. I think at the end of the day, Pat wants what’s best for us, he wants us to win, he wants something to cheer about he wants something to go on his show and scream about in a good way.  “And that’s what I want for him. At the end of the day,  me being in the locker room, me being the boots on the ground, I want to give our fans — I want to give our alumni something to be proud of and something to continue to cheer for. So, there is no back and forth. There is no feud because at the end of the day, we want the same things.” Franklin laughed when the reporter joked, “think about the ratings” if he had McAfee on his podcast.  “Look man, playoff ratings hit the best,” Franklin said. “So as long as I get to do a playoff battle, that’s all that matters.”  McAfee, who lives in Indianapolis with his wife and daughter, is a regular at Colts home games and he often sits in a suite Lucas Oil Stadium.  During an appearance on “GameDay Morning” ahead of the Colts’ 24-6 loss to the Lions this past Sunday, McAfee joked that his war with the players was “brewing.”  Franklin called a truce with McAfee after the Colts lost four of their last five games — including Sunday’s setback that dropped them 5-7.  Last week, Franklin and Colts linebacker EJ Speed took issue with the media’s criticism of Richardson asking to sub out of a division game at Houston for one play in Week 8 because he was tired. The Texans beat the Colts, 23-20. Richardson was subsequently benched in favor of veteran Joe Flacco for two games with his inconsistent play being the largest factor in the decision.  Franklin and Speed did not name McAfee, but they did use his image to promote the episode, entitled, “Zaire & EJ CLAP BACK at the media.”  McAfee was publicly critical of Richardson and the Colts in the media and on social media.  McAfee first lobbied for him to be benched, and then said the Colts should go back to Richardson after back-to-back losses with Joe Flacco at the helm.  The Colts face the Patriots (3-9) at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough on Sunday."

Zero catches, zero yards, five targets. Johnston had three fourth-quarter drops, which included a wide-open one on third down that would have extended a drive with the Chargers trailing, 23-16. That drop, in particular, was the backbreaker. Johnston took his eye off the ball on a third-and-6 play, having at least 10 yards to run with a blocker out in front for a potentially massive gain.  The Chargers then punted and the Ravens marched right down the field to score a touchdown that essentially put the game out of reach. The loss dropped Los Angeles to 7-4 in Jim Harbaugh’s first season.    Johnston then also dropped two balls on the ensuing drive, as he seemed to also have issues coming out of his turn.  Harbaugh downplayed Johnston’s drops. “I think we all have some things we wish we played, coached better,” Harbaugh said after the game. “That’s how I feel. That’s my reaction.” Quarterback Justin Herbert also gave Johnston a vow of support despite the poor showing.  “I think that’s the tough part about the NFL. He’s a playmaker. He’s done an incredible job all year. You never want to see that,” Herbert said. “He’s a fighter. You trust him. And I’m gonna keep throwing him the ball. That’s what we did out there.  “Unfortunately, it didn’t go our way tonight. But I know he’s gonna be the first one in the building, and he’s gonna do everything the right way. He’s a truly great teammate, great guy. And he’s gonna go make some plays. He’s got a lot of good football left in front of him.” The second-year player out of TCU has made some strides after a nightmare rookie season where he struggled to even crack the lineup with ex-head coach Brandon Staley at the helm and also had some costly drops.  Harbaugh has embraced the No. 21 overall pick since entering his new position.  “[Johnston is] one of our top guys right now,” Harbaugh said in July training camp. “[I] just think he got a bad rap … He’s gonna be a problem. He’s gonna be a problem for people. I’ve been nothing but happy with Quentin Johnston.” Johnston roasted Michigan as massive underdogs in the 2022 College Football Playoff semifinal when Harbaugh was the coach of the Wolverines, going for 163 yards and a touchdown in TCU’s win.  Johnston has played in nine games this season, grabbing six touchdowns to go with 354 receiving yards and 22 receptions this season."

Brooklyn was without Nic Claxton, Dorian Finney-Smith, Ben Simmons and Noah Clowney already. But Johnson sprained his right ankle in the first quarter landing on Draymond Green’s foot, and hobbled through the final 7:22 of the first half before not returning in the second. The Nets had no update on his status. Thomas had 23 points but was pulled with 6:43 left in the third. He missed the Charlotte game with a sore back, was under the weather Friday in Philadelphia to start the road trip, and got rested by Jordi Fernandez. “I ended up taking him out because he took a foul, he was tired,” said Fernandez. “I didn’t feel it was right. And I just wanted to protect him from himself.” Simmons rested Monday because he’s not cleared for back to backs, but is expected to return Wednesday in Phoenix. Finney-Smith (ankle) and Claxton (back) are both TBD against the Suns, who are getting Kevin Durant back Tuesday night. After an up-and-down start to the season, Clowney had the best performance of his career in Sunday’s 108-103 win at Sacramento, and promptly got hurt. He missed the tail end of the back-to-back against the Warriors with a sprained left ankle. Clowney had an MRI, the results of which weren’t in by tipoff at Chase Center, and Nets coach Jordi Fernandez wasn’t sure if the young big had X-rays. “It could be worse, and it ain’t worse. So, I’m happy,” said Clowney. Claxton’s back bears watching. He first injured it over the summer, calling it a “long-term thing” and acknowledging that he’ll “probably be managing for a while.” Neither Claxton nor Fernandez could say what ‘a while’ meant. “In professional sports, especially in this league, a lot of these guys play with bumps and bruises. What we need them is to believe that they’re good to go,” said Fernandez. “And if we feel like a guy is not confident, we’re gonna let them make the decisions. I think that’s fair. If you play and you’re afraid to get hurt, you’re going to get hurt. So we don’t want that for Nic or anybody. “We’re going to help him be confident, and when he’s on the court it’s because he feels 200 percent. So that’s where we are right now with Nic.” Ziaire Williams had to start as a small-ball center with injury-riddled Brooklyn playing five-out. He had his second career double-double with 17 points and 10 boards. He didn’t recall playing center in the the NBA or college. “Shoot man, probably high school. In high school I was a point-center,” said Williams. “It’s fun, man, I just love to play, love to compete. Whatever coach wants me to do, I just go out there and give my full effort.” The turnovers were essentially even, but Brooklyn outscored the Warriors, 26-13, off turnovers. “Coach wants to play fast. In the first six seconds he wants to shoot the ball,” said Dennis Schroder. Brooklyn recalled Dariq Whitehead from Long Island, for whom he’d scored 26 points Sunday in Toronto. “I’m starting to trust my body a lot more each game, and obviously it’s showing on the stats,” said Whitehead. “But moreso for me it’s just keeping it consistent. Got to keep it consistent.”"

The WNBA is set to expand from 12 teams to 15 within the next two years.","It’s been a month since the Liberty paraded their WNBA championship trophy up the Canyon of Heroes. The cheerful screams of fans that filled the streets for the day have been replaced by car horns, and the white confetti that dusted the streets is long gone. But general manager Jonathan Kolb’s efforts to ensure the Liberty’s championship window remains wide open — at least for one more year — are already ramping up as he prepares for the WNBA’s first expansion draft since 2008. After years of discussion about the league growing its footprint into more markets, it’s finally happening. The WNBA is set to expand from 12 teams to 15 within the next two years. The first round of expansion will take place in 2025, when the Golden State Valkyries make their debut. The main thing the Valkyries are missing now is an actual roster. That’s where the expansion draft comes in, on Dec. 6 (6:30 p.m. ET, ESPN). Here’s what to know:The Valkyries, like the Warriors, will play home games at Chase Center in San Francisco starting next season, and the team’s headquarters will be in the Warriors’ former practice facility in Oakland. Warriors owner and venture capitalist Joe Lacob said for years that he wanted to bring a WNBA team to the Bay Area. The Warriors officially won the bid to bring a WNBA franchise to the Bay Area in October 2023. In May, the franchise revealed it would be known as the Valkyries, a word that originates from Norse mythology and refers to “a host of warrior women who are fearless and unwavering — flying through air and sea alike,” according to a press release. Under Lacob, the Warriors established a winning reputation with four NBA Finals titles and six Finals appearances during an eight-year span. It’s expected that he’ll bring that same mentality to the Valkyries. Golden State tabbed former Liberty assistant general manager Ohemaa Nyanin to be the team’s first GM. She helped hire former Las Vegas Aces assistant coach Natalie Nakase as the first head coach. Each of the WNBA’s 12 teams was to submit a list of its six “protected players” to the Valkyries by Monday afternoon. Any player not listed as protected will be up for grabs by Golden State. The Valkyries will then have the chance to acquire the contract or the rights to one unprotected player per team. They also can pass on selecting a player from a given team, maintaining extra roster flexibility going into free agency and next spring’s draft, in which they hold the No. 5 overall pick. In addition to players who are signed to a contract for 2025, pending free agents and unsigned draft picks (such as those who are based overseas) must be protected by their current organization to be ineligible for the Valkyries to take. If selected, the Valkyries would maintain the same rights to that player as their previous team. The Valkyries may take a maximum of one player who is set to be an unrestricted free agent in February. But they cannot take any players who have been on a core-player contract for at least two seasons, such as Phoenix Mercury star Brittney Griner, meaning those players don’t have to be protected. The WNBA is choosing not to make the player lists public. That’s a departure from the NHL, which recently made its protected/unprotected player lists available for the Vegas Golden Knights and Seattle Kraken expansion drafts. Recent NWSL expansion drafts did as well. The Valkyries could make a deal with another team to avoid picking an unprotected player in return for draft picks or other assets. Likewise, the Valkyries could leverage the power they have with the expansion draft and coordinate a multi-team trade that could see players move to teams other than Golden State. It’s worth noting those types of trades likely won’t be completed until January in order for teams to avoid cap hits in 2024. Franchises in Toronto and Portland are set to begin play in 2026. An expansion draft for those future teams is expected next year. WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert has said the league will pursue expansion into a 16th market as interest appears to remain high. Just last week, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert threw his hat in the ring to bring a team back to Cleveland. St. Louis and Philadelphia also have been mentioned as other possible future sites."

The Giants’ owner otherwise would have heard yet another barb thrown at his rudderless franchise in the aftermath of Saquon Barkley’s historic performance against the Rams on Sunday. It all started when ESPN’s duo of Joe Buck and Troy Aikman discussed the rushing title race between Barkley and star Ravens running back Derrick Henry, with Barkley’s huge game giving him the lead going into Baltimore’s 30-23 road victory on Monday. “You know, John Mara, if he had a little heartburn when Saquon Barkley left and signed with the Eagles, you can only imagine the heartburn he has watching him do what he’s done,” Aikman said. Buck then referenced the infamous “Hard Knocks” clip when Mara told general manager Joe Schoen he would not be happy if Barkley landed down the turnpike. “John Mara’s gotta be so sick of that clip and hearing about, ‘I’m not gonna be able to sleep if he goes to Philly,'” Buck said. “Well, he’s in Philly and he looks like one of the best running backs ever to visit this planet.” Aikman then dug the knife deeper. “Yeah, and they decided to keep Daniel Jones. Now they don’t have either,” he said. It’s been a particularly rough week for the Giants and their problems are only exacerbated by Barkley’s MVP-caliber season with the Eagles. The Giants are 2-9 and in the mix for the No. 1 pick, while Barkley has realized the grass was indeed greener on the other side. “Hard Knocks” showed how Mara would have preferred to keep Barkley in blue for the rest of his career and particularly feared Barkley joining an NFC East rival.  “I have a tough time sleeping if Saquon goes to Philadelphia, I’ll tell you that, as I’ve told you,” Mara said in a clip that will haunt him for years to come. Well, Barkley is in Philadelphia and leads the league with 1,392 rushing yards after tallying 255 in Monday’s game against the Rams. As Barkley shines, the Giants are also dealing with the reality of how their decision to draft and then ultimately pay Jones proved to be a mistake. Jones’ contract factored into why the Giants did not match Barkley’s contract with the Eagles, and the Giants now have neither player on their roster entering a Thanksgiving road game with the Cowboys."

A week that began with Big Blue benching Daniel Jones, dropping him to fourth on the depth chart, naming Tommy DeVito the starting quarterback and then granting Jones’ request for a release ended with the same dull rationalizations from head coach Brian Daboll — they had a good week of practice, they didn’t execute, other predictable lines that fill most of his press conferences — after a 30-7 embarrassment Sunday. And an eight-month stretch that began with the Giants’ highly scrutinized decision to let Barkley walk in free agency and sign with their NFC East rival might have hit the lowest of lows that same day with Barkley erupting for a career-high 302 total yards during the Eagles’ win over the Rams. While the Giants certainly miss Barkley’s production, even his career year (an NFL-leading and career-high 1,392 rushing yards) probably wouldn’t have been enough to cure the issues plaguing Big Blue."

The NHL locked out its players for the start of the 1994 season. The players had gone to training camp and there were even some pre-season games played. But on October 1, the players were locked out. They had played the entire previous season without a deal in place. The lockout lasted until the sides finally settled on Jan. 11, saving what would be a 48-game season and playoffs that would run deeper into the summer than ever before. The key issues involved salary cap and luxury tax proposals. The league wanted a mechanism in place that would benefit the small market teams and add parity. The players’ union was not on board with the plan. Meanwhile, the collectibles business took a second hard hit on the heels of the already devastating baseball strike. Series 1 trading card products rolled out on time, but the demand was nowhere near at the level it had been in the previous two years. While there is a monopoly with Upper Deck and the NHL today, the 1994 hockey card market was the wild west. The number of brands at that time was staggering compared to what is being released today. Joining Upper Deck in the market were Pinnacle, Fleer, Topps, O-Pee-Chee and Donruss/Leaf. Pro Set was gone but the Parkhurst name was being shopped around and eventually picked up by Upper Deck. Action Packed had produced some fringe items and was knocking at the door for an NHL license. There were food issues and other sets, too.  Kraft was producing a food promotion set for Kraft and Jell-O products in Canada. Upper Deck was producing a McDonald’s set in Canada, which is the license that Tim Hortons has now. They also produced an NHLPA-licensed set called Be A Player, which included an autograph in every pack. Another big seller for a brief time that year was a set of NHL POGs from the World POG Federation. Panini was producing an NHL sticker book and stickers which sold well in Canada and Europe but did not do as well in the United States, a market that had not warmed up to stickers yet. There was also a Kitchener, Ontario-based company called Slapshot that produced junior hockey cards, as well as prospect sets from Signature Rookies and Classic. One promoter told the Calgary Herald in November of 1994 that the work stoppages “have devastated an already depressed business.”  In Alberta, hockey accounted for about 80% of store sales. At the time of the hockey lockout, I was the editor of Canadian Sportscard Collector and was also contracted to write some card backs. I went into a lot of shops and attended a lot of shows. I remember one shop owner closing his doors in the Ottawa area that year. He said he had to invest so much money into hockey and baseball to carry at least a few boxes of every product that he couldn’t afford the inventory needed to compete. He also said that he didn’t have the counter space to carry every item he wanted to. Another shop in Michigan that I visited had the same problem. Hockey was a huge seller in his shop, and he struggled to stock hockey and baseball products. Plus, he carried every NFL product and NBA product, as the Lions and Pistons were both popular at the time and driving sales. Because I was based in the Niagara area at that time, I also frequented shops and shows in the Buffalo area. They were also hit hard, but they had the popularity of the Bills to help them weather the storm. Before the lockout, there were a number of monthly shows at small hotels and community centers on both sides of the border that were put on hold and never came back. The decline in interest in the hockey card market was noticeable was at a pair of big shows. The October Montreal show saw attendance take a hit. The hardcore vintage and diehard collectors were there, and the autograph list of retired Montreal Canadiens and local stars who had played for other teams was good.  However, the vibe of the show and the feeling on the floor was downright depressing. First of all, the baseball strike hit Montreal harder than any other city and market. It ripped out the potential for a World Series from what was the best and hottest team in baseball. Olympic Stadium, at the same Olympic Park complex, stood somewhat-less-than-majestically behind the Maurice Richard Arena, where the show took place. Just seeing the stadium was a stark reminder that what had once been one of the best sports cities in North America had, at that time, no professional sports. The Canadiens were locked out. The Expos were on strike. The Alouettes had folded and would not return for a couple years, leaving only memories of Johnny Rodgers, Jimmy Jones, Tom Cousineau, Junior Ah You, and other Montreal football legends.  The city and its collectors had a blanket of depression thrown over them. It was a far cry from the same show from the previous year, when the Canadiens were the defending Stanley Cup champions, Patrick Roy was the most celebrated hero of the generation, and the excitement around the Expos was gaining momentum and was bringing the city back to the Gary Carter-Andre Dawson-Tim Raines era. The dealers in 1994 were there on the show floor with little to no crowds at their tables. Stacks of hockey and baseball wax boxes gathered dust. The autograph lineups drew enthusiastic collectors and fans, but the turnout was smaller than usual. That show was almost like a turning point in the city and in the entire province of Quebec. The sports card market would not be the same for about the next quarter century. Like in every other city, it wasn’t until COVID that things really blossomed into what it had been before 1994. The next big show that year was the Sport Card and Memorabilia Expo in Toronto. It was more of the same, yet even more pronounced. There was still excitement around the Maple Leafs, who in 1993 made their best Stanley Cup playoff run since winning their last Stanley Cup in 1967. But that excitement was temporarily deflated. The Blue Jays had been drawing four million fans per year and had won back-to-back World Series. They would not have made the post-season that year, as the New York Yankees were running away with the division and the wild card was a long shot. But there was still a buzz about the National League Expos, as all baseball fans in Canada wanted the World Series to stay in Canada. There were even conspiracy theories floating around in Canada that Bud Selig and Donald Fehr wanted the season cancelled because it would be better for baseball to lose a World Series than have a third straight in Canada. It wasn’t the first ridiculous sports conspiracy theory, and it was certainly not the last. The attendance at the 1994 Toronto show was a little better than half of what it had been in years past. Like in Montreal, the hardcore collectors were there with their want lists. Sales of new wax boxes were flat, but stronger than they were in Montreal. The number of collectors who travelled to Toronto from the United States, most notably from Buffalo, Boston and Detroit, was way down. The corporate booths were still there, but on a much smaller scale. About 30 miles away along the QEW, Hamilton was hosting the “4-on-4 Challenge”. It was a four-team tournament of four-on-four hockey featuring the locked out stars. Team Ontario, Team Quebec, Team Western Canada and Team USA played a three-day tournament on the same weekend as the Expo. Patrick Roy, Luc Robitaille, Brett Hull, Doug Gilmour, Joe Sakic and a number of top NHL stars took part in the tournament. The teams wore NHLPA logo uniforms. The tournament raised more than a half million dollars for Ronald McDonald Children’s Charities of Canada and minor hockey associations throughout the country. Wayne Gretzky, meanwhile, was organizing a barnstorming tour of Europe. He joined forces with IMG to create the Ninety-Nine All-Stars Team which spent the first two weeks of December touring Norway, Finland, Sweden and Germany. The 4-on-4 Challenge and the Ninety-Nine All-Stars also found their way onto hockey cards. The Be A Player brand, which started as an NHLPA project with Upper Deck, featured many photos from the tournament. Also included in the 1994-95 Be A Player set was a 19-card insert set called Wayne Gretzky’s 99 All-Stars. The set features photography from the December, 1994 games. Meanwhile at Canadian Sportscard Collector magazine, it seemed like there was a continual daily discussion with my co-worker and close friend Baron Bedeksy about the situation. Who are we going to put on the cover? Our 50th issue fell in November, 1994. We needed to come up with something a little bit different for the issue that would be for sale at the Expo, which was the biggest opportunity of the year to showcase our magazine. At that time, the 1993 seven game semi-final series between the Leafs and the Los Angeles Kings was still talked about. It was one of the greatest NHL playoff series ever. One of the hockey card licensing rules was that fighting was not allowed on cards. In that series, Wendel Clark and Marty McSorley dropped the mitts and had one of the most epic fights in NHL playoff history. Bruce Bennett Studios sent us a great image from the fight. Maybe the card companies couldn’t put fighting on their cards, but we could put it on the cover. The headline was “Why you won’t see this on an NHL hockey card”. During the lockout, we also focused on some future stars. Brett Lindros, the younger brother of Eric Lindros, was a highly touted junior star with the Kingston Frontenacs of the Ontario Hockey League. He had been drafted ninth overall by the New York Islanders. Lindros was destroying junior hockey. In 26 games with Kingston, he had 24 goals and 23 assists for 47 points. Putting him on one of our covers was a slam dunk. Many said he would be just as good as his older brother. He joined the Islanders when the lockout ended. Concussions put an early end to his career. He played only 51 NHL games and scored just two goals. He was a player that many collectors had invested in. Injuries turned him into one of the biggest busts in hockey card history. Pinnacle already had Eric Lindros under contract as a spokesman. Brett spent more than half the 1993-94 season with the Canadian National Team before returning to Kingston. His time with the national team in Canada opened the door for a special insert card in 1993-94 Pinnacle of the Lindros brothers. The other junior cover we did was Jeff O’Neill. He was pictured in his Hartford Whalers jersey from the NHL Draft. The headline was “The Real Deal”. O’Neill had been drafted fifth overall and was in the midst of his second straight monster year with the Guelph Storm of the OHL. O’Neill had a very good NHL career with Hartford, Carolina and Toronto. He is a very popular media personality in Canada and especially in Toronto. He is a Toronto sports radio co-host and is a commentator on Leafs TV broadcasts. He is also on The Sports Network in Canada as a hockey analyst. He is usually on the TSN show as part of their panel of experts from his home office. Behind him on the wall on every episode, several times a week on national TV in Canada, is a framed cover of Canadian Sportscard Collector. I have never met Jeff O’Neill, though several years ago a friend of mine got him to sign a copy of the magazine for me. But seeing that issue on his wall, when I was the one who decided to put him on the cover, picked the photo, and came up with the headline, is pretty cool. I hope I get to meet him some day so I can tell him about what went into that piece of memorabilia on his wall. In January, 1995, the puck dropped and play resumed. The lockout was over. The hockey card market was easing into the new normal. Unfortunately, the lockout was the knockout punch to many sports card stores already staggering from the baseball strike.

Originally a hobby journalist, he became brand manager at Pinnacle, and then was an executive for Collector's Edge and Shop at Home before joining Pacific Trading Cards as VP of Marketing.

Sports Collectors Daily,"With Canton Calling, a Look at Adam Vinatieri’s 1997 Pacific Philadelphia Rookie Card",https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/adam-vinatieris-1997-pacific-philadelphia-rookie-card/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 01:30:18 +0000","Only one company put New England's young kicker in its trading card set. Now, Adam Vinatieri's lone rookie card is one of the most sought after of the era.","November 25, 2024 By Horacio Ruiz  He’s the NFL’s all-time leading scorer and a four-time Super Bowl champion. If you’re looking to digest the Adam Vinatieri rookie card checklist, though, it won’t take long. A guy who could soon have a bust in Canton has just one, from a company that no longer exists.  That might tell you how long ago it was. If you think you can pick one up for a buck or two, though, you’re in for a surprise. In his first year of Hall of Fame eligibility, Vinatieri now has an opportunity to become the first ever first-ballot kicker to be inducted. Last week, Vinatieri was one of 25 Modern-Day semifinalists announced by the Pro Football Hall of Fame. While Vinatieri needs to go through two more rounds of cuts, he appears to be a favorite for this year’s class. He is the NFL’s all-time leading scorer, having passed the last kicker inducted into the Hall of Fame, Morten Andersen. Vinatieri was an integral part of the New England Patriots dynasty during the first half of the Tom Brady era, appearing in four Super Bowls and winning three. But Vinatieri made a name for himself by being clutch in high-pressure situations. He was a weapon his teammates could rely on in close games.  Embed from Getty Images During the 2001-02 AFC Divisional Playoffs, Vinatieri kicked the game-tying and game-winning field goals for the Patriots in blizzard-like conditions. Later in those playoffs, as New England marched towards its first title, Vinatieri kicked the game-winning field goal as time expired in Super Bowl XXXVI. Vinatieri would do it again two years later, kicking a game-winning 41-yard field goal in Super Bowl XXXVIII with four seconds remaining as the Patriots claimed their second title in three years. After ten years in New England, Vinatieri signed with the Indianapolis Colts, where he helped win Super Bowl XLI in his first season with the franchise. Embed from Getty Images Vinatieri retired after the 2019 season, and he remains the all-time leader in career field goals made, field goals attempted, consecutive field goals made, and most combined regular-season and postseason games played. There is a valid argument for calling him the greatest placekicker ever. For football card collectors, especially those who focus on Hall of Fame rookie cards, now might be a good time to look at Vinatieri. While Vinatieri started his NFL career as an undrafted free agent in 1996, his lone rookie card (no parallels) is found in the 1997 Pacific Philadelphia football set. Vinatieri is the key card in the set because it was released in May 1997 – too soon to feature the recent draft class and too late to issue any “true” rookie cards. It’s a humble start for a guy who turned out to be an all-time great but something the long defunct Pacific made a habit of doing (see Kurt Warner). Rodney Harrison, a teammate of Vinatieri’s in New England, also has a rookie card in the ’97 Pacific Philadelphia set. He was named a Hall of Fame semifinalist this year after being one of 15 finalists last year. Card #199 shows Vinatieri just after a kickoff, with the Patriots logo in the bottom right corner and his name in gold foil. The back of the card highlights his rookie campaign and highlights from his college career at South Dakota State.  The back discusses his college and pro career to that point.
 PSA has graded the Vinatieri rookie 370 times, with 95 Gem Mint 10s and 151 Mint 9s. Beckett has graded the card 145 times, with one Pristine 10 and 41 Gem Mint 9.5s. Raw cards on eBay are selling for between $50 and $70. The most recent PSA 10 sold for $417 and the most recent PSA 9 sold for $135. It would be two more years before additional cards of Vinatieri would arrive in packs, inside the Triumph set from Collectors Edge. There are no guarantees this will be the year Vinatieri gets inducted. Hall of Fame voting can be unpredictable and, at times, political. But Vinatieri is poised to become the fifth-ever placekicker inducted into the Hall of Fame. Being a semifinalist in his first season of eligibility bodes well for his future chances.

Sports Collectors Daily,Collectors’ Night in NYC Brings Out the Best,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/collectors-night-event-nyc/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 01:29:29 +0000","The sixth edition of Collectors Night brought an opportunity for collectors to expand their knowledge, hear stories and see some outstanding memorabilia.","November 25, 2024 By David Seideman  Two blocks from Rockefeller Center’s Christmas tree, the euphoria at a bar upstairs matched the season’s Yuletide spirit. On a November evening in New York, BC Vintage was hosting its sixth Collectors Exchange event. Company founders Chris Brigandi and Chris Caserta invited hobby heavyweights in various memorabilia categories to share insights and stories. About 50 collectors, some traveling long distances, were on hand. Leading off was Andrew Eckert, the director of business operations at Fanatics Live & Fanatics Collect.  Since relaunching PWCC through Fanatics Collect four months ago, the company has been selling 10,000 to 12,000 cards per week. Eckert also touted Fanatics Live, the company’s livestreaming arm where box breaks are conducted by sellers who offer spots in everything from $75 boxes to those that sell for thousands. 2024 Topps Chrome Update breaks with collectors looking for MLB Debut Patch cards–like the well publicized Paul Skenes— has been popular.   “You have his MLB Debut Patch worn on the field in his first game, a pinnacle moment,” Eckart said. “Then you take that patch and he autographs it. Skeenes has become the de facto best chase card in the hobby.” Brigandi asked him what the primary goal is for the company that will eventually own licenses for the NFL and NBA as well as the Topps Company that it now owns.  “Fanatics wants to connect the ecosystem of different kinds of collectors, from the live collector to the pure Topps collectors, through our synergy. It’s the power of all these things.” Since serving as Notre Dame’s Fighting Irish equipment manager in college, Eckhart has become a fervid collector of his alma mater.  He owns every style of the school’s jersey ever worn— 250 in all. Eckhart brought a a green jersey with a blue stripe on the sleeve worn just one game by a punter in 1983, which he bought from a local collector in South Bend.  Each of his four vintage paper ballots for the Heisman Trophy was mailed out to 100 journalists before the digital age, including one from 1956 bearing Hall of Famer Paul Hornung’s name.  On top of that, he asked each living Notre Dame coach for a handwritten play. Lou Holtz complied with a reverse play, detailed by x’s and o’s, that enabled Rocket Ismail to score a touchdown. Khyber Oser, the director of vintage memorabilia and photography at Goldin, co-wrote with Henry Yee, PSA/DNA’s photo authenticator and uber collector Marshall Fogel, the 2002 book that established the “Type” system.  Type 1 original photos of popular sports card images have skyrocketed in value. Original Sports Illustrated photos are some of the hardest to find. Oser showed a 1969 Type 1 photo of Celtics Hall of Famer John Havlicek that graced an SI cover.  As graded magazines gain traction in the hobby, he believes that such photos will attract broader interest (that photo, colorized by SI, is on the auction market now).  “There’s so much more to photos than cards,” Oser said. “They were used for magazines, posters. premiums. postcards. and programs. Babe Ruth photos were on pinbacks (buttons). His underwear box is a Charles Conlon photo. He and other master photographers had secondary usage. Photos are fine art and tell stories. This crossover is what makes photography even more interesting.” Osser held up a Type 1 photo of Mantle’s 1950s M114 Baseball Magazine premium. “If you own the premium, you might want the photo,” he said.  Brigandi shared with Oser and the guests a perfect example of his philosophy.  He acquired a striking 1926 barnstorming poster of Babe Ruth at Oscawana Lake in upstate New York. He was examining with a magnifying glass a Type 1 photo of Babe Ruth giving a trophy to a boy in a baseball uniform.  The trophy had Oscawana Lake stamped on it, making the photo and poster an ideal pair.  In April CCG bought James Spence Authentication to gain a foothold in the autograph business.  The company already authenticated coins, comic books, currency, audio visual games, currency, and sports and non-sports cards. JSA’s founder is still on the job, though.  “I am still authenticating,” Spence said. “I am not playing golf.”  Spence said about 35% of the company’s authentication work is baseball related but the company does everything, including political, entertainment, music and world leaders.  Since Spence launched JSA 19 years ago, he says he has authenticated over one million autographs, including tens of thousands of baseballs. Spence still hand signs the company’s letters of authenticity for virtually everything that has significant value. When it came time to play stump the authenticator, Spence was up the task.  A Cy Young signed ball was quickly rejected. “The ink is way too fresh,” he said. “The ink hasn’t cured or sunk into the leather. The formation is bad. It doesn’t have the sharpness spontaneity. One dead giveaway had nothing to do with the signature itself, though. The printing on the official National League baseball dated to the decade after Young had died in 1955. “This is an outright forgery,” Spence exclaimed. He noted that the three companies whose certification stickers had been applied to the ball had all been banned from eBay.  To someone not familiar with the memorabilia market or autographs in general, it could have been a disastrous purchase.  “This is absolutely authentic,” Spence said after eying a 1968 Jackie Robinson signed check. “I had the pleasure of authenticating every single check when Rachel (Jackie’s widow) sold them to Lelands in the 1990s. She had folders for all of them.” Even a check that has cleared doesn’t necessarily mean the signature is real.  For example, checks from former MLB Players Association chief Marvin Miller many other corporate type checks are stamped.  Many wives and family members of players have also been endorse them.  Thurman Munson, Billy Martin, and Reggie Jackson fit this category; Spence explained. A Babe Ruth signed ball with quote marks around “Babe” was a big whiff.  To save time, Ruth stopped using quote marks around his first name when signing around in 1928 and this ball was from a later period.  The autograph was also off center, another warning sign.  “He hit a sweet spot on 97 percent of all balls.,” Spence said. And there had been other autographs on the ball.  “There’s an abrasion on the north panel,” Spence observed. “Someone tried to turn this into a single-signed ball.” The night’s cleanup hitter for show-and-tell was super collector, Kevin Cohen, who dropped every jaw in the room. His two best pieces, naturally, involved Ruth.  An autographed Ruth on a creamy Harridge ball was authenticated by JSA and also graded a PSA 8. “You can see the autograph clear across the room,” he declared.  Brigandi said it was easily a six-figure baseball. Equally amazing was letterhead from a building where Ruth once lived. He signed it twice, and PSA encapsulated the autographs with a gem mint grade 10. “This shows you’re a true collector,” Brigandi joked.  “An investor would have cut this in half and sold one to pay for the other.” Cohen’s collecting philosophy is simple: “Eye appeal is the first thing. I have yet to lose on quality.  I have batted .1000.  And I never regret paying extra. I buy less.  One, two or three items per year.” The two least valuable show-and-tell items were the most poignant. Spence had brought along the 1968 Topps Mickey Mantle he pulled from a pack at a candy store back that year. After having Mantle sign it in 1990, Spence kept it in his wallet until it became thoroughly wrinkled. It was the first autographed card CCG authenticated when it bought Spence’s company. Spence then shared his Little League baseball from Englewood, NJ in 1970. when his dad was the coach.  Looking at the names, he ruefully recalled a teammate who was stabbed to death in town at age 15. Another name was Warren Moore, a rap music pioneer. The autograph guru’s parting gift was a pearl of wisdom. “If he is still alive, have your father sign a baseball,” he said. My father, who passed away suddenly in 2005, and I were best friends. We attended countless baseball games together in several cities and I dragged him to card shows. One of my prized possessions is a foul ball he caught at Ebbets Field and dated “7/44.”  It never occurred to me to have him sign it. What a great idea that would have been.

Sports Collectors Daily,1908-09 Ogden Pugilists and Wrestlers a Landmark Combat Set,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/1908-09-ogden-pugilists-and-wrestlers-a-landmark-combat-set/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 23:43:33 +0000","The Ogden Pugilists and Wrestlers set includes stars, a high number series, and a legendary rookie card.","November 25, 2024 By Anson Whaley  When it comes to early boxing card sets, few are as collectible as the 1908-09 Ogden Pugilists and Wrestlers set. No, these aren’t the earliest cards depicting the sport. There are several 19th century boxing sets that hold more prestige and value. Other sets, too, were released around the same time as this one. In particular, the T219 Champions, T220 Prizefighters, and T225 Prize Fight series’ were all distributed just afterwards and are popular targets. But there are several reasons why this foreign set is a landmark release that is attainable to collectors. While the majority of UK cigarette cards didn’t hit the market until the 1920s and 1930s, there are still a large number of sets available before that time. The 1908-09 Ogden Pugilists and Wrestlers set is one of those. Ogden’s, a famous cigarette brand in the UK, actually distributed several boxing series’, starting in 1901 and lasting into the 1920s. However, their 1908-09 Pugilists and Wrestlers set might be the most popular of those releases. The set is broken up into two series’. The first series was issued in 1908 and features cards No. 1-50. A shorter (and rarer) second series was distributed in 1909 for cards No. 51-75. It is worth pointing out that part of the reason the first series cards are seen more often is that some were actually reprinted in 1909 as well. While cards No. 1-25 are only believed to have been printed in 1908, cards No. 26-50 were also printed into 1909 (these have a strong white back as opposed to ones more off-white in color). The cards’ appearance is almost Allen & Ginter Champions-like in nature. Fronts feature color lithographs of subjects against all white backgrounds, similar to those popular American-issued N28 and N29 multi-sport cards that preceded them by about 30 years. There are three things in particular that make these cards highly collectible, even in addition to the outstanding artwork. First, the cards are somewhat easy to find. While American collectors were probably not too familiar with them in the pre-internet days, they are now found online quite easily. eBay is a great starting point for these cards, yes. But vintage dealers online from the UK, or even America, are good places to look, too. You are not too likely to stumble upon them at your local card shop. These are, after all, boxing cards more than a century year old. Still, online shopping makes finding them much easier. eBay often has a few hundred listings available. The cards, too, are pretty affordable. I’ll cover cost a bit later, but the majority of this set can be built quite reasonably. Finally, the checklist includes fighters from many years up until that point. Ogden didn’t just include current boxers. The roster goes all the way back to the days of bare knuckle fighters in the 19th century. The set is headlined by plenty of Hall of Famers and stars, including John Sullivan, James Jeffries, Joe Gans, Sam Langford, and more. And in addition to those, true to the name of the set, cards of early wrestlers are included, too. The highlights there are early cards of Hall of Famers and early champions Frank Gotch and Georges Hackenschmidt. If you’re building the set, don’t underestimate the wrestling subset. Several of those cards are desirable and Gotch’s card is one of the most valuable in either series. As if all of that isn’t enough, the set also includes a pair of key rookie cards.  Baseball card collectors have been drawn to the set in recent years by the presence of Abe Attell. Attell was famously a conspirator in the 1919 World Series scandal involving the Chicago White Sox. While Attell has plenty of other boxing cards, this one is important as it is viewed as his rookie. The real headliner, however, is the card of Hall of Famer Jack Johnson. Similar to Attell’s, while other Johnson cards command interest, this one has the added benefit of being a rookie card. Johnson, for the record, does have at least one other rookie. That one is found in James Jeffries’ 1909 playing card set, as I wrote a while back. But this one not only pictures Johnson on his own, it also comes in a more traditional card set. Of the two, his Ogden card is by more desirable to most collectors. A final note here is that the cards bear a strong resemblance to another boxing set that Ogden released a few years later in 1915. While the checklist is different, the cards can easily appear to be in the same set. The 1915 Ogden Boxers cards have similar fronts and even feature the same sorts of images — boxer headshots. The have the same Ogden’s Cigarettes title at the top and the same capital letter font for the names at the bottom. They could easily be mistaken for a third series of sorts. However, they are easily separated by the backs. Even though the backs also have a similar style, the 1915 cards are titled ‘Boxers’ instead of ‘Pugilists and Wrestlers.’ That set is also not nearly as heavily traded as it contains fewer stars than the earlier Pugilists and Wrestlers issue. As mentioned earlier, the cards aren’t too difficult to find if you know where to look online. However, finding them out ‘in the wild’ in person is a much more difficult task. While they are not scarce, they can be tricky to find at shops or even card shows. Prices, however, are often collector friendly. If interested in acquiring a set, a collector’s best bet is to buy the cards in lots. While individual commons from the first series often are sold in the $5-$10 range, in lots, it is possible to find them at times for closer to $2-$3 a card in lesser condition. The stars, of course, are a bit more. Cards, too, in the higher-numbered second series usually often are closer to $10-$15. But even the most expensive cards can fit into many collector budgets. Attell’s aforementioned card is still a relative bargain, usually starting around $25. The card of Gotch the wrestler is typically the second most valuable card, starting around $50-$100. Johnson’s rookie, of course, is the most valuable. And while nicer examples are not cheap, low-grade raw examples can be found for as little as $150-$250. Complete sets, particularly with both series’, are rare. However, on occasion you can find them available. Complete first series’ are more readily seen than the second series with Johnson’s rookie and the high-numbered Gotch card often pulled out and sold separately. There are usually a few hundred listings for the 1908-09 Ogden Pugilists and Wrestlers on eBay.

According to Robert Edward Auctions, the case was discovered recently at an estate sale in Richmond, VA, located just ten miles from where the American Tobacco Company factory that made them was located. Is there a multi-million- dollar pristine copy of the famed Honus Wagner card in one of them?  Not likely, but the tantalizing possibility of a Walter Johnson, Cy Young, Christy Mathewson, Ty Cobb or Nap Lajoie is enough to make collectors swoon.  The packs date to the 1910 era when ATC was cranking out millions to serve a nation of smokers.  The estate sale find uncovered by REA’s consignor consisted of 13 packs, even of which were still sealed and while the tax stamp has been broken on the remaining six.  REA says the consignor has decided to keep one pack for his personal collection.  Piedmont packs offered to collectors are often described as dating to the three-year era of baseball card production are often inaccurately researched and the auction house description details some of those issues. The packs offered by REA appear to have a reasonable chance of containing a baseball card, but ATC also produced non-sports cards in the era and the possibility of a bird card instead of a baseball card can’t be ruled out.  Either way, most potential buyers are likely to keep the pack unopened because of the scarcity. The case they came in originally housed 50 packs and the one offered by REA is the only one known to exist.  The Piedmont packs aren’t the only new discoveries offered for sale in what is one of REA’s largest auctions each year. As was reported last week, a 1916 Morehouse Baking Babe Ruth rookie card graded PSA 3.5, and over 100 other cards from the same set, are making their hobby debut.  Brought to market by a collector who made contact with the owner while at a yard sale, the cards were distributed through a bakery in Massachusetts.  It’s the first Morehouse Ruth ever documented and presented for sale. More than a dozen other Hall of Famers and stars of the day were also part of the find.  Bidding on the Ruth card quickly topped $500,000 in the first 48 hours after the auction opened. Also on the block is a newly discovered T206 Ty Cobb with the Cobb tobacco back graded PSA 2.5 that had a high bid of $185,000 as of Sunday afternoon.   According to REA, “This card comes to us from a family outside of Greensboro, North Carolina, where the card was the centerpiece of a large vintage baseball card collection built between the 1970s and 1990s. Originally purchased at a flea market in the 1980s by our consignor’s father, the card was highlighted in an August 1990 feature story in their hometown newspaper, a copy of which accompanies the card. The collection, and this incredible rarity, was eventually passed from father to son, where the T206 Ty Cobb with “Ty Cobb” back stayed in its original ungraded state until just earlier this year.” The card’s arrival on the auction market comes just days after SC Daily reported on another new T206 Cobb back that will enter the market through dealer MINT State, which plans to sell it on consignment on behalf of the family that owns it—and hundreds of other T206 cards. Following the announcement of his third MVP Award, the auction features a 2018 Topps Transcendent Japan Autographs #TA-SO17 Shohei Ohtani Rookie Red #1/1 graded PSA 10.  Other modern card highlights include a 1996-1997 Topps Chrome Kobe Bryant rookie Refractor PSA 10 and a 1997-1998 Skybox Metal Universe Championship Precious Metal Gems Basketball #23 Michael Jordan #15/50 PSA 4.

The price was the most ever paid for an 8.5 BGS Jordan and over $100,000 more than the last result, with the rarity of Jordan’s autograph on the card bringing a new level of interest to what’s been one of collecting’s hottest cards this year.  The shorts Jordan wore in all three home games of the “Last Dance” 1998 NBA Finals sold for $216,000–a record for any game worn basketball trunks.  Game- used bats brought strong results as well. The Louisville Slugger Willie Mays used to hit his 660th and final career home run went for $204,000, a 1951 Ted Williams club graded PSA/DNA GU 10 brought $96,000, and a 1967-68 Mays bat graded PSA/DNA GU 10 sold for $90,000.

Consigned by the man who corralled it at Coors Field in Denver on the night of Sept. 27, the ball sold for $158,600 at Goldin late Saturday night. Ohtani ended the year with 54 homers and 59 steals, grabbing one of the latter against the Rockies that night.  The lot included a three-page letter from the man who caught it and pictures of the Japanese media interviewing him afterward. The auction consisted exclusively of game-used and game-worn items and Ohtani memorabilia was a big part of it.  The ball thrown to third base as he slid in safely for his 50th stolen base of the season went for $91,522.  Part of a double steal, the swipe set the stage for Ohtani, who also reached 50 homers against the Miami Marlins that night.  Goldin sold Ohtani’s 50th home run ball for nearly $4.4 million last month and it recently went on display in Taiwan.  The base Ohtani rounded for homers 49,50 and 51 during that monumental day in Miami also sold in the Goldin auction, netting $91,522.   The ball Ohtani hit for his 30th homer of the 2024 season, one that set the record for the furthest home run hit by a Dodger at Dodger Stadium in the Statcast era at 478 feet, rocketed to $86,620.   Ohtani’s 156th career home run ball, which set the record for Japanese born players, netted $57,430.   Other sales included: *Joe Montana 1981 game-worn jersey matched to multiple games and Super Bowl XVI Media Day ($107,360)

Collectors and dealers will have to accept the .99-cent starting price with cards listed through PSA’s eBay page. For several months, PSA has offered the option for collectors to send their items to vaulting and then have the option to consign to eBay but the new option streamlines the process for those who know they want to list an entire order for sale quickly. In both cases, PSA handles the listing and shipping. In five months since launch, over 222,000 items have sold via PSA’s eBay consignment platform. Over 33,000 cards are currently listed. —–   The hunt continues for some of the top MLB Debut patches hidden inside Topps Chrome Update, but a couple of the early pulls have already been graded. The Elly De La Cruz and Pete Crow-Armstrong cards each received 10/10 grades from PSA. While the hunt continues for the Paul Skenes card, the Chrome Updates SuperFractor autograph 1/1 has been pulled —– Huggins & Scott’s Fall Auction is open with nearly 2,200 lots, led by a signed copy of the rare 1980 Charlotte O’s Police Orange Border Cal Ripken Jr. minor league card.

That one didn’t carry a Ripken signature. The event also includes ticket stub and program from Opening Day at Fenway Park on April 20, 1912, the first game ever played there.

Sports Collectors Daily,North Carolina Family’s Inherited Collection Includes Rare Ty Cobb Card,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/north-carolina-familys-inherited-collection-includes-rare-ty-cobb-card/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 03:32:46 +0000","The Lucky 7 Find is legendary.  Now, the same dealer who brought those rare Ty Cobb cards to market has latched onto another one inside a family heirloom collection worth plenty. It’s a deal 5 years in the making.","November 21, 2024 By Rich Mueller  Call it Lucky 7 Find II. Eight and a half years after he landed one of the most memorable–and valuable– finds of vintage baseball cards this century, the longtime owner of MINT State has uncovered another Ty Cobb Tobacco branded Cobb card, along with hundreds of others from the standard T206 set.  This time, the consignment deal Rick Snyder has acquired from a North Carolina family won’t bring as big of a windfall, but the story behind it is certainly worth telling. To understand it, one has to go back a few years. It was in March of 2016 when the South Carolina-based dealer received a phone call that led him to one family’s discovery of no less than seven T206 Cobb/Cobb back cards face down in a paper bag while they cleaned out their great grandparents’ crumbling home in a rural town in the south. Sold to collectors over a period of time, they netted about $3 million. The “Cobb Tobacco” card is a close cousin of the regular T206 Cobb red portrait but the back has an add for Cobb’s own brand of tobacco and proclaims it “King of the Smoking Tobacco World.” It’s believed the cards were placed inside tins of the Hall of Famer’s short lived brand of cut plug tobacco. Only about 15 were known to exist before the discovery.  After reading about what became known as the Lucky 7 find, the North Carolina family realized their own hoard of 570 tobacco cards that had been passed down through the generations was probably worth looking into. It had been hidden away for years, all but forgotten by current family members who weren’t collectors. “Like the Lucky 7 Find, one family member was ready to throw them out and another said ‘no, no, no’,” Snyder said.   That was in 2019. The family began researching the cards, including the Cobb, and came across coverage of the original Lucky 7 Find. Snyder wasn’t that far away and they reached out, offering scans, descriptions and a history of the collection. All but one of the T206s had Piedmont or Old Mill tobacco ads on the back.  The one exception featured the rarest brand of the 16 ad backs associated with the set:  the Cobb brand.  That card–if it was authentic–would take what looked like a very nice, star packed find into a doozy. An intrigued Snyder called back. “We later learned the entire household was huddled around the phone listening and hoping,” he reported.  “The family knew they had what appeared to be an authentic collection of tobacco cards more than 110 years old, and properly identified 545 of the cards from the T206 set with 370 different, more than 70% of the complete set.” Snyder, who often sells on consignment, expressed his interest in helping the family sell the collection but nothing came of it.  Their communication from 2019 remained at the bottom of his text message history. Patience, though, can pay off.  The family contacted him again not long ago and set up a meeting. “It went from nothing for five years to ‘let’s do this now’,’ Snyder told SC Daily.  He traveled to the neighboring state to determine once and for all if  the rare prize was authentic. “As I was examining the Cobb, my consignor asked me ‘Why are you smirking?’  I confessed it was because hers was only the second family I would ever tell that their T206 Ty Cobb with the ‘Ty Cobb’ ad brand was the real deal.”  Now graded 1.5 by PSA, the Cobb back card expected to bring a six-figure price by itself.  Only 21 copies are in PSA’s population report and nine in SGC’s, making it significantly rarer than the famed T206 Honus Wagner card. Earlier this year, a Cobb back graded 2.5 by SGC sold for $432,000. A PSA 1.5 sold back in 2019 for $138,000. The entire collection had remained in the family since the cards were produced. Originally pieced together by a former employee of the American Tobacco Company, presumably someone who worked at Factory No. 25 in Virginia, the cards were given to the North Carolina family as a gift in the first half of the 20th century.  Among the cards that had called the cigar box home for all those years were numerous Hall of Famers, including Christy Mathewson, Cy Young, Tris Speaker, other Cobb cards and assorted rarities.  All carry low technical grades, mostly because because of corner wear but a look at the images of some of the the 250 cards that were submitted for grading shows many to have eye appeal that’s off the charts, with white borders and bright color.     Keeping them tucked in a box and away from the light for about 115 years or so clearly paid dividends.  “They still have a freshness to them,” Snyder said. He estimates the value of what he’s dubbed “The Factory 25 Collection” to be between $300,000 and $400,000.    MINT State will soon start selling the collection on behalf of the family, individually and in groups. About 250 of the cards were graded.   The Cobb card, of course, is the star of the show. “What makes this example so special is that it has no creases or surface wrinkles, typically found on the vast majority of the Cobb with Cobb back,” Snyder remarked. “The card also displays nearly perfect centering on both the front and back.  Extraordinary eye appeal for the PSA 1.5 grade.”   Oh, and that original find from 2016?  The family from the small town later uncovered an eighth Cobb.  Of the 21 reviewed by PSA over the last 30 years or so, Snyder has now submitted nine of them. It’s safe to say the original Lucky 7 Cobb Find is one that won’t be duplicated but being able to sell a fresh copy of one of collecting’s truly rare cards in 2024 is certainly something Snyder wasn’t anticipating. “I guess lightning can and does strike the same place twice.” Rich is the editor and founder of Sports Collectors Daily.

Sports Collectors Daily,Top-Rated 1934 World Wide Gum Set Featured In Heritage Auctions Sale,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/top-rated-1934-world-wide-gum-set-featured-in-heritage-auctions-sale/,"Fri, 22 Nov 2024 02:40:39 +0000","Much rarer than its Goudey brother, the Canadian issue is even tougher to find in anything resembling higher grade. The set being offered by Heritage Auctions is the best one on PSA's Registry.","November 21, 2024 By Bob D'Angelo  The 1930s saw the Goudey Gum Company produce some iconic cards of baseball stars. North of the border, Canadian-based World Wide Gum produced a similar version, but with several key differences. A complete, 96-card set of the 1934 World Wide Gum set, commonly called the “Canadian Goudey,” is part of Heritage Auctions’ Winter Sports Catalog Auction that runs from Dec. 5 to Dec. 7. What makes this set  — catalogued as V354 — so special is that it is the No. 1 All-Time Finest set on the PSA registry. Bidding for the set has already reached $50,000; figure in the 20% buyer’s premium and the top bid is actually $60,000. Heritage Auctions will announce whether the reserve for this item has been met on Dec. 2.  The World Wide Gum set is much rarer than the ’34 Goudey issue.  PSA has graded fewer than 1,800 World Wide Gum cards to date, compared to more than 27,000 Goudeys.  The 1934 World Wide Gum set combines elements of the 1933 and ’34 Goudey designs. The first 48 cards in the set mirror the 1933 Goudey/World Wide Gum design on the front, while cards 49 through 96 are carbon copies of the 1934 set, complete with the “Lou Gehrig Says …” intro. The 1934 set was the final time that World Wide Gum used color on its card fronts. It had white borders and colorful, artistic renditions of the players. The card backs are bilingual, with type in both English and French. They measured 2 3/8 inches by 2 7/8 inches.  The set has some of the biggest names in baseball, and one that was missing from the 1934 Goudey issue — Babe Ruth. Although the Bambino had four cards in the 1933 Goudey set, he had none in the 1934 offering. His 1934 World Wide Gum card uses the same design of the No. 53 card in the ’33 Goudey set. The only difference is the back, with its bilingual type. In the World Wide Gum set, key cards include Ruth (No. 28), Gehrig (No. 92), Rogers Hornsby (No. 1), Dizzy Dean (No. 55) and Jimmie Foxx (No. 58). The set offered in the Heritage Auctions sale includes five cards with a PSA 9 grade, albeit one with a qualifier. Eighteen cards have PSA 8 grades, including Hall of Famers Hornsby, Earle Combs (No. 32), Jesse Haines (No. 44) and an off-center Red Ruffing (No. 48). The largest group of graded cards are 34 PSA 7s, which feature Hall of Famers Ruth,, Dean, Foxx, Rabbit Maranville (No. 4), Herb Pennock (No. 16), Tris Speaker (No. 29) and Charlie Gehringer (No. 57), which is spelled “Charley” in the set. There are 22 cards graded at PSA 6, including Hall of Famers Frank Frisch (No. 64), Leo Durocher (No. 69) and Luke Appling (No. 84). Nine cards are in EX (PSA 5) condition, with Cooperstown enshrines Mickey Cochrane (No. 59), Heinie Manush (No. 68) and Carl Hubbell (No. 71) featured. There are seven PSA 4 cards, highlighted by Hall of Famers Gehrig, Bill Terry (No. 53), Lefty Grove (No. 54), Chick Hafey (No. 78) and Ernie Lombardi (No. 82). Ruth, Gehrig, Dean and Hornsby are the most coveted cards in the set. Ruth was declining as a star but still hit 34 home runs and had 104 RBI in 1933. His numbers fell to 22 homers and 84 RBI in 1934, his final season with the New York Yankees. Gehrig was at his peak in 1934, winning the Triple Crown with 49 home runs and 166 RBI while hitting .363. Dean had his greatest season in 1934, winning 30 games and two more in the World Series as the St. Louis Cardinals soared as baseball’s best that year. Hornsby, meanwhile, was a player-manager in 1934 for the St. Louis Browns, who went 67-85 and finished in sixth place. Bob has been a sportswriter and copy editor for more than 45 years and a blogger for two decades.

In July 2024, Leicester City announced it had signed a sponsorship deal —","In the middle of a relegation battle on the field, English Premier League side Leicester City could be facing problems off the field too, as the financial stability of their front-of-shirt sponsor has been called into question. In July 2024, Leicester City announced it had signed a sponsorship deal — one of the most valuable in its history, the club said at the time — with BC.Game, an online cryptocurrency gaming platform. The site’s logo has appeared on the front of the Leicester City men’s first team jerseys since the 2024-25 Premier League season began in August. But BC.Game’s financial health has been seriously questioned lately. According to iGamingBusiness, bankruptcy petitions were filed in October against the site’s former owner, Blockdance, and its current parent company, Small House, in Curaçao, the Caribbean island nation where BC.Game is licensed. These petitions were filed by The Foundation for the Representation of Victims of Online Gaming and allege Small House has failed to pay out more than $2 million in player winnings since acquiring the site in February 2024. In a statement dated November 21, 2024, BC.Game says the allegations “lack substantive evidence and fail to demonstrate any violations by our platform.” The allegations lack sufficient supporting evidence, with many claims based solely on unverified statements. Our internal investigations have revealed discrepancies in the cases cited by the plaintiffs, with most accusations lacking a clear legal or technical basis. We affirm that BC.GAME has adhered to industry compliance standards in all relevant operations. The statement also raises concerns about lawyers’ conduct in the case and inconsistencies in the case evidence. For their part, Leicester City also released a statement of support for BC.Game: “We have been and continue to be in regular discussions with BC.Game with regard to an active legal case in Curacao. BC.Game have provided the Club with the strongest assurances that they are actively appealing this case, and that the process which has been initiated in Curacao is administrative in nature and has not arisen due to any concerns with their financial standing. “BC.Game have further assured us that they have no issues with liquidity and that they remain fully committed to meeting their ongoing contractual and financial obligations, including to the Club, and that this case will not impact on BC.Game’s continuing international operations.” Should BC.Game not be able to fulfill their deal with Leicester City, it wouldn’t be the first time in recent memory that a cryptocurrency firm has had to terminate a sponsorship contract early. Late in the 2022-23 season, Italian clubs AS Roma and Inter Milan both dropped their front-of-shirt sponsor, blockchain company DigitalBits, over missed contract payments. AC Milan played in blank shirts for a few games before securing streaming service Paramount+ as a new sponsor for the final match of the Serie A season and the UEFA Champions League final. AS Roma, meanwhile, played the rest of the season with the initials “SPQR” on their shirts. The acronym stands for “Senatus PopulusQue Romanus” (“The Senate and the People of Rome”) and it also “appears on Roman currency, at the end of documents made public by an inscription in stone or metal, and in dedications of monuments and public and civil works,” according to Wikipedia. The full phrase “appears in Roman political, legal, and historical literature.”"

This collaboration is based on shared values ​​to which adidas has shown a deep commitment, such as respect for our culture, traditions and passion for soccer. We are sure that the renewal will continue to inspire generations of Mexicans to proudly wear the colors of our National Team,” said FMF executive president Ivar Sisniega. “For adidas, being on the side of Mexican soccer has always been important; being part of the process of achieving success is becoming increasingly important today, and in this sense, we are happy to continue being part of this path.

The new look maintains the popular bee character, a staple in the minor league baseball landscape since 2006, while updating the typography and adding some alternate identities. The new type, which is included in the primary logo and the interlocking cap logo, is meant to allude to the sting of a bee. The interlocking SL cap logo pre-dates the Bees in Salt Lake City, with previous teams in the city like the Gulls and the Trappers using a version of the baseball custom in the 1970s and ’80s. New alternate identities pay tribute to the state of Utah, including one that features the state outline with the word Bees set in a descending staircase that evokes a classic logo from the team’s parent club, the Los Angeles Angels. Another alternate pays homage to the Beehive State with a beehive icon. If you’ve driven through Utah, you’ll know this symbol from the state’s highway signs. Yet another alternate sets pair of crossed bats within a honeycomb, with icons of a baseball and the state of Utah set opposite the letters S and L. The new Bees look pays tribute to teams from the early 20th century with a recreation of a bee illustration on uniforms from the 1920s. The team unveiled a series of wordmarks derived from their new custom typography. The Bees, affiliates of the Los Angeles Angels in the International League, played their final game at Smith’s Ballpark September 22. Next season the team will play in South Jordan, about 20 miles south Salt Lake City, at brand-new Daybreak Field."

About two weeks after the conclusion of the 2024 Korean Series in late October, the KBO League team based in Daejeon, South Korea, unveiled a new suite of logos and uniforms for 2025. While the orange remains in their colour palette from previous seasons, it is now complemented by a dark shade of navy blue instead of black.

Both identities were created by designer Matthew Wolff. The wordmarks include one in cursive script and one in all caps. Both were “developed with the motif of an eagle’s beak and talons,” the team said on social media. The cursive script—used in the primary logo and on both the white home and orange alternate uniforms—is “a modern reinterpretation of the logo from the championship days,” when the Eagles won their only Korean Series in 1999. Also included in the new suite is an eagle head logo with lightning bolts in the neck. This logo doesn’t appear on the Eagles’ new uniforms, but it is used on their website, on team merchandise, and on a flag that was used in the photo shoots for the new uniforms. The Eagles’ white home uniforms feature the scripted wordmark in one-colour orange, while the front number is navy blue. The corporate wordmark of the Hanwha Group — a worldwide conglomerate based in Korea that deals in everything from energy to finance — appears in orange on the left shoulder. A single orange stripe runs down each side of the pants. The grey away uniforms have slightly darker grey pinstripes and a navy blue all-caps wordmark on the front, along with an orange front number. A navy blue stripe runs down each side of the pants. The Eagles also unveiled two alternate jerseys, one orange and one navy blue. The orange one has a navy blue script wordmark and a white front number, while the navy blue one has a white all-caps wordmark and a white front number. The navy alternate is also the only one where the unveiling photos showed a clear view of the back; in this case, the player name is one-colour white, while the number is one-colour orange. The Eagles’ social media announcement pictured all four jerseys with the same cap or batting helmet, which has a navy blue base and an orange script “E” on the front. Along with the Eagles and Twins, Wolff has done design work for Major League Soccer’s Chicago Fire and Los Angeles Football Club; New York/New Jersey Gotham FC, Racing Louisville, San Diego Wave FC and Angel City FC of the National Women’s Soccer League; and USL clubs like Louisville City, Union Omaha and FC Tulsa. He also worked on the typography as part of the rebranding of the National Basketball Association’s Los Angeles Clippers, which was unveiled in February 2024. The Hanwha Eagles joined the KBO League in 1986 as the Binggrae Eagles, as Binggrae was the name of Hanwha’s confectionary branch. They changed their name in 1993 when Binggrae separated from the Hanwha conglomerate. They won their only Korean Series championship in 1999 but have been runners-up five times (1988, 1989, 1991, 1992, 2006)."

The Armada — based in Boisbriand, Quebec, just north of Montréal — have primarily used black and white as their team colors since joining the QMJHL in 2011. But they added blue to their palette over the weekend with the unveiling of the third jersey, which they wore at home both on Friday against the Acadie-Bathurst Titan and Saturday against the Val d’Or Foreurs. While the new third jersey maintains a black base — echoing the Armada’s “Bleed Black” motto — the squared-off shoulders are blue, as are stripes around the waist and sleeves. The front of the jersey features a new logo, with “ARMADA” in black running across a black “A”, both of which have white outlines. Blue was chosen because it “embodies the spirit of an armada that strongly cuts through the waves, weathering storms and staying on course toward a future full of promise” (translated to English by Google). Atop the “A” is a blue crown that the team says is made up of two horizontal Bs. The bottom line of the crown symbolizes Autoroute 15, which runs through Boisbriand and is part of the Trans-Canada Highway.

(&#8216;Member member berries?)","As far as old hockey logos go, the Vancouver Canucks’ “flying skate” logo might be one of the most divisive of them all. Was this actually a logo good enough to warrant a rebirth, or are we simply hitting the member berries a little too hard again? (‘Member member berries?) With its sharp lines, vibrant red-and-yellow colour palette, and a sense of speed woven into its look, it was a vast departure from the club’s previous blue-and-green hockey stick design when it was introduced in 1978. It was also the most visible element for one of the most memorable runs in franchise history when they went all the way to Game 7 of the 1994 Stanley Cup Final. Though they fell just short of ultimate glory, the love for the logo lives on, guaranteed to instantly bring back memories of that team that was just a win away. As the ’94 team celebrates its 30th anniversary—and as the flying skate continues to make its mark now as an incredibly popular alternate jersey—let’s take a closer look at the origins of the flying skate logo and that colour scheme: how they came to be, their controversial reception, and how they have cemented their place in Vancouver’s visual identity. When the Canucks decided to overhaul their look in 1978, they turned to Beyl and Boyd, a San Francisco-based design agency, to create a bold and aggressive new identity. The result was a massive shift from the team’s look up until that point—gone were the blue and green of the original uniforms, replaced by a vibrant red, orange, yellow, and black colour scheme meant to evoke energy and aggression. “The Canucks colours were all wrong,” designer Bill Boyd told the Vancouver Sun in 1978. “Blue-green is the coolest colour of all; [it] slows the pulse, reduces aggression, and promotes calmness. With the [new] Canucks uniforms, we are going from the coolest of colours—blue-green—to the hottest—red-orange. The cool colour is passive, the hot one aggressive, plus the black. It’s the contrast of colours that creates emotion.” This aggressive new palette was paired with a dynamic new logo by illustrator Mike Bull. The flying skate design replaced the stick-in-rink logo, which Boyd and his team considered too static for the fast-paced game of hockey. The skate, speeding diagonally across the word “Canucks,” embodied motion, style, and progress. According to Boyd, the new logo was specifically chosen for its positive attributes of “movement and style,” reflecting the Canucks’ desire to inject energy and aggression into their brand. The change was as symbolic as it was visual, trading one piece of hockey equipment (the stick) for another (the skate) in a way that underscored the true speed of the game. It bore the hallmarks of the pop art movement, with sharp angles and a bold, contrasting colour palette. It was part of a broader trend in the late 1970s, as sports teams experimented with their aesthetics to stand out in increasingly competitive markets. Initially, the Flying Skate’s impact on the uniforms was minimal, appearing only on the sleeves of the jersey and serving as a secondary element to the far more overpowering “V” design on the chest—a representation of the City of Vancouver. “Diagonal stripes get your attention. They’re like the crooked picture on the wall. You have to fix it, or it drives you crazy,” Boyd explained. The Canucks continued to break from tradition by wearing yellow jerseys at home instead of white, with Boyd emphasizing, “White produces no response at all, so we went for yellow… Yellow is warm, pleasant, happy, upbeat.” As with most bold design choices, the look proved polarizing. Critics mocked the new uniforms, with The Financial Post joking, “So the Canucks will go from ‘cool’ to ‘hot’ just by changing their uniforms? The rest of the teams could wear sunglasses, that is, if they aren’t already colourblind.” By 1982, the Canucks had made a surprise run to the Stanley Cup Final, providing the flying skate logo with its first big moment on the national stage. Unfortunately, the New York Islanders quickly swept aside the team and eventually the “V” jerseys. Just three years later, the Canucks updated their look, moving the flying skate logo from the sleeves to the front of the jersey while shifting the “V” to the shoulders. These changes introduced a cleaner, more traditional uniform layout, though the colour scheme of red, yellow, and black remained intact. By the late 1980s, dissatisfaction with the team’s look persisted. Brian Burke, the Canucks’ director of hockey operations at the time, criticized the jerseys on a local radio show, calling the home uniforms a shade of “puke-yellow.” His remarks inspired a 20-year-old fan named Jeremie White to propose a new uniform concept, pitching designs that replaced the colour scheme with black and blue and introducing a new design featuring a hockey stick flying through a “V.” While Burke dismissed the colour and logo change, he saw potential in White’s skills and ideas. Partnering with general manager Pat Quinn, White refined the design, resulting in a significant uniform update in 1989. The new look eliminated the shoulder “V”s, reintroduced traditional striping on the jerseys, and replaced the “puke yellow” home uniforms with a white set. The flying skate logo remained front and centre on the chest of both the home white and road black sweaters. White’s vision, combined with Quinn’s leadership, ultimately helped refine the look that became synonymous with the Canucks’ most competitive teams of the ’90s. The flying skate logo undoubtedly reached its peak during the 1994 Stanley Cup Final, where it adorned the jerseys of a gritty Canucks team led by Trevor Linden, Pavel Bure, and Kirk McLean. Though it ended in heartbreak, the flying skate became synonymous with that era of Canucks hockey and a moment when many younger fans forged their lifelong love for the team. The popularity of that team wasn’t enough to stop the radical design shift the sports world experienced in the mid-to-late 1990s. Just three years later, it was gone, replaced with a new orca-focused logo and then, eventually, a return to that cool-and-calming blue and green colour scheme. ‘Member blue and green? Despite its forced retirement, the flying skate’s popularity endured. While the orca logo ushered in a new chapter for the Canucks, many fans saw it as a corporate pivot—a sharp departure from the community-driven passion the flying skate represented. In 2019-20, as part of the team’s 50th-anniversary celebrations, the Canucks wore the flying skate jerseys for select games before bringing it back as a full-fledged third jersey during the 2022-23 season. They say sometimes you have to lose something to love something, and that appears to be the case here with the Flying Skate logo. Widely panned in its day, the Flying Skate is now more popular than ever, with fans often pleading for it to return full-time, hoping to join a handful of other NHL teams that have corrected their ’90s redesigns. As a hockey fan who grew up watching those black, red, and gold Canucks teams, I never got the appeal of that look at the time, but I can’t deny the warm-and-fuzzies I feel whenever I see them hit the ice today. It’s not just about the bold colours or sharp lines—it’s about the grit of Trevor Linden, the jaw-dropping magic of Pavel Bure, and the electric atmosphere of the old Pacific Coliseum every time the team stepped on the ice in that unforgettable outfit. ‘Member Gino Odjick?

The franchise unveiled the new identity during a ceremony at the Wilson Industrial Air Center, a historic training site for World War II aviators. The nickname Warbirds is a reference to military aircraft that continue to fly after their service days are over. More specifically, the name is a tribute to Wilson’s own Vollis Simpson, a World War II pilot who went on to become a sculptor. Simpson was best know for creating a series of large, wind-powered “Whirligig” structures, which will be visible beyond the left field wall in the team’s new downtown ballpark. “Designed to symbolize historical significance and unmatched speed, the logo celebrates community passions for baseball, aviation, and Americana,” the team said in a statement. The brand was created by Rev Pop, a design firm based in Milwaukee, the hometown of the Warbirds’ MLB parent club, the Brewers. An understated metallic color palette and an anthropomorphic, patriotic bird character in period costume evoke a distinctive 1940s vibe. “Scott Starr of Rev Pop, who led the process of developing the team name and associated logos, spent significant time researching everything about Wilson and the region,” said Milwaukee Brewers President of Business Operations Rick Schlesinger, quoted in a statement. “His travels included visits with local citizens and civic officials, and this proved to be the first big step in branding the team.” Fans of the classic Carolina Mudcats brand, which until yesterday had remained largely unchanged since 1991, will have one last season to enjoy an identity that many fans point to as one of the most definitive of this current era of Minor League Baseball. The Warbirds will take to the field, still a Brewers affiliate in the Carolina League, in 2026."

𝐖𝐞𝐞𝐤 𝟏𝟏 𝐔𝐧𝐢𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐬 🔴⚫⚫ pic.twitter.com/Ld8bZW1Pb3 The red helmets feature Utah’s interlocking “U” logo and a tribal tattoo – known as kākau – on the right side, while the left side includes the phrase “Malama Lahaina,” an outline of the Hawaiian island of Maui and a depiction of Lahaina’s iconic Front Street, which was destroyed by wildfire in 2023. Created by Samoan artist Fred Frost of Utah-based Frost City Tattoos, the tattoo represents the islands of Polynesia and the Polynesian players and coaches who have come through the program, while the stripe down the center of the helmet is inspired by the Hawaiian tradition of lauhala weaving.  “Malama,” meanwhile, is the Hawaiian word for caring, nurturing and preserving the land and its people, an important message as the Lahaina wildfire caused more than $5 billion in damage and claimed the lives of 102 people, marking the deadliest weather-related disaster in the state’s history.

The jerseys were unveiled in front of 1,500 supporters, including Gov. Janet Mills, at a special event at the State Theater in Portland on the evening of Thursday, November 21. Hearts of Pine executive creative director Burke Cherrie, who co-designed the kits with club founder Gabe Hoffman-Johnson, told SportsLogos.net in an interview just hours before the reveal that the club was aiming for a timeless design that people across Maine would be proud to wear. “Mainers, in particular, like the old ways. There’s a convergence of the old ways and the new ways here,” Cherrie said. “We don’t discard the past. That’s something that really resonated throughout the branding process. In town halls with supporters and local government officials, talking with people who run businesses, there was a desire for this to be as Maine as possible. And history and heritage are a key part of that.” The jersey features navy blue and forest green hoops all over the front, back and sleeves to represent the Atlantic Ocean and the woods that Mainers interact with every day, either for recreation or to earn a living. The sleeve cuffs and polo collar are navy blue with red trim inspired by the heart in the club’s crest. The club motto, “Lead With Your Heart,” and Dirigo heart logo — a mashup of their heart iconography and the “Dirigo star” from the Maine flag — appear on the back collar. “We’ve been working on the [kit] design for really over a year. As we were developing the crest and everything else that went into the brand, the jersey design was front and center in that process,” Cherrie said. “Gabe and I are lifelong soccer fans, and there’s a lot of nostalgia for ’90s soccer culture, from when we were growing up,” he added. “I have a lot of great memories of long-sleeved jerseys and big collars and cuffs. A soccer jersey is performance wear, but it’s also fashion in today’s world. To bring back some of those trends, we felt there was an opportunity to lean into that.” The front-of-shirt sponsor is Visit Maine, the state’s tourism office, and their logo of the state’s name with a period appears in white. The sleeve sponsor is L.L.Bean, the outdoor clothing and equipment retailer based in Maine. “I would argue we have the best front-of-shirt and sleeve sponsorship combo in American soccer, and probably the world,” Cherrie said. “I don’t think you can find a European club or a South American club that has a more unified club brand aligned with its sponsors’ brands. That’s a credit to the team that’s been working on sponsorships, the commercial side of things, to bring that to life.” The kits are manufactured by Danish sportswear company Hummel, who also produce kits for Denmark’s national teams as well as German Bundesliga team Werder Bremen; Spanish La Liga clubs UD Las Palmas, Real Betis and RC Celta de Vigo; and French Ligue 1 side AS Saint-Étienne. “It’s a small world, and I’m fortunate to have friends on the other side of the table,” said Cherrie, who has worked in sports media for more than a decade, collaborating with high-profile European clubs like Liverpool and Chelsea in the past. “I’m a huge soccer fan, and my dad was obsessed with the 1992 Danish national team that wore Hummel. The chevrons and the history that’s gone into that 100-year-old brand, that always felt like a really good fit for us. And they really align with the culture of Maine; it’s a brand that punches above its weight.” Portland Hearts of Pine will kick off its 2025 USL League One season at Fitzpatrick Stadium, a 6,300-seat facility in Portland. The club launched its crest — also co-designed by Cherrie — in April 2024, which incorporates elements from the Maine seal and other state symbols. The heart in the crest is inspired by the Valentine’s Day Bandit, whose tradition of decorating storefronts and other structures in Portland with red hearts every February 14 has carried on beyond the original Bandit’s passing in 2023. Though he grew up in Pennsylvania and went to college in New York City, Cherrie has called Maine home for the past six years. To spearhead the development of a brand for a local team and watch his designs become reality has a real thrill for him. “To walk down the street and see a crest you helped create on someone’s hat at happy hour or whatever it is, it’s special to see that,” he said. “The way Portland and much of Maine has taken to the brand has been amazing.” He adds, though, that since the crest unveiling, Hearts of Pine has shipped merchandise to 45 different U.S. states and internationally. “Once you’re a Mainer, it sticks with you.” The 2025 USL League One regular season will kick off in March. Hearts of Pine plans to reveal a second kit in February and a third kit a month or two into the season, depending on potential kit clashes with opponents. Cherrie was coy about the details of the second and third kits, but did say the team was “cooking up something pretty unique” for those. “As excited as I am about this one, I think the second and third kits are going to strike a different chord with both fans of the club and people who collect jerseys,” he said. The Woods and Water Kit is available in unisex short-sleeve, unisex long-sleeve, women’s and kids’ sizes through Hearts of Pine’s online store and at the club’s holiday pop-up shop in Portland."

This potentially would bring women’s professional basketball back to Cleveland for the first time in over twenty years. The team would be the WNBA’s 16th franchise, joining the league’s growing roster as early as 2027 or 2028. The new franchise would play its home games at Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse, which has undergone significant renovations in recent years. Additionally, the team would utilize the Cleveland Clinic Peak Performance Center, a new state-of-the-art training and business facility currently under development and set to open in 2027. “It has long been woven into our mission to utilize our platform to unite our community in ways that drive equal opportunities across the board,” said Rock Entertainment Group in a statement to Reuters. “To that end, we are actively pursuing bringing a WNBA expansion team to Cleveland.” Cleveland previously had a WNBA team, the Cleveland Rockers, one of the league’s original franchises. The Rockers played from 1997 to 2003, folding after then-owner Gordon Gund ceased operations and the league could not find a new owner. The city recently hosted the 2024 NCAA Women’s Final Four, which broke television viewership records for women’s sports. The WNBA, currently a 12-team league, is in the midst of a rapid expansion.

They have flown nine different types aircraft dating back to World War II, with the pilots of Vought F4U Corsairs racking up over 150 kills by the end of the war. Other aircraft flown by the Jolly Rogers include the Grumman F6F Hellcat, F9F Cougar, FJ-3 Fury, McDonnell F3H Demon, Vought F-8 Crusader, McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, F-14 A/B Tomcat and the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets.

As is the case with all Winter Classic games, both teams will be wearing uniforms inspired by the history of hockey in their communities. The Blackhawks, again, will reach back into the wealth of options their ninety-eight-year-old wardrobe offers. St Louis, on the other hand, has had fewer unique uniform designs over the years (and has already used up the big ones several times) and, therefore, has gone away from the franchise history a bit for their design. SHOP: 2025 NHL Winter Classic Blues and Blackhawks jerseys available now Starting with Chicago, a uniform which had leaked a couple of months ago is now confirmed as legit. We get the first time the Blackhawks have worn red for an outdoor game. Inspired by their uniforms and crests worn during the 1940s and ’50s, the Blackhawks will have several horizontal stripes across the chest in white and black with a mishmash of team logos as the main crest. The current Blackhawks’ primary logo is the centrepiece inside a roundel with four stars around the bottom, a nod to the Chicago city flag. The typeface within the roundel is a block, serif-style font, which is very close to what the crest featured on their uniforms of the late ’40s/early ’50s. You’ll note that the team name was presented as two words in those original photos; the team made their name a single word in 1986. On the back of the jersey, the player numbers incorporate a pinstripe pattern, a nod to the Chicago Cubs (perfect for a game at Wrigley Field). From the NHL: The Blackhawks’ NHL Winter Classic uniform pays homage to the franchise’s rich heritagewhile introducing distinctive new design elements. The jersey features a classic lace-neckcollar, reminiscent of hockey’s early days, complemented by a vintage cream color thatcaptures the nostalgic spirit of the Original Six era. In unique design flourishes, the frontcrest includes stars from the Chicago flag and the back numbers incorporate subtlepinstripes, a thoughtful tribute to Chicago’s deep baseball tradition. The elements cometogether to create a uniform that honours both the team’s storied past and the city’s broadersporting legacy. The St Louis Blues design looks like they’re going back to the 1930s St. Louis Flyers, a team that predates the Blues’ time in the NHL by three decades. The striping across the chest, with the team name across it, seems to be directly inspired by those Flyers uniforms. The colours blue and gold are not what the Flyers wore, but they, of course, are present here to tie this uniform to the Blues franchise. The font for the ST LOUIS name across the chest is a modified version of that prototype Blues jersey, which served as the inspiration for their Reverse Retro 2.0 uniform back in 2022-23. Something that caught my eye is a modified Bluenote logo on the shoulder, perhaps testing the waters for a future change. From the NHL: The Blues’ NHL Winter Classic uniform pays homage to the city’s hockey heritage. Thejersey’s primary wordmark represents the first time in team history that a Blue Note is notthe principal design element appearing on the chest. The font styling and numbers areinspired by an unworn prototype Blues uniform from 1966, and the jersey also includes anewly designed vintage-style “Blue Note” on the shoulder. Lastly, fleur-de-lis designs arefeatured on the inside back neck and hem loop labels to honour the city of St. Louis.

A retro-style pig character—much friendlier than the IronPigs metallic contemporary logo—features prominently on a red cap. A cream-colored jersey is adorned by red piping and a script wordmark across the chest—note the curly-Q on the descender of the G in Pigs, meant to evoke a pig’s tail. “What started as a focus on reimagining the full body pig characters ended up taking a nice ‘what-if’ turn,” Ryan Foose said. “2024 actually marks 140 years of baseball in Allentown. While this identity doesn’t necessarily pull all the way back to the 1880s, it was great collaborating with Lehigh Valley staff on what the IronPigs Baseball Club would look like from the golden era of baseball.” The IronPigs, who are named for the pig iron forged in the steel mills of eastern Pennsylvania, will play their first Friday home game on opening day, March 28, 2025."

That is the time when general managers from around the league get together, and baseball's hot stove really heats up. But this year, the stove is already warm. The Juan Soto sweepstakes are at a fever pitch, with several teams clamoring for his services. MLB Network's Jon Morosi confirmed reports by New York Yankees beat writer Randy Miller that five teams have already submitted their initial offers.  The Yankees have been the betting favorites to return the star outfielder. The New York Mets have openly expressed their desire to be aggressive in acquiring Soto. But maybe the true dark horse is the Toronto Blue Jays, who are among the five teams to have submitted an offer already. The other teams are the aforementioned Yankees, Mets, Boston Red Sox, and Los Angeles Dodgers. Even though the Dodgers clearly have the capital to pull the move off, it still seems like a long shot. The Red Sox are likely not close to contending for a World Series, which is something Soto's camp has stressed. The Yankees and Mets are obviously legit contenders. But the Blue Jays make sense on a lot of levels. For one, their last-place finish in the American League East in 2024 had more to do with injuries than talent.  The lineup already features Vlad Guerrero Jr., Bo Bichette, Daulton Varsho, George Springer, and Alejandro Kirk. Plus, Spencer Horwitz is coming off of a strong rookie campaign and should only get better. Their rotation boasts top-end talent and depth with Kevin Gausman, Chris Bassitt, and Jose Berrios. Alek Manoah is still recovering from elbow surgery but should return before the All-Star break. This team is far better than most realize. It stands to reason the Blue Jays' brass pointed that out while meeting with Soto and his camp. But only time will tell if it will be enough, as a second round of offers is expected in the coming weeks.

Sporting News RSS,Phillies All-Star Jeff Hoffman hints at where he will play in 2025,https://www.sportingnews.com/us/mlb/philadelphia-phillies/news/phillies-all-star-jeff-hoffman-hints-where-he-will-play-2025/c317e70162deb1cbd80b2b57,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 18:50:28 +0000",Philadelphia Phillies reliever Jeff Hoffman recently opened up about his future entering free agency.,"Jackson Roberts The Philadelphia Phillies and All-Star reliever Jeff Hoffman were a match made in heaven for the last two years, but that doesn't guarantee the relationship will continue. After struggling for years as a starting pitcher with the Colorado Rockies and Cincinnati Reds, Hoffman became one of Major League Baseball's most dominant bullpen arms in Philadelphia. He totaled a 2.28 ERA and 158 strikeouts across 118 2/3 innings pitched with the Phillies. Hoffman endeared himself to Philadelphia, but loyalty has to take a backseat when it comes to free agency. The 31-year-old righty expects plenty of suitors, and there's even talk that he could go back to being a starter, increasing both his demand and earning potential. It's going to be a tough decision for Hoffman no matter what, but if Phillies fans were looking for hope, he gave it to them. In an interview with ESPN's Kiley McDaniel, Hoffman declined to specifically state whether he was hoping for a return to the Phillies, but gushed praise about the environment he'd been pitching in for the past two years. ""It's hard to even explain what it feels like pitching in Philly, because of the noise, how in tune with the game [the fans] are, it feels like the field surface is alive,"" Hoffman said. ""When the big moments happen, you can hear it from the ground up, like the stadium has the same heartbeat as you.""  Hoffman also laid out what was most important to him from a potential new team if he's not able to reunite with the Phillies this winter. ""The thing that's most important to me is being on a contender, playing deep into October,"" he said. ""Playing meaningful baseball, it makes the clubhouse that much more enjoyable when everyone is playing for the same thing. That's what I want out of my next situation.""  Because he's been so dominant, Hoffman could be in position to land a three-year contract, worth upwards of $30 million in total value and potentially even exceeding $40 million. That's a lot to commit to a reliever, but perhaps a team would actually be landing a new starter.  It's early, and Hoffman's future is still as unpredictable is ever. But one thing remains clear: he loves Philadelphia, and if all other things are equal, it sure seems like he'd prefer to be back on the mound at Citizens Bank Park.

Through the first half of League Phase play, these two European giants have combined for just three total wins across eight matches, with Bayern sitting 17th in the overall table and PSG facing even more dire circumstances in 25th. Just the top eight sides in the final standings earn an immediate pass to the Round of 16, while the next 16 must contest a playoff round and the bottom eight are eliminated outright. This means Bayern are well off the pace for an outright bye while PSG currently occupy the first elimination position.

 BET NOW:Latest odds for Champions League games and best bets for the Bayern Munich vs. PSG match on BetMGM Both clubs hold comfortable leads in their domestic league tables, but those accomplishments pale in comparison to European play as both managers know an early exit from the Champions League would leave their job security in considerable peril. MORE: A complete guide to betting on soccer in the United States Bayern have had PSG's number across their numerous Champions League matchups, even as the French side boasted some of the world's most formidable attacking stars. Tuesday's hosts have won six of their last eight all-time meetings, dating back to September of 2017. Furthermore, in those six Bayern Munich victories, PSG were shut out in four of them, scoring just two total goals in those defeats, while it took a three-goal outburst to secure both of their victories. At this point, Bayern are just a more complete team, and while both sides see their greatest weaknesses in midfield, Josh Kimmich and Leon Goretzka should manage to boss the match effectively. Dayot Upamecano has been known for a host of high-profile defensive gaffes over the past year, and his partnership with Kim Min-Jae has yet to develop into one of Europe's best as it was thought, but the Bayern Munich defense has quietly hit a strong run of form. Since the embarrassing 4-1 defeat to Barcelona in late October, Bayern Munich have not conceded a single goal over their last six matches across all competitions. Not all clean sheets are alike, but these have been well-earned — they have allowed just 26 total shots across those six games, including an astonishing six total efforts over their last three games, holding Benfica to just one measly attempt in their last Champions League match. Flip things around, and PSG have somehow held their opponents to the fewest number of shots of any team in the Champions League thus far. While it hasn't translated to success on the scoresheet, that is an indication that Bayern may not experience the joy they're used to in front of goal. 

 While Michael Olise's early-season form has faded somewhat, Jamal Musiala's has not. The Germany wonderkid has been electric in recent weeks, even amidst the October slump as the rest of his team faltered around him. Musiala has found the net in two of his last four league games, along with the team's only goal in the 1-0 Champions League victory over Benfica. While he blanked over the weekend against Augsburg, he ripped off an insane TEN total shots without finding the back of the net, and he had four against Benfica while profiting. He even scored for Germany on the recent international break, one of many in the 7-0 win over Bosnia & Herzegovina. The 21-year-old is +180 to score anytime, but given his additional creative influence (2.38 xA in Bundesliga play plus a pair of assists against Dinamo Zagreb in Bayern's Champions League opener), it's worth taking the hit on return in a game where goals could be a bit harder to come by than the odds suggest.

On Friday, Fadeaway World’s Fran Leiva put out a new report indicating that the Lakers could be in talks with the Indiana Pacers this winter about a trade involving two starter-level players on expiring contracts. “Myles Turner has basically lived in trade rumors for years, and the Lakers are always one of the teams in the mix,” Leiva said. “Turner’s contract situation makes things interesting—he’s on an expiring $19.9 million deal, just like D’Angelo Russell’s $18.3 million contract.” Leiva envisioned the Lakers sending Indiana a package of Russell, Jalen Hood-Schifino, and a 2029 first-round pick in exchange for Turner. “Swapping Turner for Russell would clear the books for the Pacers while giving them a nice future first-round pick in 2029,” Leiva said. “Add in Jalen Hood-Schifino, a young player with potential, and it’s a package the Pacers might actually consider.” “For the Lakers, Turner would be a perfect fit next to Anthony Davis in the frontcourt. His shot-blocking and ability to stretch the floor would complement Davis’ skill set perfectly. Together, they’d create one of the best defensive duos in the league while giving the offense a much-needed boost with Turner’s shooting and scoring. … Feels like a win-win.” Turner is in the final year of his two-year, $40.9 million veteran extension.

Bissonnette played in 202 NHL games for the Phoenix Coyotes and the Pittsburgh Penguins. On Spittin’ Chiclets, Bissonnette recounted the story of how a group of intoxicated patrons were causing problems for the restaurant staff. He detailed how the group of “about nine” were escalating conflict with the manager and assistant manager. Paul Bissonnette breaks down his 1 vs 7 brawl at Houston’s in Scottsdale @spittinchiclets pic.twitter.com/2AwmhOs2J3 “So, after watching this for about fifteen seconds of him getting in [the assistant manager’s] face... I get up and go over. I walk over, I grab the guy’s arm, and I say ‘listen, buddy, if you keep harassing and assaulting the staff here, we’re going to go outside and we’re going to have some problems.’ The minute that left my mouth, the guy beside him starts throwing punches, and then the next thing you know, there were about four guys swinging at me.” The fight continued through the restaurant until Bissonnette was able to exit out the door. “We’re all of a sudden now in the parking lot, and they keep coming… they get me down, they’re throwing punches, I’m able to get back up, I lose my shoe. I’m taking some, and I’m giving some.” The fight moved across the parking lot towards a CVS in the same shopping center. “I made my way around the dumpster at the CVS, and four of them got me. They got me on the ground… I ate three kicks, one in the neck, two in the head, was able to get up.” Bissonnette ran into the CVS, and his group of attackers didn’t follow him.  Authorities had been alerted during the confrontation in Houston’s, and they were able to detain five of Bissonnette’s assailants when they arrived on the scene. Bissonnette estimated that the entire ordeal lasted around three and a half minutes. He was taken to the hospital afterwards, but was not seriously injured. “Maybe I felt more of a connection because I go to this Houston’s restaurant three or four times a week, and these people are always so kind to me, so I felt the need to step in… maybe I bit off a little bit more than I could chew, but I wouldn’t change one thing about what I ended up doing.” Hannah Kirkell is a freelance sports writer from the suburbs of Philadelphia.

They are 9-7 and hold the seventh seed in the Western Conference. Phoenix is on a five-game losing streak, but they will welcome back both Durant and Beal in their game Tuesday night against the Los Angeles Lakers. The Suns are 8-1 with Durant in the lineup this season compared to them being 1-6 without him, so his and Beal’s return should help the Suns. With their big three healthy and their offseason additions playing well, the Suns look as though they will be a championship contender. Of course, this all relies on the health of their stars, especially Durant and Beal who have dealt with multiple injuries over the past few seasons. Even with the Suns looking like a championship team, they could still make a move before the trade deadline to improve their roster. They could trade for Walker Kessler from the Utah Jazz to improve their frontcourt depth and inside defense. In a possible trade, the Suns could send Mason Plumlee, Oso Ighodaro and picks to Utah for Kessler and Patty Mills. This works well for both teams as the Jazz, who are stuck in a rebuild, add another young talent in Ighodaro as well as Plumlee, who is on an expiring contract. Utah would also add more draft capital to help set them up for the future. For Phoenix, adding a young center in Kessler would greatly improve their frontcourt depth. Jusuf Nurkić has played well as the Suns’ starting center, but the lack of depth behind him is worrisome. Plumlee has not had the best season and Bol Bol has played in only four games, so adding Kessler would give them a reliable backup center. Kessler has had a solid start to the season as he is averaging 9.4 points, 10.6 rebounds and 2.8 blocks per game, all of which are better numbers than last season. He is also shooting 67.8% from the field, up from 65.4% last season. This trade helps improve the Suns’ frontcourt depth and defense, which would help them improve their odds of winning a championship this season, especially if their big three stay healthy.

Soto is coming off the best year of his career when he mashed 41 home runs, drove in 109, and posted the highest WAR of his career at 7.9. Teams have been clamoring for Soto's services. The New York Yankees have been listed as the favorite to bring back the star outfielder, but he is keeping his options open and has visited several teams.  The cross-town rival New York Mets are one of them. According to MLB Network's Jon Morosi, the Mets' initial offer has officially been sent to Scott Boras, Soto's agent. They are not the only ones, though, as the Yankees, Boston Red Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Toronto Blue Jays have each submitted their initial offers. All along, Soto's camp has said they plan on being patient and doing their due diligence. So, the fact that at least five teams have submitted offers does not move us much closer to knowing where he will ultimately land. Among the teams to be taken seriously, the Mets likely make the most sense. They are likely going to remain in contention for a World Series berth, which is something Soto covets. Additionally, they have a glaring hole in the outfield.  New York recently traded with the Tampa Bay Rays for center fielder Jose Siri. The speedy outfielder offers some depth, speed, and flexibility, but is not a player that can be counted on every day in the lineup. He hit just .187 last year and is a career .210 hitter. Soto and Boras are going to draw this out well past Winter Meetings, creating a bidding war. The Mets will assuredly be one of the last bidders standing.

Can the Vikings continue to prove naysayers wrong and keep pace with Detroit and Philadelphia?,"Ryan OLeary The Minnesota Vikings (9-2) completed the first half of a rare NFL scheduling quirk last week, and they’ll open the second half Sunday (noon CST, FOX) in an intriguing matchup against the Arizona Cardinals (6-5) at U.S. Bank Stadium. The Vikings played their last three games on the road, and managed to win all three of them against the Jaguars, Titans and Bears. They’ll now play three in a row (and four of their final six games) at home, starting with a Cardinals team that’s been tougher than you’d expect in 2024. Arizona is coming off a loss to the Seattle Seahawks, so it should have no problem getting up for a Vikings team that’s in the hunt for the NFC’s No. 1 seed. The Cards have established themselves as one of the more physical teams in football, leaning on a solid run game and a defense that’s allowed just 31 points total over its last three games. Nothing’s been easy lately for Minnesota, but the team just continues to find ways to win and keep pace with the NFC North leading Detroit Lions (10-1). The Vikings have won four straight games, all by one possession, leaving most NFL analysts wary about their chances of truly contending in the postseason. Here’s what NFL experts are saying about Sunday’s matchup of NFC playoff hopefuls: Iyer: “The Cardinals are much better at running the ball and playing defense at home for Jonathan Gannon. The Vikings have become red-hot offensively again, and they will be ready to go after Kyler Murray in what becomes a one-dimensional attack. Minnesota gets the key sacks and turnovers to win comfortably again.” Bender: “The Vikings are 4-1 S/U with three one-score victories at home this season. Arizona had its four-game winning streak snapped, and they are 2-3 S/U on the road this season. Kyler Murray took five sacks last week. The protection will need to be better if the Cardinals want to pull an upset, but we think the Vikings' charmed season continues in a wild early-window game.” Cluff: “The Vikings are 4-1 at home this season and have won four straight games, and could feast on the Cardinals' offensive line after Arizona's woes protecting Kyler Murray in Seattle in Week 12.” Johnson: “The NFC duel between the Arizona Cardinals and Minnesota Vikings should be one of the best games in Week 13. Minnesota and Arizona are going to both dial up a lot of pressure on the quarterbacks, a recipe for mistakes and a low-scoring game. Ultimately, the Vikings’ talent advantage and more experience in their coaching schemes should deliver cleaner football in a nail-biting win over Arizona.” Rolfe: “The Minnesota Vikings looked to be back on track against the Bears in Week 12 but let the game slip through their grasp in the fourth quarter before winning in overtime. It hasn’t been convincing, but the Vikings are on a four-game winning streak, with a top-five defense in the league driving their success. They’ve fallen into the bottom half of the top 10 in our PR+ rankings but still have a slight edge over the Cardinals. These two teams are evenly matched overall but in different ways. Arizona is strong on offense but has looked better defensively in recent weeks. Meanwhile, the Vikings have a strong defense and an enigmatic offense. Minnesota has the advantage both offensively and defensively but has also played an easier schedule. The Vikings should be too much for this Cardinals team, but Kyler Murray is the potential X-factor in this one.” Ryan O'Leary has spent his entire professional career in sports multimedia, working as journalist, editor, podcaster, and in live events as a content manager and show emcee. His career highlights include working as a podcast host and audio editor for USA TODAY Sports Media Group, where he led a series of NFL podcasts for the company’s top-performing NFL sites.

The Pistons are 8-11 to start the new season, and Cade Cunningham is playing like the No. 1 overall pick that he is. As the Pistons celebrate hitting big on Cunningham and look ahead to a bright future, they may also be able to sneak into the playoffs as early as this season with the Eastern Conference shaping up to be weak and full of parity. It would behoove Detroit to trade for a veteran backup point guard to spell Cunningham and ensure that he stays healthy. On Monday, Bleacher Report’s Greg Swartz conceived of the perfect player for such a task: Malcolm Brogdon of the Washington Wizards. “A (solid) start to the season could turn the Detroit Pistons into surprise buyers at the deadline as the franchise looks to reach the playoffs for the first time this decade,” Swartz said.“Brogdon was the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year just two seasons ago and would give Detroit a veteran point guard behind Cade Cunningham in the rotation.” Brogdon, formerly of the Indiana Pacers and Boston Celtics, is in the second year of his two-year, $45 million deal.

According to WFLA News, a ""confidential settlement and release agreement"" was made for the company to repay the $11.7 million owed to Mayfield in January of 2024.  However, the latest lawsuit said that Mayfield ""received nothing,"" hence why a breach of contract complaint has been filed. This is what the latest lawsuit stated in regards to the current situation.  To date, Camwood Capital has not repaid even one dollar under the Settlement Agreement, Defendants have failed to refinance their existing loan, and Defendants have not provided Plaintiffs with access to their books and records. As a result, Plaintiffs have been left with no choice but to file suit for breach of the Settlement Agreement to recover the assets improperly taken from them. Mayfield's father and brother will have a chance to answer and file a motion to dismiss the complaint as defendants in the case.  Mayfield signed a three-year, $100 million contract with the Buccaneers in the 2024 offseason. It came with $50 million of the deal guaranteed, as well as a $28.875 million signing bonus.  He'll be an unrestricted free agent in 2027.  NFL HQ: Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule Mayfield has a new worth of roughly $25 million, according to Pro Football Network.  During his professional playing career, the QB has earned a just over $55 million from his NFL contracts alone.

Sporting News RSS,Boise State RB Ashton Jeanty bolsters Heisman season with mind-boggling stat,https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/boise-state-rb-ashton-jeanty-bolsters-heisman-season-mind-boggling-stat/896b1fec01b047a89e8ea6e4,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 18:16:36 +0000","Ashton Jeanty is having one of, if not the single, most dominant seasons of all time-- but his latest stat blows all of that out of the water.","Brooks Crew Ashton Jeanty has been a godsend for the Boise State football program this season. The junior has garnered many, many awards and nominations for his standout season, but his latest stat may be the most insane display of his abilities yet. The Bronco already leads the league in rushing yards. That much, everyone knew. But, after his most recent game, the new second-best back in the league has been named ""Ashton Jeanty after contact."" That’s right, the Boise State workhorse has more yards after contact this season than any other player has total, sporting a 20-yard margin. This absolutely insane stat only furthers the case that Jeanty deserves the Heisman, even over Power 4 standouts like Cam Ward and Travis Hunter.  Furthermore, when compared to every other Heisman back throughout history, Jeanty averages more yards after contact per carry than all but three winners averaged per carry. Many make the case that if Jeanty was a deserving Heisman, his team would be better somehow. Except, whoops, the Broncos still stand on top of the Mountain West and, with just one loss to the No. 1 team in the country, find themselves ranked No. 12 in the nation. Yet, Hunter still stands atop the Heisman rankings. The two-way star has dominated both offensively and defensively, though it is still hard to argue with the sheer production Jeanty has been able to create. Jeanty is dominant, the understatement of the century right there, and perhaps the most dominant RB to ever touch a college football field. The stats certainly suggest it. Despite this, however, he is still not even the favorite to win the Heisman. Brooks Crew is an Atlanta-born freelance writer.

The Boston Red Sox could be a fit for one of the Giants' best players.,"Aaliyan Mohammed The San Francisco Giants missed the postseason in 2024 and could be losing a superstar player in free agency. The Boston Red Sox could be a fit for one of the Giants' best players. While listing potential landing spots for ace Blake Snell, Bleacher Report's Joel Reuter named the Boston Red Sox as the top landing spot for the 31-year-old. ""From a logic standpoint, the Boston Red Sox might be the best fit for Snell,"" wrote Reuter. ""Even with the emergence of Tanner Houck and the eventual return of Lucas Giolito, this team is in serious need of front end rotation help, and they have the financial flexibility to make a short-term, high AAV pitch or a long-term offer."" Spotrac projects Snell to sign a five-year, $131 million deal in free agency. He is a two-time Cy Young Award winner and has an All-STar nod under his belt as well. He signed with the Giants late in free agency last year and did not land a long-term deal. He started 2024 off poorly and had a 6.31 ERA in the first half of the year. He kicked things back into gear and looked like himself in the second half. In 12 games after the All-Star Break, he had a 1.45 ERA and 103 strikeouts. The Red Sox have the money to lure Snell away from the Giants. They are also pursuing Juan Soto, indicating they want to make an effort to build a championship roster. ""Snell also has a good record at Fenway Park from his time with the Tampa Bay Rays, with a 3.10 ERA, 1.17 WHIP and 32 strikeouts in 29 career innings in Boston. That past success, coupled with his swing-and-miss stuff, makes him a strong fit at what is traditionally a hitter's park,"" wrote Reuter. ""Landing one of the market's top starters should be the No. 1 priority for the Red Sox this offseason.""

Kareem Hunt, the running back who returned to the Chiefs after a five-year absence, has been instrumental to keeping their offense afloat. To this point, he's for 577 yards and five touchdowns in his eight-game Kansas City stint. Hunt has had an up-and-down career since being named a Pro Bowler during his 2017 rookie campaign. He was suspended for eight games after a 2018 incident in which he shoved and kicked a woman in a Cleveland hotel, but went on to have a five-year career as the Cleveland Browns' backup.  In 2024, Hunt has proven invaluable to the Chiefs in the wake of starting running back Isiah Pacheco's broken leg. But with Pacheco expected back this week, Hunt may not be long for the Chiefs once the season ends. However, Hunt's strong season should land him another NFL opportunity in 2025. Kris Knox of Bleacher Report recently predicted that Hunt would sign with the New Orleans Saints in a backup capacity this spring. ""(The Saints will) probably be in the market for a No. 2 running back to pair with Alvin Kamara in the offseason. Jordan Mims has seen limited opportunities, Kendre Miller can't stay on the field, and Jamaal Williams is another likely 2025 cap casualty—cutting him would save $2.3 million in cap space,"" Knox said. ""Kareem Hunt, who has revitalized his career with the Chiefs this season, might be available on a relatively team-friendly deal. He joined the Chiefs on a $1.2 million contract, so swapping Williams for Hunt could, theoretically, allow New Orleans to create cap space."" Entering his age-30 season, Hunt will just be looking for an opportunity to keep his NFL dreams alive. He's not the most explosive runner by any means, but if he can continue excelling in short-yardage situations, a team like the Saints may be swayed to give him that opportunity.

Sporting News RSS,Isaiah Hartenstein proving to be missing piece to Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Thunder's championship puzzle,https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/isaiah-hartenstein-missing-piece-thunder-championship/51fc08f659946e790e8f0dcb,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 17:51:58 +0000","Isaiah Hartenstein has only played in a couple of games for OKC, but he's proving to be a perfect fit.","Stephen Noh Isaiah Hartenstein hasn't had many opportunities to show off the full extent of his skills. After being taken with the 46th pick of the 2017 NBA Draft behind second-rounders like Ivan Rabb and Jawun Evans, Hartenstein bounced around the benches of four teams in his first four years.  Hartenstein finally got a consistent role with the Knicks two seasons ago, and he's expanded even more on that skill set in his first week with the Thunder. He has been exactly what Oklahoma City needs, shoring up the team's biggest weakness. Hartenstein isn't the best player for the Thunder, but don't make the same mistake that his previous teams did — he's a game-changer and looks like the missing piece in their quest for their first championship.  SN's NBA HQ: Live NBA scores | Updated NBA standings | Full NBA schedule Hartenstein has recorded four blocks through his first two games. The amount of ground that he has been able to cover on some of them has been astounding.  The Thunder just got even better with Hartenstein, folks. pic.twitter.com/7LZjuvK8Xr Hartenstein has also given the Thunder the low-post brute they've been missing. With all due respect to Kenrich Williams, who stood Domantas Sabonis up in the post in the most impressive defensive sequence on Monday, Hartenstein has the size and strength to make those types of plays on a more regular basis. MORE: Yes, the Cavs are the real deal Hartenstein is much more than a big body. His best skill is his feel — he knows where he's supposed to be on the court at all times. He has enough mobility to fly out to 3-point shooters in emergency closeouts or patrol the paint and prevent shots at the rim from even taking place. It's not a coincidence that the Knicks' defense has cratered without Hartenstein. He would have been in consideration for an All-Defensive team had he played enough games to qualify last season. The Thunder were already the best defense in the league before Hartenstein made his season debut. Their only battle remaining will be how they stack up among the historically great teams. Once Chet Holmgren returns, they're going to be an even better version of what the Celtics have had over the previous few years, fielding two legitimate shot-blocking threats and plus defense all across the perimeter. Hartenstein gives OKC the size and versatility to have no discernable weaknesses on that end of the floor.  MVP RANKINGS: Nikola Jokic setting high bar for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and others Hartenstein has only played in two games, but he's already had some of the best passes of the Thunder's season. He created a dunk out of thin air against the Kings.  ""I'm not going to believe that he threw that pass on purpose,"" said an incredulous Mark Jones on the call.  Such a stellar assist here from Isaiah Hartenstein tonight pic.twitter.com/Q5JUUjBJim Hartenstein probably knew exactly what he was doing — those types of behind-the-back passes are his specialty. He threw two consecutively in his debut, setting up teammates perfectly for botched layups. Hartenstein's teammates better learn to expect the ball whenever they're open because he's going to find them.  MORE: JJ Redick has turned Anthony Davis into the MVP candidate we've been waiting Hartenstein doesn't need plays run for him. When he catches it in the lane, he relies on an unorthodox push shot that is one of the best in the game. The in-between range of 4-14 feet is usually one of the worst areas to shoot from. For Hartenstein, he's like clockwork from there. Hartenstein is a solid finisher at the rim as well. He can throw down some monster finishes when guards dump the ball off to him.  More often, Hartenstein is setting killer screens. Look at the amount of space he's able to create for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, taking the best perimeter defenders completely off him: Thunder fans should be very excited about Isaiah Hartenstein's screening for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.Look at the space Hartenstein creates by routinely wiping out the other team's best perimeter defender. And if teams send extra help at SGA, Hartenstein will punish that too. pic.twitter.com/rjaFVi1oci The Thunder's offense is built on those downhill attacks from their guards. They lead the league by a mile in drives per game. With Hartenstein in tow, they become an even more dangerous group to deal with.  Hartenstein is the glue guy who is going to make all of the skills of his teammates shine even brighter. His skill set is perfect for this Thunder team, which is why Sam Presti made him his chief target this summer. This fit looked great on paper, and it's been even better in practice so far.  Stephen Noh started writing about the NBA as one of the first members of The Athletic in 2016.

He won National League Most Valuable Player in his first season with the team, and now a unique jersey from his past has gone up for auction. Before joining Major League Baseball, Ohtani was a star in Nippon Professional Baseball. He played for the Nippon Ham Fighters from 2013-2017. He won a Pacific League MVP, an ERA title and a Japan Series. He was also a five-time NPB All-Star. A game-used Nippon Ham Fighters jersey from his final NPB season has recently gone up for auction at Grey Flannel Auctions. The highest bid currently sits at $9,743 at 12 p.m. EST on November 26. The bidding is set to close on Sunday, December 8 at 9 p.m. EST. The starting bid was $5,000. The opening bid came on November 18. While Ohtani did not win NL MVP officially until November 21, he was the favorite to take home the award for months. During the 2017 season in Japan, Ohtani slashed .332/.403/.540. The following offseason he signed with the Los Angeles Angels. Ohtani has already established himself as one of the best players ever. He has won Rookie of the Year, three MVP Awards and three Silver Sluggers. He has also earned four All-Star selections. This is not the first Ohtani item to hit auctions this year. Earlier this year, Shohei Ohtani’s 50th home run ball from his historic season was auctioned. The ball was sold for a record $4.392 million. The auction of the ball was handled by Goldin Auctions.

Our guys, ‘Sonic and Knuckles,’ it’s official now, I’ve been warned that that’s what they want to be called,"" running backs coach Scottie Montgomery said last month.

With both sides struggling to find consistency in the competition, this match promises to be a tightly contested affair at the Epet Arena. Sparta Prague have had a mixed start to their Champions League campaign, winning two and losing two of their opening four matches. The Czech outfit sit in 26th place in the overall Champions League table, just one point behind 24th-placed PSV Eindhoven. Striker Victor Olatunji has been a bright spark for Sparta, finding the net on eight occasions this season. Atletico Madrid, on the other hand, have endured a challenging start to their European campaign, losing to both Benfica and Lille. The Spanish giants are currently in 23rd position in the Champions League table, having collected just six points from their opening four matches. However, Atletico’s form in La Liga has been more impressive, with Diego Simeone’s side sitting third in the domestic league, five points behind leaders Barcelona. Sparta Prague’s recent form has been a cause for concern, with the team winning just one of their last six matches in all competitions. Their Champions League campaign has seen them secure a 3-0 victory over Red Bull Salzburg and a 1-1 draw with Stuttgart, but they have since suffered heavy defeats against Manchester City (5-0) and Brest (2-1). Atletico Madrid, on the other hand, have been on a roll, winning their last five matches in all competitions, including a crucial 2-1 victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. The Red and Whites’ recent La Liga form has also been impressive, with a 2-1 win over Alaves keeping them in the hunt for the league title. This will be the first-ever meeting between Sparta Prague and Atletico Madrid, as the two sides have never faced each other in a competitive fixture before. Sparta Prague will be without the services of Veljko Birmancevic (thigh) and Angelo Preciado (knee) due to injury. Atletico Madrid, meanwhile, will once again be without the injured Thomas Lemar, while Robin Le Normand is also unlikely to feature.

Sparta Prague have shown they can be a tough opponent at home, but Atletico Madrid’s recent form and pedigree in the Champions League suggest they have the edge. The Spanish giants’ ability to grind out results, coupled with their attacking firepower, could prove to be the difference in this encounter. – Atletico Madrid to win

With Milan seeking a third straight win in the competition and Slovan still searching for their first points, it promises to be an intriguing encounter. Slovan Bratislava are making their Champions League debut this season, but it has been a chastening experience so far. They are one of five teams yet to pick up a single point, sitting bottom of the group with a goal difference of -13. Despite their domestic dominance, Vladimir Weiss’s side have struggled to adapt to the rigors of Europe’s premier club competition. In contrast, AC Milan have bounced back from a slow start to their Champions League campaign. After losing to Liverpool and Bayer Leverkusen, the Rossoneri have recorded impressive victories over Club Brugge and reigning champions Real Madrid. Paulo Fonseca’s men will be aiming to maintain their resurgent form and take a significant step towards securing a place in the knockout stages. Slovan Bratislava’s domestic form has been relatively strong, with just one defeat in 17 matches this season. However, their Champions League performances have been a different story, as they have lost all four of their group stage fixtures so far. The Sky Blues will be desperate to avoid a fifth consecutive defeat in Europe’s premier club competition. Milan’s form has been somewhat erratic, with the Italians winning only eight of their last 25 matches in all competitions. Their mixed domestic results, which include a 0-0 draw against Juventus and a 3-3 draw with Cagliari, have been in stark contrast to their impressive Champions League showings. The Rossoneri will be keen to build on their recent triumphs and cement their position in the top eight. This will be the second meeting between Slovan Bratislava and AC Milan in European competition. The two sides previously faced off in a qualifying tie for the inaugural Champions League in 1992, with the Italian giants emerging victorious on aggregate. Slovan Bratislava will welcome back Kevin Wimmer and Juraj Kucka following the international break. However, they will still be without several first-team regulars as they aim to secure their first points in the Champions League. Milan, on the other hand, will have almost their entire squad available, with the exception of long-term absentees Ismael Bennacer and Alessandro Florenzi. Alvaro Morata is expected to lead the line, supported by the in-form Rafael Leao and Tijjani Reijnders. Slovan Bratislava: Takac, Medvedev, Bajric, Wimmer, Vojtko, Ihnatenko, Barseghyan, Szoke, Gajdos, Mak, Strelec
AC Milan: Maignan, Hernandez, Thiaw, Gabbia, Royal, Fofana Musah, Reijnders, Leao, Pulisic, Morata Despite Slovan Bratislava’s impressive domestic form, their Champions League struggles are unlikely to end against a resurgent AC Milan side. The Rossoneri’s quality and experience should prove too much for the Slovakian champions, and they are tipped to secure a comfortable victory. – AC Milan to win

The Bundesliga heavyweights are looking to bounce back from their recent 4-0 defeat against Liverpool, while the Austrian side seek to build on their 3-1 win over Feyenoord. Leverkusen have enjoyed a mixed start to their European campaign, collecting seven points from their opening three games. Xabi Alonso’s side currently occupy 13th place in the 36-team Champions League table. The German outfit have been boosted by Patrik Schick’s hat-trick in their 5-2 Bundesliga victory over Heidenheim on Saturday, but they will be without several key attackers due to injury. Salzburg, on the other hand, have struggled in Europe this season, losing their first three matches before securing a much-needed 3-1 win over Feyenoord. Pep Lijnders’ young team remain outside the playoff spots in 30th place in the Champions League standings and have lost their last two domestic fixtures against Blau-Weiss Linz and LASK Linz. Leverkusen’s recent form has been inconsistent, with two wins, two draws, and two defeats in their last six matches across all competitions. The Bundesliga side’s 4-0 loss to Liverpool at Anfield marked their first Champions League defeat of the season, but they bounced back with an impressive 5-2 victory over Heidenheim at the weekend. Salzburg, on the other hand, have struggled to find consistency, winning just two of their last six matches in all competitions. Their 3-1 triumph over Feyenoord in the Champions League was a rare bright spot, but the Austrian side have since lost back-to-back domestic fixtures. This will be the first-ever competitive meeting between Bayer Leverkusen and Red Bull Salzburg. The German champions have an impressive record against Austrian opponents in Europe, winning three of their five previous encounters and drawing the other two. Leverkusen will be without several key players, including striker Victor Boniface, midfielders Jonas Hofmann and Amine Adli, and winger Martin Terrier. Jeremie Frimpong is also a doubt after picking up a knock in the win over Heidenheim. For Salzburg, goalkeeper Alexander Schlager returns from suspension, but the visitors will be missing several injured players, including Bryan Okoh, Leandro Morgalla, and Takumu Kawamura. Hradecky; Tella, Tapsoba, Tah, Hincapie; Garcia, Xhaka, Andrich, Grimaldo; Wirtz, Schick Schlager; Dedic, Baidoo, Piatkowski, Terzic; Diambou, Gourna-Douath, Clark; Nene, Konate, Gloukh Despite Salzburg’s recent win over Feyenoord, Leverkusen should have too much quality for the Austrian side, especially with their attacking options depleted by injuries. Alonso’s men will be determined to bounce back from their heavy defeat against Liverpool, and they should have enough firepower to secure a comfortable victory at home. – Leverkusen to win

The two sides last met in the 2021-22 group stage, with Atalanta prevailing 1-0 at home and drawing 3-3 in the reverse fixture. Young Boys, the reigning Swiss Super League champions, have endured a dismal start to their Champions League campaign, losing all four of their opening matches. Under the caretaker management of Joel Magnin, the Swiss outfit have scored just once while conceding 11 goals, leaving them rooted to the bottom three. In contrast, Atalanta have been one of the surprise packages in Europe’s elite club competition this season. Piero Gasperini’s men are unbeaten in their first four matches, keeping four clean sheets in the process. Atalanta’s recent form has been impressive, with six consecutive wins across all competitions, including a 3-1 victory over Parma in Serie A on Saturday. Young Boys’ domestic form has been slightly more encouraging, with four points from their last two Swiss Super League fixtures. However, their European woes continue to overshadow any positive results on the home front. Magnin will be hoping his side can end their Champions League drought and secure a much-needed win against the in-form Italians. Atalanta, on the other hand, are flying high both domestically and in Europe. Their 2-0 triumph over Stuttgart on matchday four of the Champions League showcased their defensive solidity and attacking prowess. The Bergamo-based club currently sit second of the Serie A table, level on points with reigning champions Inter Milan. The previous two meetings between Young Boys and Atalanta have been closely contested affairs. In the 2021-22 Champions League group stage, the Italian side won 1-0 at home before being held to a thrilling 3-3 draw in Switzerland, where Luis Muriel’s late strike salvaged a point for Atalanta. Young Boys will be without several key defensive players, including Saidy Janko, Abdu Conte, and Loris Benito, while midfielder Miguel Chaiwa is also sidelined. Atalanta, meanwhile, will be missing the suspended Ederson in midfield, but Lazar Samardzic is expected to deputize effectively. Keller; Athekame, Lauper, Camara, Blum; Males, Lakomy, Ugrinic, Colley; Imeri; Ganzvoula Carnesecchi; Toloi, Hien, Kossounou; Bellanova, Samardzic, De Roon, Ruggeri; De Ketelaere; Lookman, Retegui Atalanta’s superior quality and recent form should prove too much for the struggling Young Boys. Gasperini’s side have been clinical in front of goal and solid at the back, and they will be eager to maintain their unbeaten start to the Champions League campaign. Expect the Italian visitors to secure a comfortable victory in Bern. – Atalanta BC to win

[&#8230;]","Barcelona will be looking to bounce back from their disappointing La Liga draw when they host French side Brest in a Champions League clash at the Estadi Olimpic Lluis Companys on Tuesday evening. Barcelona currently sit sixth in the Champions League group stage, having picked up nine points from their opening four matches. They suffered a shock 2-1 defeat to Monaco in their opener but have since secured three consecutive victories against Young Boys, Bayern Munich, and Red Star Belgrade. Top scorer Robert Lewandowski has been in fine form, netting five goals in the competition so far. Brest, making their Champions League debut this season, have been the surprise package of the group stage. The French outfit sit fourth in the table with 10 points, only two behind leaders Liverpool. They have recorded impressive wins over Sturm Graz, Red Bull Salzburg, and Sparta Prague, in addition to holding Bayer Leverkusen to a 1-1 draw. Barcelona’s form has been a mixed bag of late. They remain top of the La Liga table but have drawn two of their last three league games, including a 2-2 stalemate with Celta Vigo on Saturday. Hansi Flick’s side will be eager to return to winning ways in Europe. Brest’s Champions League exploits have contrasted with their domestic struggles. They have lost their last three Ligue 1 matches, including a 3-2 defeat to Monaco, and currently sit 12th in the French top-flight, 10 points adrift of the top three. This will be the first-ever competitive meeting between Barcelona and Brest. Barcelona are still without several key players, including Lamine Yamal, Ronald Araujo, Ansu Fati, and Marc-Andre ter Stegen. However, Eric Garcia and Ferran Torres could feature after overcoming their respective injuries. Brest have their own injury concerns, with Pierre Lees-Melou, Massadio Haidara, Romain Faivre, and Soumaila Coulibaly all doubtful for the trip to Spain. Ludovic Ajorque is expected to lead the line for the visitors. Pena; Kounde, Cubarsi, I Martinez, Balde; De Jong, Casado; Olmo, Pedri, Raphinha; Lewandowski Bizot; Lala, Chardonnet, Le Cardinal, Amavi; Camara, Lees-Melou, Fernandes; Balde, Ajorque, Doumbia Barcelona will be heavy favorites to secure all three points against the Champions League debutants. While Brest have exceeded expectations in Europe, this will be a significant step up in quality for the French side. Flick’s team should have too much firepower and experience for their opponents, and a comfortable home win seems the most likely outcome. – Barcelona to win
– Over 2.5 goals

Both teams are looking to solidify their positions in the group stage, with Inter seeking to maintain their unbeaten start and Leipzig aiming to bounce back from a series of disappointing results. Inter Milan have made a strong start to their Champions League campaign, picking up 9 points from their opening 4 matches. The Nerazzurri have been particularly impressive defensively, keeping clean sheets in all their European games so far. Key performers for Inter have been striker Marcus Thuram, who has scored 3 goals, and midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu, who has dictated play from the center of the park. However, the team has been hampered by the recent injury to captain Lautaro Martinez, whose availability remains uncertain. RB Leipzig, on the other hand, have struggled in the Champions League, losing all 4 of their matches to date. The German side has been plagued by defensive lapses, conceding 9 goals and failing to maintain leads. Nonetheless, they have been solid domestically, sitting third in the Bundesliga. Striker Benjamin Sesko has been a bright spot, scoring 3 goals in the Champions League, while winger Antonio Nusa has been in fine form for both club and country. Inter Milan’s form has been largely positive, with just one loss in their last 16 games across all competitions. They come into this match off the back of a convincing 5-0 victory over Hellas Verona in Serie A. RB Leipzig, on the other hand, have lost 3 of their last 6 games, including a 3-1 defeat to Celtic in their previous Champions League outing. This will be the first-ever meeting between Inter Milan and RB Leipzig in European competition. The two sides have never faced each other before, adding an extra layer of intrigue to the encounter. Inter Milan will be sweating on the fitness of Lautaro Martinez, who returned late from international duty and has since been struck by a virus. Midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu is also a doubt due to a thigh injury. For RB Leipzig, Eljif Elmas and Yussuf Poulsen have both picked up injuries while on international duty, while Xavi Simons and David Raum are also sidelined. Sommer; Bisseck, De Vrij, Bastoni; Dumfries, Barella, Asllani, Mkhitaryan, Dimarco; Thuram, Taremi Gulacsi; Klostermann, Orban, Lukeba; Henrichs, Haidara, Seiwald, Nusa; Baumgartner; Openda, Sesko This promises to be a closely contested affair, with both teams desperate for the points. Inter Milan’s solid defensive record and home advantage should give them the edge, but RB Leipzig’s attacking threat means they cannot be ruled out. The Nerazzurri’s experience and organization in big games could prove the difference, and we predict a narrow 2-1 win for the Italian side. – Inter Milan to win: Considering their strong home form and defensive resilience, Inter Milan are the favorites to secure all three points. – Over 2.5 goals: With both teams possessing potent attacking options, this match could see a high-scoring encounter. – Marcus Thuram to score anytime: The French striker has been in impressive form for Inter and could find the back of the net."

The home side are in dire need of a positive result after a disastrous run of form, while the visitors aim to continue their respectable European campaign. Match Preview Manchester City [&#8230;]","Manchester City, the reigning Premier League champions, welcome Feyenoord to the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday evening for a crucial Champions League group stage clash. The home side are in dire need of a positive result after a disastrous run of form, while the visitors aim to continue their respectable European campaign. Manchester City have been in full-blown crisis mode, suffering five consecutive defeats across all competitions. Their latest humiliation came on Saturday as they were annihilated 4-0 by Tottenham Hotspur at home. The Cityzens’ attacking talisman, Erling Haaland, has been uncharacteristically quiet during this poor run, while the likes of Jack Grealish and Kevin De Bruyne have failed to inspire. In contrast, Feyenoord have been enjoying a relatively strong start to the season. The Dutch side sit in the bottom half of the Champions League group stage table but have managed to pick up six points from their opening four matches. Striker Santiago Gimenez and playmaker Chris-Kevin Nadje have been the standout performers for the Rotterdam outfit. Manchester City’s autumn has been nothing short of disastrous, with Pep Guardiola’s men losing their last three Premier League matches. The reigning champions now find themselves 10th in the table, a far cry from their usual lofty standards. Feyenoord, on the other hand, have won six of their last seven Eredivisie games, including a comfortable 3-0 victory over Heerenveen on Saturday. The two sides have met only once before in the Champions League, with Manchester City recording a 4-0 victory at De Kuip in the 2017-18 group stage. The Etihad encounter that season ended 1-0 in favor of the English champions. Manchester City will be without the injured trio of Rodri, Oscar Bobb, and Mateo Kovacic, while Ruben Dias is also expected to miss out. Feyenoord’s injury list is even more extensive, with key players such as Gimenez, Justin Bijlow, and Quinten Timber all doubtful for the trip to Manchester. Ederson; Walker, Akanji, Stones, Ake; Nunes, Lewis; Savinho, De Bruyne, Grealish; Haaland Wellenreuther; Nieuwkoop, Trauner, Hancko, Smal; Hwang, Zerrouki, Milambo; Moussa, Carranza, Paixao With Feyenoord’s lengthy injury list, this represents an excellent opportunity for Manchester City to pull themselves out of their rut. The Etihad outfit should be able to capitalize on the visitors’ defensive vulnerabilities and secure a much-needed victory. However, the Citizens’ recent form suggests they may struggle to produce a convincing performance, and the match could be closer than expected. – Manchester City to win
– Over 2.5 goals : both teams have conceded goals easily in recent matches
– Erling Haaland to score anytime: the Norwegian striker is due a goal after a quiet spell"

<h1>Buffalo Sabres Overcome Anaheim Ducks in Tense Overtime Clash</h1>
<p>Friday night's NHL showdown saw <a href=""https://21sports.com/thrilling-shootout-victory-sabres-douse-flames-in-nhl-showdown/"">Buffalo Sabres</a>' Jiri Kulich steal the show, scoring an eleventh-hour goal with just under a minute left in overtime. This saw the Sabres rally back from trailing by two goals to clinch a 3-2 victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/thrilling-third-period-surge-propels-anaheim-ducks-to-victory-over-chicago-blackhawks/"">Anaheim Ducks</a>.</p>
<h2>Anaheim Ducks' Winning Streak Snapped by Buffalo Sabres</h2>
<p>Kulich's crucial rebound shot, off an initial attempt by Sabres' defenseman Owen Power, found the top right corner of the net. This was Kulich's second goal of the season, marking a pivotal moment that ended the Ducks' three-game winning spree. Peyton Krebs and Jason Zucker, who are both in good form, also marked their names on the scoresheet for Buffalo, contributing to their second consecutive victory and their third in the last four games.</p>
<p>Power, who aided with two assists, along with goalie Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen's 23 saves, played a significant role in the Sabres' win. In contrast, Drew Helleson and Isac Lundestrom were the goal scorers for Anaheim, with their goalie, John Gibson, managing to block 31 shots.</p>
<h2>Buffalo Sabres and Anaheim Ducks: Key Players and Moments</h2>
<p>In the Sabres' camp, center Tage Thompson, leading the team with 11 goals and 18 points, missed his fourth consecutive game owing to a lower-body injury. However, Coach Lindy Ruff is optimistic about Thompson's return in their upcoming game against San Jose on Saturday.</p>
<p>For the Ducks, Trevor Zegras has been on a roll, tallying three assists in the last two games. A crucial turning point came when Krebs and Zucker netted two goals within a span of 50 seconds towards the end of the second period, leveling the game at 2-2. This marked the sixth instance of Buffalo scoring twice within a minute.</p>
<p>Zucker, who scored the equalizer with just 33 seconds left, now has goals in two successive games. Alex Tuch, who assisted Krebs’ goal, has managed to register points in five consecutive games, including a goal and six assists.</p>
<h3>Key Statistics and What's Next?</h3>
<p>Despite their win, Buffalo saw their seven-game power-play goal streak come to an end, which was the longest of any team this season. In terms of what's next, the Sabres are set to visit San Jose on Saturday, while the Ducks are due to host Seattle on Monday.</p>

<h1>Zary Seals Flames' Triumph, Rangers Suffer Second Road Loss</h1>
<p>On a thrilling Thursday night, the <a href=""https://21sports.com/dustin-wolf-shines-bright-flames-edge-predators-in-a-goalkeepers-duel/"">Calgary Flames</a> clinched a 3-2 victory over the New York Rangers, thanks to Connor Zary's crucial goal in the third period. <a href=""https://21sports.com/calgarys-flames-ignite-in-overtime-coronato-leads-to-3-2-victory-over-canadiens/"">Matt Coronato</a> and Yegor Sharangovich contributed significantly with each adding a goal and an assist to the Flames' tally. MacKenzie Weegar demonstrated some impressive playmaking skills with three assists.</p>
<h2>Jonathan Huberdeau Achieves Milestone, Dustin Wolf Shines Between the Pipes</h2>
<p>Jonathan Huberdeau, another star for the Flames, hit a significant milestone by bagging his 500th career assist. In the net, Dustin Wolf stood tall, blocking 27 shots, marking his third consecutive victory.</p>
<p>For the Rangers, Alexis Lafreniere and Will Cuylle found the back of the net in a quick succession of just 16 seconds in the second period. Despite the loss, it's worth noting that this is only the second road game the Rangers have lost this season. Goalie Igor Shesterkin remained resilient, saving 46 shots.</p>
<h3>Key Play: Zary's Game-Changing Goal</h3>
<p>The game-changing moment came at 10:34 of the third period when Zary, who had been active on the ice throughout the game, shrugged off a challenge from Kaapo Kakko. He managed to lift the puck over Shesterkin, scoring what would be the game-winning goal.</p>
<h2>Takeaways from the Game</h2>
<p>The Flames showcased their best first period of the season, outshooting the Rangers 20-5. Despite this, they held only a slim one-goal lead heading into the second period. Their power play, which had been lackluster in November, came alive and produced an essential goal for the second game in a row.</p>
<p>The Rangers, on the other hand, relied heavily on their goalkeeper Shesterkin to keep them in the game. Their progress was hindered by four penalties within the first 29 minutes, stalling their momentum.</p>
<h3>Breaking Down the Numbers</h3>
<p>The Flames achieved a feat of 20-plus shots in the first period for the first time since October 25, 2022, when they registered a similar number against Pittsburgh.</p>
<h2>What's Next for Flames and Rangers?</h2>
<p>The Flames will be looking to continue their winning streak at home against the Minnesota Wild on Saturday. The Rangers will conclude their four-game road trip on the same day, facing off against the Edmonton Oilers.</p>

Craig Smith and Nick Foligno also inked their names on the scoreboard, enabling Chicago to halt a hat-trick of consecutive losses. This victory also bolstered their home record to 3-5-0 for the season.</p>
<h2>Mrazek's Impressive Return to Lineup</h2>

<h2>Teravainen's Power-Play Goal Sets the Tone</h2>
<p>Teravainen set the Blackhawks on the path to victory with an early power-play goal, just 2:46 into the opening period. This marked only his second goal in his recent 17 appearances.

<h3>Key Moment of the Game</h3>
<p>A noteworthy moment of the game came when Blackhawks' defenseman Wyatt Kaiser was benched for delay of game 12:22 into the third period. Despite this setback, the Blackhawks successfully killed off the penalty, rendering the Panthers' power-play opportunities futile.</p>

<h1>Werenski's Overtime Goal Brings Columbus Blue Jackets a Remarkable Comeback Victory</h1>
<p>Zach Werenski's masterstroke at 1:25 of the overtime session marked the climax of a thrilling game as the <a href=""https://21sports.com/los-angeles-kings-emerge-victorious-in-dominant-performance-against-columbus-blue-jackets/"">Columbus Blue Jackets</a> overcame a three-goal deficit to triumph over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/vasilevskiy-shines-with-stellar-saves-as-lightning-strike-devils-4-0/"">Tampa Bay Lightning</a>, in an electrifying 7-6 victory on Thursday night. Werenski, shining in the spotlight, equalized the game at 4 in the second period and contributed with three assists, helping the Blue Jackets secure their second consecutive win.</p>
<h2>Key Players in the Clash</h2>
<p>Sean Monahan and Dmitri Voronkov greatly supported their team with a goal and three assists and a goal plus an assist, respectively.

<h1>Colorado Avalanche Triumphs Over Washington Capitals in Nail-Biting Encounter</h1>
<h2>Miles Wood Fires Avalanche to Victory</h2>
<p>In an electrifying Thursday night showdown, Colorado Avalanche clinched a tight 2-1 win over <a href=""https://21sports.com/capitals-dominate-avalanche-in-thrilling-5-2-victory-a-night-of-twists-and-triumphs/"">Washington Capitals</a>, with Miles Wood playing the hero as his third-period goal became the decider. Mikko Rantanen, another Avalanche star, also found the net, marking the team's fifth victory in their last six outings.</p>
<h2>Alexandar Georgiev Continues Winning Streak</h2>
<p>Alexandar Georgiev, the formidable Avalanche goaltender, demonstrated his mettle with an awe-inspiring performance that saw him repel 29 shots. This marked his fourth consecutive win after returning from an upper-body injury that sidelined him for two games.</p>
<h2>Capitals Feel the Absence of Ovechkin</h2>
<p>For the Capitals, it was Pierre-Luc Dubois who scored, but the team's winning spree came to an abrupt end, halting at three victories. Logan Thompson, the Capitals goalkeeper, experienced his maiden regulation loss of the season with 25 saves. Earlier, the team was dealt a significant blow as Alex Ovechkin, their superstar, was ruled out for four to six weeks due to a broken left fibula, sustained during their Monday clash against Utah.</p>
<h3>Avalanche's Takeaways</h3>
<p>Despite Nathan MacKinnon failing to score for the second time in three games — both against the Capitals — Rantanen maintained his impressive form, securing points in five of his last six games.</p>
<h3>Capitals' Takeaways</h3>
<p>Without Ovechkin's presence, the Capitals found it difficult to generate momentum offensively. Their usually effective power play, often energized by their captain, went 0 for 2.</p>
<h2>Key Moment of the Match</h2>
<p>The defining moment came just 3:29 into the third period when Wood, positioned at the front of the net, deflected Cale Makar's point shot, sending it past Thompson for the lead.</p>
<h2>Crucial Statistic</h2>
<p>A telling statistic dating back to the 2021-22 season reveals that the Capitals have a dismal 4-14 record without <a href=""https://21sports.com/ovechkins-decisive-strike-propels-capitals-to-victory-over-predators/"">Ovechkin</a> in the team. At the time of his injury, the captain was leading the league with 15 goals, only 27 short of Wayne Gretzky's record.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>The Avalanche is set to square off against the reigning Stanley Cup champions, Florida, on Saturday, while the Capitals will host New Jersey.</p>

<h1>Golden Knights Prevail Over Senators in Hard-Fought Match</h1>
<p>In a hockey game that kept fans on the edge of their seats, the Vegas Golden Knights claimed victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/tkachuks-overtime-magic-propels-senators-to-victory-over-bruins/"">Ottawa Senators</a> with a nail-biting 3-2 score on Thursday night. Ilya Samsonov, who had let in 10 goals over his last two games, bounced back with a remarkable performance, pulling off 38 saves.</p>
<h2>Samsonov's Key Saves Halt Senators' Attack</h2>
<p>Despite the Senators' aggressive play, Samsonov held strong, making crucial saves against formidable players like Josh Norris, David Perron, Tim Stutzle, and Brady Tkachuk. The Senators (8-10-1) find themselves trapped in a four-game losing streak, having scored just two goals throughout their last three games.</p>
<h2>Golden Knights Gain the Upper Hand</h2>
<p>In the initial phase of the game, the Golden Knights (12-6-2) seized control when Linus Ullmark made a spectacular diving save but failed to reposition quickly enough. This left Jack Eichel with an unhindered shot to the net, marking his sixth goal this season. Brett Howden extended their lead to 2-0 in the mid-second period, slipping a goal past Ullmark, who had 29 saves in the game.</p>
<h3>Sensational Third-Period Action</h3>
<p>Adam Gaudette managed to get one past Samsonov 7:17 into the third period, narrowing the lead. However, the Senators' joy was short-lived as Pavel Dorofeyev restored the two-goal lead just two minutes later. Drake Batherson kept the Senators' hopes alive, scoring a goal off a Jake Sanderson rebound with a little over seven minutes left. Despite the Senators outshooting the Golden Knights 18-5 in the third period, they fell short of a comeback.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways and Statistics</h2>
<p>A recurring issue for the Senators has been their habit of conceding the first goal, which has led to eight consecutive losses and a dismal 1-9-1 record when they let in the first goal. On the other hand, the Golden Knights capitalized on an ill-timed Ottawa line change, delivering a swift counter-strike leading to Howden's goal. The Golden Knights have an impressive 12-1-1 track record against the Senators since their entry into the league in 2017.</p>
<h3>What's Next for Both Teams?</h3>
<p>Looking ahead, the Senators are gearing up to host the Vancouver Canucks on Saturday night, while the Golden Knights prepare to face off against the Montreal Canadiens on Saturday afternoon.</p>

<h1>A Nail-biting Victory for Detroit Red Wings against New York Islanders</h1>
<p>In a thrilling showdown, <a href=""https://21sports.com/lucas-raymond-inks-lucrative-eight-year-contract-with-detroit-red-wings/"">Lucas Raymond</a>'s incredible goal in the final seconds helped the Detroit Red Wings to a 2-1 victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/islanders-thrilling-rally-overcoming-penguins-in-post-regulation-showdown/"">New York Islanders</a> on Thursday evening. Jonatan Berggren's crucial equalizer also played a pivotal role in breaking Detroit's run of three consecutive losses. The Red Wings' goaltender, Alex Lyon, displayed a remarkable performance with 22 saves.</p>
<p>For the Islanders, the only ray of hope came from Simon Holmstrom, who managed to score the sole goal for his team, unable to reverse their pattern of losses with five out of their last six games ending in defeat. Despite a valiant effort with 29 saves, Islanders' goalie Ilya Sorokin couldn't prevent the defeat.</p>
<h2>The Turning Points of the Game</h2>
<p>Holmstrom sparked the Islanders' spirits by scoring the first goal of the match at 5:51 of the first period, marking his third goal of the season. However, Berggren, with just 4:46 left in the game, managed to level the score with his third goal of the season. The decisive moment came when Raymond, with a skillful assist from Dylan Larkin, netted the puck from the left circle, beating Sorokin's glove with just 51 seconds to spare.</p>
<h3>Key Takeaways from the Game</h3>
<p>The Islanders, despite having the league's worst penalty-kill entering the game, successfully thwarted three power plays from the Red Wings, who boast the second-best power play in the league. Sorokin was instrumental in this, making six crucial saves.</p>
<p>In contrast, Raymond, who had an impressive tally of 31 goals last season, ended his scoring drought with a game-winning goal in the final minute, providing a much-needed boost to the Red Wings.</p>
<h2>Flashback and Key Statistics</h2>
<p>Recalling the teams' first encounter last month, which saw the Red Wings triumph with a 1-0 victory thanks to Patrick Kane's first-period goal, it seemed history might repeat itself with Holmstrom's early goal. However, the Red Wings turned the tide with two goals in the final five minutes of the game.</p>
<p>A noteworthy stat from the game revolves around the Red Wings' knack for comebacks last season, boasting an 11-24-3 record when trailing after two periods. This season, however, they had a 0-8-0 record when down after two periods, a statistic they managed to overturn with their late rally in this game.</p>
<h3>What's Next for the Teams?</h3>
<p>Looking forward, the Islanders will be hosting St. Louis on Saturday, while the Red Wings will welcome Boston to their home ground.</p>

Jonatan Berggren’s crucial equalizer also played a pivotal role in breaking Detroit’s run of three consecutive losses. The Red Wings’ goaltender, Alex Lyon, displayed a remarkable performance with 22 saves. For the Islanders, the only ray of hope came from Simon Holmstrom, who managed to score the sole goal for his team, unable to reverse their pattern of losses with five out of their last six games ending in defeat.

<h1>Nick Chubb Spearheads Cleveland Browns' Victory Over Pittsburgh Steelers</h1>
<p>In an intense blizzard, Nick Chubb drove his team forward, replicating the play that almost ended his career in Pittsburgh last year. Chubb's perseverance paid off with a memorable touchdown, the highlight of a game his teammates will cherish. In the dying seconds of the game, Chubb powered through for a 2-yard touchdown, leading the Cleveland Browns to a triumphant 24-19 victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/steelers-snatch-victory-from-commanders-with-wilsons-late-game-heroics/"">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> on Thursday night. This victory snapped the Steelers' five-game winning spree.</p>
<h2>Chubb's Redemption Against the Steelers</h2>
<p>Chubb's electrifying performance came in his first encounter with the AFC North leaders, the Steelers (8-3), since suffering a season-ending left knee injury in a Monday night game against the same team in Week 2 last September. After a difficult rehab and a similar knee injury in 2015, Chubb's return to the field and scoring against the Steelers was a poetic moment.</p>
<h3>Myles Garrett's Praise for Chubb</h3>
<p><a href=""https://21sports.com/cleveland-browns-myles-garrett-battles-double-foot-injury-a-look-into-his-determination-and-future-prospects/"">Myles Garrett</a>, who made three impressive sacks, expressed his admiration for Chubb, “It meant a lot to me. I know it means a lot to him,” said Garrett. ""His resilience and his comeback in this game truly exemplify the kind of man he is. We absolutely love him.”</p>
<p>In the second quarter, Chubb had scored another 2-yard run. The Browns (3-8) managed to recover from blowing a 12-point lead in the fourth quarter and being down 19-18. With 3:22 left on the clock, the Browns got a chance when Pittsburgh punter Corliss Waitman made a 16-yard blunder.</p>
<h2>The Snowy Showdown</h2>
<p>In the midst of accumulating snow, Jameis Winston of the Browns completed a crucial third-down pass to Jerry Jeudy, reaching the Pittsburgh 9. Two plays later, it was Chubb who bulldozed his way into the end zone.</p>
<p>The Steelers had one last opportunity, but their Hail Mary on the final play was deflected by Browns safety Grant Delpit, triggering euphoria at Huntington Bank Field. This win against the Steelers provided some relief for coach Kevin Stefanski in a tough season and gave Browns fans a reason to celebrate.</p>
<h3>Victory Amidst the Snowstorm</h3>
<p>With a snowstorm transforming the field into a white canvas, the Steelers managed to wipe out an 18-6 deficit, scoring two touchdowns in a little over a minute. However, the Browns rallied back to secure their second divisional win after defeating the Ravens last month.</p>
<h3>Garrett's Outstanding Performance</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, Myles Garrett outshone Steelers star T.J. Watt in a dominant display, including a crucial strip-sack of Wilson. This performance came after Garrett made comments about Watt's apparent snub when Garrett was awarded the Defensive Player of the Year over him last season.</p>
<h2>Up Next</h2>
<p>The Steelers will face the Cincinnati Bengals on Dec. 1, while the Browns are scheduled to take on the Denver Broncos on Dec. 3.</p>

Sports Alabama under new head coach Kalen DeBoer is not going in the direction it predicted before the season and Bama fans just forget about their playoff hopes! After what they have done recently, there’s no shame in saying that. Facing a 24-3 embarrassing loss to an unranked Oklahoma? Seriously, that’s just pathetic. Boy oh boy, Oklahoma is the same team that faced five losses this season and still beat the Tide? All that and still looking at Alabama’s CFP picture, they are still the highest three-loss SEC team currently riding on No. 13. That’s really interesting. But do the experts of this sport also think the same way? Have you heard  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Well, can you recall a single episode when Heather Dinich’s predictions went wrong? Because we don’t! Does that mean the playoffs are a long-lost story for the Alabama Crimson Tide? It looks like that because the majority of the Alabama team’s flaws were exposed last Saturday while Arizona State showcased their worth after their heroic win against BYU. Although the Bama has been a juggernaut in the college football world, the 2024 season is filled with glaring vulnerabilities of the Tide. And more recently, the Oklahoma Sooners were the ones exposing their blunders. After watching that game, it was evident that the blueprint for winning against Alabama is not too hard: play keep away, take an early lead, and crush their offense by pressuring their QBs. Yeah, these were some of the things observed by ESPN analyst Greg McElroy. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad “You play; keep away. You keep their offense off the field,” McElroy said. As per him, the Crimson Tide faced difficulties so far this season when forced to play from behind. “They’ll probably get a little impatient, and they’ll probably get a little one-dimensional.” He then explained that Alabama’s O-line melts like Swiss cheese when they can’t control the game. So against the sooner they only had four possessions till the first half. McElroy discussed what their quarterback, Jalen Milroe, was doing in the game by explaining that he played poorly; there’s no other say in that but he was not the only problem they faced on Saturday night. The wide receivers were as guilty as him. McElroy believes that it was Ryan Williams’s worst performance so far. Not only him but TJ Dupree was found not hanging on the pigskin. As a result of a shaky offense, Oklahoma’s defense dominated throughout the game. So if Alabama hopes to learn from their mistakes, they’ll need to figure out how to stay focused when the game falls out of their hands.

And, you know who knows this better than everyone on the planet today? Kenny Wallace, the unfiltered voice of NASCAR, has never held back – not while he was racing, not now that he has retired. And, man can his opinions rattle fans! This time around, he took on F1’s Las Vegas Second Edition to speak on. And, as usual, he was not afraid to speak his mind, even if it displeased some sections of people. So, what does he think about the race taking place in the largest State of Nevada, challenges highlighted by the X community by it being held late at night, and some businesses in the area crying foul? ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The happy-go-lucky Kenny Wallace never fails to amaze people with his brutally honest, brutally caffeinated takes. So, it shouldn’t be surprising that fans love the old-time barnstorming driver, who raced in his dirt-modified car. He might not have won a Cup race, but his passion for cars and racing is not exactly subtle. He said to these people, “I hear you, I agree. It’s Vegas man and Larry McReynolds says nighttime is the right time. However, they are also saying that the reason they run at night is because they just shut that City down for a little bit. And, I’m sure Formula One and the city are addressing it. Like, you know Vegas is normal all during the day, and then all of a sudden like …(bamm)..  they finish the road course they put the barriers up and then they race. I think the reason they run that Vegas race so late at night is because they shut a lot of the streets down. You know that’s a short race.” However good the show might be, there are many business owners in the area who expressed dissatisfaction with the temporary bridge constructed for the 2024 Las Vegas Grand Prix They believe the bridge is hindering customer access to their establishments, leading to financial losses. One business owner, Wade Bohn, mentioned that he experienced millions in lost sales. Jay’s Market on Flamingo is a typical corner gas station but with a prime location at the crossroads of two major roads. It sells a lot of things, making it an ideal stop for travelers needing to stock up as they come into or leave the city. However, during the last two Novembers, this convenience has been disrupted by the construction of the Las Vegas Grand Prix Formula One circuit, which spans 3.8 miles of city streets. This project has resulted in traffic restrictions and road closures that have caused considerable gridlock in the area. These are just two of the many stories. Anyhow, Kenny Wallace said, “There is a thought that there are some small shops out there in Vegas that are just pissed that Formula 1 is ruining their business that one night. You know it’s a couple of nights, whatever it is. For as much money as the Formula 1 race brings in, I think I’d just bite it for a little bit.” And, Wallace isn’t exactly wrong. Nelson-Kraft, senior vice president of corporate affairs for the Las Vegas Grand Prix explained that the first Grand Prix held last year created an economic impact of $1.5 billion for the city, surpassing initial projections. This amount was higher than the $1 billion generated by the Super Bowl that took place in Las Vegas in February. Additionally, tax revenue from the Grand Prix amounted to $77 million, setting a record for Las Vegas. While he said that the city must be helping these businesses, he also acknowledged that he doesn’t know everything. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad As per a report, four local business owners, including Bohn, initiated lawsuits against Clark County, claiming that the county’s actions have adversely affected their businesses and are seeking financial compensation. The Las Vegas Grand Prix chose not to comment on any current legal matters. Race organizers and Clark County have taken significant steps to ease the impact on local businesses, according to Lori Nelson-Kraft. The construction timeline for this year’s race was reduced by 65% compared to the previous year. To minimize disruptions during peak hours, most of the construction work took place overnight. Additionally, race representatives engaged with local business owners, including Bohn, and expressed a willingness to consider suggestions that could further benefit the community. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad To help with the traffic congestion, a proposal was made to reduce the number of lanes on the temporary bridge on Flamingo Road over Koval Lane from four to two. This bridge was established in October. “A lot of improvements have been made, and I will say that the restaurants that are in and around the circuit, specifically in that corridor, I have personally eaten at since the vehicular bridge has gone in,” Nelson-Kraft explained. “And, anecdotally, while eating in that area there with my husband, I had conversations with their staff where they have shared with me, just as a guest of their venues, that they have seen remarkable improvements over last year.” Critics of the race ideally would like to see the Las Vegas Grand Prix move away from the city to avoid the need for closing major routes. What do you think is the likelihood for that to happen? Before answering this, we might want to keep in mind that the city and F1 have a ten-year contract, which ends in 2032.

In UFC history, we have never seen an athlete as mind-bogglingly unnerving as ‘Borz’. It’s been six years since Chimaev started competing professionally, and no one has been able to hand him a single loss. Furthermore, the Chechen-born, UAE-based fighter has 12 finishes in 14 career fights. With a perfect record and a series of stunning performances, Chimaev’s dominance is undeniable. He was last seen in action at UFC 308, defeating Robert Whittaker in the first round. In true Whittaker fashion, ‘The Reaper’ seemed highly impressed with his performance and now wants him to fight for the title next. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Dricus Du Plessis, the South African middleweight champion, has clarified that he wants Khamzat Chimaev next. ‘DDP’, known for his aggressive fighting style and knockout power, believes a fight with Chimaev would be the perfect test of his skills. There’s only one problem, though, and that’s another former middleweight champion. Sean Strickland lost the belt to Du Plessis in a very closely fought contest. Most of the fans and even experts believed that ‘Tarzan’ should deserve a chance for a title shot next. However, ‘The Reaper’ feels like Chimaev should be next in line for ‘Stillknocks’, as opposed to Tarzan. “I think you [Khamzat] should go straight to Dricus you know. I don’t think sitting out should be rewarded ever right? But not my call.”, Whittaker said on the ‘MMArcade’ podcast.     A post shared by Khamzat Chimaev (@khamzat_chimaev)  Perhaps, ‘The Reaper’ wants to see ‘Stillknocks’ being tested by ‘Borz’, as the current champion already faced ‘Tarzan’ in his last fight. Regardless, Khamzat Chimaev’s dominance impressed Robert Whittaker, although he was on the receiving end of the Chechen’s onslaught. While Chimaev won emphatically, he was sad at having to do what he did to Whittaker. After all, Chimaev previously expressed a reluctance to beat Whittaker saying, “I don’t want to fight with good guys, I need some bad guys.” Let’s see what ‘Borz’ had to say about the finishing sequence of his UFC 308 fight. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Should Chimaev leapfrog Strickland for a title shot, or is that unfair to 'Tarzan'? Debate There are very few fighters in the UFC who are as tough (and scary) as Khamzat Chimaev. The 30-year-old is a master of pressure and he did exactly that against ‘The Reaper’ – apply relentless pressure from the get-go. The comeback fight for ‘Borz’ had him all fired up, but deep down, the Chechen wished it wasn’t Whittaker who suffered the worst injury at his hands. “In the fight, I already knew that something was broken. I heard something crunch. I felt sorry for the guy. Now he needs to be repaired.”, were his words on the ‘Hustle’ podcast. Chimaev even wanted to meet Whittaker after the fight and check on him – “No, I didn’t see him but I wanted to. My team tried to find him. We wanted to shake his hand but we couldn’t find him.”  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad He doesn’t need to feel that bad, though, as Whittaker has healed from his surgery, and is back training with no contact, according to his coach. Now that he’s on the sideline for several months, he will join fans as they wait to see if Khamzat Chimaev gets paired with Dricus Du Plessis in his next outing. Everyone is interested in seeing how the Chechen’s relentlessness stacks up against the South African’s awkward, albeit effective style backed by toughness. Will that fight happen? We’ll have to wait and see. What about Sean Strickland? What does he do with his #1 spot if that fight doesn’t pan out? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

With South Carolina facing defeat for the first time since losing to Iowa in the 2022-23 season’s Final Four, UCLA has surprisingly moved to the top spot for the first time in history. But there’s another team that’s been hit badly in Southern California and their top player, JuJu Watkins, seems to be in hot water. In their latest match-up, the USC Trojans’ surprising loss to the Notre Dame Fighting Irish turned into Watkins vs. Hannah Hidalgo. Then ranked No. 3, USC was expected to take the win against their then-No. 6 ranked opponents but their loss heavily affected their AP Rankings. With the Trojans now at No. 6, even analyst Meghan McKeown has moved them out of the top 5 of her own rankings list. And Zora Stephenson agrees. “With this new top 5, it does mean that USC drops out of the top 5,” she said on NBC Sports. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad “And they lose at home to a Notre Dame team, that at the time, if we’re talking about AP Rankings, I believe was 6. So, makes sense, and this is going to fluctuate throughout the season.” Just last week, these two teams were exactly in each other’s spots, but this time Notre Dame, disrupting her flow with heavy defense, seemed to get to USC’s standout shooting guard. Watkins, who also celebrated a huge NIL deal with State Farm yesterday, seemed to struggle when matched with different sizes on the court vs. the Fighting Irish. The USC sophomore had a slow start in the first half, scoring just five points. But she heated up in the second half against Hidalgo to finish the 74-61 defeat with a total of 24 points. Can JuJu Watkins lead USC back to the top, or is the team facing a tough season? Debate USC might have lost this week and will be wary of Notre Dame when they meet next on Dec. 6th. By then, McKeown and Stephenson’s lists might have changed again. But for JuJu Watkins, who led the team to their first Elite Eight appearance in 30 years last season, the stage is set for a long-term victory. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad After taking college basketball by storm as a freshman, the Angelino has achieved things not even Caitlin Clark was able to do. For instance, she has an upcoming documentary called “On the Rise: JuJu Watkins,” presented by LeBron James’ UNINTERRUPTED and 4.4.Fourty Media. She has NIL deals with Gatorade and Nike and looks primed for a successful college career. But even with all of these achievements, the only thing she wants is an NCAA title. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad “There is definitely a standard we have built and we are looking to achieve and that’s a championship,” Watkins told Sporting News. “We kind of set the stage last year, and this year, we really plan to continue to grow. It’s basically a whole new team, so we’re still working on chemistry and that will continue to come with as many games as we have.” The Fighting Irish might have ended the Trojans’ four-game winning streak but Lindsay Gottlieb’s squad is not one to be easily kept down. This week might have pushed them out of the top 5 but even with rising challenges, JuJu Watkins and Co. will be looking for a comeback. Let the world know your perspective.

While Earnhardt Jr has been a name that fans resonate with and the legacy he carries, it seems that his daughters saw this fame for the very first time. The No. 8 driver has always been known to be an avid strategist and his impact in the field of driving is worth remembering.  Recently, he was behind the wheel at the Florence Motor Speedway. In his past form, he made every effort to salvage from the 40th position right to the front. While he did not end up winning at the Speedway, the race surely has etched a special memory in his and his daughters’ hearts.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The recent run at Florence Motor Speedway was special in all the right ways and especially when it comes to family, one always tries to make it count. Both his daughters Nicole and Isla were present at the Speedway. They were also near the car after daddy Dale Earnhardt Jr called it a night. While he did put up a good show driving from the 40th position to the 2nd position, an unexpected fuel pump failure meant a DNF for Dale Jr. However, this did not dim the lights in his eyes, all thanks to his beautiful daughters who saw their father racing like the true superstar he was.  While Earnhardt Jr. was skeptical about how his daughters might react to the loud noise, things were quite smooth sailing. Talking about how he felt, Earnhardt Jr said, “I loved them being there. At first, they were kind of scared about it. They were scared of the cars and the noise….but now they are really comfortable about it and I’m starting to understand that they are starting to understand. That’s starting to bare fruit. I want to race more so hopefully the kids know that I race. I didn’t wanna not race in front of them and then when they are 15 or 20, have to go, yeah check this out, I had a whole another life. And they would be like man, wonder what that was like, looking at videos and pictures”.  Although Dale Jr.’s daughters did see him race sporadically after his 2017 retirement, it wasn’t like the South Carolina 400. You see, at the race, Dale Jr. drove his iconic red and black #8 car, complete with the Budweiser logo. It was the car he drove at the peak of his popularity. It was long before the kids were born, and before Dale Earnhardt Jr. moved to Hendrick Motorsports. Is Dale Jr.'s racing comeback more about family legacy or personal passion? Debate While fans would want to witness him more on the tracks, Earnhardt Jr. made it quite clear that he will not be a regular. He added, “So now they atleast have a taste of what racing is like so in the next 5 or 10 years when I don’t do it anymore they can have some memories of going into the racetrack and their dad being a competitor.” It wasn’t long before Dale Jr. got to talking about adorable moments with his family off the track.  Recently, the Dale Earnhardt Jr Foundation had set up an auction and this is when the driver was getting rid of items that were in his storage. While the family was sorting out the items to be sent out for the auction, the girls came across some of the stuff that they liked. This includes some fun costumes along with stuffed animals. Not only the girls but even Amy, flaunted the same.  While the girls had a glimpse of what Dale Earnhardt Jr.’s racing legacy meant, the #8 Bud driver found himself lost in the memories of his father, Earnhardt Sr. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The Florence Motor Speedway saw an abrupt end for Dale Earnhardt Jr with almost 31 laps remaining in the race. This is when his iconic No. 8 Chevy gave up and started powering down. To combat the same, Earnhardt Jr had to make a pit stop, though he could not bounce back to the tracks after that. However, it seems as though Dale Earnhardt Jr is not quite upset about it. Speaking about how the car went through manual issues that could not be fixed, Earnhardt Jr said, “I know this is gonna sound strange but that’s one thing I like about Late Model stock racing is that our cars are prone to failure. There’s a ton of attrition in that race. The parts and pieces on these cars are really traditional”. This hinted that Earnhardt Jr vouches for the unpredictability of the cars and how they add to the curve of the race.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad He was also seen drawing references to his dad’s time and the cars that were popular back then. Earnhardt Jr said, “When Dad (Dale Earnhardt Sr.) was racing for these championships it was a major fear in the back of your mind that you’re gonna have some kind of mechanical failure. I do love that being a part of the process; it just feels real. Feels more authentic”.  Although Dale Earnhardt Jr did not make it to the victory line, he did give a nail-biting performance where he was seen in close contention with drivers like Lapcevich and Doug Barnes Jr.  Let the world know your perspective.

The highly anticipated game will show whether Jon Scheyer’s recruitment will bear fruit for his reign this year or if he will walk the unexciting path that the Blue Devils have after Coach K retired. While the Blue Devils are prepping to show their potential, a certain basketball analyst believes they will have a hard time, and not without reason. On Tuesday’s episode of The Field Of 68: After Dark, Tyler Hansbrough discussed why the Jayhawks might have an edge in this game, and his thinking resonated with many NCAA fans. “Duke’s a young team. They’re gonna get better as they get more experience, and the season goes on. With that said, I like Kansas to win this one because they’re a little more veteran and they have older guys, and Dickinson down low. He’s a bucket. So I’m gonna lean towards Kansas as well with John on this,” Hansbrough stated. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad USA Today via Reuters Oct 20, 2023; Durham, NC, USA; Duke Blue Devils recruit Cooper Flagg during Countdown to Craziness at Cameron Indoor Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Rob Kinnan-USA TODAY Sports The Kansas Jayhawks are an experienced team led by the senior Hunter Dickinson. They have won all the five games they have played this season and only have one notable freshman in Flory Bidunga. Other than that, most of their players are either in junior year or senior year. This certainly gives them an edge since they have played together and individually in the NCAA, like in the case of Dickinson, who transferred to the Jayhawks in 2023. Notably, Dickinson averages 17.8 points with 10.4 rebounds per game. However, it is not only the experience factor that increases their chances of winning the clash. The Bill Self team stands atop the AP men’s basketball polls with their five straight wins. The Duke Blue Devils are placed at the eleventh spot, one better than last week, after having won 4 and lost one game against the Wildcats. What puts more pressure on them is that they haven’t punched above their weight till now in this NCAA season, and all the teams they defeated were either unranked or ranked below them in the AP men’s basketball polls. But despite these disadvantages, Hansbrough did not shy away from applauding the man of the hour: Cooper Flagg. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad When the NCAA season started, the country’s top recruit of the 2024 season hoped to improve his NIL. However, somewhere after losing the crucial game to the Wildcats by a 77-72 margin, all doubted if Flagg would ever be able to live up to the expectations. Then, Flagg also had a poor display against Wofford in his fourth game of the regular season, as the defenders contained him. Can Jon Scheyer's young Blue Devils defy the odds and topple the veteran Kansas Jayhawks? Debate The 17-year-old could only score 8 points in that game. However, he made a comeback against the Arizona Wildcats, hitting 24 points with 10 out of 22 field goals, thus again establishing his supremacy. With that, his NIL, too, reached $2.7 million. Therefore, Hansbrough is excited to watch him play. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad “Cooper Flagg’s unbelievable talent. He’ll be fun to watch. So you know I’m looking forward to him and also like can nipple… I think he’s been one of my favorite players to watch. He’s very active. I like how he’s always moving,”  Hansbrough added. Notably, the 2025 NBA mock draft’s number-one projected pick averages 17.8 points with 8.8 rebounds per game. Hence, it will be exciting to watch him play. Meanwhile, it remains to be seen if Hansbrough’s predictions come true. But if the Blue Devils upset the Jayhawks, it will send a signal that Scheyer is taking steps towards emulating his mentor, Coach K, as his legacy shines on. Let the world know your perspective.

He often gives the impression of disliking basketball. But we very well know that is absolutely not the case. Although, horses might be the Joker’s No.1 favorites. The once-practice hater, Nikola might be the most meticulous player of the Denver Nuggets. Thus, his hard work draws comparisons to the legendary Stephen Curry‘s. Speaking on The Old Man & The Three podcast, ex-NBA player Joakim Noah draws parallels between Nikola Jokic and Steph Curry’s pregame routines. Just to let you know, the Serbian 6’11” giant is nearly 102 lbs heavier than the Baby-Faced Assassin. Despite, his stature, Jokic’s smooth maneuver on the court is a sight to behold. And so, maybe whatever Noah described about the 29-year-old reigning MVP is true. “When Steph Curry is doing his warmup before the game, how it’s become something where fans come and watch, Joker has a workout like that.”Joakim Noah claims in the podcast. “If you see him and what he’s working on before the game, it’s so interesting. Everything is about touch. Touch around the rim. His flow and his touch are just, it’s so unmatched.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The former Clippers star goes on to say: “He works on it. You know, that’s the kind of thing that he works on before the game even starts.” So, what does Nikola do differently? He races around the court with Christian Braun for layup lines. Jokic practices shots like Chef Curry. For the Golden State Warriors star, his pregame routine is like meditation. Everything is about stress management and anxiety control. Well, Nikola Jokic is the coolest player on the court, not just his gameplay but the attitude he holds. Thus finding similarities with Curry. Moreover, as more facts emerge about Joker’s routine and dedication, they actively debunk the rabid myths surrounding him. Is Nikola Jokic's 'lazy' label just a myth, or does his game speak for itself? Debate Remember when Davon Reed rubbished the “lazy” accusations on Nikola? Sometimes it feels like Nikola Jokic just can’t play a bad game. Even when the Denver Nuggets are losing, the Serbian superstar is scoring like there’s no tomorrow. What’s his motivation, you may ask? Well, it’s the love he has for the sport, even when he shows disinterest. Currently, Jokic is leading the triple-double show for the league. Averaging 29.7 points, 13.4 rebounds, and 10.9 assists per game. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad “Lazy” is a strange adjective for Nikola Jokic. His former teammate Davon Reed has verified this matter. In his conversation with Jefe Island, the ex-Nuggets hooper staunchly stated: ” I know a lot of people think ‘Oh Nikola doesn’t like basketball’, or ‘He’s just out there’ like it’s crazy how the media can kind of put a spin or a motive on something when it’s not true. It’s just that’s the notion or that’s motive, and because he’s got an unorthodox game or stardom or what have you that you feel like that. That’s a word just because they say that’s true.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Of course, Nikola Jokic is anything but lazy. He is at the top of his game for the Denver Nuggets. Moreover, Joakim Noah’s revelation simply shows the greatness of the 29-year-old center. Being put at the same table as ‘the’ Stephen Curry himself is an outstanding achievement in itself. But well, knowing the Joker, he keeps going for records and feats. So, could you say he’s laid back? Surely not! Let the world know your perspective.

Chimaev entered the octagon at UFC 308 at Etihad Arena in Abu Dhabi, and despite Whittaker’s intense preparations, he was quickly submitted with a rear-naked choke, resulting in an injured jaw. The submission resembled what Khabib Nurmagomedov did to Conor McGregor six years ago. Despite the defeat and injury, Whittaker remains composed and bears no ill will towards Chimaev. It’s no surprise that he continues to hold the No. 4 spot in the UFC rankings. Weeks after the fight, Whittaker reflected on the bout and acknowledged Chimaev’s impressive performance. Now, let’s see what Whittaker has to say about the Chechen wolf. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Robert Whittaker recently appeared on the MMArcade podcast on YouTube, where he shared updates on his recovery from the injuries sustained in his fight against Khamzat Chimaev. Fully healed and in high spirits, Whittaker joined host Jonny to discuss trending topics in the UFC. However, before diving into broader discussions, Whittaker took a moment to reflect on his loss to Chimaev. Despite the defeat, Whittaker expressed satisfaction with his overall performance and praised Chimaev’s wrestling abilities. He stated, “We did a lot of wrestling, we did a lot of stuff, we did a lot of war work. But, mate, it’s so hard to replicate that sort of takedown, that sort of commitment. Props to him—the guy knows his strengths, played into them to a T, and is willing to burn it all there for it, right? Anyway, the takedown—he goes in, ankle picks me off the fence. It was a great takedown, it was a beautiful takedown.” via Imago ABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES – OCTOBER 28: Khamzat Chimaev of Chechnya interacts with media during the UFC 267 press conference at Etihad Arena on October 28, 2021 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. (Photo by Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC) While Robert Whittaker acknowledged Chimaev’s technical skills, he clarified that he didn’t find Chimaev to be overwhelmingly powerful. Instead, he commended Chimaev’s weight distribution during the rear-naked choke that sealed the fight. Whittaker explained, “He has a really heavy sag. He’s not ridiculously strong or anything like that, but he has a really heavy sag. And he was really good at making me work—always kind of reaching for underhooks, reaching for ankle picks, trying to get a hook in.” With this victory, Khamzat Chimaev made a significant leap in the middleweight rankings, jumping ten spots to claim the No. 3 position. On the other hand, Whittaker’s loss saw him drop a spot in the division rankings, setting him back in his pursuit of another title shot. Rumors have been swirling about Whittaker’s potential return in February 2025, possibly against Dricus du Plessis in Sydney. However, the latest update from Whittaker seems to suggest a different direction altogether. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Did Khamzat Chimaev's win over Whittaker prove he's the next big thing in the UFC? Debate Dricus Du Plessis has been out of the Octagon since defending his title for the first time against Israel Adesanya at UFC Perth. While seeking an appropriate opponent for his next bout, much is happening in the division. What could be better than returning to Australia, where he defended his title, but this time in Sydney? According to Du Plessis’ longtime coach, who revealed last month, “There is only one thing certain at this stage, only one thing,” a rematch with Robert Whittaker seemed likely. However, this prediction came before UFC 308 concluded. The aftermath of UFC 308 has changed the dynamics. Whittaker’s tooth injury turned the tide for Du Plessis’ aspirations. ‘The Reaper’ recently underwent surgery to remove his middle teeth, which had been weak since his teenage years but worsened due to his fighting career. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Robert Whittaker’s coach, Alex Prates, recently provided a health update while speaking to Sherdog, saying, “After he had his six teeth implanted, he returned to training on Monday, but without any contact. He will train Muay Thai, run, everything — but without contact. Maybe he will still have an operation on his elbow to remove some bone fragments, but we haven’t decided yet. It’s a minor surgery, but it would cost another month. Our plan is to return to the Octagon in June.” What are your thoughts on Khamzat Chimaev’s performance at UFC 308?

PUBLICATIONxINxGERxSUIxAUTxONLY Copyright: xKimxKlementx 20221008_lbm_sv7_084 The CFB gods have finally bestowed rivalry weekend upon us. Some teams still have overarching goals to achieve heading into the final Saturday of the regular season. Playoff berths, Conference Championship shots, or salvaging bowl eligibility. Amidst the high stakes, an old-fashioned grudge game with nothing but pride on the line would go down as a treat. One such matchup beckons in the Sunshine State. The FSU Seminoles (2-9) will host the Florida Gators (6-5) in a night game at Doak. That’s enough to get the juices flowing if you’re of a Seminoles persuasion. The game presents an opportunity to end a dismal season on a high. However, one adversary may just have provoked FSU by firing the inaugural shots leading up to the battle. A battle he shall not even be in the trenches for himself! Kahleil Jackson, junior year WR for the Gators, is the adversary in question. He posted an IG story of him running a great route followed by a first down against ex-Seminole DB Renardo Green. The clip was from a previous game between the two schools. Jackson added the hashtag “#beatfsu”, along with an emoji of a man throwing trash in the garbage. Not a very subtle choice to make his feelings toward his rival known. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Sup lil bro @SSN_Seminoles pic.twitter.com/7hteVUcxam — Sidelines: Florida Gators (@SSN_Gators) November 25, 2024 Expand Tweet  Renardo Green is now playing in the NFL for the 49ers. Unfortunately for Kahleil Jackson, he would not have had an opportunity to recreate the catch anyway. Jackson is out for the season with a torn ACL. He suffered the injury during practice back in September. Yet, he made sure to potentially instigate some back-and-forth between the two sets of players.  Both programs have had seasons they’d look back at without much to cherish. FSU lost 6 games on the spin before some respite last weekend against Charleston Southern. Florida meanwhile found a pulse to their season a shade prior. They’re off the back of consecutive wins against ranked opposition. One thing however has kindled fervor among both fanbases- the players destined to line up under center on Saturday and, they hope, for the foreseeable future. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Will Kahleil Jackson's trash talk ignite a fire in the Seminoles, or is it just hot air? Debate Amidst the many facets at play in the latest iteration of this storied rivalry, one in particular yields special intrigue. Both offenses will be spearheaded by true freshmen.  DJ Lagway and Luke Kromenhoek will be the quarterbacks for the Florida Gators and FSU Seminoles respectively. DJ Lagway doesn’t need much introduction to CFB fans. The guy has already captivated onlookers along each of his 5 starts so far. He’s been a breath of fresh air who’s changed the perception around his team and perhaps even been key in securing HC Billy Napier’s future in the Swamp. Luke Kromenhoek, on the other hand, is even more of a novice in the CFB realm. He made his first career start in last weekend’s win, and did he leave his mark. Kromenhoek threw for over 200 yards through the air and 3 TDs. Talk about an instant impact. Kromenhoek was a 4-star prospect and will likely be entrusted with the future of the flailing program. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The home environment may well be an edge for Kromenhoek to ease the nerves a little when they face this weekend. If Kahleil Jackson is an allegory for how the Florida Gators’ defense feels about their nemesis, he will need it. Perhaps the freshmen will be at the center of the next round of trash talking even. A fascinating game beckons in Tallahassee. Keep an eye out on the airwaves for some retaliation to Jackson in the lead-up!  Let the world know your perspective.

   With most teams already playing 12 games, the NFL picture is starting to take better shape. Of course, things can change drastically in this league, and overreactions aren’t unusual in this sport. That’s because a string of bad games can end a team’s hopes in such a short season. With that in mind, ESPN pundit Stephen A. Smith shared his thoughts on the current state of the league. As usual, he took some time from Tuesday’s edition of “First Take” to share his updated list of the top five teams in the league. .@stephenasmith's top 5️⃣ NFL teams list after Week 12:   1. @Lions 2. @Eagles 3. @BuffaloBills 4. @Chiefs 5. @Ravens  What do you think? 🤔 pic.twitter.com/tAub47yo4r — First Take (@FirstTake) November 26, 2024  Following their primetime win over the Los Angeles Chargers, he has the Baltimore Ravens at No. 5. The Ravens might be the best team in the league when they’re at their best, but inconsistency has plagued them all season. Then, he has the Kansas City Chiefs at No. 4. The defending Super Bowl champions bounced back from their first loss of the season, but they only beat the Carolina Panthers by three. Then, he has the Buffalo Bills, who didn’t play this week. Josh Allen is one of the leading MVP candidates, and with him playing at such a high level, they might be the biggest threat to the Chiefs. He has the Philadelphia Eagles at No. 2. They’ve won seven games in a row, and as much as people still have reasons to doubt Nick Sirianni, they’re peaking at the right time. Unsurprisingly, he has the Detroit Lions at the top. They’re tied for the best record, have the absolute best offense, and their defense has shown up when needed."

   Outside of a season in which he posted above-average numbers, Daniel Jones never lived up to the standards of an NFL quarterback. He had the prototypical size and proved to be mobile, but his decision-making, accuracy, timing, and overall passing were never truly there. The Giants constantly gave him a pass because of the lack of talent they put around him, but eventually, enough was, in fact, enough. The team parted ways with him, and now that he’s cleared waivers, he’s free to sign with any team. Notably, a team like the Las Vegas Raiders would’ve made perfect sense for both parties. Nevertheless, it seems like the Duke product has no interest in joining them. According to a report by Jordan Schultz of FOX Sports, Jones removed the Raiders from consideration because he’s looking to sign with a playoff contender. Sources: Despite interest from the #Raiders, free agent QB Daniel Jones has eliminated Las Vegas from his consideration (contrary to other reports).  The former #Giants’ QB is weighing substantial interest from multiple playoff teams, and wants to join a postseason contender. pic.twitter.com/vKhrRvJVcY — Jordan Schultz (@Schultz_Report) November 26, 2024  Schultz adds that other teams have expressed an interest in getting him. Needless to say, the fans quickly took to social media to react to this somewhat shocking turn of events. I can’t think of a single playoff contender that would want him as a starter. At least he would play for the Raiders. — Dave Cartwright (@TheChiefWildcat) November 26, 2024  Imagine getting rejected by Daniel Jones — Mike Maher (@mikeMaher) November 26, 2024  Rejected by Daniel Jones who will be a Birmingham Stallion next year 😭😭 — Jay 🍀 (@MALlKNABERS) November 26, 2024  Oh Danny boy  the pipes…the pipes are calling you to say lower your expectations — Mac🦬 (@tha_buffalo) November 26, 2024  Let me translate: never gonna win one otherwise, let me just join and tag along. — Brett Myers (@bamafan7) November 26, 2024  Being turned down by a recently-released and ever-struggling quarterback might be a new low for the Raiders organization. It speaks volumes about how things have unfolded for Mark Davis’ team lately, and it will take a lot to change that sentiment. Jones should be looking at a team where he could get on the field, and he won’t find that on any contender. He might get a chance to win a ring on the bench. Playing and proving that he deserves another shot as a starter might not be on the table."

   The Philadelphia Eagles are getting by just fine without Jason Kelce. They missed him and his leadership earlier in the season, but it seems like they’ve finally figured things out without him. In the meantime, Kelce has been one of the biggest rising stars in the NFL industry, constantly appearing on TV and making big strides with his podcast. However, he’s not the only Kelce family member who will be in the media. His wife, Kylie, is also about to have her own podcast. Kylie is reportedly sick and tired of everybody talking about her family, so she’s taking matters into her own hands and going to do a lot of talking on her own. The show “Not Gonna Lie with Kylie Kelce” premieres on December 5th and new episodes air on Thursdays. I am obsessed with the fact that Kylie Kelce is making her own podcast cause she got so annoyed with people talking about her family and decided ""fine. We can talk, but you'll hear it from the source. so shut up"" GO QUEEN @nglwithkylie pic.twitter.com/pOwBTZ0VD4 — 🍉🪶 Lauren 💙💜🩷 (@bigreptuation) November 25, 2024  Clearly, her husband can give her a few pointers on what to do with her podcast. New Heights, starring Jason and Travis Kelce, has been a major hit since its premiere episode, long before the Kansas City Chiefs star tight end started dating Taylor Swift. The Kelce brothers continue to grow a massive following, and the family has suddenly become very prominent in the entertainment industry. Of course, that’s also going to attract some negative attention, so props to Kylie for trying to set the record straight with her own side of the story."

   The New York Giants finally cut the cord on the Daniel Jones experiment. It was a long and winding road for the G-Men, even costing them their best player in recent history. Even so, that’s not the end of Jones in the National Football League, not by a landslide. According to Adam Schefter of ESPN, the ever-struggling signal-caller will still have a place in the league. Talking on ESPN Radio’s “UNSPORTSMANLIKE,” Schefter reported that the Baltimore Ravens and Minnesota Vikings are two of the teams with the strongest mutual interest in pursuing Jones. The latest on Daniel Jones:  Ravens and Vikings could be two of (not the only) teams Daniel Jones has conversations with.  @AdamSchefter imagines we get a decision sometime this week on where Daniel Jones lands. pic.twitter.com/C7wIcI5bc4 — UNSPORTSMANLIKE Radio (@UnSportsESPN) November 26, 2024  Jones reportedly wants to play for a Super Bowl contender where he can play meaningful games. Moreover, the fact that he didn’t sign with anybody shortly after clearing waivers made Schefter feel like the Ravens might be in the lead, as they played on Monday Night Football and needed more time to have conversations with him. This feels like an odd approach by Jones. If anything, he should be looking to play for a struggling team with a bad quarterback to compete for a starting spot and prove whether he can play. Barring a major disaster or injuries, he won’t see the field with the Ravens or Vikings. He makes sense for them as an upgrade to their current backups, but he’s not a realistic choice to start for them at any point."

   Daniel Jones has officially hit the NFL free agent market after clearing waivers on Monday, presenting an intriguing opportunity for teams seeking quarterback depth. The New York Giants released Jones at his own request following a recent benching, and the most attractive aspect for potential suitors is the financial flexibility – any team signing him won’t be responsible for the nearly $12 million remaining on his contract or his $23 million injury guarantee. While initial rumors pointed to the Las Vegas Raiders as a potential destination, Fox Sports’ Jordan Schultz reported that Jones has removed them from his list of potential landing spots. “Despite interest from the #Raiders, free agent QB Daniel Jones has eliminated Las Vegas from his consideration (contrary to other reports). The former #Giants’ QB is weighing substantial interest from multiple playoff teams, and wants to join a postseason contender.” The NFL Insider noted.

Jones’s struggle with a challenging offensive line has been a significant factor in his recent performance. Ranking seventh in the NFL with 29 sacks and absorbing a league-high 44 hits this season, he’s been under constant pressure that has undoubtedly impacted his statistical output. Despite these challenges, Jones remains a starting-caliber quarterback with untapped potential. His 2023 season numbers reflect both resilience and potential: 2,070 passing yards, eight touchdowns, seven interceptions, and a noteworthy 265 rushing yards with two additional ground touchdowns. These stats suggest a versatile quarterback who could be an asset to the right team. Several playoff-contending teams have shown preliminary interest in Jones, including the San Francisco 49ers, Miami Dolphins, New York Jets, Detroit Lions, and Minnesota Vikings. The Vikings and Dolphins appear particularly compelling options. For the Dolphins, Jones could provide valuable insurance given Tua Tagovailoa’s ongoing injury concerns."

   The Cincinnati Bengals’ season reads like a paradoxical NFL narrative, where individual brilliance collides with collective disappointment. Joe Burrow’s recent performances have been nothing short of extraordinary, painting a picture of quarterback excellence that stands in stark contrast to the team’s 4-7 record. He also is on a rare historical trajectory. “Joe Burrow is on pace to be the third QB over the last 50 seasons to lead the NFL in pass TD on a team with a losing record. The other two are Joe Montana (1982) and Drew Brees (2012),” NFL researcher Tony Holzman-Escareno wrote on X. Joe Burrow is on pace to be the third QB over the last 50 seasons to lead the NFL in pass TD on a team with a losing record.  The other two are Joe Montana (1982) and Drew Brees (2012). — Tony Holzman-Escareno (@FrontOfficeNFL) November 25, 2024  Burrow’s statistical resume is genuinely impressive. Through 11 games, he has amassed 3,028 passing yards, maintaining a robust 67.2 percent completion rate and delivering a league-leading 27 touchdowns against just four interceptions. His sterling 106.9 passer rating underscores a level of consistency that belies the Bengals’ overall performance. In a stunning display of individual prowess, Burrow etched his name in the NFL record book by becoming the first quarterback in league history to throw for 300+ yards, 3+ touchdowns and zero interceptions in back-to-back games while losing both in regulation. His statistical achievements become even more remarkable when considering he’s already accumulated three losses with such stellar numbers, more than Tom Brady experienced in his entire career. When a franchise quarterback performs at such an elite level yet consistently finds himself on the losing side, it signals fundamental problems within team management, coaching strategies and player dynamics. The road ahead remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: Joe Burrow is delivering a master class in quarterbacking, even as the Bengals struggle to translate his brilliance into victories."

   The San Francisco 49ers were outclassed and embarrassed by the Green Bay Packers in Week 12, and without quarterback Brock Purdy, who was out with a shoulder injury, they looked like a boat without a competent captain. With a 5-6 record, San Francisoc’s chances of making the playoffs haven’t quite run out, but there is very little margin for error for the rest of the season. The Niners absolutely need Purdy back as soon as possible with another difficult road game coming up against the Buffalo Bills, and head coach Kyle Shanahan provided a positive update as preparations begin. “Niners QB Brock Purdy (shoulder) did light throwing today, per coach Kyle Shanahan,” Around the NFL wrote on X. Niners QB Brock Purdy (shoulder) did light throwing today, per coach Kyle Shanahanhttps://t.co/mesa2GFthe pic.twitter.com/bRfVQu5OME — Around The NFL (@AroundTheNFL) November 25, 2024  Purdy’s stats may not be as good as they were last season, but in his defense, he and the team have been dealing with a rash of injuries, and the list of available offensive players has been different from week to week. Right now, the offensive line is in bad shape, as left tackle Trent Williams, left guard Aaron Banks and right guard Dominick Puni are dealing with injuries. The one saving grace is that the NFC West is arguably the weakest division in the NFL, and if the 49ers manage to eke out just enough good health and wins, they could still claim the division title and a playoff berth. But the way things have been going this season, it looks very likely they will be on the outside looking in once the postseason starts."

   A number of NFL quarterbacks have been playing at a very high level this season, mostly the usual suspects, with a couple at the top of the list of MVP candidates. But there is one very talented QB who many aren’t talking much about, even though his team came into “Monday Night Football” with the fourth-best record in the AFC. Los Angeles Chargers star Justin Herbert has made his team one of the league’s biggest surprises, and he earned some high praise from former NFL quarterback Alex Smith. “This guy is an absolute monster,” Smith said of Herbert, via SiriusXM NFL Radio. ""This guy is an absolute monster.""    Alex Smith has been impressed by @Chargers QB Justin Herbert as he is a guy who can do it all.    📻 https://t.co/v3G0iz6gwE#Chargers | #BoltUp pic.twitter.com/RFFRzNI4AY — SiriusXM NFL Radio (@SiriusXMNFL) November 25, 2024  Smith said Herbert has been a monster for a while and even compared the 26-year-old to Adonis while saying he hasn’t seen a more impressive physical specimen in person. Herbert was the No. 6 overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft, and he has one of the strongest arms in football, which allowed him to set the league record for the most touchdown passes by a rookie. Now, under new head coach Jim Harbaugh, a lot of the burden of carrying L.A.’s offense has been lifted, and it has helped him and his team. Coming into the Week 12 game against the Baltimore Ravens, Herbert had thrown for 2,186 yards and 13 touchdowns, and though those numbers may not be MVP-caliber, the fact that he has thrown just one interception is very impressive. He helped guide L.A. to a 7-3 record, and despite the expectations of many when the year started, the team is in position to make the playoffs for just the third time in the last 11 seasons. Smith said Herbert will help the Chargers win lots of games for many years to come with a proven culture-builder like Harbaugh in charge."

   Saquon Barkley’s electrifying performance on “Sunday Night Football” thrust him into the spotlight during the Philadelphia Eagles’ demolition of the Los Angeles Rams. The crowd’s “M-V-P” chants showered a player delivering a career-defining moment, with Barkley unleashing 255 rushing yards and two second-half touchdowns that decisively crushed any comeback hopes for the home team. His 72-yard touchdown run not only sealed the victory but also etched his name in Eagles history, surpassing LeSean McCoy’s single-game record of 217 rushing yards, set in 2013. In a moment of pure, unscripted authenticity, Barkley was hilariously unaware of his record-breaking achievement. After tossing the ball to an Eagles fan, he learned of his feat on the sidelines, asking a staff member about the ball, only to hear he’d given it away. His classic “Oh no!” reaction captured the genuine surprise of an athlete in the midst of a historic season. Pain 😩😂 (via NFL) pic.twitter.com/xHJyB0uqal — FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) November 25, 2024  With 1,392 rushing yards in just 11 games this season, Barkley is tracking toward an extraordinary 2,151-yard season. That pace would not only eclipse the 2,000-yard milestone but also would surpass Eric Dickerson’s legendary single-season record of 2,105 yards. McCoy’s franchise record of 1,607 yards is well within reach and seems increasingly likely to fall given Barkley’s current momentum. His move to Philadelphia came as a free agent after six seasons with the New York Giants. Known throughout his career as one of the league’s most dynamic running backs, he’s now benefiting from the best offensive line of his professional career. The result? A performance that’s transforming him from a talented player to a potential league-defining star."

   The New England Patriots have been going through a frustrating rebuilding process ever since quarterback Tom Brady left, but for the first time since then, they may be seeing a glimmer of the light at the end of the tunnel. They seem to believe they have found their next franchise quarterback in Drake Maye, the No. 3 overall pick from the 2024 NFL Draft who took over in Week 6, and second-year cornerback Christian Gonzalez may be developing into a star. Veteran safety Jabrill Peppers could be another cornerstone for the Patriots moving forward, but earlier this season, he was arrested on charges reportedly including strangulation and drug possession. As a result, he was placed on the commissioner’s exempt list, but he has now been reinstated by the league. “Jabrill Peppers is now eligible to participate in all team activities, including playing in games,” Mike Reiss of ESPN wrote on X. Jabrill Peppers is now eligible to participate in all team activities, including playing in games.  From the NFL: “In accordance with the Personal Conduct Policy, the league initiated a preliminary investigation into an incident from early October. That review will remain… https://t.co/d0fDvDVcQU — Mike Reiss (@MikeReiss) November 25, 2024  The Patriots signed Peppers to a two-year contract, and in his first season with them he recorded eight passes defended, two interceptions, five tackles for loss, two quarterback hits and 78 total tackles (52 solo). Despite going 4-13 last season, New England’s defense was solid, and it has missed Peppers during his absence. Now 3-9, the Patriots have one of the worst records in the AFC, and at this point, their fans are perhaps hoping for as many losses as possible so the team can improve its draft positioning. The Pats have many needs on both sides of the football, and the organization has been discovering how hard it is to rebuild after building a dynasty as they did over two decades."

English football’s governing body released their new equality, diversity and inclusion strategy for the next four years on Tuesday – a document exclusively revealed by Mail Sport – and a commitment to improving the number of black, asian, mixed or other ethnic background (BAME) coaches that work within the national teams across all age groups has emerged as a leading theme. The FA also revealed their intention to:        The FA want 25 per cent of England men’s team coaches to be from BAME backgrounds by 2028 – and for that number to be 50 per cent for the Lionesses      Paul Nevin (centre), Jimmy Flloyd Hasselbaink (right) and Chris Powell (not pictured) all worked with the senior team under Gareth Southgate  According to the report, the number of BAME coaches working across England men’s teams currently stands at 19 percent. But the document, published on Tuesday, has pledged to have that figure rise to 25 percent with an ambitious ‘stretch target’ of 30 percent. That commitment comes at a time when it is yet to be concluded whether incoming England senior head coach Thomas Tuchel will have an ethnically diverse coach on his backroom team. Chris Powell, Paul Nevin and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink all worked with the senior England team during Gareth Southgate’s eight year reign while Ashley Cole and Joleon Lescott assisted Lee Carsley’s recent interim period in charge. The move to increase diversity across top coaching roles has split public opinion amid a popular belief that such appointments should purely be based on ability.      The FA also want females to make up half their staff, and LGBTQ+ people to comprise 14 per cent of their workforce Nevetheless, the FA are determined to ensure their most prestigious coaching positions represent a cross-section of society. Elsewhere in the document, the FA disclosed that one of their key targets is to tackle the vile abuse England footballers have received in recent years. In a human rights report conducted by UEFA following Euro 2024, it was revealed Bukayo Saka and Jude Bellingham were the two most seriously abused players at the tournament. Saka, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford were all targeted with online racial abuse after they missed penalties in the Euro 2020 final defeat to Italy. In the report, the FA say they have calculated a 47 percent rise in racist abuse across all levels and a 44 percent rise in instances of sexism and misogyny. Other highlights from the dossier include a clear commitment to promoting the Rainbow Laces campaign, aimed at ensuring members of the LBGTQ+ community are welcomed across English football. Indeed, the FA have set a target of 14 percent of all their employees to be LGBTQ+ by 2028. Your email address will not be published.

Chris Sutton's son scores STUNNING goal from inside his own box – before ex-Premier League star dad reacts on It's All Kicking Off Chris Sutton has reacted to his son’s goal which went viral after his goalkick looped straight over the opposition goalkeeper and into the back of the net. The incident occurred during Wroxham’s 5-2 win over Grays Athletic, when Sutton’s son, Ollie, launched an effort the length of the pitch and into the goal. He then celebrated with Alan Shearer’s trademark celebration – as the crowd serenaded him with chants of ‘Shearer’.   Now, ex-Premier League star Chris Sutton has offered his thoughts on the goal.  Speaking on Mail Sport’s own podcast It’s All Kicking Off, Sutton said: ‘The goalkeeper for Wroxham is my son, Ollie, who’s 28 years old and he scored his first ever goal.  ‘He saw the opposing Grays goalkeeper off his line and punted the ball up the pitch. Couple of bounces, gale force winds and into the goal. And he’d been getting a fair bit of stick all afternoon.       Ollie Sutton scored a stunning goal from inside his own box after launching a goal-kick      The 28-year-old wheeled away doing Alan Shearer’s trademark after jeers from the fans      Chris Sutton reacted to the viral incident on Mail Sport’s podcast It’s All Kicking Off   ‘Good natured stick, but from the Grays support who who were calling him son of Shearer. And it was good natured, he said after. ‘So then when he scored, what did he do? He ran over to the grey support who were giving him pelters all afternoon doing the Shearer celebration. That was beautiful’.  Sutton’s podcast co-host Ian Ladyman then jokingly said: ‘He’s obviously inherited that very natural sense of pettiness that his father has. And I absolutely love that.  ‘When you say the traveling fans supports him, how many would we be talking about? Six, seven? sorry. Sorry, mate. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry’. Sutton responded: ‘No, well, Grays were at home. Yeah, so Wroxham travelled to Grays . But anyway, yeah, so they were a good lot, actually, though.  ‘And, you know, there are certain stadiums which Ollie plays in, and he does get a fair bit of flack because I’m his dad. But that was all pretty nice nature, so fair play to the Grays fans’. Ladyman replied: ‘I love it, I love it. Message to Russell Martin at Southampton, see, does work when you punt it long. We’ve been telling you this all season.  ‘I love the way that you suggest that he did it on purpose, that he spotted the goalkeeper off his line. Surely he just wellied it as far as he can like he does every time he gets it. ‘Exactly’, Sutton finished. ‘When he was younger, he could barely kick the ball out of his box.

Mascherano will now be the head coach for the Major League Soccer super team led by his former Barcelona teammates Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets, Luis Suarez, and Jordi Alba. This comes after manager Tata Martino decided to leave the club following a season where they won the Supporters Shield, but were eliminated in MLS Cup Playoffs by Atlanta United.   Prior to this recent appointment, Mascherano was the head coach of the Argentina U20 and U23 national teams. Mascherano led the Argentina men’s team at the 2024 Summer Olympic games in Paris. There, they finished second in Group B and fell to host nation and eventual silver medalists France in the quarterfinals. Mascherano arrives with no experience having coached a senior side or a first team at any level – either internationally or in the club sphere.       Javier Mascherano has been confirmed as the new manager of Inter Miami in MLS      Mascherano takes over a Miami team led by his former Barcelona teammate Lionel Messi  It seems to be yet another move by Inter Miami owners Jorge Mas, Jose Mas, and David Beckham to acquire as many members of the 2015 UEFA Champions League winning Barcelona side as possible. Jorge Mas, the managing owner of the club, said in a statement, ‘This job requires somebody with the experience to be able to maximize our unique collection of talent – from our global superstars, to our burgeoning Homegrown players, to our young international prospects, and everything in between.  ‘Javier has amassed unmatched experience in his career, from playing on the world’s biggest stages, to coaching at the youth international level; he has the blend of skills and experience we were looking for, and even has had direct coaching experience with [Inter Miami players] Tomás Avilés, Facundo Farías, Federico Redondo, and Benjamin Cremaschi. ‘We believe Javier is an important addition to our Club as we continue on our quest to be among the world’s elite, setting a new standard for fútbol in North America.’ David Beckham also contributed to the club statement, saying, ‘Throughout his career as one of the world’s best players and as an experienced coach, Javier has always demonstrated what makes him great – relentless determination with the knowledge, instincts and understanding to back it up. We’re very excited to welcome him to lead our team.’ Mascherano said, ‘To be able to lead a Club like Inter Miami is an honor for me, and a privilege I will strive to make the most of. I was drawn to the organization’s undeniable ambition, and the infrastructure it has to support it.  ‘I’m looking forward to working with the people at Inter Miami to help the Club reach new heights, and to give the fans more unforgettable moments.’ Mascherano will be tasked with providing success to the club after a season that ended much sooner than anyone associated with The Herons may have hoped.       Co-owner David Beckham also praised Mascherano for his experience as a player and coach After winning the Supporters Shield – given to the team that earns the most points in an MLS season – by eight points over the Columbus Crew, Messi & Co. fell at the first hurdle in the playoffs. The silverware may be nice, but by MLS standards, Miami will go uncrowned after losing in a three-game series to the nine-seed Atlanta United.  After winning the first game 2-1, they fell in the second match by a 2-1 scoreline as well. In the do-or-die third match, Miami couldn’t hold on despite scoring first as Atlanta won 3-2 to advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals.  Inter Miami saw Suarez and Messi finish joint second alongside Los Angeles FC’s Denis Bouanga in the goal scoring race. Messi also finished tied for third in assists with 16. All that was under Tata Martino – the former Barcelona manager who won an MLS Cup with Atlanta United back in 2018.  Martino helped Inter Miami start its silverware cabinet with a Leagues Cup crown in 2023 before winning the Supporters Shield and the Eastern Conference regular season title this past season. After the elimination, Martino decided to leave the club, citing ‘personal reasons’.      Mascherano (center) is best associated with his time at Barcelona where he won multiple Spanish league titles and cups as well as the Champions League twice      With Argentina, Mascherano won a gold medal at the Olympics in 2004 and in 2008 (above) Mascherano has only been coaching since 2021 after he hung up his boots following a playing career that spanned 649 club matches and 147 caps for Argentina. His career included stops at River Plate, Corinthians, West Ham, Liverpool, Barcelona, Hebei China Fortune, and Estudiantes. Mascherano scored five goals at club level and three internationally while garnering a reputation as one of the best holding midfielders of his generation. He’s best associated with Barcelona, where he played 334 matches. He won La Liga five times, the Copa del Rey five times and the Spanish Supercup three times. Mascherano also won the 2010-11 Champions League, the 2014-15 Champions League and both the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup in 2011 and 2015. As a player for Argentina, he won gold medals at the Olympics in 2004 and 2008. He was also part of the side that finished runner-up at the 2014 FIFA World cup and finished second at the Copa America four times. Your email address will not be published.

The Real Madrid star has opened up on the agony he felt after the Three Lions’ defeat to Spain and said he felt like a scapegoat by fans and media, who he insists overstepped the mark of respect with some of their reporting. Bellingham was speaking at Anfield ahead of the European champions’ clash with Liverpool on Wednesday night and insisted his ‘smile is back’ after a tough few months.   ‘I’ve got to be honest I think I lost my smile a lot after the Euros when it came to playing for England because I felt like I was a little bit mistreated in comparison to what I contributed,’ said 21-year-old Galactico. ‘I felt like some of it was a bit harsh on me.  ‘I felt I was a bit like the scapegoat. Maybe I was feeling a little bit sorry for myself. The last (England) camp with a lot of new faces really brought out the joy in my game again and I think you can see that in the two games. ‘In general, I haven’t lost my smile in the Madrid shirt. I am annoyed when we lose and I get frustrated but it is never a case of not being happy. I’m the luckiest lad in the world. I get to play week in week out for the biggest club in the world and represent my country. The smile is back.’      Jude Bellingham says he ‘lost his smile’ after the Euros and felt ‘mistreated’ by fans and media      The 21-year-old says he felt like a scapegoat for the final defeat and that ‘the whole world was crumbling down on me’       Now he has his smile back but has not forgotten his emotions from over the summer Bellingham, who was La Liga’s player of the season with 19 goals and six assists last term, has failed to replicate those dizzying heights this year with just two strikes. But he added: ‘For me pressure is not a problem. ‘I understand that playing for Real Madrid the expectations are going to be high for me wherever I go with the national team. I felt like I contributed some pretty big moments and, in the end, it kind of felt like the whole world was crumbling down on me after the Euros. ‘One of the big criticisms of me was that I didn’t speak to the media, I didn’t want to do press conferences. That was reported in a way that it made out I was above it, that’s not at that at all. I had some personal things going on. ‘Journalists went to go and see members of my family while I was at the tournament, went to visit my grandparents and that’s something I kept to myself. I don’t think that’s fair. I think that crosses the line of respect. ‘That’s where I took it a little bit personally and decided I was going to focus on football and try to let that do the talking instead of talking in the press to people who seemingly don’t respect me. That was a thing for me. Family comes first. ‘My nan didn’t want to leave her house for the whole summer, bless her. Maybe I should have communicated that before so people understood my situation but that was a little bit more personal and that’s why I decided to keep my mouth shut.      Bellingham revealed that even his nan didn’t want to leave her house for fear of being bombarded by reporters      The midfielder is gearing up for a Champions League clash and hopes to continue ‘shutting people up’ with his performances ‘Criticism is part of the game and I know how to accept it but when it feels personal it does give you a bit of a new challenge to continue to shut people up. That’s something I’ve dealt with since I was very young, coming into the first team at Birmingham. ‘Then, people aren’t sure you’re ready. You take those little things and you try to use it as motivation. Like I say, it’s not something I’m really worried about. I understand it is part of the game.’ Your email address will not be published.
