Now the quaint, handwritten creation he turned during an English III class at UCLA in 1940 is about to go up for sale. Weiss Auctions is offering the 15-page report—all in Robinson’s hand and complete with pictures he pasted to illustrate his conclusions—in its Fall Auction. The one-of-a-kind piece is expected to sell for $15,000-$25,000.  According to the auction company, the report was purchased years ago from the estate of long-time UCLA assistant football coach A.J. Sturzenegger and comes with a JSA Letter of Authenticity. It’s believed to be the first time it’s been offered publicly. “We are very excited to be able to handle a terrific item like this,” Weiss Auctions Founder Phil Weiss told SC Daily. ” In over 40 years in the auction business, we’ve had the opportunity to handle the sale of some very unique and significant items and this definitely would be near the top of that list.”  The auction cuts a wide swath across sports and non-sports card categories.  Collectors of pre-War vintage cards will find a group of rare 1932 US Caramel card, including Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, 1933 Goudey issues of the two Yankee sluggers and several other lots featuring tobacco cards and 1940s Play Ball.    A fully graded 1956 Topps baseball set kicks off the post-War offerings, joined by complete 1951 Red and Blue back sets and a 1963 Topps set.  There are also 1950s and 60s stars including numerous Mickey Mantle cards. Among the modern card lots is a partial PSA 9-graded set of 1993 Topps Finest Baseball.  For those who really want a trip back into cardboard nostalgia, there are 1950s Exhibit and baseball card vending machines up for grabs.  Non-sports offerings include the highest graded 1953 Topps Who-Z-At set, a 1933 Jungle Gum graded set and many other vintage TV show master sets. There are dozens of autographed items, including those penned by Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle, with several of the latter carrying inscriptions.  A 1950 Yankees team signed baseball also includes one of the first signatures of Mantle with the Bronx Bombers while a rookie year government postcard carrying his early autograph is also on the block.     Other signed items include a Ty Cobb check, a Roy Campanella signed 1956 Topps card, a Derek Jeter Little Sun Prospect signed card, an Andre the Giant signed magazine, a 1986 World Series ticket signed by Buckner and Wilson and other items. The auction is open for pre-bidding now and will close a live session on Wednesday, Nov. 20. Rich is the editor and founder of Sports Collectors Daily.

Now, redemption cards for complete sets of 1986-87 Fleer basketball are part of the 'Finale' of Jersey Fusion's ode to the original landmark product.","November 11, 2024 By Rich Mueller  Late last spring, cards from 50 complete sets of 1986-87 Fleer basketball and another hoard of 125 Michael Jordan rookie cards and stickers were put into a new product from Sportscards.com’s Jersey Fusion Line. Described as a years in the making “passion project” for company founder Bobby Poll, the Beckett encapsulated cards include small swatches of game-used gear used by the player on the card. Thousands of one card boxes were sold but six months later, the company has added some fresh content to the remaining inventory, including three redemption cards for fully PSA graded complete sets of cards and stickers, each with a Jordan rookie graded NM/MT 8.   The 1986-87 Fleer Jersey Fusion “Finale Edition” boxes also include a fourth redemption for a complete Jersey Fusion set of the 132 cards and 11 stickers that included the memorabilia pieces embedded in the holder. That set was originally pieced together by a collector who took advantage of the company’s offer last spring to trade it in for a game-worn, autographed 1991-92 Jordan jersey.  Sportscards.com is now giving that set back to the collecting community through the sales of the Finale edition. The product contains cards and memorabilia for all 131 players that were featured on the landmark Fleer set, which was the first in five years to be sold via wax packs.    At least three of the five boxes in a display case have autographed cards. Full cases contain six display cartons with a total of around 20 autographs. Some of the autographed cards carry inscriptions.  One of the biggest hits in the product One of the top pulls was an autographed Jordan rookie that carries a 9 autograph grade from Beckett and a portion of an NBA ‘Logoman’ patch from one of Jordan’s 1987-88 home uniforms. Other chase cards carry pieces of basketballs used in the NBA Finals.   Autographs from about 100 of the players in the set are possible, including Jordan, Julius Erving, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Charles Barkley and the late Bill Walton. A checklist that’s been pulled includes autographs of Erving, Bird and Johnson.  The back of each card in the product has a QR code on the reverse side that bring the collector to the site to see the original game-used  memorabilia item from which it was taken. Memorabilia used in the Jersey Fusion product came from jerseys, warm-ups, trunks, shoes, basketballs and even surfaces of NBA courts. Boxes and cases of the most recent edition are available here.  The previously released version, which still offers randomly packed Jordan rookie cards and stickers are still selling on eBay here.

The final games of Gwynn’s career took place slightly later than normal due to the Sept. 11 attacks. The jersey includes the American flag patch worn by on-field personnel after play resumed.  Another jersey with the flag patch, presumably from the same time period, sold for just over $5,000.

Sports Collectors Daily,Kahn’s Final Football Set In 1964 Was Colorful And Loaded With Stars,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/kahns-final-football-set-in-1964-was-colorful-and-loaded-with-stars/,"Tue, 12 Nov 2024 00:30:24 +0000","Sixty years ago, Kahn's wrapped up a short run of football card set with their only full-color NFL offering.","November 11, 2024 By Bob D'Angelo  Let’s be frank: Kahn’s Wieners had a great run for enthusiastic foodie sports card collectors. In baseball, Kahn’s released sets from 1955 through 1969. The company added basketball cards to the mix in 1957, and those were issued through 1965. It was inevitable, perhaps, that the Cincinnati-based meat company would include pro football. Kahn’s produced sets from 1959 through 1964, and the final set is one of the most coveted. Kahn’s, which was founded by Elias Kahn as a meat market in 1883, became a landmark in Cincinnati. After he died in 1899, Kahn’s children founded E. Kahn’s and Sons, By 1926 it was one of the nation’s largest independent meat processing companies. The company’s slogan was  “The Wiener The World Awaited.” In the 1964 Kahn’s football set, some long-awaited technology was introduced: full-color photography.  The borderless cards measured 3 inches by 3 5/8 inches and 53 were different were on the checklist. The company’s slogan, which had appeared in a white rectangle at the bottom of the card fronts of previous Kahn’s football issues, was relegated to the backs in the 1964 set. The backs also contained statistics and brief biographical sketches.    The cards, which were not numbered, were included in select packages of the wieners and were referenced in advertising as “photos.”  For the second consecutive year, players from all 14 NFL teams were included. However, in keeping with the regional nature of the Kahn’s sets, nine cards feature members of the Cleveland Browns, who were on their way to the 1964 NFL championship. The set contains the top players of the 1960s and 19 future Hall of Famers, including Doug Atkins, Jim Brown, Mike Ditka, Paul Hornung, Sam Huff, John Henry Johnson, Alex Karras, Dick “Night Train” Lane, Jim Ringo, Joe Schmidt, Bart Starr, Fran Tarkenton, Jim Taylor, Y.A. Tittle, Johnny Unitas and Paul Warfield. The poses are classic 1960s football. Warfield’s card in the 1964 Kahn’s issue is the earliest to feature the smooth wide receiver, whose rookie card in mainstream cards was first introduced in the 1965 Philadelphia set. The cards are extremely difficult to find in high grade. Of the 1,242 cards submitted to PSA, only 17 achieved gem-mint status and 98 were PSA 9s. There are no PSA 10s of Brown and just six PSA 9s. There are also no PSA 10s of Hornung, Huff, Karras, Lane, Ringo, Schmidt, Starr, Tarkenton, Tittle and Warfield. Unitas has two gem-mint specimens and six that were graded PSA 9, along with Gary Collins and Jim Katcavage. Not surprisingly, the players with the most graded cards are Unitas (54) and Brown (43). Dallas quarterback Don Meredith, who had 20 cards from the set submitted to PSA, only had one card as high as PSA 9 and five at PSA 8. Over at SGC, only 161 cards have been submitted, and only one came back as a 10. That was of defensive back Clendon Thomas, who had a career season in 1963 when he intercepted eight passes for the Pittsburgh Steelers and was chosen for the Pro Bowl. Seven cards were graded as high as SGC 9, with Warfield’s card being one of them. Other notables at that grade included Ditka, Hornung, Katcavage and Norm Snead. The ’64 Kahn’s cards are fairly hard to locate outside the eastern third of the country. A higher grade near set–missing only one card–sold for a little over $2,400 last month.  That was a bit of a bargain.  Fewer than 100 can be found on eBay. The 1964 season was an interesting one for football. Topps lost its license for NFL trading cards and the Philadelphia Chewing Gum Corporation would issue cards that year and through 1967. In the meantime, Topps issued cards from the upstart AFL. In November 1964, the St. Louis Cardinals football team made noises about moving to Atlanta but were persuaded not to by city officials. Atlanta would get its own NFL franchise in 1966. Also in November, Frank and Martin “Buster” Loicano were convicted of accepting illegal bets on football cards while operating their coin-operated machine business. And an ad for Kahn’s Wieners in February 1964 noted that “famed economist” Nellie Oxrider recommended Kahn’s Wieners because “not only are they delicious, but digestible, too.” They were also the only meats used at the New York World’s Fair that year, the company noted. But as far as football cards were concerned, the string of Kahn’s sets was over after ’64. Bob has been a sportswriter and copy editor for more than 45 years and a blogger for two decades. He is celebrating his 60th year of card collecting, and still counts his 1965 Topps Mickey Mantle as his favorite.  You can reach him at [email protected].

Sports Collectors Daily,"After Tom Brady Signing Fiasco in Miami, Collectors Still Looking for Answers",https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/after-tom-brady-signing-fiasco-in-miami-collectors-still-looking-for-answers/,"Mon, 11 Nov 2024 03:29:39 +0000","Collectors who thought they could get a nice Tom Brady autograph on some valuable game-worn items and Super Bowl tickets are still frustrated, months after getting barely a scribble from the seven-time Super Bowl champ.","November 10, 2024 By Horacio Ruiz  More than six months after a much anticipated Tom Brady autograph signing in Miami, the collectors whose items were inked by Brady with an illegible scribble remain as disheartened, angry, and confused as the day it happened.  One collector is selling off his Brady collection, and another is trying to recoup some of his losses.  The entrance to Brad Jarrett’s house near Orlando, FL prominently featured his Brady memorabilia. The collection featured autographs and inscriptions on helmets, jerseys, and plaques. To Jarrett, Brady was a transcendent football player, but more importantly, a leader he hoped to emulate at his workplace.  “I’m still hurt by what happened at that event,” Jarrett told SC Daily. “I lost all my respect for Tom Brady.” What occurred at that event has been well documented. Brady was the keynote speaker for a business conference organized by EXMA Global, a marketing company specializing in leadership and development events.  As part of his appearance at the Watsco Center in Miami, Brady was contracted to sign about 100 items for patrons who paid $3,600 for a package deal that included Brady’s speech, a photo op and an autograph. The tickets also included a yacht tour of Downtown Miami and networking events at art galleries. Most of the attendees were there for business and networking opportunities and wouldn’t have requested Brady’s autograph on high value items.
 Before delivering a one-hour speech that the attendees praised, Brady was ushered into a room where the items collectors were hoping to have signed were located.  All were meticulously prepared for Brady by a local dealer named Salomon Lutwak. Instructions were placed by each item regarding where to sign with colored pens.    Lutwak, who lives in South Florida, wanted to get a Brady rookie card signed. He volunteered to prepare the items for the signing room because he was friends with many of the collectors in attendance.   When Brady entered the room, Lutwak was asked to leave by Brady’s handlers. When he returned, he couldn’t believe his eyes. Near the end of the speech, Lutwak approached Greg Nazareth, a friend of Jarrett’s, who was also at the conference.  “Bro, all the signatures look like s***,” Lutwak told Nazareth.  Lutwak recorded the room for 18 seconds, sending the clip to Nazareth, who then sent it to the other collectors. They were stunned.  One of the gems in Jarrett’s collection was a ticket from the 2000 NFL Draft, where Brady was famously picked 199th overall. It is one of a handful that are known to exist. From the moment he bought it, Jarrett knew it was the one item he wanted signed in person by Brady. He thought the signing session would be the time and place. He knew Brady’s signature wasn’t a work of art, but he expected it to be similar to others. As the event moved forward, Jarrett was unsure how his ticket had been signed. He didn’t see it in the short video circulating among the collectors. But he saw enough of the autographs on his friends’ items to get angry. He took the photo op to voice his displeasure directly with Brady.   “Tom, I saw the signatures, and it’s messed up what you did,” Jarrett recalls telling Brady. “It’s not right. I spent a lot of money on this.” He walked 30 feet off the stage, turned around, and found Brady staring at him.  “He looked at me like he was shocked I had said something,” Jarret said. “Or surprised that he impacted people with that autograph. I’m not really sure.
 “Brady just gave a great speech about effort and how when he started putting forward the effort in college, small gradual results started happening and that shaped him into giving 100% effort in everything he does. He just lied because he put 0% effort into his signing.”  Nazareth was next in line behind Jarrett, about nine feet away, when he saw Brady’s face. He brought the only known used Brady helmet in the hands of a collector to get signed – a Tampa Bay Buccaneers practice helmet. He considers himself lucky with the autograph he received.  “It wasn’t good,” said Nazareth of his autograph. “But it was better than some of the other crap I saw. Brady turned to [Brad] and gave him a look almost as if to apologize.” The events that unfolded in the room are still up for speculation, but what’s not up for debate is that Brady didn’t sign all the items with his customary autograph for some reason. Instead, some items were marked with a scribble that one would never have guessed came from the legendary quarterback. Brady is known to give a quick, shorthand autograph in large crowds, earning a moniker among collectors as Tornado Tom. However, in their opinion, most of the autographs were worse than those administered by Brady when in a rush.  Many of the items – rare collectibles and, in some instances, unique pieces – were no better off than if a child had taken a marker and scrawled across them.  It’s believed that Brady entered the room expecting to find items like copies of his book, “The TB12 Method,” and glossy photos to sign. Instead, he may have been taken aback to find rare one-of-a-kind items tracing the arc of his career and equipment he once wore on the field, like game-used Super Bowl balls, game-used cleats, the used practice helmet, and the NFL Draft ticket. Typically, Brady signs through Fanatics, with whom he has an exclusive autograph deal. Through Fanatics, Brady will sign items for $4,000. Game-used memorabilia carries a $10,000 fee. Many of the types of items he encountered that day would typically be channeled through Fanatics.  When Brady entered the signing room, he could have: Instead, Brady went with a fourth option, doling out an illegible scribble for many of the items that had been laid out for him. Brady did appear to sign some items in a condensed version that earned him the Tornado Tom nickname. But even those were few and mostly reserved for lower-end items like replica jerseys and pennants.  When Jarrett saw his autographed ticket, he was crushed. It looked a little better than the Super Bowl ticket Brady had signed for another collector, but not much. With his regular autograph, some items would have gone up in value by tens of thousands of dollars. “Tom is a smart guy, and he knows how much his signature adds to what items,” Jarrett said. “He doesn’t like people profiteering off him. If I was in his shoes, and there was all this collectible stuff, I’d be pissed too, but you don’t take it out on the fans. He could have not done it.” At the center of the dispute are the terms set by Brady’s representatives and EXMA Global Founder and CEO Fernando Anzures. Anzures admitted to not knowing much about the signing portion of the event. He sourced that responsibility to Fernando Regato, a sports collector based out of Mexico, who used the EXMA Conference as an opportunity to run his first-ever signing event.  It’s believed that Anzures sold the signing portion of the event to Regato and left it up to him to coordinate and iron out the details.  If the contract between EXMA Global and Brady included a clause about the type of items that could be signed, that wasn’t communicated to the collectors who attended.     Brady’s signing and photo op for the VIPs were a small portion of the EXMA Global Conference that ran through the weekend. However, to the collectors who bought the tickets for $3,600, the autograph opportunity was the primary draw. A handful of die-hard Brady collectors first learned about the signing on the Tom Brady Collectors Group on Facebook.  Derek Wagner, a high-end Brady collector for more than 20 years, was excited about flying to Miami to meet Brady and take a picture with him. He learned about signing on Facebook and became the liaison between himself and four other collectors, including Jarrett, Nazareth, and Regato.  “It was supposed to be one of the greatest times of my life,” Wagner told SC Daily. “How many people get to meet Tom Brady and get his autograph? He’s been my idol for 20-plus years.” The exact terms between Brady and EXMA are unknown, but it appears the seven-time Super Bowl champion wasn’t expecting to see a room with multiple high-value items.  “Regato was telling us any item would be signed,” Jarrett said. “We were wondering, ‘Is this for real?’ We asked a bunch of questions.” “I knew Brady is signed exclusively through Fanatics,” Nazareth said. “We knew he doesn’t do these public signings. But finally, enough of us bit, and we did the event.” Each $3,600 ticket would get one item signed. Wagner bought 15 tickets, six for him, one each for Jarrett and Nazareth, and seven tickets for two other collectors. He paid a portion of the tickets with a credit card and arranged with Regato to pay the remainder in cash. The cash came from Regato, who purchased two game-used Super Bowl balls from Wagner at the event. Regato included those two Super Bowl items in the signing, ironically receiving subpar Brady autographs.  The items Wagner submitted were:  In the aftermath, Anzures admitted to knowing less than he should have about the signing’s details. But he also pledged to make things right. Some wanted a full refund. Wagner filed a dispute with his credit card company, which Anzures did not fight. That resulted in a partial $1,900 refund for each ticket bought. However, Wagner says Regato never reimbursed him for the portion paid in cash.  The tickets were purchased under Wagner’s name, and he felt responsible for getting the money back for his friends.  “He straight up told me he doesn’t have it,” Wagner said of Regato. “He said, ‘I have $8,000 to my name and you can have it.’ I didn’t want $8,000. I wanted the entire thing refunded.” Anzures fully refunded some collectors who were trying to get rookie cards signed, according to USA Today, because Brady did not sign them due to his exclusive autographed card deal with Fanatics. Wagner says Regato told him that Anzures even refunded some collectors their flights and hotels. SC Daily contacted Anzures on multiple occasions, but he did not respond to our interview request.  After the event, Jarrett decided to write directly to Brady via his official Facebook and Instagram accounts.  “I was heartbroken when I saw pictures of the signatures before meeting you,” Jarrett wrote. “I hate admitting it as a grown man, but I was fighting back tears telling you this because I had envisioned the moment so differently. But I had to speak up for what I felt was right.” He wrote him about the 2000 NFL Draft ticket he had purchased less than a year before the signing.  “This ticket meant a lot to me. I had spent years hunting it down, and there have only been three known to come up. For me, this item represented that no matter where others rank you, you can turn yourself into greatness by hard work and dedication. I considered myself blessed that my prized possession wasn’t as messed up as others, but it still hurts, and I wish I had never attended this event.” Jarrett never heard back from anyone.  Wagner is a well-known collector and dealer in the northeast and Massachusetts. He had done various signings with former Red Sox and Patriots players. He reached out to multiple players who could help connect him with Brady, but no one was willing to try.  “Nobody was willing to give us a shot,” Wagner said. “I had never seen anything like it. It’s like they were scared of him.” Within a week of the event in Miami, Jarret, Nazareth and Wagner were referred to a Florida law firm with experience working cases involving celebrities. Over five months, Jarrett and Nazareth discussed scenarios where they sued Anzures and EXMA, Brady, or both. But Jarrett and Nazareth increasingly felt it would be a difficult case. After all, Brady had signed their items – and it would be difficult to argue any intentionally malicious destruction of property.  Ultimately, the firm wanted a $50,000 retainer plus a contingency fee from any monetary wins. The three men countered with a higher percentage for the contingency fee and lower retainer, but the firm declined.  At the same time, Wagner was talking to a prominent Boston-based lawyer. The lawyer agreed to work on a contingency basis, but after a month he told Wagner there wasn’t a case.  “The lawyer was working on it for a month, and he came up with three things we could go after him for, but then he said they’re not valid points,” Wagner said. “He said, ‘If this ever goes to court, there’s no case.’”  Now, it appears that a lawsuit won’t happen. “We were getting exhausted with what was going on,” Jarrett said. “At the time, Derek had made a deal with Goldin Auctions, where he was going to auction off all of the items that he had signed as long as he had consigned all the items with them.” Wagner still felt the weight of the responsibility for being the point person between the collectors and Anzures/Regato. While he was able to file a successful claim with his credit card company, the group was still down $26,000 from the trip to Miami.  Wagner was contacted by a representative from Goldin Auctions, who felt they could sell his six items for a premium, given the provenance from the Miami event and because of the controversial autographs on them. Goldin would give Wagner a bonus for consigning all six items from the signing with the auction house. Wagner would use the bonus to make everyone “whole” from the event and compensate for the cash that was never reimbursed. Wagner would also keep whatever amount the items sold for. But after three signed items were auctioned off in late September, Wagner broke the contract and pulled the other three items from being auctioned off. “They were very confident the items were going to sell for more than normal pieces because they were from this high-profile event,” Wagner said. “But they sold for all-time lows because the autographs clearly destroyed them.” A game-used cleat signed by Brady sold for $4,575, with a buyer’s premium. In all, Wagner says he lost $22,000 with the sale of the three items, including what he paid to get them signed.  “I signed a contract saying they would sell my other three items, and I broke the contract,” Wagner said. “My goal was to refund these other guys in full. I didn’t mind getting rid of my stuff to help everyone out. But I couldn’t keep taking that kind of beating.”  As a result, Goldin revoked the bonus. Wagner still has the Brady to Gronkowski Super Bowl ball, a Super Bowl 55 photo-matched game ball, and a game-used ball from the 2000 NFL Hall of Fame Game – Brady’s pro debut.  All the collectors remain baffled by what happened that day.  They wonder why Brady signed the way he did. Nazareth believes Brady didn’t know those items belonged to collectors but might have thought they belonged to the event organizers trying to take advantage of him.  “I think he knew exactly what he was doing,” Nazareth says. “I’ve followed Brady since he was in high school. He’s humble, he’s friendly, I think he genuinely cares about his fan base. The speech he gave for an hour was amazing and it’s stuff like that that makes me love the guy. I think he thought he might’ve been doing it to people who were trying to get one over him. Trust me, I was not trying to get one over him.”  A fan outside of the Watsco Center who did not attend the event was lucky enough to have a football signed with a nice autograph.  The ticket Jarrett was so eager to have signed by Brady is now in a closet, hidden in a bin along with other Brady programs and items. The ticket was sent to JSA for authentication, where three months after being sent, the autograph was authenticated.    “I am planning on holding onto the ticket for right now,” Jarrett says, “but I’m not really sure what I will do with it going forward. I’ve been slowly selling some of my smaller Brady items, but the collectible market is down right now. If I could break even on all my items, I would sell it all.” Wagner wants to know why Brady signed the way he did. He doesn’t want money or anything else signed; he just wants a direct answer.  “I have completely lost every ounce of respect I had for Brady, which is terrible because I was one of the biggest Brady collectors out there,” Wagner said. “I just want the stuff out of my house. I would love to know why he did that. Maybe he wasn’t trying to be an a-hole. I don’t know his side.  “As much as Tom is a celebrity and a GOAT, he’s human. He could’ve lost his temper. Just let us know what happened unless he was really out to get us, which I would find really hard to believe.” Horacio is an educator and writer living in Staten Island, NY.

Sports Collectors Daily,1 of Few Surviving 1919 World Series Rings Consigned to Auction,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/1-of-few-surviving-1919-world-series-rings-consigned-to-auction/,"Sun, 10 Nov 2024 19:21:26 +0000",One of only a few known rings from the Reds-Black Sox World Series of 1919 is making its auction debut after consignment by the family of the Reds' shortstop.,"November 10, 2024 By Rich Mueller  It would become tainted by scandal, but the Cincinnati Reds weren’t about to let a championship go by without honoring those who made it happen.  Now, 105 years after it ended, a 1919 World Series ring has emerged and is on the auction block. Presented to shortstop Larry Kopf, the gold ring with a small diamond in the center, was a late consignment to next weekend’s Louisville Slugger Factory & Museum Auction by the Kopf family.  It’s expected to sell for $25,000-$50,000.   1919 World Series rings were originally created as 14k gold pins and are extremely rare.  Three, including one given to Kopf, were fashioned into rings. Championship rings didn’t become popular until later as they were associated more with women’s apparel at the time.  Kopf’s wife Erma wore the ring for many years and it has some moderate wear.  It has an inset diamond with a baseball field and “1919 World’s Champions” engraving. “The pin façade was then affixed atop a simple gold ring band with the perimeter of the top being slightly shortened and pin back removed during that same process,” Hunt Auctions notes in its auction description.  The Reds’ victory over the Chicago White Sox was an upset.  Gamblers struck a deal with members of the Sox to throw the series but after the deal soured, the Sox attempted to rally. However, the Reds emerged to win the first title in franchise history. Kopf was one of the better shortstops on the era. He played in all eight games of the series, collecting six hits, including a two-run triple in Game 2 and the go-ahead run in Game 4. Embed from Getty Images Hunt calls the ring “one of the most coveted baseball award scarcities of its type with relation to one of the most infamous events in the history of the game.” Bidding is open now and concludes this Saturday, with a live finale at the Louisville Slugger Factory & Museum.

Sports Collectors Daily,Veterans Day: Honoring Athletes Who Served,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/veterans-day-honoring-athletes-who-served/,"Sun, 10 Nov 2024 19:11:02 +0000","A look at a few athletes who put country, duty and honor ahead of sports and the cards we remember them by.","November 10, 2024 By Bob D'Angelo  As the United States honors its military veterans on this Veterans Day, it’s instructive to understand that some very real sacrifices were made by athletes to keep the country free. Some  paid with their lives; others sacrificed the primes of their athletic careers to serve in the military. Some are household names. Willie Mays, Joe DiMaggio and Jackie Robinson come to mind. Hank Greenberg was the first American League player to register for America’s first peacetime draft, taking the oath on May 7, 1941. He was discharged on December 5, 1941, but re-enlisted the following February after Pearl Harbor was attacked two days after his honorable discharge. Greenberg would miss 3 1/2 seasons before returning in 1945. Others athletes have been obscured by history, but are just as important. One who comes to mind is Eddie Grant, one of the few players killed during World War I. The New York Giants had a plaque dedicated to his memory at the Polo Grounds on Memorial Day, 1921. It would take a lengthy series to mention all of those military heroes, but here are just a few: Jack Lummus
 Lummus was a defensive end for the New York Giants. One month after New York lost the NFL’s Eastern Division title to the Chicago Bears, Lummus became an officer in the Marine Corps. Lummus, who also starred collegiately at Baylor, distinguished himself at Iwo Jima in 1945 and received the Congressional Medal of Honor. He continued to fight despite being injured in the shoulder and helped his platoon eliminate fortified enemy positions. He stepped on a land mine, which blew off both his legs. As doctors tried to save him, Lummus was quoted as saying, “Well, doc, the New York Giants lost a mighty good end today.” Lummus was one of 23 NFL players killed during World War II.  He didn’t have any cards during his playing days but Tri-Star’s Obak series has honored him. Yogi Berra He might have been famous for his pithy statements and a stellar baseball career — three American League MVP awards, a 15-time all-star, and catcher/outfielder for 14 pennant winners (and 10 World Series champions) and manager for the 1964 A.L. champion Yankees — but Lawrence Peter Berra saw some major action during World War II. Berra served in the Navy from 1944 to 1945, joining the armed forces as an 18-year-old. He was a gunner’s mate on a landing craft on D-Day, as Allied troops stormed Omaha Beach on the Normandy coast on June 6, 1944. Berra told interviewer Keith Olbermann that the attack “was like the Fourth of July.” “I said, “Boy, it looks pretty, all the planes coming over.” And I was looking out and my officer said, “you better get your head down in here, if you want it on.’” Berra would keep his head and go on to a Hall of Fame baseball career, one that included cards and autographs from 1948-present. Bob Feller “Rapid Robert” won 266 games during his 18 seasons with the Cleveland Indians. He won 20 games six times, including 27 in 1940. He also lost nearly four years of pitching time, enlisting in the Navy the day after Pearl Harbor was attacked in 1941. In the three years leading up to his enlistment, Feller won 24, 27 and 25 games. When he returned from the war he put together 26- and 20-win seasons. It’s fair to say that Feller would have won more than 300 games had World War II not interrupted his career. Feller was signing autographs before a spring training game in Winter Haven, Florida, about a decade ago. One fan told him it was a shame that he lost so many prime seasons to the war effort. Feller didn’t even hesitate. “I’d do it all over again,” he said. Feller was not happy serving in a special physical fitness program. He enrolled in gunnery school and was assigned to the USS Alabama in late 1942. He spent the next 26 months as the Alabama’s chief specialist in charge of a crew that controlled the ship’s anti-aircraft equipment. Feller was involved in several battles in the Pacific, including skirmishes in the Gilbert and Marshall island chains.  He was used in numerous War-era advertising campaigns which are very popular collectibles today and appeared in the ‘Armed Forces’ subset of this year’s Panini Cooperstown set. Rocky Bleier After being drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1968 and playing a season, Bleier was drafted by the U.S. Army and shipped to Vietnam in May 1969. He was part of the 196th Light Infantry Brigade and took a load of shrapnel in his leg during fighting. He was awarded a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star, but doctors told Bleier he’d never play football again. Undaunted, Bleier returned to the Steelers in 1971 and became the blocking back for Franco Harris. He played 130 regular-season games and 10 playoff contests over the next decade and won four rings as a member of Pittsburgh’s four Super Bowl championship teams. Bleier included some Army inscriptions on this rather unique signed Steelers helmet.  His rookie card was in the 1975 Topps set and he appeared in a few others as well. Bob Kalsu He was an All-American offensive tackle in 1967 at Oklahoma, the year the Sooners went 10-1 and beat Tennessee in the Orange Bowl. Bob Kalsu was drafted in 1968 by the Buffalo Bills and by season’s end was voted the team’s rookie of the year. In 1969, he was called to serve in Vietnam, leaving his pregnant wife Jan and 10-month-old daughter Jill.  A 1st lieutenant for the 11th artillery unit of the 101st Airborne unit, Kalsu was killed on July 21, 1970, at the remote Firebase Ripcord in Thua Thien, along with 60 other fellow soldiers. At the time of his death, Kalsu and his unit had been pinned down for weeks by enemy fire. He was the only active NFL player to die in the Vietnam war. Early on July 23, 1970, Jan Kalsu gave birth to a son, named Robert Todd Kalsu. That afternoon, a uniformed Army officer informed the family of the death of Bob Kalsu. Later that night, Jan changed the boy’s name to James Robert Kalsu Jr. In 2000, the Bills added Kalsu’s name to the Wall of Fame at Ralph Wilson Stadium. Kalsu also appears in the Obak sets. Warren Spahn Spahn is the winningest left-handed pitcher in major-league history with 363 victories. He won 2o or more games 13 times and won the Cy Young Award in 1957, receiving 15 out of a possible 16 votes after a 21-11 season. Spahn made his major-league debut with the Boston Braves in 1942, but had no decisions in four games. He spent the next three seasons in the Army with the 276th Engineer Combat Battalion, the 1159th Engineer Combat Group. Spahn’s unit fought in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, and then monitored and protected the flow of traffic over the Ludendorff Bridge — the only bridge spanning the Rhine River that allowed passage into Germany. A staff sergeant, Spahn was injured by shards of shrapnel in his foot as the Germans maintained a steady, daily fire. Spahn was awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart and was promoted to 1st lieutenant. Topps included him in its 2007 Distinguished Service set. Ted Williams  One of major-league baseball’s greatest hitters and the last player to bat .400 in a season, Williams had a career .344 average and hit 521 home runs. He won the Triple Crown in 1942 and ’47 and was a two-time American League MVP. Williams enlisted in the Navy after the 1942 season. His goal was to become a Naval fighter pilot, and by May 1944 he had earned his wings and was commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant. Until June 1945, he served as an instructor with the U.S. Marine Corps reserves. Williams also served a second stint in the military, recall
ed in 1952 and deployed with Marine Aircraft Group 33 to Korea. Williams flew 39 combat missions over Korea before being relieved due to complications from an ear infection. He had missed most of the 1952 and ‘’53 baseball seasons, but returned full time in 1954 and remained with the Red Sox until his retirement after the 1960 season. He homered in his final at-bat, on September 28, 1960. His best cards span three decades. Pat Tillman Tillman would have turned 38 on November 6. He was the first NFL player to be killed in combat since Bob Kalsu in 1970. Tillman is the only player to ever give up a multimillion dollar contract to serve his country, and he did it voluntarily. Tillman turned down a three-year, $3.6 million offer from the Arizona Cardinals after the 2001 season and enlisted in the Army.  He appeared in the 2001 Upper Deck set. Joining the Army Rangers was motivated by the September 11 attacks. Tillman already was an all-pro safety with the Cardinals and was 25 in 2002, entering the prime of his career. He was deployed to Iraq, then was serving in Afghanistan when he was killed by friendly fire on April 22, 2004. After his death, the Pat Tillman Foundation was established, in hopes of inspiring and supporting individuals seeking positive change in themselves and the world. Eddie LeBaron The left-handed “Littlest General” was drafted by the Washington Redskins in 1950. He played two preseason games, then entered the Korean War as a 2nd lieutenant with the Marines. He was wounded twice during his nine-month hitch in Korea and won a Purple Heart. He also won a Bronze Star. LeBaron appears in several 1950s and 60s football sets. Forest K. Ferguson Jr. “Fergie” is the classic case of what could have been. The second All-American in University of Florida history, Ferguson set the pass receiving record at Florida with a 74-yard catch against Miami in 1941. He had received letters from several NFL teams, including the Steelers and Lions, but his mission after graduation was to enlist in the Army. Ferguson distinguished himself at D-Day, helping to blow a gap in the German lines on Omaha Beach. He was mortally wounded that day, halting his athletic career. Ferguson would die from his wounds in 1954, nearly 10 years to the day after the Normandy landings. Florida named an annual award after Ferguson, presenting it to the Gators senior who displays leadership and courage. I don’t believe any cards have been released of Ferguson, but I know of at least one recent book written about him. Bob has been a sportswriter and copy editor for more than 45 years and a blogger for two decades. He is celebrating his 60th year of card collecting, and still counts his 1965 Topps Mickey Mantle as his favorite.  You can reach him at [email protected].

Sports Collectors Daily,1974 WHA Canada-Soviet Summit Series Celebrates 50th Anniversary,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/1974-wha-canada-soviet-summit-series-celebrates-50th-anniversary/,"Fri, 08 Nov 2024 02:31:40 +0000","Bobby Hull, Gordie Howe and others reflect on the 1974 WHA Canada-Soviet series as the ""Forgotten Series"" marks its 50th anniversary.","November 7, 2024 By Jeff Morris  Rick Smith reflected on the 50th anniversary of the second Canada-Soviet hockey series, which took place in the fall of 1974. Like the 1972 Summit Series, the second Canada-Soviet series was an eight-game affair with four games in Canada and then four in Moscow. The difference, however, was that the Canadian team would be comprised of WHA players and not NHL players. Smith, now 76, lives along a big lake near Westport, Ontario, north of Kingston. He makes sure he has a perfect sheet of ice on the lake through the winter, and is out on the blades almost daily. He still participates in alumni events with the Boston Bruins and Ottawa Senators. “It was really exciting to be asked to play for Canada in the series,” Smith said. “It was more than a Canada-Russia thing for us. It was a chance for us to represent the WHA and show that we were on par with the NHL.” Smith won a Stanley Cup with the Boston Bruins in 1970 and was traded to the California Golden Seals in 1972. Bruins goalie Gerry Cheevers jumped to the WHA’s Cleveland Crusaders and thus was left off the 1972 Canadian team, as only NHL players were allowed to participate. Bobby Hull was among the other players left off the 1972 team. Cheevers pushed for Smith to be part of the team, as Smith was a steady defender who was always in position and fundamentally sound. By 1974, Smith was playing for the Minnesota Fighting Saints of the WHA. The bulk of the players on Team Canada were former NHLers who jumped to the new league. Frank Mahovlich, Paul Henderson and Pat Stapleton played in the 1972 series as they were still in the NHL. Gordie Howe and Bobby Hull did not play for Canada in 1972. Hull had jumped to the Winnipeg Jets for hockey’s first million-dollar contract. Howe retired before the 1972 series, but then came out of retirement the following year to join the Houston Aeros of the WHA and play with his sons, Mark and Marty. “I remember the time leading up to the 1972 series, and no one really thought they had a chance against the best players in the NHL,” Howe said during an interview with SCD several years ago. “They were amateurs, and they had won all these world championships, but they had never played actual professionals.” Howe, like every other hockey-loving Canadian, was shocked when the Soviets upset Team Canada 7-3 in the first game. What ensued was the most dramatic and globally important tournament in hockey history. “As the series went on, and the Canadians came together and won the series, all of us watched,” Howe said. “There was no way we could lose that series. It meant to much. All of these players who battled each other night after night for years all came together – the players playing for Canada as well as all of us at home watching on TV. I was 44 years old at the time and thought my hockey career was over, but as the series went on, I wished I was over there and a part of it. I think all of the NHL players watching probably felt the same way.” In 1974, Howe got the opportunity to play in the series with his sons, Mark and Marty. “I wasn’t sure what to expect, but the first time I put that Canada sweater on, it was a special feeling. Then I looked over in the dressing room and I saw Mark and Marty put their sweaters on. I was so proud as a father that my sons were playing for Canada. Getting to play with them for Canada in that series was a feeling I can’t really describe.” Howe was 46 years old in the 1974 series but was still a dominant force, as he had seven goals in seven games. Bobby Hull, meanwhile, was the player the world was watching. He led the tournament with seven goals and two assists for nine points in eight games. “I get asked about the 1976 Canada Cup a lot, and I am often asked about missing the 1972 series,” Hull said in an interview with SCD in the early 2000s. “But I rarely get asked about the 1974 series. “I was not happy about not being able to play in the 1972 series. That’s why I was so happy to get the chance to play for Canada in 1974. We had a very talented team and we were better than people thought we were. The series was not just a chance to play the Russians. It was a chance to show the world that our league was just as good as the NHL.” The feeling was different for Game 1 in 1974 compared to 1972. Hockey fans in Canada knew nothing about the Soviets when the 1972 series began. In 1974, the Soviet stars were household names in Canada. Aside from Howe, Hull, Henderson, Mahovlich and Cheevers, Canada had its share of household names on its roster. John “Pie” McKenzie, Rejean Houle, Ralph Backstrom, Mike “Shakey” Walton, Tom Webster, J.C. Tremblay and Rick Ley were among the stars on the team. Le Colisee in Quebec City only seated a little more than 15,000. There was a lottery in Quebec for the rights to buy tickets. Two million lottery tickets were sold for the rights to those 15,000 tickets. The WHA Team Canada got off to a better start than the 1972 team. Trailing 3-2, Hull scored the tying goal with 5:42 remaining. Canada had a chance to get the win late in the game. “I found Frank Mahovlich with a long pass and sent him in on a breakaway,” Smith recalled. “Unfortunately, Tretiak made the save, and I missed my chance to get on the scoresheet.” Smith did get on the scoresheet in the series, as he led Canada with 14 penalty minutes. Game 2 was played in Toronto, and Canada won 4-1. Game 3 in Winnipeg was won by the Soviets 8-5. In Game 4 in Vancouver, Hull scored three goals in the first period and Canada led 5-2, but the Soviets came back and managed a 5-5 tie. In Game 3, Canadian coach Billy Harris decided to sit some of the star players to let some of the other players get some playing time. Goalie Gerry Cheevers missed the game, as he was at the hospital tending to his father who was seriously ill. Don McLeod took his place. Howe, Mahovlich, Ley, House and Brad Selwood were all scratches for Canada in Game 3 in favor of players got their first taste of action in the series. “That changed everything for us,” Howe said. “We wanted to win. Once we realized that giving everyone ice time was more important than winning, the intensity seemed to disappear for us.” In 1972, some of the players on the roster who had been scratched and did not get playing time quit the team and went home. Harris wanted to avoid that from happened from his team, but he swung the pendulum too far the other way. In Game 4, with their “A” line-up back on the ice, the teams played to a 5-5 tie. Hull scored three goals in the first period, but the Soviets chipped away at Canada’s 5-2 lead. Late in the third period, Alexander Maltsev and Alexander Gusev scored for the Soviets to tie the game. “When I do autograph signings and meet fans, they often talk about their favorite moments of my career,” Hull said. “That hat trick was one of the biggest moments of my career. I scored three goals in one period against one of the greatest teams in the world. Maybe people forgot about it because they came back and tied the game and we didn’t win. No one ever brings that game up, but it is one of the biggest highlights of my career.” Hull and Howe were treated like celebrities and the Soviet hockey fans were warm and welcoming, though there were the usual complaints about accommodations and scheduling. “I wasn’t sure what to expect when we got to Moscow,” Howe recalled. “The fans were great. Even though we were rivals, they were very welcoming and they respected us.” The Soviets won Game 5 3-2, and then the frustrations of the Canadians began to show when they lost Game 6 5-2. “Mark put a big hit on Petrov,” Howe recalled, talking of his son. “Things got pretty heated after that. At the end of that game, Ricky Ley got in a fight with Valeri Kharlamov. He was their biggest star and he was a very good player. Rickey punched him out and Kharlamov’s face was bloodied up.” Kharlamov played at 5’8”, 165 pounds and was the most talented Soviet player. In the 1972 series, Bobby Clark broke Kharlamov’s ankle with a slash. The teams tied 4-4 in Game 7 and the Soviets won Game 8 3-2. Smith recalled that playing with Howe and Hull was a highlight of his career. “I played against those guys for years, but you don’t really get an appreciation for someone like that until you get a chance to be teammates and to paly with them,” he said. While in Ottawa in the 1990s, Tretiak talked openly about the two Summit Series, the Canada Cup, and the Super Series that saw Red Army come to North America to play NHL teams. “We didn’t know what to expect with the WHA team,” Tretiak said. “We knew about Bobby Hull and Gordie Howe, but we had never seen them or played against them. When we saw their roster, we thought they were very old and that they would not be able to keep up with us. “But even though they were older, they were better than we expected. Gordie Howe was still a great player, and bobby Hull was a great goal scorer. I thought that the 1974 team was better and harder to play against than the 1972 team.” The series gave the WHA exposure. While their TV contracts with CBS and CTV did not put a lot of games on the air, some was better than none. “Before the series, we heard everyone talk about Gordie playing with his sons, Paul Henderson playing the Russians again, Cheevers, Mahovlich and myself,” Hull said. “People who followed the series got to see how good Andre Lacroix was, and how good Mark Howe was.” After the series, O-Pee-Chee decided to produce their first WHA exclusive hockey card sets. The first was a 66-card set, while after that, the WHA sets featured 132 cards. But while there were Team Canada inserts in the 1972-73 O-Pee-Chee set, and while there were sets dedicated to the 1972 series and the 1976 Canada Cup, there is very little in the way of cardboard for the 1974 series. The odd retrospective autographed card of Hull, Howe and Cheevers have been produced, but for the most part, there is almost nothing to collect from that series. “I have signed a lot of autographs, photos, pucks and cards – everything,” Hull said. “When I do shows, the promoters always have stacks of 8x10s for fans to get signed. I never see photos from the 1974 series. It’s like they don’t exist.” Hull never called himself a collector, but he did get one special item after the series. “The Russians were great players, and it was a privilege to play against them,” he said. “Alexander Yakushev was their best scorer. After the series, he asked for my autograph, and I asked for his. I always wished some of those guys could have come to North America to play.” Jeff Morris is a hobby veteran who has been a collector for more than 50 years.

The Ecuadorian Football Association announced his death on Tuesday.  Angulo was a passenger in a single-car crash southeast of Quito on Oct. 7 that killed the driver and another passenger. Angulo sustained a head injury and lung contusion and had been put in an artificial coma. He had been on loan from FC Cincinnati to Ecuadorian top-flight side LDU Quito. ""We are deeply saddened by the loss of Marco -- a husband and father, a brother and son, a friend and teammate. He was a joyful, kind young man who lit up every room he entered,"" FC Cincinnati said in a team statement. ""Our entire club grieves this tragedy, and we are thinking of and praying for his family. He was a cherished member of the FC Cincinnati family, and he will be missed."" Angulo joined Cincinnati in December 2022 from Independiente de Valle in Ecuador and was part of Cincinnati's 2023 team that won the Supporters' Shield, paying in 24 matches (nine starts) and posting two assists. He was with LDU Quito the entire 2024 season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

As part of the shakeup, offensive coordinator Shane Waldron was fired on Tuesday. Waldron received a vote of confidence eight days ago after a lopsided 29-9 loss to the Arizona Cardinals, but head coach Matt Eberflus indicated he was resigned to change on Monday.  ""After evaluating our entire operation, I decided that it is in the best interest of our team to move in a different direction with the leadership of our offense,"" Eberflus said in a statement released by the team. ""This decision was well-thought-out, one that was conducted deliberately and respectfully. I would like to thank Shane for his efforts and wish him the best moving forward."" Eberflus selected Waldron as offensive coordinator from a pool that included former Cardinals head coach Kliff Kingsbury. Eberflus was retained as head coach by general manager Ryan Poles in January following a 7-10 season. The present situation isn't entirely unfamiliar to Brown. He is being bumped into the primary play-calling role for the second consecutive season. In 2023, the 38-year-old was promoted by the Carolina Panthers with embattled coach Frank Reich giving Brown the call sheet in an effort to spare his own job and pump life into their rookie No. 1 pick at quarterback, Bryce Young.  The Bears are in a bind with the Packers (6-3) up next as confidence and production bottom out on the heels of three consecutive losses and a three-game streak during which rookie No. 1 pick Caleb Williams has zero touchdown passes.  Eberflus said Monday that Williams was safe as the starting quarterback but pointed to imminent changes around the rookie. Williams and the Bears were dominated by the New England Patriots (3-7) on Sunday. They carry a run of 23 consecutive possessions without a touchdown into Week 11 trying to keep pace with the rest of the NFC North. Eberflus is 0-4 against Green Bay in his first two seasons as Bears head coach and will see the Packers, Lions (8-1) and Vikings (7-2) twice in the final two months of the season.  The Bears have 27 total points during a three-game slide that began with rookie Jayden Daniels' 52-yard, game-winning Hail Mary on Oct. 27.  Chicago produced three points against the Patriots, putting up fewer than 17 points for the fifth time this season. New England sacked Williams nine times one week after the Cardinals posted six sacks against Chicago. Brown, a former NFL running back who broke into coaching under Sean McVay with the Rams, spent nine seasons on college football staffs including three years as Miami (Fla.) running backs coach and offensive coordinator.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Owner Jerry Jones said Prescott is set for surgery Wednesday in New York. Jones said on 105.3 The Fan in Dallas that quarterback Cooper Rush will start Monday's game against the visiting Houston Texans. Trey Lance will serve as the backup while the team is expected to add fellow quarterback Will Grier to the practice squad. Jones provided optimistic news on Prescott having his surgery in New York. ""He had a good visit last night and he wants to do that there, and he's got great medical doctors up there,"" Jones said. ""His prognosis is wonderful, it just means we're not going to have him the rest of the year."" Signed to a four-year, $240 million contract extension in September that made him the highest-paid quarterback in NFL history, Prescott threw for 1,978 yards with 11 touchdowns and eight interceptions in eight games this season.  Prescott, 31, led the NFL in completions (410) and touchdowns (36) last season. He threw for 4,516 yards in 17 games as Dallas finished the regular season 12-5. A three-time Pro Bowl selection, Prescott owns a 76-46 record in 122 career starts since being picked by Dallas in the fourth round of the 2016 NFL Draft. He has thrown for 31,437 yards with 213 touchdowns and 82 interceptions. Rush flopped in his first start of the season on Sunday, one week after Prescott sustained his injury during the third quarter of a 27-21 loss to the Atlanta Falcons.  Rush completed 13 of 26 passes for 45 yards and lost two fumbles as Dallas dropped its fourth straight game, a 34-6 setback to the Philadelphia Eagles.  Rush was replaced in the fourth quarter by Lance, who went 4-for-6 for 21 yards with an interception in his first regular-season action since being acquired by the Cowboys in 2023.   But the Cowboys (3-6) are turning back to Rush for the Monday night game against the Texans (6-4). ""Because Cooper has shown that he has the capability to compete and win games,"" Jones said. ""And he does give us our best chance. Frankly that was really an out-of-character game for him based on what we've seen.""  Rush, 30, has completed 35 of 62 passes for 212 yards and a touchdown in parts of five games this season.  He has completed 59.7 percent of his passes for 1,831 yards with nine touchdowns and six interceptions in 31 career games (seven starts) with Dallas. Grier, 29, had been with the Cowboys in 2021-22 before being released prior to the 2023 season. He completed 28 of 52 passes for 228 yards in two starts during the 2019 season with the Carolina Panthers. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Anybody that gladly took them up on the offer in a game against the Miami Dolphins ended up with indigestion. It was the offense that was supposed to carry the Rams into a new era, but Los Angeles head coach Sean McVay couldn’t get his group over the line in a 23-15 loss Monday. With a fourth consecutive victory there for the taking, the Rams did not score a touchdown behind quarterback Matthew Stafford. Any ideas of rallying from a dreadful 1-4 start and into the playoffs have been put on pause with the current 4-5 record. Stafford has played 50 regular-season games with the Rams. He has now failed to orchestrate a touchdown drive in just two of them. “It was a little bit of this and a little bit of that,” Stafford said of the team’s issues on offense. “We did some really good things and weren’t good enough in some areas. I would say that we were inconsistent.” The Rams were supposed to be about the offense this season, and if anybody wondered why, they just needed to look toward the stands Monday. All-superhero defensive tackle Aaron Donald was in attendance to watch his former teammates, looking as chiseled as ever in retirement. A young Los Angeles defense was supposed to go through growing pains this season, and the offense, filled with elite skill players, was set to move things forward. Well, if Donald was impressed with any group, it was with his former defense. Miami won with just 238 yards of total offense, well below the Rams’ 327 yards. The Dolphins got the job done despite just 208 yards passing and an interception from Tua Tagovailoa. So while the Rams have Stafford, wide receivers Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp and running back Kyren Williams, there is a new group of players looking for top billing. Edge rusher Byron Young and defensive tackle Kobie Turner played as rookies alongside Donald in his final season. Edge rusher Jared Verse and defensive tackle Braden Fiske were drafted after Donald announced that his playing days were done. The Rams already had a Fearsome Foursome in the 1960s, and while this base defense is not the same as that one, the current young group can still be known as the Ferocious Foursome as it continues to progress. Can the Rams still make the playoffs? The loss Monday gave them a playoff probability of 13 percent. Just another sign of their bad luck. Los Angeles built hopes after a rough start that was mostly due to a flood of injuries on offense, including Nacua and Kupp, not to mention multiple starters on the offensive line. But center Jonah Jackson, left guard Steve Avila and right tackle Joe Noteboom all came off injured reserve to play this week, and yet Stafford was hurried all night by a Dolphins defensive front that had underperformed this season. Stafford was sacked four times, while Nacua and Kupp combined for 16 receptions, but none for TDs. It was just one loss, and yet it seems inevitable that some kind of change is ahead for the Rams. After all, Kupp was rumored to be a trade possibility, and then the deadline passed with him still in Los Angeles. The reality is that the front office has signaled they are willing to look at any and all options to build a brighter future. For all that McVay has done in eight seasons as a head coach, he has yet to develop his own quarterback. Stafford is signed through 2026, with no indications the Rams are anywhere near moving away from their star. But he won’t play forever. In a season like this one—with games still remaining against the Philadelphia Eagles, Buffalo Bills, San Francisco 49ers and the first-place Arizona Cardinals—there is a hunger to know what happens next. “There was some execution that has to be better,” McVay said of his offense that he agreed was 'sloppy.’ “These are the things we have to clean up if we want to be the type of (effective) team from an offensive perspective.” The Rams are just 1.5 games behind the suddenly-hot Cardinals in the NFC West and a game behind the second-place 49ers. Hope remains. But as Monday showed, it’s best to be careful about what is on the menu. Copyright 2024"

Just two months ago, the NFL world was encouraging Tagovailoa to retire after watching him curl his fingers while down on the turf following a shot to the head during a 31-10 loss to the Buffalo Bills back on September 12.  It was the third confirmed concussion that Tagovailoa has had at the professional level, and it sidelined him for four games. Tagovailoa vowed not to wear a Guardian Cap upon his return. He stuck to his word, which was all well and good, assuming that he would make some playstyle changes to get himself out of harm’s way.  So much for that. After being picked off in the second quarter of a 23-15 win over the Rams on Monday night, Tagovailoa tried to bring down Los Angeles linebacker Christian Rozeboom, who had come down with the interception. Rozeboom was running along the sideline on his return when Tagovailoa lowered his shoulder and took a knee to the side of the head. The Miami signal-caller ended up being just fine, even sharing a few light moments with reporters following the game when asked about the tackle. “I went up to that dude that intercepted me and asked him, ‘Like bro, you couldn’t (of) just ran out of bounds or like cut back?’ … He told me after the game, he’s like, ‘There’s no room, there was nowhere else to go,’” Tagovailoa said. “He gotta do what he gotta do to help his team win games. “I wasn’t planning on using my head to go hit him, so.” Throughout his explanation of how things went down, Tagovailoa couldn’t stop smiling, even laughing at times—because what could possibly be funnier than another traumatic brain injury, right?  Dolphins coaches need to start getting some of the blame here, too. To continuously let Tagovailoa go out there and throw himself headfirst at opposing defenses is just plain irresponsible.  It needs to be made clear to Tagovailoa that he quite literally cannot suffer another concussion. Not only would that one likely be career-ending, but it could also be life-altering, both mentally and physically. Surely these conversations have been had—or at least we hope that’s the case—but it looks like the message still hasn’t gotten through. Something tells us we haven’t seen Tagovailoa get knocked out for the last time. The saddest part? No one is going to intervene. Miami isn’t going to bench the 26-year-old, and the NFL certainly isn’t going to step in. For a league that says it cares so much about the health of its players, here’s a chance to possibly save one, and all it’s going to do is look the other way. We obviously hope Tagovailoa cleans up his game in such a way that will prevent a major head injury from ever happening again. But when he—and everyone else around him—seemsly embraces recklessness, it feels like another disaster is bound to happen.

After missing the preseason and first nine games of the regular season, Joel Embiid is set to suit up for the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday for the first time in 2024-25. That’s arguably the greatest area of intrigue at the dawn of the NBA Cup, an in-season tournament that will contest group play on Tuesdays and Fridays from today through Dec. 3 to decide an elimination bracket later that month. We look at the start of the event as well as a showdown between NHL Eastern Conference contenders and a juicy piece of college football MACtion. Let’s go. Embiid may have returned sooner from a left knee injury, but he racked up a three-game suspension for shoving a Philadelphia Inquirer columnist. The transgression? Name-dropping Embiid’s son and late brother in a column, calling into question his ability to stay in shape. Now the star center gets the chance to take out frustration on a Knicks team that eliminated Philly from the playoffs last season. Embiid likely will be on a minutes restriction, but his track record for efficiency and the struggling Sixers’ urgency could equal instant contribution. Limited to 39 games last season due to injury, Embiid shot 52.9 percent—including 38.8 percent from deep—while averaging a career-best 34.7 points.

The defending Stanley Cup champion Panthers have won seven straight and their 23 points are one clear of the Devils for tops in the Eastern Conference. New Jersey was blanked for the second time in five games during Sunday’s 1-0 home loss to San Jose, unable to solve former Devil Mackenzie Blackwood in a 44-save shutout. The Panthers needed a shootout to defeat the visiting Philadelphia Flyers on Saturday, the first time in their current tear that they didn’t prevail by at least two goals.

The usually purple-clad Huskies (5-5, 3-4) instead will don black uniforms, and fans are also encouraged to wear black. ""Some great uniforms coming out,"" Washington coach Jedd Fisch said. ""So excited about that."" The Huskies this season have played in a black-out at Rutgers (Sept. 27), a stripe-out at Iowa (Oct. 12) and a red-out at Indiana (Oct. 26) before last Saturday's white-out. They lost all of those games, although they are 5-0 at Husky Stadium. Washington likely needs to defeat UCLA to become bowl eligible as its last game of the regular season is Nov. 30 at No. 1 Oregon. The Huskies have had a short turnaround after not getting back to Seattle until 5 a.m. Sunday following their game at Penn State. ""Short week, a little bit of a cram session,"" Fisch said. ""But as I told the staff, ‘Sleep Saturday.'"" Quarterback Will Rogers is expected to start against UCLA after getting benched at halftime last weekend for Demond Williams Jr.  ""Will was a victim of circumstances, a little bit,"" Fisch said. ""He was 10-for-13 in the first half, just we weren't able to get anything going."" The Bruins have won three in a row, including a 20-17 decision against visiting Iowa last Friday. They have games remaining against rival Southern California and Fresno State as they try to qualify for a bowl game. The win over the Hawkeyes was UCLA's first in four tries at the Rose Bowl this season. ""I didn't want to make too big of a deal about us being back home, but we kind of treated this game like a road game,"" Bruins coach Deshaun Foster said. ""I just think my guys, they came out and they earned the right to win. Just in how they practiced (last) week and I think as long as we continue to do that, this team can really just take off."" UCLA quarterback Ethan Garbers started his collegiate career at Washington in 2020 -- he was named the Huskies' offensive scout squad MVP -- before transferring to Westwood the next year.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Louisiana won its most recent game, however the Ragin' Cajuns coach wasn't totally satisfied. Both teams are focused on early-season improvement ahead of their game Wednesday night in Houston. Houston (1-1) dropped to No. 8 in the Associated Press Top 25 poll after a 74-69 home loss to then-No. 11 Auburn last Saturday. The Cougars opened the season with a 97-40 victory against outmanned Jackson State, prompting coach Kelvin Sampson to say that he wanted his team to be challenged in its second game. ""This team needed to be tested,"" Sampson said. ""That's why we scheduled the game. You have wins and losses, but you also have wisdom and learning. This was a learning night for us."" Sampson said his team had its lofty ranking because of its ""rebounding and transition defense."" But those areas weren't advantages against the lengthy and athletic Tigers. Auburn outscored Houston 14-10 in fast-break points, including a 12-3 edge while it outscored the Cougars 46-36 in the second half. The teams each had 33 rebounds. ""We got exposed in some areas that we've got to go back and figure out how we can get better and clean up some things,"" Sampson said. ""This is a great learning tool for us. We weren't very good offensively in a lot of ways, but their defense had a lot to do with that. ""We hope we can learn from a loss to a really good team. There is no shame on our side."" J'Wan Roberts was one of five Houston players to score in double figures. He finished with 12 points along with seven rebounds. ""I don't think this game defines our season,"" Roberts said. ""When we look at the film there's a lot of stuff we've got to work on to try and get better for the next game."" The next game is against Louisiana (1-1), which defeated visiting UT Dallas 82-65 last Thursday. ""We showed some inconsistency,"" Ragin' Cajuns coach Bob Marlin said. ""It's a learning process.

Marlin said his team had too many unforced errors among its 14 turnovers and he was ""really disappointed"" in its 3-point shooting (4 of 21). ""We've got to do a better job of shooting the ball,"" Marlin said, but he added that his team's shortcomings were overcome by preventing its opponent from taking full advantage. UT Dallas, which made 7 of 28 3-pointers, turned the ball over 24 times and Louisiana had a 30-9 advantage in points off turnovers. ""(The Ragin' Cajuns) are disappointed because they know they're better than they played,"" Marlin said, ""but we're still growing as a team."" The game against Houston will be a far greater challenge for Louisiana, which opened the season with a 70-66 home loss to Kent State on Nov. 4. ""We'll learn more when we go to Houston,"" Marlin said. ""It'll be a super tough game. They're one of the most physical teams in the country, if not the most physical."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

UConn coach Danny Hurley said he will be looking for a better effort than the one his team put forth in Saturday night's 92-53 victory over New Hampshire. The Huskies (2-0) held just an 11-point halftime lead in that game.   ""I said to those guys in the locker room, ‘You won by 39 points, but the reality of the situation is that game was below brand for us for a considerable amount of time,'"" Hurley said. ""The standard is high here. That was clearly a below-standard performance for us in a number of ways, in particular on-ball defense. ... I thought there were some good things, but for the most part it was a frustrating game.   ""We've got some young guys who are gonna get better defensively who right now are not good defensive players. These games early in the year are important to learn lessons and develop and get better.""   Senior forward Alex Karaban has led the Huskies in scoring in each of their first two games. He had 20 points in a 92-56 season-opening victory against Sacred Heart and 17 versus New Hampshire. He's averaging 5.5 assists and 5.5 blocks per game.   ""Alex is playing the way a Big East Player of the Year is supposed to be playing from a statistical standpoint, an efficiency standpoint, but he's also been super vocal and doing everything we want him to do right now,"" Hurley said.    Le Moyne (1-2) is in its second season as a Division I program. The Dolphins moved from Division II to the Northeast Conference before last season. Le Moyne opened its season with an 86-82 loss to Syracuse and a 97-75 setback to Cal State Northridge before rebounding to record a 107-73 victory over Division III SUNY Poly on Saturday.   Injuries have prevented Le Moyne from having its complete team available for a game this season. Guard AJ Dancler missed the Dolphins' first two games, and guard Robby Carmody -- who began his career at Notre Dame -- played in the loss to Syracuse but has missed the past two games with a leg injury. In addition, fifth-year guard Darrick Jones Jr. missed the Syracuse game, but came off the bench against Northridge.   ""At the end of the day we have to do a better job defensively and we know that,"" Le Moyne coach Nate Champion said following Saturday's win. ""We have to continue to get better as a team defensively and buy-in to that mindset.   ""(UConn is) a really good team. Hopefully we'll be ready to go. Hopefully we can perform at a high level again.""   Dwayne Koroma, a 6-foot-8 forward who started his career at Iona after being recruited by Rick Pitino, led the Dolphins with 17 points and six rebounds against SUNY Poly.    ""I think we're building the right culture here,"" Koroma said. ""I think we have a super-selfless group of guys. Everybody plays for each other.   ""A lot of (people) didn't expect us to have the performance we had against Syracuse, either. It doesn't matter if we're banged up or not, we're going to play as hard as we can and try to come out with a win.""   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

After Vancouver's most recent outing, which continued the club's home-ice struggles, the Canucks could use it. Lekkerimaki, who was selected 15th overall in that draft, will be counted on to provide some of the scoring punch lost with Brock Boeser on the shelf due to a suspected concussion.  Lekkerimaki, 20, collected five goals and two assists in seven games for Abbotsford of the American Hockey League before being summoned. He practiced on a line with J.T. Miller and Pius Suter on Monday. ""I'm not nervous right now, but probably get (nervous) the same day or a few hours before the game,"" Lekkerimaki said. ""I will just try to play my game. But at the same time, the first NHL game is special, so try to enjoy it, too. Just have fun and enjoy every second, on and off the ice."" The Canucks, who have only one win in six home games (1-2-3), saw their three-game winning streak snapped by a 7-3 thrashing from the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday. Struggling forward Elias Pettersson registered his first multi-point performance of the season with one goal and one assist. The Canucks likely will turn to goaltender Arturs Silovs, who had some mop-up duty after Kevin Lankinen surrendered all seven goals. ""We wanted to get him in a game and we'll go from there,"" coach Rick Tocchet said.  The Flames arrive after skating to a 3-1 win over the Los Angeles Kings at home on Monday night. ""There was a lot of good from a lot of players. There's not a lot I can be overly critical of. It was a pretty solid 60 minutes,"" coach Ryan Huska said. Goaltender Dustin Wolf turned in a sparkling 28-save performance. His shutout bid was quashed in the final minutes, but the victory was a solid effort through the lineup. ""I think everyone, as a whole, just shut them down,"" Wolf said. ""Any chances they had, I was able to see, for the most part. I'm just trying to help keep pucks out of our net and if we score one more than they do, then we're going to be in pretty good hands."" The Flames finished a three-game Eastern road swing before returning home to face the Kings. While it will be a mean feat to rack up another victory on the West Coast, Calgary did show the blueprint in beating the Kings. The Flames controlled play from the start, were rewarded offensively and continued to hold momentum with a patient game that included a smart forecheck. ""We needed to start on time and be all over them, and that's what we did. Doing that all over them wears them down,"" forward Jonathan Huberdeau said. ""Scoring two quick goals and taking advantage (of the first period edge in play), we deserved it the way we were working. We needed to capitalize, and that's what we did, and after that, we didn't look back."" Calgary won the first meeting of the season between the Pacific Division rivals, a 6-5 overtime clash to open the season, in a game in which the Flames trailed 3-0 midway through the first period.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Dallas, which entered Monday with just 39 goals in 13 games, feasted on the league's third-worst scoring defense. The Stars' six-goal first period tied the then-Minnesota North Stars, who also scored six in the first 20 minutes in a 7-2 win over the Los Angeles Kings on March 16, 1971. The half-dozen goals that got past Joel Blomqvist and Alex Nedeljkovic on just 12 shots were also the most Pittsburgh ever allowed in the first period at home. Five Stars players recorded two or more points in the barrage, with Marchment (one goal, three assists) tying a team record with four points in one period. That occurred 10 times previously, with Tyler Seguin and Valeri Nichushkin both accomplishing the feat most recently against Philadelphia on Dec. 7, 2013. Canadiens 7, Sabres 5 Montreal outlasted host Buffalo with two-goal efforts from Cole Caufield and Nick Suzuki, while Suzuki added two assists and Juraj Slafkovsky tallied three assists. Caufield helped put an end to the Canadiens' six-game losing skid as he struck on the power play with 7:02 left in the third period to record his second goal of the contest and the eventual game-winner.

Utah (2-0) not only has opened the season with a pair of wins, but the Utes are hitting a bevy of 3-point shots. Utah drained 19 3-pointers in each of its first two games, a 100-59 blowout of Alcorn State and a 98-63 rout of Central Arkansas. ""I'm proud of how we've been able to adapt and adjust to get through these two games,"" Utes coach Craig Smith said. ""It feels like we're very connected on both sides and ... we've clearly started communicating at a much higher level as a team."" The Utes are leading the nation in 3-point makes per game as well as 3-point attempts per game (44.0) and are 17th nationally in scoring (99 ppg). In the Central Arkansas win, guard Gabe Madsen eclipsed the 1,000-point mark for his Utah career. Madsen is averaging 26 points per game in the young season. His twin brother, Mason, a transfer from Boston College, is adding 15.0 ppg. Queens (2-0) is also off to a strong start. Coach Grant Leonard's Royals were picked ninth in the preseason poll of the Atlantic Sun, which is a 12-team league. Their leading scorer is guard Asjon Anderson at 16 ppg. Queens is 0-3 all-time against power conference foes, with defeats against Nebraska, Clemson and Duke. Leonard has spoken positively of his young team's offensive execution. ""This year, we're way far ahead of where we've been in years past,"" he said. ""But I think it's just because we're learning to do it better."" Queens will travel to BYU for a second game in two days on Wednesday.

The transfer from Indiana State is averaging 20 points in his first two games with Xavier, scoring 21 and 19 points in two home wins. Jackson State is playing its third straight road game to open the season and will be looking for its first win after falling to High Point 80-71 on Saturday. While Xavier has improved its offensive rebounding since the first 20 minutes of its season, it is trying to do the same with its 3-point defense. The Musketeers surrendered six offensive rebounds that turned into 10 second-chance points in the first half of their opener against Texas Southern, falling behind by as many as nine points. Since that point, Xavier has won the rebounding battle 45-38, allowing only 11 second-chance points. The problem for Xavier has been its defense against the 3-point shot. Texas Southern and IU Indy went a combined 24 of 51 from beyond the arc. IU Indy drained 14 of its 28 shots from long distance Friday as Xavier struggled to put the Jaguars away. ""We have to get better on our end defending the 3-point shot,"" Xavier coach Sean Miller said. ""We have to fix the leak in the roof and be better in that area. When you give up 14 of 28 from three, that's a concern."" After getting blown out 97-40 at No. 4 Houston in its season opener Nov. 4, Jackson State rebounded with a more respectable effort on the road at High Point, N.C., on Saturday. The Tigers trailed by as many as 23 with 3:33 remaining in the first half before outscoring High Point 52-38 the rest of the way. The Tigers outscored the Panthers 26-20 in the paint as Romelle Mansel led Jackson State with 22 points and Jayme Mitchell Jr. added 18 off the bench.

The Bulldogs tout a program record, to boot. As a Tuesday visit from Southeastern Louisiana looms, Mississippi State has scored at least 95 points in consecutive games to begin the season for the first time in school history. Five Bulldogs scored in double figures during a 101-66 rout of Georgia State on Friday. In that contest, three players made their first career starts for Mississippi State, which is growing in a new philosophy under third-year coach Chris Jans. ""I want our team to play and get great shots and put pressure on the defense and score early when we can,"" Jans said. ""But on the other end, if we don't turn them over, I want them to have to go all the way to the shot=clock (buzzer) and work for open looks. ""The difference in length of possessions offensively and defensively is way more important to me than when people talk about what our pace is."" The Bulldogs drilled 10 3-pointers against Georgia State while boasting a 54-24 scoring edge in the paint. Josh Hubbard scored a team-high 15 points and Riley Kugel followed with 14. Hubbard, who shot 3-for-6 from long range, has made at least one 3-pointer in 15 straight games. Tuesday marks the second game of a 10-game road trip for Southeastern Louisiana. A 14-0 run in the first half at UAB on Sunday helped the Lions take a 10-point lead, but they couldn't hold the momentum. The Blazers responded with a 12-1 run to close the half en route to a 82-72 victory. Jakevion Buckley sparked Southeastern Louisiana (1-1) with 16 points and freshman Jeremy Elyzee posted his first career double-double, contributing 14 points and 10 rebounds. The Lions blasted visiting William Carey, an NAIA school, 91-53 on Nov. 4 but aren't set to return home until Dec. 20 against Loyola New Orleans. ""This is what we want,"" Southeastern Louisiana coach David Kiefer said. ""If we are trying (to) beat the best, we have to go on the road."" Mississippi State leads the all-time series 18-1.

The Horned Frogs and Bobcats had a triple-overtime thriller in their last meeting on Nov. 24, 2009, with TCU prevailing 108-99. TCU (2-0) has improved its program significantly since then, as it has made it to the NCAA Tournament in each of the previous three seasons under Jamie Dixon. TCU is hoping to make a fourth straight with wins over Florida A&M and Florida Gulf Coast already under its belt.  The Horned Frogs have become consistent winners early in seasons, too, posting a 53-6 record in the month of November since the 2014-15 campaign. TCU's offense shined in its season-opening victory over Florida A&M (105-59), while the defense received much of the credit in its 67-51 victory over Florida Gulf Coast. ""We found a way to get it done defensively, rebounding-wise, got all of our defensive goals, our standards, so that's a good sign,"" Dixon said after the victory over Florida Gulf Coast. ""Offensively, just not very good early and it wasn't like missing shots. It's just (that) our decision-making wasn't great."" Sophomore guard Vasean Allette has come off the bench to lead the Horned Frogs in scoring in each of the first two games, averaging 17.0 points per contest. For Texas State (2-0), this will be its first road game of the season. The Bobcats went 5-11 on the road last year. Sophomore guard Kaden Gumbs has led the team in scoring the first two games, scoring 15 points against Eastern Michigan and 27 points against McMurry. Guard Drue Drinnon is another player to watch and is an outside threat, knocking down five 3-pointers in the last game against McMurry. As a team, Texas State improved its field-goal percentage from 41.7 against Eastern Michigan to 56.7 vs. McMurry. Asked about the improvement on offense, Bobcats coach Terrence Johnson said, ""It's a good pass, which is usually going to be a good shot.

The Longhorns bounced back from a season-opening loss to Ohio State in Las Vegas with an empathic 90-59 home win over Houston Christian on Friday. Johnson led the way for Texas with 28 points and now has racked up a combined 57 points in his first two collegiate games. Texas (1-1) never trailed against Houston Christian. The Longhorns were up by seven at halftime but roared out of the break, scoring the first 12 points of the second half as part of a 24-2 run to begin the second half. Johnson hit two 3-pointers and had 10 points in that pivotal spurt while Texas' defense held the visitors to 2-of-12 shooting over the first nine minutes of the half and won its 23rd consecutive home-opening game. ""We were able to get out and play to our strengths, which is to get out, play fast in transition, put pressure on the basket and let our guys get a chance to play a little bit in open space,"" Texas coach Rodney Terry said afterward. Arthur Kaluma added 15 points, Chendall Weaver had 12, Jordan Pope scored 11, and Kadin Shedrick and Jayson Kent hit for 10 points each for the Longhorns  in Friday's victory. Texas is still without guard Tramon Mark, who has missed the first two games with an ankle injury and has no specific timeline for a return. Johnson continues to wow, as expected for the presumptive one-and-done guard. He said the team's intense summer workouts have helped him adapt quickly to the college game. ""I feel like my adjustments have mainly been in practice, working against other good players, older players,"" Johnson said. ""It's just been playing off my teammates, letting it come to me, and shooting the open shot."" Johnson is 21 of 38 from the floor and 10 of 18 from 3-point range over his first two games. By comparison, former Texas one-and-done player Kevin Durant scored 20 and 21 points, respectively, in his first two collegiate contests. ""Tre is one of those guys that I think every game, every day, he's just getting better and better,"" Terry explained. ""It's really about developing a pro mentality."" Chicago State (0-2) heads to Austin after an 80-60 loss at home to Youngstown State on Saturday. The Cougars, who play in the Northeast Conference after two seasons as an independent, dropped their season opener 79-72 at Loyola Chicago on Nov. 4. Gabe Spinelli led Chicago State with 15 points in Saturday's setback while Jalen Forrest had 11 and Saxby Sunderland and Cam Jernigan added 10 points each. The Cougars were within a point of the lead after a back-and-forth first 28 minutes before surrendering a 15-2 run to Youngstown that all but decided the game.

Hamilton joked that he didn't want to discuss the Colonels' next opponent, Clemson. ""Let's just talk about ETSU right now,"" Hamilton said. Reality comes Tuesday when Eastern Kentucky (2-0) plays at Clemson (2-0), which is coming off an appearance in the NCAA Tournament Elite Eight last spring. In its strong start, with wins over two mid-majors, Clemson has yet to trail. In the Tigers' 88-62 win on Friday over Saint Francis (Pa.), Ian Schieffelin had 16 points and 13 rebounds while Jaeden Zackery delivered 16 points, six assists and four steals. Zackery, who averaged double-figure scoring for each of the past three years at Boston College, has excelled at both ends of the floor. On Friday, when Clemson coach Brad Brownell said he thought his team ""had some guys that just didn't play quite as hard,"" he also singled out Zackery for his effort. ""Jaeden Zackery was terrific all night,"" Brownell said. ""I thought his on-ball defense was really good."" Zackery's presence at the point has allowed backcourt mate Chase Hunter to focus on scoring. Hunter leads the Tigers with an average of 15 points per game, hitting 57.9 percent from the floor and 5 of 9 from beyond the arc (55.6 percent). Eastern Kentucky counters with its top scorer, George Kimble III, a transfer from Division II Eckerd College, who is averaging 18 points and 4.5 assists per game. Jordan Crawford, a transfer from College of Charleston, is averaging 14.5 points per game. Devontae Blanton, who entered the year 12th on the school's all-time scoring list, is putting up 14 points, 5.5 rebounds and five assists per game. As Eastern Kentucky awaits the renovation of its home arena, the Colonels are playing a heavy road schedule. Of their first 15 games, only four are at their alternate home gym, 13 miles south at Berea College. ""We gotta go on the road,"" Hamilton said. ""We gotta be tough. We gotta be together.

Jack Eichel had a goal and an assist and Ivan Barbashev also scored for Vegas, which had a franchise-record-tying eight-game home winning streak snapped. Adin Hill stopped 17 of 21 shots before being replaced by Akira Schmid, who finished with 12 saves in his Golden Knights debut. Carolina took a 1-0 lead at the 4:24 mark of the first period when Robinson, stationed in front of the crease, redirected Sean Walker's point shot through Hill's pads for his fourth goal of the season. Kotkaniemi made it 2-0 at 12:46 of the period when he roofed in a rebound of his own shot at the end of a three-on-two rush for his second goal of the campaign.  The Hurricanes extended their lead to 3-0 early in the second period when Staal scooped up a turnover in the high slot and drilled a one-timer in off the crossbar for his second goal this season, with this one coming short-handed.  Jost extended the lead to 4-0 a few minutes later, as Jaccob Slavin's blast from the left point caromed in off Jost's leg and went inside the near post. Vegas coach Bruce Cassidy then pulled Hill for Schmid. Eichel made it 4-1 at the 6:11 mark of the third period with his fifth goal of 2024-25.

Syracuse hasn't played since its season opener Nov. 4, when the Orange overcame an eight-point second-half deficit to edge visiting LeMoyne 86-82. Colgate last played Saturday, when the Raiders never led in a 73-56 loss to host Drexel. Syracuse, which was picked to finish 11th in the 18-team Atlantic Coast Conference under second-year head coach Adrian Autry, fended off Le Moyne's upset bid despite shooting just 43.1 percent (31 of 72) from the field, including 18.2 percent (4 of 22) from 3-point land. The performance from the field was the worst for Syracuse since Feb. 17, when the Orange shot 36.7 percent (22 of 60) overall and 16 percent (4 of 25) from beyond the arc in a 65-60 loss to Georgia Tech. Le Moyne shot 49.1 percent overall (28 of 57) against the Orange, including 36 percent (9 of 25) from beyond the arc. ""We're going to focus on everything -- we've got a long way to go,"" Autry said. ""We're just a work in progress still. We've got a lot of work to do."" Colgate (1-1), which has won four straight Patriot League titles and was picked to finish first in the 10-team conference under 14th-year head coach Matt Langel, endured even deeper struggles on both ends of the floor against Drexel. The Raiders shot 33 percent (20 of 60) from the field, including 16 percent (4 of 25) from beyond the arc. Drexel drained 42.9 percent of its attempts (24 of 56) and finished 43.3 percent (13 of 30) from 3-point land.

UCLA committed 15 giveaways on Monday but offset them with its stifling defense.  The Bruins converted Boston University's turnovers into 36 points. UCLA also dominated the interior, outscoring the Terriers 34-10 in the paint.  Stefanovic went 3-for-5 from 3-point range on a night UCLA collectively struggled from beyond the arc, going just 5-for-22 as a team. Sebastian Mack chipped in 12 points for the Bruins. Mack was a player Cronin specifically mentioned as someone who struggled offensively against New Mexico. Mack responded by committing no turnovers against the Terriers.  Boston University (0-3) was 6-for-24 from long distance, led by its only double-figure scorer, Kyrone Alexander. Alexander made 2 of 6 triples en route to 10 points. The Terriers were not much more successful inside the 3-point arc, going 8-for-22 on 2-point field-goal attempts. With its inability to get good looks from inside, Boston University also failed to get to the free-throw line often.  The Terriers attempted nine foul shots, making six.

After a season-opening 97-64 win over Indiana State on Nov. 4, the Owls blasted NAIA foe Coastal Georgia 99-49 on Friday. With Florida Atlantic coming to town, Dawkins is trying to focus on building team chemistry since 11 newcomers are on the UCF roster this season. Among the fresh faces is former UTSA guard Jordan Ivy-Curry, who went for 18 points against Purdue Fort Wayne. George Mason transfer Keyshawn Hall had 14 points and 12 boards in the victory, while true freshman Moustapha Thiam chipped in 13 points and six rebounds. ""I'm still learning about these guys.

""When you have that many new players, I'm still learning about what they're like in games."" Jakus can relate, as the Owls lost 10 players from last season's 25-win team. Jackson State transfer Ken Evans Jr. and Louisville transfer Kaleb Glenn scored 18 points apiece against Coastal Georgia. Florida Atlantic has outrebounded opponents 98-62 through its first two games, but the Owls realize that the Knights pose quite the challenge on the glass. ""UCF is a very big team.

Florida State's depth and defense, which have been staples of coach Leonard Hamilton's most successful teams, were on display as nine players got on the scoresheet and 12 received playing time. The Seminoles' defense totaled nine steals and seven blocks while scoring 23 points off Rice's 17 turnovers.

Nashville defenseman Brady Skeji had the puck just inside the blueline in the Colorado zone but lost an edge. Girard took the puck, skated in on Juuse Saros ahead of Skeji and scored over Saros' blocker to win it. It was his first goal of the season, and he also added an assist on the night. Mikko Rantanen and Devon Toews also scored and Alexandar Georgiev turned away 29 shots for the Avalanche, who have won two in a row. Luke Evangelista and Colton Sissons scored for the Predators and Saros finished with 29 saves. Georgiev allowed an early goal for the second straight game but then kept Nashville off the board for the next two periods. The Predators got that goal 1:45 during a delayed penalty. Juuso Parssinen took a shot from the point that Georgiev stopped but Evangelista scooped the rebound and tapped it in for his second goal of the season. It stayed that way until the second period. Four seconds after Nashville killed off Zachary L'Heureux's minor, Toews took a shot from the point that deflected off a Predators stick and by Saros at 4:32. It was the first goal of the season for Toews. The Avalanche took the lead midway through the second when Joel Kiviranta had the puck at the top of the slot, passed it to Rantanen in the right circle, and his one-timer beat Saros to the short side at 11:37. It was his ninth of the season and the second straight game with a goal. Nashville tied it up in the first minute of the final period. Roman Josi stole the puck at the Colorado blueline, skated into the zone and fed Sissons with a pass to the side of the crease. Sissons slid it into a wide-open net at 59 seconds. It was his second of the season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The 54-year-old Boston native was joined in the Class of 2024 by ex-NHL players Pavel Datsyuk and Shea Weber, women's stars Natalie Darwitz and Krissy Wendell-Pohl, and executives Colin Campbell and David Poile. Roenick composed himself at the start of his speech before saying, ""I love this game. It's been such a huge part of my life for most of my life and this is the best way I can finally find to end this chapter of my life."" Roenick compiled a total of 513 goals with 703 assists with the Chicago Blackhawks (1988-89 to 1995-96), the Phoenix Coyotes (1996-97 to 2000-01 and 2006-07), the Philadelphia Flyers (2001-02 to 2003-04), the Los Angeles Kings (2005-06) and the San Jose Sharks (2007-08 and 2008-09). Only Brett Hull, Mike Modano and Keith Tkachuk scored more goals in the NHL than Roenick among U.S.-born players. Datsyuk, a 46-year-old Russian, spent all 14 seasons of his NHL seasons with the Detroit Red Wings. He logged 918 points (314 goals, 604 assists) and was part of Stanley Cup-winning sides in 2002 and 2008. Datsyuk also captured an Olympic gold medal in 2018 and was a four-time recipient of the Lady Byng Trophy, given for gentlemanly conduct. ""As I stand here today, I realize that being inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame is tremendous honor, the honor I couldn't even dream of, but this moment is not mine alone. It is shared with all of you,"" Datsyuk said Monday. Weber, a 39-year-old British Columbia native, played with the Nashville Predators from 2005-06 to 2015-16 and then with the Montreal Canadiens from 2016-17 to 2020-21. The defenseman posted 589 points (224 goals, 365 assists) in the NHL and won gold with Canada in 2010 and 2014. ""I want to thank all those players who demonstrated the importance of hard work and dedication,"" Weber said Monday. ""By passing on your knowledge to the next generation, you're ensuring that the spirit of this game continues to thrive. ""It's also when the coaches and staff teach you the nuances of the game. They challenge you to get better every day."" Darwitz notched the winning goal for Minnesota in the 2005 NCAA championship game against Harvard. She played for the United States at the 2002, 2006 and 2010 Olympics. ""I wasn't your everyday little girl, and somehow my mom was on to me,"" Darwitz said Monday. ""Despite some obvious distraction techniques on her part, in the name of tap dancing classes and shopping trips, she knew where my heart was, and on my fifth birthday, my blonde French braid strolled into the hockey rink."" Wendell-Pohl, another Golden Gophers great, captured the Patty Kazmaier Award for the top female college hockey player in 2005. She was selected the MVP of the 2005 IIHF World Championships, when the U.S. team won its first gold medal, and she was the captain of the 2006 Olympic team. ""I feel so fortunate that hockey has allowed me to represent not only my hometown, my state but my country,"" Wendell-Pohl said. ""Playing in the Olympics was never why I started playing hockey but I am beyond grateful to have been blessed and had the opportunity to wear the red, white and blue."" Campbell has been a player, coach and executive across a 52-year hockey career, and he has been the senior executive vice president for the NHL's hockey operations, officiating and central scouting departments for 25 years. Campbell won a Stanley Cup as associate coach of the New York Rangers in 1994. Poile retired as general manager of the Nashville Predators in 2023 after becoming the winningest and longest-tenured general manager in league history. He was GM of the Washington Capitals from 1982-97, then served in the same role in Nashville for 27 years. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

That's what Seattle Kraken coach Dan Bylsma did with forwards Oliver Bjorkstrand and Tye Kartye on Nov. 5 at Colorado. The move seems to have paid off, as Bjorkstrand scored a goal and Kartye assisted on another as the Kraken snapped a four-game skid with a 4-3 overtime victory against the visiting Vegas Golden Knights on Friday. After a weekend off, the Kraken will host the struggling Columbus Blue Jackets on Tuesday. Bjorkstrand's gritty goal early in the third period -- Golden Knights goalie Adin Hill lunged to make a pokecheck, only for the puck to careen off Bjorkstrand as he charged to the top of the crease and deflect into the net -- put the Kraken ahead 3-2 after they had fallen behind 2-0. ""I thought his game, in particular, was a great bounce-back game for him,"" Bylsma said. ""He's a talented, skilled player with a great shot and scores a lot of goals. His competition was at a great level for him to have success in the game. And it's not just the evidence of going to the net and scoring a dirty goal, but on the wall in the first period, at the faceoff (circle), also in the first period, the battle on the wall in the second period in front of our bench. It was great."" Bjorkstrand, who told reporters he needed to be better when asked about being a healthy scratch, was pleased to impact the game. ""Yeah, it was good,"" he said. ""I would have been ready in Colorado, but I was ready (Friday), kept it simple. I feel like I played well with the puck and was able to create some chances."" After a promising start to the season, the Blue Jackets are winless in their past five games (0-4-1). They fell 4-2 on Sunday at Anaheim as Ducks goaltender John Gibson, making his season debut after undergoing an emergency appendectomy on Sept. 25, stopped 38 shots. Kirill Marchenko had a goal and an assist for Columbus. Yegor Chinakhov also scored, and Daniil Tarasov made 26 saves. ""It's unacceptable,"" said Columbus defenseman Zach Werenski, who was playing in his 500th NHL game. ""Enough with the moral victories. We've played well enough in a lot of games this year to win and we end up losing them, and that's on us. ""We have to look ourselves in the mirror and find a way to win hockey games. I don't care if we outshoot them 50-20 or we get outshot 50-20. At the end of the day, we have to find a way to get points in this league and win hockey games, and we haven't done it."" The Blue Jackets have scored just nine goals during their losing streak. ""Goal-scoring is funny. It goes in streaks,"" Columbus coach Dean Evason said. ""A few weeks back, we couldn't miss and the pucks were finding their way in and we were getting some bounces and good stuff. And now it's gone the other way a little bit, but there's nothing we can do about it now except move forward and keep doing those things to get those opportunities."" Both teams could have lineup reinforcements Tuesday. The Kraken reacquired forward Daniel Sprong, who scored 21 goals for them in 2022-23, in a trade with the Vancouver Canucks. The Blue Jackets claimed defenseman Dante Fabbro, a former first-round pick, off waivers from the Nashville Predators. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

After seeing its three-game win streak come to an end with a head-scratching home loss to the Miami Heat on Sunday, Minnesota opens up NBA Cup play against the host Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday night. The teams meet again in Portland on Wednesday.  The Trail Blazers have lost three straight, most recently 134-89 to the visiting Memphis Grizzlies on Sunday. Minnesota fell 95-94 to Miami on Sunday after Mike Conley missed a 3-pointer in the last two seconds. The Wolves committed 20 turnovers in the loss. After the game, Minnesota coach Chris Finch took the blame for some confusion during the game's final two possessions. Center Rudy Gobert appreciated Finch's apology but said it was a team loss. ""We were in a position to win, and we weren't able to close it out,"" Gobert said. ""Everyone remembers the last play, but I think we as a team remember the last few minutes when we're up (eight) at some points. So, yeah. None of us is perfect. Gonna all learn to be better."" The occasional speed bump was expected for Minnesota, which traded Karl-Anthony Towns to the New York Knicks for Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo prior to the season. After reaching the Western Conference finals last season, the Wolves are focused on figuring out how to best integrate their newest players. ""It might've been easier last year. We had been together for a year and a half, two years,"" Conley said. ""Now, we're trying to figure out what we do with what we have now and whoever is finishing the game. We could finish with seven, eight different guys."" The 37-year-old Conley is looking to settle in this season while shooting an underwhelming 30.7 percent from the field and 30 percent from 3-point range. Minnesota has won its last five meetings against Portland, which turned in a dismal performance against a depleted Memphis squad. The Grizzlies played without injured guards Ja Morant (hip) and Desmond Bane (oblique) and still led by as many as 25 points in the second quarter. ""It was just (expletive) embarrassing,"" Portland coach Chauncey Billups said. ""We were soft as hell the whole game. Nobody really fought. It was just embarrassing for everybody. That's just not who we are. It really isn't. No excuse for that."" Jerami Grant led the Blazers with 20 points, while Dalano Banton and Donovan Clingan had 13 points apiece off the bench. Portland opened a four-game homestand by shooting 4-of-42 (9.5 percent) from 3-point range and committing 23 turnovers. ""It was like our guys just showed up because they had to be here and didn't want to play,"" Billups said. ""Didn't want to actually work. And that's embarrassing. It's unfortunate that we had to go out there in front of our fans who paid their hard-earned money to come and see their favorite team play, and we show up and do that."" Blazers guard Shaedon Sharpe, coming back from a shoulder injury, played in his third game and made his first start of the season on Sunday and had seven points on 3-of-10 shooting. Sharpe started in place of forward Deni Avdija, who is averaging 9.0 points and 5.6 rebounds. In 13 minutes off the bench, Avdija missed all five of his field-goal attempts.

Jacob Meyer scored 12 points for the Blue Demons (3-0), who, under first-year coach Chris Holtmann, boast an entirely new roster compared to last season's 3-29 squad.  Former Louisville forward JJ Traynor had 11 points and 10 rebounds and Drake transfer Conor Enright dished out eight assists for DePaul, which took control by going 7-for-15 from 3-point range and scoring 21 points off 14 Mercer turnovers in the first half. For the game, the Blue Demons shot 54.8 percent overall, totaled 21 assists and got 53 points from its bench, led by Benson, Gunn and Meyer. Meanwhile, Ahmad Robinson and Alex Holt each scored 12 points for Mercer (1-1), which shot 39.3 percent from the field and went 4-for-24 from 3-point range in its first-ever meeting with DePaul.

The 34-year-old Thompson, a first-round pick by the Warriors in 2011, elected to leave Golden State in a sign-and-trade over the summer, ending a 13-year run that included two missed seasons because of Achilles and knee injuries. The four-time champion and five-time All-Star is averaging 13.8 points in his first 10 games for the Mavericks after averaging 17.9 points for the Warriors last season. Thompson departed Golden State ranked second to Stephen Curry on the franchise all-time list for career 3-pointers (2,481), while also sitting fourth in games (793), sixth in points (15,531) and ninth in steals (676). The homecoming comes as part of the second edition of the NBA Cup, an in-season tournament that was drawn with the Mavericks and Warriors in the same five-team pool with the Memphis Grizzlies, New Orleans Pelicans and Denver Nuggets. Thompson attempted to downplay his return by citing excitement for the NBA Cup, in which he and the Warriors went 2-2 last season. ""It'll be good to see people you grinded with,"" he said over the weekend. ""But to me, it's just another regular-season game in November. Obviously, there are bigger implications with the NBA Cup, so what's on my mind is to win that because I haven't been a part of it yet. I know it's young, but it'd be fun to play for that title."" Thompson's departure from the Warriors came as part of a six-team trade in which the Warriors acquired, among others, Buddy Hield from the Philadelphia 76ers. Hield has more than made up for the loss of Thompson, ranking among the NBA leaders in 3-pointers (40) and 3-point field goal percentage (48.8). Thompson has made 29 treys at a 35.4 percent clip for the Mavericks. Warriors coach Steve Kerr said there are no hard feelings about Thompson leaving. ""Sometimes a fresh start can be healthy,"" he said. ""Everybody's life and career arc is different. I think Klay made the right decision going to Dallas. Just seeing him the last couple of years, I think he needed a fresh start."" The Warriors plan to greet Thompson with a ""Salute Captain Klay"" interactive experience that will include a pregame video tribute. The Warriors have announced that his No. 31 will be retired when his playing days are over. Curry applauds the idea of celebrating his ""Splash Brother"" sooner rather than later. ""We have a game to play, so the focus has to be there,"" he said. ""But he deserves the celebration and the welcome he's going to get. It's a chance to reflect on all the memories we created together."" Coming off a 4-1 trip that included wins over the Boston Celtics and Oklahoma City Thunder, the Warriors take an 8-2 record into a four-day sequence in which they also will host Memphis in an NBA Cup game on Friday. With Kyrie Irving scoring 43 points, the Mavericks opened a three-game trip with a 122-120 loss at Denver on Sunday.

He stared down Anze Kopitar moments after his team staked the 2-0 lead, and kept the door shut early in the third period when Adrian Kempe was sprung on a golden opportunity.

""He's close,"" Collins said of the player's status. Northwestern (1-1) was without Barnhizer for its first two games, including Saturday night's 71-66 road loss to Dayton. The Wildcats led by as many as 13 in the first half before the Flyers came back, outscoring Northwestern 47-34 in the second half. Junior Nick Martinelli recorded career highs with 32 points and 14 boards. He made 12 of 16 field-goal attempts, including all three from beyond the arc. Martinelli was selected the Big Ten Player of the Week on Monday after becoming the first player in the conference since at least 1996-97 to post 25-plus points and 10-plus rebounds in the first two games of a season. Barnhizer is out with a lower-body injury but took part in warm-ups ahead of the Flyers game. Barnhizer averaged 14.6 points and 7.5 rebounds last season. Northwestern is attempting to win its fourth straight game against UIC. Collins is 3-0 against the Flames, each win by double digits. The teams last met in December 2022, with the Wildcats pulling away 92-54. The Wildcats lead the series 6-4. Freshman guard Angelo Ciaravino is slowly getting used to playing at the collegiate level through two games. Even in a losing effort, Ciaravino said it is a building block for future success. ""It's very surreal stepping out there and seeing all those people, but at the end of the day, it's us vs. them, and it's about focusing on what's on the court and drowning everything else out,"" said Ciaravino, who scored 12 points in 21 minutes against Dayton. The Flames (2-0) have rolled through their nonconference schedule thus far. In their victories against St. Francis (Ill.) and Yale, they scored 91 points in each game, with five scorers reaching double figures against the Bulldogs on Friday night. Tyem Freeman led the way in the 91-79 home victory with 19 points off the bench, while Jordan Mason added 16 in a reserve role. Sasa Ciani posted a double-double with 13 points and 11 rebounds, Jayon Jackson scored 13 and Ahmad Henderson II contributed 11 points and a game-high seven assists. UIC's last win against a power-conference opponent came at Northwestern's expense, 50-44 in 2012. The game against the Flames is the first of four home games at Welsh-Ryan Arena before the Wildcats travel to Tempe, Ariz., to take on Butler in the Arizona Tip-off on Thanksgiving Day. The Flames host Saint Mary's (Minn.) on Saturday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Oklahoma City is 3-0 this season on the second night of a back-to-back. The loss snapped a four-game winning streak by the Clippers. The Clippers cut what was a 20-point deficit to three with just more than two minutes remaining before Gilgeous-Alexander answered with a step-back 3-pointer. Ivica Zubac's three-point play with 42 seconds left cut the deficit to 130-128 before Gilgeous-Alexander hit a pair of free throws and Luguentz Dort had a steal leading to a Jalen Williams dunk in the closing seconds to put the game away. Playing a day after Chet Holmgren suffered a pelvic fracture in a loss to Golden State, the Thunder leaned heavily on Gilgeous-Alexander and Williams. Gilgeous-Alexander was 13 of 21 from the field and hit a season-high four 3-pointers while Williams added 28 points on 11-of-16 shooting. The Thunder shot 51.6 percent from the floor and were 22 of 23 from the free-throw line. Holmgren will be evaluated in eight to 10 weeks, the Thunder announced before the game. Playing without Holmgren, and with several other frontcourt players injured as well, the Thunder went with a smaller lineup. Oklahoma City thrived for much of the game after starting Williams with Aaron Wiggins and Dort in the frontcourt. The Thunder led for much of the game, building their lead to 20 by midway through the third. But the Clippers finally had success on the interior over the last half of the quarter, reeling off a 25-10 run to cut the deficit to five heading into the fourth. Zubac had six points and a block during the run, while Norman Powell had 12 points. Powell had a pair of steals in the final two minutes of the quarter that led to points on the other end. Powell scored 18 of his 31 points in the third quarter and finished with five 3-pointers. Zubac finished with 22 points and 14 rebounds as the Clippers outrebounded Oklahoma City 56-34. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Sengun paired 27 points with 17 rebounds to pace the Rockets, who overcame the absence of point guard Fred VanVleet (hamstring). Houston recorded only 13 assists, relying on transition opportunities and a dominant performance from Sengun in the paint to survive. Kyle Kuzma scored eight points during an 11-4 Wizards run that opened the fourth and cut the deficit to 86-80. Following a Houston timeout, Sengun converted a dunk and a driving layup before nailing a 3-pointer to help the Rockets reclaim control and a double-digit lead at 93-80. Jalen Green added 18 points for the Rockets. Amen Thompson added 13 points, eight rebounds and four steals, while Aaron Holiday and Jabari Smith Jr. tallied 11 points each.

Kuzma led the Wizards, who have dropped five consecutive games, with 18 points. However, he needed 18 shots to reach that total, reflecting the poor shooting from the Wizards (35.5 percent). Jordan Poole missed 9 of 14 shots en route to 11 points, while Alexandre Sarr, the second overall pick in the NBA draft, shot 2 of 9 for five points. Both the Rockets and Wizards quickly recovered from ragged starts.  In the first quarter, Washington got a combined 15 points from Carlton Carrington and Bilal Coulibaly to offset a balanced scoring attack from Houston, which got six points apiece from Smith, Sengun and Green. Washington shot 52.2 percent in the opening period but trailed 30-28 entering the second due partly to the Rockets' aggressiveness, which yielded 10 free throws compared to four for the Wizards. When the Rockets threatened to run away late in the second, Kuzma helped the Wizards fashion a response. Houston extended to its largest lead of the half at 55-40 on back-to-back steals and transition layups from Green and Eason. But Kuzma drilled a 3-pointer and converted a driving layup to pull Washington to within 57-49 at the intermission.

After both teams failed on their first shootout attempt, Michkov deposited an impressive backhand-to-forehand move. Following a save by Ersson, Konecny netted the decisive goal, dragging the puck on his forehand before flipping it under the crossbar. The Flyers scored twice in the first period, beginning with Johnson's first goal of the season at 1:40. With just over four minutes left in the period, Konecny made it 2-0 on a tic-tac-toe setup, as Emil Andrae found Michkov, who one-timed a feed to Konecny, whose blast from the right circle beat Vanecek for a power-play goal. At 5:09 of the second period, Michkov got behind the defense and beat Vanecek 5-hole to make it 3-0. However, San Jose began to chip away later in the period. With about 4 1/2 minutes left in the stanza, William Eklund's centering pass caromed off Thompson's skate and past Ersson to get the Sharks on the board. About three minutes later, Eklund set up Granlund at the right faceoff dot for a spicy wrister that got under the crossbar. The score remained 3-2 until Goodrow netted the equalizer with 2:24 left in regulation. Henry Thrun's shot from the left point ricocheted to the right of the net where Goodrow slammed it past Ersson.

Sure enough, the Triple Crown winners in the National League and American League -- Atlanta Braves left-hander Chris Sale and Detroit Tigers lefty Tarik Skubal, respectively -- were named finalists on Monday. Sale, 35, took the NL Triple Crown with 18 wins, a 2.38 ERA and 225 strikeouts. Earning his first career Gold Glove in 2024, he helped lead the Braves to an 89-73 record and a postseason appearance. Skubal, 27, grabbed the AL Triple Crown with 18 wins, a 2.39 ERA and 228 strikeouts while propelling the Tigers to their first playoff appearances since 2014. Pittsburgh Pirates rookie right-hander Paul Skenes and Philadelphia Phillies right-hander Zack Wheeler are the other NL finalists. Skenes, 22, had a sensational first season, going 11-3 over 23 starts with a 1.96 ERA, a mark that would have led the majors by a healthy margin had he pitched enough innings. Wheeler had his most successful season as a pro at the age of 34. Posting career bests in ERA (2.57), and wins (16), Wheeler struck out 224 while earning an All-Star nod for the NL East winners. Cleveland Guardians closer Emmanuel Clase and the Kansas City Royals right-hander Seth Lugo are the other AL finalists. Clase, a 26-year-old right-hander, led the majors in saves (47) for the third straight season. That mark was the best of his five-year career, as was his 0.61 ERA over 74 appearances covering 74 1/3 innings. Lugo, 34, went 16-9 with a 3.00 ERA for the playoff-participating Royals.

Witt also tallied 32 home runs to go along with 31 steals for the upstart Royals, who made the postseason for the first time in nine seasons. Joining Ohtani as NL MVP finalists are New York Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor and Arizona Diamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte. Lindor powered the Mets' postseason run by catching fire at the plate. Over the season's second half, Lindor batted .306 with a .368 on-base percentage, helping the Mets make the NLCS. The four-time All-Star and two-time Gold Glove winner finished with a .274 average, 33 home runs, 39 doubles and 91 RBIs. Marte set career highs in RBIs (95) and home runs (36).

Dallas, which entered Monday with just 39 goals in 13 games, feasted on the league's third-worst scoring defense. In winning for the second time in three games, the Stars did nearly all of their damage in the opening period and cruised from there. The first-period six-pack tied the then-Minnesota North Stars, who also scored six in the first 20 minutes in a 7-2 win over the Los Angeles Kings on March 16, 1971. The franchise record for goals in any period is eight, set by Minnesota in the second period of a 15-2 home win against Winnipeg on Nov. 11, 1981. The half-dozen goals that got past Joel Blomqvist and Alex Nedeljkovic on just 12 shots were also the most Pittsburgh ever allowed in the first period at home. Five Stars players recorded two or more points in the barrage, with Marchment (one goal, three assists) tying a team record with four points in one period. That occurred 10 times previously, with Tyler Seguin and Valeri Nichushkin both accomplishing the feat most recently against Philadelphia on Dec. 7, 2013. Marchment's goal came when Brendan Smith cleared the puck from the Stars' end as both teams changed lines. The puck bounced off the board behind the Penguins' net and toward the slot, where Marchment got ahead of Matt Grzelcyk and Kris Letang to beat Blomqvist, make it 3-0 and end the starting netminder's night with 9:44 remaining in the period. Marchment, who entered Monday with two goals and six assists in 12 games, helped on goals from Matt Duchene, Miro Heiskanen and Seguin. He added a fifth point, one off his career high, when he and Duchene assisted on Wyatt Johnston's third-period goal. Heiskanen added an unassisted goal as he tallied his first two of the season, and the fifth two-goal game in the defenseman's career. Logan Stankoven also scored. After allowing three goals on four shots in relief of Blomqvist, Nedeljkovic settled down to make 28 saves for the Penguins, who lost for the third time in four games. Tristan Jarry, recalled from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton on Saturday, was a healthy scratch. Dallas goalie Jake Oettinger rebounded from being pulled after giving up four goals in less than 30 minutes in a loss at Winnipeg on Saturday. He made 20 saves on Monday, only allowing a second-period goal by Anthony Beauvillier. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

After Gardner-Webb made a program-record 70 percent of its field-goal attempts on Friday in a win over North Carolina Central, the Runnin' Bulldogs made just 39.7 percent of their shots from the floor on Monday. Before the game was five minutes old, Pitt opened a 14-2 lead, which Leggett started and finished with baskets in the paint. Diaz-Graham added a 3-pointer and Dunn followed with a three-point play to fuel the surge. Midway through the half, Pitt began a 13-0 spree that included 3-pointers by Austin and Leggett. When Leggett finished the run with a fastbreak layup, the Panthers were on top 34-13. Over the final 6:05 of the half, Pitt missed nine consecutive field-goal attempts against Gardner-Webb's active 2-3 zone. During the dry spell, the Runnin' Bulldogs got 3-pointers from Ademide Badmus and Selden to cut a 21-point deficit to 38-23 at the break. Gardner-Webb made some noise in the second half, slicing a 19-point gap to 11 as Brendan Mycalcio came off the bench and scored six quick points. The Runnin' Bulldogs made their run largely by hustling for offensive rebounds. A three-point play by Selden midway through the half made it 55-44, but Gardner-Webb got no closer the rest of the way. Pitt put it away with a 14-1 run which was triggered by a tip-in dunk by Diaz-Graham and included a pair of treys by Leggett as the Panthers grabbed a 71-47 advantage with 4:38 left. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Reese barely missed a double-double but led the Terrapins (3-0) to their third consecutive victory by 30 or more points to open the season. Reese was one of five Maryland players to score in double figures as the Terrapins led wire-to-wire and were able to play 14 players after taking a double-digit lead for good with 3:53 left in the first half. Tyler Shirley with 10 points was the lone double-figure scorer for the Rattlers (0-3), who continued to struggle early on against tough competition in coach Patrick Crarey II's first season. Shirley, however, fouled out with 9:36 left in the second half. Maryland scored the game's first 15 points in three minutes. The Terrapins took advantage of five turnovers during that span and that became a theme throughout the contest as they finished with 11 steals. Florida A&M ended up with 22 turnovers overall, which led to 31 Maryland points. Ja'Derryus Eatmon's layup with 16:41 left in the first half finally got the Rattlers on the scoreboard. It also sparked a 12-2 surge, which cut Maryland's early advantage to five. But the Terrapins continued to turn mistakes into fast-break points and broke the game open by halftime, leading 40-21. Maryland finished with only six turnovers and a 19-3 edge in fast-break points. Selton Miguel totaled 14 points while Ja'Kobi Gillespie had 12 points and five rebounds. Derik Queen scored 11 points and had three assists. Rodney Rice, who scored a career-high 28 points in Maryland's previous game over Mount St. Mary's, had 10 points. The Terrapins shot 48.4 percent from the field (31 for 64) and 51.6 percent in the second half to lead by as many as 39 points. Maryland faces its first ranked opponent of the season in its next game Friday when it hosts No. 15 Marquette. Florida A&M will also potentially face a ranked opponent next when it travels to Gainesville to face No. 20 Florida on Nov. 19. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Cofie, a true freshman, finished with 11 points and 11 rebounds to go along with four steals, three blocks and two assists off the bench. Also scoring in double figures for Virginia (2-0) were Isaac McKneely with 14 points and Dai Dai Ames with 13. Coach Tony Bennett is retired, but the Cavaliers showed that they can still play strong defense under interim coach Ron Sanchez. Virginia had 11 blocks and seven steals and limited Coppin State to 28 percent shooting from the field, including a 21.1 percent mark (4 of 19) from 3-point distance. Derrius Ward scored 12 points and Jonathan Dunn had 11 to lead the Eagles (0-4), who have lost 17 consecutive games dating back to last season. The Cavaliers blew the game open midway through the second half. Cofie's 3-pointer with 9:09 remaining capped a 13-0 run and gave Virginia a 53-27 lead. The advantage swelled to 57-29 after Cofie stole the ball and threw down a reverse dunk with 6:14 left. Virginia shot 40.4 percent from the field, 33.3 percent (9 of 27) from downtown and 91.7 percent (11 of 12) at the free-throw line. Coppin State's only lead of the game came at 2-0 on a jumper by Cam'Ron Brown. It was a competitive first half until Virginia heated up from beyond the 3-point line. McKneely drained three triples during a 12-2 run to put the Cavaliers ahead 32-16 at the break. Virginia shot 43.8 percent (7 of 16) from behind the arc during the first half. Coppin State missed all seven of its attempts from 3-point range and shot 28 percent overall (7 of 25) for the half. Coppin State's last victory was a 58-55 overtime decision against Maryland-Eastern Shore on Jan. 8.

Bruce Thornton had 12 points, Meechie Johnson added 11 and Sean Stewart supplied 10 for the Buckeyes (2-0), who led by 15 at the break and never looked back. Ohio State was playing as a ranked team for the first time since landing in the top 25 the week of Jan. 2, 2023.  Cris Carroll had 10 points and Ty Harper and Gabe Dynes each scored nine points for the Penguins (1-1), who were 3-for-22 on 3-pointers (13.6 percent).  Bradshaw and Stewart had only two points apiece in a season-opening victory against then-No. 19 Texas last Monday, but they combined for 15 in the first half against the Penguins.  Mobley, who went 4-for-4 from beyond the arc vs. the Longhorns, knocked down his first three triples of the night against Youngstown State to run his streak of made treys to seven before recording his first miss from deep.  It was a wonder why the Penguins only trailed 37-22 at intermission after their epic cold spells. They took a 2-0 lead 16 seconds into the game but went the next 6:14 without scoring while the Buckeyes reeled off 12 straight points. The Ohio State lead reached 13 points, 27-14, before Youngstown State got as close as nine, but it then went the final 6:34 of the first half without a made field goal. However, the Penguins did sink five free throws during that stretch.  Ohio State opened the second half on an 8-2 run to build a 45-24 cushion, then led by at least 20 the rest of the way.  Because a power outage on the Youngstown State campus postponed the Penguins' season opener against Westminster last Monday, the team will begin the season with six straight games away from home for the first time in program history. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

In last season's inaugural edition of the NBA Cup, then called the NBA In-Season Tournament, Phoenix advanced from the five-team group at 3-1 to reach the knockout round. Utah finished third in the group at 2-2. Through the first few weeks of this regular season, the Jazz struggled to an 0-6 start -- the franchise's worst opening stretch since going 0-8 in 2013-14. Utah tips off the NBA Cup having won two of three games, however, coming off a 111-110 decision in San Antonio on Saturday. Collin Sexton's free throws with 3.2 seconds gave Utah a necessary buffer, as Devin Vassell hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer. Sexton finished with a team-high 23 points, as the Jazz improved to 2-1 this season when he notches 20-plus points. Sexton scored 24 in the 135-126 win at Chicago on Nov. 4. Lauri Markkanen scored 20 points in his second game back in the lineup after leaving the Oct. 29 loss to Sacramento with back spasms. Rookie forward Kyle Filipowski played a strong all-around game against the Spurs with eight points, six assists and five rebounds. ""He's very comfortable with the ball in his hands,"" Jazz coach Will Hardy said of Filipowski, per the Deseret News. ""It gives us a lot of (options) on offense, especially when he's out there with John (Collins) and Lauri."" Fellow Utah rookie guard Isaiah Collier, helping fill in with Keyonte George out with a foot injury, had seven points, six rebounds and four assists in his second NBA game. While Utah tips off the NBA Cup coming off of just its second win on the season, Phoenix begins group play coming off of only its second loss. The Suns lost to visiting Sacramento 127-118 in overtime, snapping their seven-game winning streak. Devin Booker scored 28 points, Bradley Beal added 23 and Tyus Jones recorded a season-high 22 to shoulder the bulk of the offensive load with Kevin Durant sidelined.   Durant sustained a left calf strain in Phoenix's 114-113 win over Dallas on Friday. The team announced the 11-time All-NBA forward will miss at least the next two weeks. Beal, who has been dealing with an elbow sprain, also collided with DeMar DeRozan on Sunday and underwent an X-ray on his left knee following the game. Results from the X-ray returned negative. Beal's incident came after Jusuf Nurkic exited the game with an ankle injury. ""Our depth definitely got tested with Nurk going out,"" Suns coach Mike Budenholzer said.  Veteran reserve Mason Plumlee, who Budenholzer said has been ""very good"" for Phoenix this season, came on to provide six points, 11 rebounds and six assists. Fellow reserve Josh Okogie added nine points and five rebounds. Regardless of the status of Beal or Nurkic for Tuesday, Budenholzer is still looking for continued contributions from the bench. ""We've been talking about how positive we are on Oso (Ighodaro),"" Budenholzer said. ""Josh has done it now for two games in a row. ...

Conversely, the Edmonton Oilers' third-period outburst on Saturday provided a hint they might finally be ready to return to form. The former tries to bounce back and the latter aims to build momentum Tuesday night when New York visits Edmonton in the first clash of the season between the teams. Neither team has played since Saturday. The host Islanders squandered a two-goal lead in the third period and fell to the New Jersey Devils 4-3 in overtime. The visiting Oilers ended a two-game losing streak by scoring four goals in fewer than five minutes in the third period of a 7-3 win over the Vancouver Canucks. The loss snapped a season-high two-game winning streak for the Islanders, who appeared headed for victory when Dennis Cholowski and Brock Nelson scored within a stretch of 1:56 shortly beyond the midway point of the third period. But Dawson Mercer scored with 4:27 left for the Devils, who pulled goalie Jacob Markstrom with about 1:18 remaining and tied the score when Stefan Noesen's pass into the crease glanced off the stick and skate of Islanders defenseman Grant Hutton and trickled past Ilya Sorokin, who finished with 29 saves. Jack Hughes scored on a breakaway 2:35 into overtime to hand the Islanders their 14th loss -- counting the playoffs -- in games in which they led in the third period over the last two seasons. New York, which frittered away several one-goal leads in a 5-4 overtime loss to the Utah Hockey Club on Oct. 10, also gave up third-period advantages in a shootout win over the Montreal Canadiens on Oct. 19 and in an overtime victory over the Devils on Oct. 25. ""We managed to take a 3-1 lead. Unfortunately, we couldn't close,"" Islanders coach Patrick Roy said. ""Need to find a way to close those games."" Closing wasn't a problem Saturday for the Oilers, who led 3-0 fewer than five minutes into the second before the Canucks' Elias Pettersson and Filip Hronek scored twice in a span of 1:59. Connor Brown opened and closed the third-period flurry for the Oilers, who received goals in between from Connor McDavid and Brett Kulak. The four-goal third was the most prolific period of the season for Edmonton, which scored fewer than four goals in nine of its first 14 games. The win was the fifth in the last eight games for the defending Western Conference champion Oilers, who were a popular preseason pick to win the Stanley Cup but opened with five losses in their first seven games (2-4-1). ""It was a solid effort by our group, but the main thing is that third period, the way we showed composure and poise in the third and made plays with the lead and piled on,"" Brown said. ""I think there's a lot of momentum to be built off that game, especially that third period."" The Oilers will visit the Islanders on March 14 to conclude the two-game season series. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The visiting Ospreys (3-0) already have picked up wins at South Carolina and Georgia Tech, the latter a 105-93 victory in Atlanta on Sunday in which they made 73.7 percent of their 2-point attempts. That's after making 25 3-pointers at a 43.1 percent clip in their first two games.

""So proud of this group and so proud of what they stand for."" Georgia (2-0) has started off with home wins over Tennessee Tech and Texas Southern, limiting Texas Southern to 1-of-19 shooting from 3-point range and holding a 53-23 advantage on the boards. ""I thought we got back to just focusing on smaller details, especially on the glass and on the defensive end,"" Georgia coach Mike White said. ""Took more pride in defending. I just thought simply we played harder."" Picked to finish seventh of 12 teams in the Atlantic Sun Conference preseason poll, North Florida has five players averaging double figures.

He died in Baton Rouge, La., from complications stemming from pneumonia. Robinson compiled a 104-35-4 record over two separate tenures as head football coach at USC, winning a national championship with the Trojans in 1978. The 104 wins put him at third place in all-time wins at the school behind John McKay and Howard Jones. Robinson never had a losing season at USC in 12 seasons. His first team, in 1976, went 11-1 and won the Rose Bowl, finishing No. 2 in the AP poll. After a dip to 8-4 in 1977, Robinson put together a two-year run of 23-1-1 in 1978-79, winning two more Rose Bowls and a national championship as designated by the coaches' poll in 1978. He coached another three seasons during that first tenure, producing such noted NFL stars as Marcus Allen, Ricky Bell, Charles White, Clay Matthews and Joey Browner. Allen and White both won the Heisman Trophy while playing for Robinson. In 1983, Robinson was handed the reins to the Los Angeles Rams and twice advanced to the NFC Championship Game in his tenure there (1983-1991), going 75-68. The Trojans re-hired Robinson for the 1993 season. While his second stint at USC did not produce the same highs, he did earn three more bowl wins over five seasons, including wins in the Cotton Bowl and Rose Bowl. His head coaching career wrapped in Las Vegas with UNLV, where he went 28-42 over six years. He also became a consultant with LSU and was present for the Tigers' national title in 2019. Overall, Robinson finished with an 8-1 record in bowl games over 18 seasons as a head coach. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Skenes, the star Pittsburgh Pirates right-handed pitcher, is up against Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Jackson Chourio and San Diego Padres outfielder Jackson Merrill. Skenes is the leading candidate in the National League after claiming the award from multiple publications since the end of his first season.  The No. 1 pick in the 2023 MLB Draft, Skenes was promoted from the minors to the Pirates' rotation on May 11. He led baseball in ERA from that point forward and became the fifth rookie pitcher to start the All-Star Game.  Skenes, 22, was 11-3 with a 1.96 ERA, 170 strikeouts and 0.95 WHIP in 2024. Merrill had 162 hits in 156 games, batting .292 with 61 extra-base hits (24 home runs, 31 doubles, six triples) and 90 RBIs. Chourio, in his first year in the big leagues for Milwaukee, batted .275 with 21 homers, 79 RBIs and 22 stolen bases in 148 games, splitting his time between left and right field. A starting pitcher is also favored on the AL side. Yankees right-hander Luis Gil, who had seven career appearances before 2024, quickly earned a spot in the team's starting rotation and finished the year with a 15-7 record, a 3.50 ERA, 171 strikeouts and a league-high 77 walks in 151 2/3 innings. He had 17 starts with one run or zero runs allowed. His New York batterymate Austin Wells appeared in 115 games and hit .229 with 13 homers and 55 RBIs. The third AL finalist is Baltimore Orioles outfielder Colton Cowser, who became an everyday player for the O's and batted .242 with 24 homers and 69 RBIs in 153 games.

Quatraro, 50, oversaw a stunning turnaround for the Royals, who were coming off a lifeless 56-106 last-place finish in 2023. A similar roster in 2024 became a winning squad under Quatraro's direction, going 86-76 with a second-place finish in the American League Central. This year's Royals earned a 2-0 sweep of the Baltimore Orioles in the AL wild-card series before dropping an AL Division Series to the New York Yankees three games to one. Quatraro will have stiff competition in the AL from two divisional rivals, A.J. Hinch of the Detroit Tigers and Stephen Vogt of the Cleveland Guardians. Hinch matched Quatraro by directing an 86-76 club that found postseason success. Hinch's Tigers swept the Houston Astros 2-0 in the other AL wild-card series and pushed the Guardians to five games in the ALDS before losing 3-2.

Tejada leads Towson with a 16.5 scoring average and Dylan Williamson is contributing 12.5 per game. The Tigers would certainly like to post an attention-grabbing victory after stringing together three straight seasons of 20 or more wins. Towson hasn't played in the NCAA Tournament since 1991 but this group has made it a goal to end the long drought. ""We're going to take it one day at a time, one game at a time,"" Tigers guard Nendah Tarke recently said. ""We know that that's our end goal. We're far from that now, but if we keep up with the right habits and doing the right things, everything should take care of itself."" This is the third meeting between the schools. South Carolina won both of the first two with the most recent matchup being a 65-55 victory on Dec. 30, 1997. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Following the Utes' 22-21 home loss to rival BYU on Saturday night that dropped Utah to 4-5 and 1-5 in the conference, Harlan unloaded on the officiating and the conference itself. ""This game was absolutely stolen from us,"" Harlan said. ""We were excited about being in the Big 12, but tonight I am not. We won this game. Someone else stole it from us. Very disappointed."" Those comments led to a fairly swift reaction from the league, which reprimanded Harlan with the fine and a statement Sunday. ""Mark's comments irresponsibly challenged the professionalism of our officials and the integrity of the Big 12 Conference,"" Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark said. ""There is a right way and a wrong way to voice concerns. Unfortunately, Mark chose the wrong way. Accordingly, this violation warrants a public reprimand and financial penalty. The Big 12 Conference prioritizes professionalism, integrity, and fairness, and will continue to do so."" Down 21-19, a holding penalty called on Utah cornerback Zemaiah Vaughn on fourth down negated a sack and gave BYU the ball at its own 19 with about 90 seconds left. The Cougars then drove down the field for a game-winning 44-yard field goal. With the win, which came before the largest crowd (54,383) ever at Rice-Eccles Stadium in Salt Lake City, No. 9 BYU moved to 9-0, 6-0 in the conference, to stay firmly in the mix for a College Football Playoff berth. ""I recognize that there are more appropriate times and avenues to express those concerns, and I accept the consequences of my decision,"" Harlan said in a statement. ""My comments came after having just left our team locker room where our student-athletes were hurting and upset. The University of Utah is proud to be a member of the Big 12 Conference and we look forward to working with our peers to continue to enhance the league."" The game was the first between the two as conference mates since 2010 when both teams left the Mountain West Conference. Utah joined the Big 12 along with three other Pac-12 teams this summer. BYU joined the conference in 2023. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Friars (2-0) are coming off a 76-49 win Saturday over nearby Stonehill in which 11 different players scored, led by Georgia graduate transfer Jabri Abdur-Rahim's 16 points and six rebounds. Coach Kim English's team is still coming together after dealing with injuries throughout the preseason. All-Big East star Bryce Hopkins has been out since January due to an ACL tear. ""Guys are still fighting for rotational minutes -- and that's without Bryce Hopkins, who you can plug in (for) high-20s, low-30s per game,"" English said. ""The starting group, we're still evaluating. ... We're looking to see who can play that hard on defense and be efficient on offense."" The deep lineup shot 50 percent from the field, a big improvement from the 37.7 percent mark in last Monday's 59-55 win over Central Connecticut State. Meanwhile, English is hopeful for a Hopkins return during the Friars' Thanksgiving week trip to the Battle 4 Atlantis in the Bahamas. ""I'm wanting him to do more. He's kind of in a dilemma of wanting to get in but also wanting the guys that are going to play to get reps,"" English said. ""His legs are strong, his knee is strong."" Miami transfer Bensley Joseph leads Providence with 14 points per game, including 21 points and five 3-pointers against Central Connecticut. Tuesday marks Hampton's (1-1) second game against a Division I foe this season after it fell 82-54 on Friday at George Washington. George Beale Jr., a junior transfer from Norfolk State, scored a game-high 19 points on 8-of-14 shooting. Beale has 17 points per game for a Pirates team that boasts just one returning starter in Kyrese Mullen, whose 10 double-doubles led the Coastal Athletic Association last season. ""What I've learned about the program is that we've had to establish our culture,"" first-year coach Ivan Thomas said. ""There was no culture here. We got 14 new players. ...

For the Raptors, coming off a 25-win season last year, it's not a surprise to see them where they are in the standings, but the struggles of the 2-8 Bucks are one of the talks of the early season. ""We gotta get out of this hole that we created,"" Bucks coach Doc Rivers said after his team's loss to the Boston Celtics Sunday. ""We created it. All of us, me, them, together. I have no doubt that we will. We have to play ourselves out of this hole."" The Bucks wasted another sensational performance from Giannis Antetokounmpo Sunday against the Celtics. He had 43 points and leads the NBA averaging 31.6 points a game, boosting that average to 33.8 over his last five. Damian Lillard was held to 14 points by the Celtics, well off his 26-point average. Rivers appears frustrated by his team's issues, especially the variables of pace and effort. ""We can't sustain what we did like we did in the Cleveland game. We came out like gangbusters and we just didn't sustain our play,"" Rivers said. ""It's my job to make sure we keep going and playing at the right pace. We didn't do that."" The Bucks do expect the third piece of their Big Three back soon. Rivers said Khris Middleton has been ramping up his activity level after suffering an ankle injury. Injuries have been a big theme for the Raptors, who have lost four straight on a five-game road trip that ends Tuesday. Bruce Brown is out with a knee injury, and Scottie Barnes is out until at least Thanksgiving with an orbital fracture. Raptors lead guard RJ Barrett missed three games with an injury but has played well since his return. Immanuel Quickley missed eight games with a pelvis injury and Raptors coach Darko Rajakovic said the two are still getting used to one another. ""It's just a different role in different situations for both of them,"" Rajakovic said. ""They are learning how to play off of each other. They are learning how to play again with Jakob (Poeltl). We're still playing quickly. We have to use this as a learning opportunity. We have one more game on this road trip."" The Raptors lead the NBA in 2-point shooting percentage at 65.1, and Poeltl is averaging a double-double, but Toronto has a defensive rating of 120.0, worst in the NBA. While it seems like it's getting late early for the Bucks, Toronto entered the year with measured expectations and there's no talk of digging out of a hole. ""It's hard to make any conclusions after 10-11 games,"" Rajakovic said. ""We still have guys dealing with injuries. We are really investing in developing the young players that we have."" The NBA Cup is an in-season tournament in its second season. Milwaukee went 4-0 in group play last year and lost in the semifinals to Indiana. Toronto went 1-3 in NBA Cup play. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""We'll look at what we're doing sports science-wise, but we'll come up with answers,"" Montgomery said. ""Right now, I don't have an answer for you."" The exploration will continue when the Bruins visit the struggling St. Louis Blues on Tuesday night. Boston is coming off a 3-2 overtime loss to the visiting Ottawa Senators on Saturday night. The Bruins, 1-1-1 in their last three games, were outshot 12-0 in the third period. ""It's up for you guys to figure that out and come up with a reason,"" Montgomery told reporters after the loss. ""We just weren't good enough. You guys can write what you guys think is the malaise on the team and what's going wrong. We're just not playing good enough."" Captain Brad Marchand noted that Boston is reacting to the play rather than initiating it. ""Sometimes when you lack confidence or you're overthinking, your execution is slow,"" Marchand said. ""We need to get out of our heads. Stop thinking and start playing. It comes down to will and compete at this point. We need to understand we need to be better. That's part of it. Sometimes when you're thinking about where you're supposed to be, you're half a second late. That's too slow in this league."" The Bruins are near the bottom of the NHL offensively, averaging 2.5 goals per game. Their power play is converting at 12.5 percent, tied for second worst in the league entering Monday. Fortunately for the Bruins, they face the team with the NHL's least effective power play -- the Blues. The injury-depleted Blues are connecting on just 10.8 percent of their power-play chances and are just head of the Bruins in goals per game (2.53). Playing without top center Robert Thomas (broken ankle) and top-four defensemen Philip Broberg and Nick Leddy (both sidelined by lower-body injuries), the Blues have fallen into a funk. The Blues' 8-1 loss to the Washington Capitals on Saturday night was their fifth defeat in their last seven games, dropping them below .500 at 7-8-0. St, Louis collapsed in the third period, allowing five goals. ""You can't sugarcoat it when you let in eight,"" Blues captain Brayden Schenn said. ""It just boils down to being in a hockey game, being able to come back from 3-1, to letting in five in the third period. It's just absolutely unacceptable."" It was the second time in two weeks the Blues suffered an 8-1 loss. After they lost by seven at Ottawa on Oct. 29, they rebounded to win two of their next three while allowing two goals per game over that span. ""We bounce back with some good efforts but we haven't been able to sustain it,"" coach Drew Bannister said. ""We have to be able to sustain playing better hockey. We can't take one or two steps forward and then keep taking these steps back. Our consistency when we're playing well, we have to be able to maintain that."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Off to the best 15-game start in NHL history, the Jets attempt to push their winning streak to seven games Tuesday night when they visit the New York Rangers. The Jets are the first team to win 14 of their opening 15 games in NHL history and are five points up on the Florida Panthers and Minnesota Wild in the early race for the league's top point total. Winnipeg kept its streak going with a 4-1 home win over the Dallas Stars on Saturday afternoon and is outscoring foes 27-9 in its second lengthy winning streak this season. The Jets scored at least four goals for the 10th time this season and won by at least three for the eighth time. Alex Iafallo and Nikolaj Ehlers scored power-play goals as the Jets raised their NHL-best power-play percentage to 41.9 percent and scored multiple times on the power play for the fifth game. ""I'm pretty amazed a little bit,"" Jets coach Scott Arniel said. ""At the same time, these players, they do have to recognize that it's an amazing feat, what they've done so far. But we'd like to just keep this going a little bit longer. They've got to be awfully proud of what they've done."" The power play is not the only thing clicking for the Jets, whose 67 goals are the most in the NHL. Mark Scheifele has nine of his 19 points (seven goals, two assists) in a seven-game points streak while goalie Connor Hellebuyck went a franchise-record 191:47 without allowing a goal until giving up a late tally on Saturday. The Jets scored 11 times in that span. Winnipeg put together its quick start playing nine of its games at home, and Tuesday's visit to the reigning President's Trophy winners starts a stretch of nine out of 10 games on the road. The Rangers are still trying to find the form that led them to the top mark last season. While they are off to a 9-3-1 start, the Rangers have been outshot in seven of their games and gone 5-2-0 in those games. The latest instance was Saturday's 4-0 win over the Detroit Red Wings, two nights after a 6-1 home loss to the Buffalo Sabres. Backup goalie Jonathan Quick made 37 saves against Detroit in a game when the Rangers were outshot 37-23.  That occurred a little over a week after the Rangers were outshot by sizable margins against the Washington Capitals and Ottawa Senators. ""It's good to get two points and get the win, get back on track,"" Rangers coach Peter Laviolette said. ""I thought the third period was our best period. First period, we got going a little bit toward the end. I thought in the first period and the second period wasn't very good but overall, the bounce-back and getting a win is good."" New York scored two goals late in the second period, when allowed 19 shots on goal. Jimmy Vesey and Artemi Panarin scored 48 seconds apart while Chris Kreider added a power-play goal in the opening period. Quick earned the shutout after relieving Igor Shesterkin on Thursday but the Rangers' star goaltender is expected to start after giving up five goals on 12 shots against Buffalo. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

We've done a great job during this stretch."" Bennett and the Panthers aim to continue their torrid stretch on Tuesday night when they host the New Jersey Devils in Sunrise, Fla. The teams also will square off in the Sunshine State on Thursday. Bennett scored a goal in Florida's 4-3 shootout victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on Saturday to boost his season point total to 15 (nine goals, six assists) in 15 games. He trails only Sam Reinhart in goals (11) and points (23) on the team. Speaking of Reinhart, he notched an assist on defenseman Dmitry Kulikov's goal in the second period on Saturday to extend his point streak to seven games (six goals, five assists). Reinhart also torched New Jersey in 2023-24, scoring four goals to help the Panthers win two of the three games in the season series. Evan Rodrigues had a pair of assists before scoring the deciding goal in the fifth round of the shootout versus the Flyers. Captain Aleksander Barkov has produced two goals and nine assists since returning from a lower-body injury on Oct. 28. Sergei Bobrovsky has won five straight starts since being pulled after yielding five goals in two periods against the Minnesota Wild on Oct. 22. The two-time Vezina Trophy recipient boasts a sterling 20-7-1 record in 29 career appearances versus the Devils. For its part, New Jersey was unable to solve former Devils netminder Mackenzie Blackwood in a 1-0 setback to the San Jose Sharks on Sunday. New Jersey had won three in a row and five its previous six games before Blackwood recorded 44 saves in the shutout. ""They've got a fast, skilled team, and they have been playing well of late,"" Devils backup goaltender Jake Allen said after his 26-save performance. ""Coming off (Saturday's 4-3 overtime win versus the New York Islanders), we wanted to keep this stretch going here. Now we'll take time to regroup. It's going to be a tough test this week, a tough challenge."" Jesper Bratt was denied on a partial breakaway during the final minute of the second period on Sunday. Bratt, who leads the team in assists (14) and points (19), had three and five, respectively, in three games versus Florida last season. Jack Hughes registered eight shots on goal on Sunday after recording back-to-back three-point performances. The top overall pick of the 2019 NHL Draft sits one point shy of 300 in his young career. Devils No. 1 goaltender Jacob Markstrom has won four of his last five starts, posting a 2.00 goals-against average and a .919 save percentage. In 11 games (10 starts) against Florida, he is 5-5-1 with a 3.08 GAA and a .909 save percentage.

The Colts have now lost three consecutive games, beginning with a Week 8 loss at Houston in which second-year quarterback Anthony Richardson briefly removed himself from the game for being tired. Flacco started the following week against Minnesota and has thrown for 451 yards over the past two games. However, Indianapolis has lost both while Flacco has committed six turnovers. ""Joe's a veteran guy,"" Steichen said when explaining his decision to stick with Flacco for a third consecutive week. ""He's had two games that he'd want back.

The process of this whole thing, it really is a process. We're going through that process right now. Right now, Joe's still our guy."" Following the Jets game, the Colts play host to Detroit before traveling to New England ahead of their bye week. Indianapolis is only two games behind Houston in the standings, but has already lost both meetings against the Texans this season.

Meanwhile, the 22-year-old Richardson remains the backup, having played in only 10 career NFL games.

The Giants fell to 2-8 with Sunday's last-second loss to Carolina in Germany, a game in which quarterback Daniel Jones threw for 190 yards on no touchdowns while getting intercepted twice and posting a paltry 33.9 quarterback rating.  New York has now lost five consecutive games to fall into a tie with Jacksonville for the worst record in the NFL. ""We're going to spend a lot of time here watching our tape and evaluating things. We'll do that as a coaching staff over the next week here,"" Daboll said on Monday when asked if Jones is still the starting quarterback. Jones has completed 63.3 percent of his passes for 2,070 yards and eight touchdowns against seven interceptions. He was benched for Drew Lock in the second half of a 28-3 loss to Philadelphia in Week 7, but Daboll has stuck with Jones as his starter for each of the ensuing three losses. When pressed on why he declined to commit to Jones as he has in previous weeks, Daboll offered only that, ""I would say we're evaluating our team at the bye week is what we're doing.""  In addition to Lock, the Giants have former undrafted free agent Tommy DeVito on the roster. DeVito, who played in nine games after Jones suffered a season-ending knee injury last year, has yet to appear in a game this season. ""We're going to get started on this process here of going back and looking at everything you normally look at in a bye week,"" Daboll said. ""Schemes, situational stuff, technique, all the things you do in a normal bye week. You evaluate the players. You have a good amount of games to watch. Situational review tape, calls, all those types of things.  ""We'll do that like we normally do on a bye week and try to improve in the areas that we need to improve on."" Jones signed a four-year, $160 million contract during the 2023 offseason that includes $92 million in guaranteed money. He is due to earn $30 million in base salary next season, with $12 million becoming fully guaranteed on the fifth day of the league season. If the team is considering moving on from Jones after this season, his $23 million injury guarantee could prompt a change to Lock or DeVito. Daboll acknowledged that he's in communication with general manager Joe Schoen and the team's ownership group on ""a daily basis"" regarding every position. ""I think that's very important and healthy for the organization,"" he said. ""If there's changes we need to make, we'll make them. Again, you only have about a week to do this and look at things. But you're always doing that throughout the season after a game. It's just here, you've got some more information. You've got back-to-back-to-back of cutups of things you want to look at.

Atlanta entered the rivalry game undefeated against NFC South opponents, and had won five of six overall. The Saints had lost seven in a row and were playing their first game following the firing of head coach Dennis Allen. Perhaps the biggest surprise was the way Atlanta lost. Despite outgaining the Saints 468-365, the Falcons scored on just three of their 11 drives, and usually reliable kicker Younghoe Koo missed three field goals. Koo, whose 58-yard field goal with seconds to spare beat the Saints on Sep. 29, missed from 53 and 35 yards out in the second quarter, before hitting the upright on what would have been a game-tying 46 yarder with 6:43 left in the fourth. Although kickers are known to have short leashes in the NFL, Atlanta head coach Raheem Morris' belief in Koo remains strong. ""When you talk about Younghoe Koo, you're talking about the guy who hit a 52-yard field goal to send a game to overtime against Tampa, you're talking about a guy who won the game last time we played New Orleans with a walk-off,"" Morris said in Monday's press conference. ""You're talking about a guy that's been clutch for us over the last couple of years in big moments. ""There's going to be times that you don't have the success that you want to have. We still have a lot of football to play, so those percentages will go back up, I believe, because of who he is, what he is and what he's all about."" Atlanta (6-4) still has a two-game lead on the Buccaneers for control of the NFC South. The Falcons now prepare for another playoff hopeful as they travel to Denver for the first time since 2016 to take on the 5-5 Broncos. Denver had the 8-0 Kansas City Chiefs on the ropes Sunday, but Wil Lutz had his 35-yard field goal blocked as time expired, and the Broncos fell 16-14. The 20-point mark has been the key for Atlanta's offense, as the Falcons are 6-0 when reaching that total and 0-4 when they don't. Morris is confident that the unit can replicate its success this week, despite Denver's stingy defense. ""I've got so much respect for (Denver defensive coordinator) Vance Joseph and what they've been able to do on defense. It's been really fun to watch,"" Morris said. ""But I've got so many expectations for our offense, and our ability to execute at a high level.

On the injury front, Morris said cornerback Mike Hughes (neck) has been cleared after leaving Sunday's game with the injury and undergoing an MRI Monday. The Falcons are more worried about defensive lineman Ta'Quon Graham, who suffered a pectoral muscle injury and did not return. Meanwhile, linebacker Troy Andersen (knee) made his long-awaited return from a five-game injury absence but Morris revealed that Andersen reaggravated the injury during the Saints game.

Colorado two-way star Travis Hunter took advantage of Miami's first loss of the season to vault into the favorite seat for the first time this season. Hunter, who caught nine passes for 99 yards and a touchdown in addition to his regular duty as a shutdown corner in Colorado's 41-27 win at Texas Tech on Saturday, is the +130 Heisman Trophy favorite at DraftKings. Hunter has supplanted Hurricanes quarterback Cam Ward, who tumbled to +800 after Miami was upset at Georgia Tech. He is now also behind Boise State running back Ashton Jeanty (+300) and Oregon quarterback Dillon Gabriel (+330). Each of those three have spent at least two weeks as the favorite at different points during the season. They now all find themselves trying to chase down Hunter, who was a +2000 longshot just three weeks ago. After two games in which he caught a combined five passes for 43 yards, Hunter has been heavily featured in the Buffaloes' passing attack in wins over Cincinnati and Texas Tech. Saturday night's nine catches came after Hunter torched the Bearcats for 153 receiving yards and a pair of touchdowns ahead of Colorado's bye week. The Buffs host Utah on Saturday before traveling to Kansas, then return home to close out the regular season against Oklahoma State before a potential date in the Big 12 championship game. HEISMAN TROPHY ODDS (via DraftKings) PLAYER, TEAM, JULY ODDS, WEEK 1, LAST WEEK, CURRENT Travis Hunter, Colorado, N/A, N/A, +220, +130 Ashton Jeanty, Boise State, N/A/, N/A, +500, +300 Dillon Gabriel, Oregon, +750, +800, +290, +330 Cam Ward, Miami, +2200, +950, +200, +800 Kurtis Rourke, Indiana, N/A, N/A, +2200, +1500 Jalen Milroe, Alabama, +1500, +1100, +5000, +1800 Jaxson Dart, Ole Miss, +1400, +850, +1600, +2000 Shedeur Sanders, Colorado, N/A, +2200, +3500, +4000 Quinn Ewers, Texas, +1000, +1400, +6000, +4000 Milroe was the biggest mover of the week, with his rise from -5000 before Alabama's rout at LSU representing the biggest positive odds delta of the week. Jeanty's odds shortened -200 after rushing for 209 yards and three touchdowns in Boise State's 28-21 win over Nevada. Ward suffered the biggest drop among the contenders, seeing his odds lengthen by +600. Sanders' lengthened +500 and Dart's +400 despite leading both of their teams to key victories on Saturday. The Heisman Trophy race has seen significant movement on a weekly basis throughout the season. Should No. 1 Oregon run the table undefeated in the Big Ten, it will likely be difficult for Hunter and Jeanty to hold off Gabriel, who has spent multiple stints atop the Heisman picture this season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Duwelius, who has worked for the Lynx since 2014, will join Unrivaled, the new 3-on-3 professional women's league, as GM and executive vice president. Lynx star Napheesa Collier co-founded Unrivaled, which will begin its first season in January in Miami. Duwelius, who began her tenure with the Lynx as basketball operations coordinator before moving up in the front office, became GM when head coach Cheryl Reeve was named president of basketball operations in 2022. Meanwhile, Smith is returning to her alma mater, Ohio State, to serve as an assistant coach. Smith played from 1992-96 and helped the Buckeyes reach the national title game in 1993. After two championship seasons with Columbus of the ABL, Smith was a seven-time All-Star during her 15 seasons in the WNBA -- including 6 1/2 seasons with the Lynx -- and was a two-time champion with Detroit. A member of the Naismith, Women's Basketball and Ohio State halls of fame, Smith is also a three-time U.S. Olympic gold medalist. Before joining the Lynx's staff in 2020, she was the head coach of the Liberty for two seasons. ""Katie has been an integral part of the Lynx since her return in 2020,"" Lynx coach and president of basketball operations Cheryl Reeve said in a statement. ""She poured her heart and soul into developing the Lynx team and its players into a championship contender once again.

Matthews (upper-body injury) is eligible to come off injured reserve on Tuesday but did not participate in practice on Monday. Toronto will be without Max Pacioretty (lower-body injury), who was placed on IR after he left Saturday's 4-1 victory over the Montreal Canadiens. While Pacioretty is considered week-to-week, Matthews continues to be classified as day-to-day. ""We want to make sure we get ahead of it and hopefully get it behind us once and for all,"" Maple Leafs general manager Brad Treliving said on Monday. ""(Matthews) will remain day-to-day. I would say he is doubtful for (Tuesday) but he skated Saturday and Sunday, so we'll keep going down that path."" Matthews led the league last season with 69 goals and has five this season in 13 games. William Nylander and Max Domi also did not practice on Monday for what was termed a maintenance day. They are expected to play Tuesday. Mitchell Marner had a goal and an assist against Montreal to extend his points streak to eight games (three goals, 10 assists). Morgan Rielly had an assist, joining Borje Salming and Tomas Kaberle as the only Maple Leafs defensemen to record 400 NHL assists. Toronto's power play continues to surge after a 4-for-40 start. The Leafs went 2-for-4 on Saturday and are 11-for-53 on the season. ""I thought we checked extremely well for two periods,"" coach Craig Berube said. ""The power play was good again. Clean pretty much with penalties and I thought we played a real smart game. I was really happy. Third period they made a little push but our goalie (Joseph Woll) was really good for us."" The Senators won for the second time in five games Saturday, posting a 3-2 overtime road victory over the Boston Bruins. The Senators improved to 2-5-0 on the road on Saturday when Brady Tkachuk scored 21 seconds into overtime. It was his 12th shot on goal. ""I think the last two games for myself, individually, I haven't liked the way I've been playing with the puck,"" said Tkachuk, who also had an assist. ""It's just something that I want to focus on, that every time I have an opportunity to shoot -- that I'm pretty confident in my shot -- that every time I have the puck on my stick, that has a chance to go in, so I have to start utilizing that more."" Senators coach Travis Green was impressed with his team's performance from start to finish. ""We've challenged our guys the last couple days here to play more consistent,"" Green said. ""Play faster, play harder, and they responded in a really good game for 60 minutes."" ""We really showed what kind of team we are,"" said Ottawa goaltender Linus Ullmark, who made 14 saves against his former team. ""It's a statement game, so to speak. We have to learn this is the sort of game we have to play every night, not just here and there."" Ottawa received good news on the injury front when Shane Pinto (undisclosed) said that he will be able to play on Tuesday. He has missed the past eight games. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Del Rio, 61, was taken by police to a local hospital for a blood draw, according to the incident report. Del Rio joined Badgers head coach Luke Fickell's staff this season as a senior adviser. Fickell addressed Del Rio's arrest in his weekly Monday press conference. ""He's going to move forward and he's going to resign and move on,"" Fickell said. ""But it's a tough situation.

Tuesday's game is part of the NBA Cup, which features six groups of five teams. The Sixers and Knicks are part of East Group A, along with the Brooklyn Nets, Orlando Magic and Charlotte Hornets. The group-play contest also is a showdown between two squads off to a slow start. Philadelphia's plan to showcase the dynamic trio of Embiid, Tyrese Maxey and Paul George had been put on the backburner. Embiid missed the entire preseason and the first nine regular-season games -- first while managing left knee soreness and more recently due to a three-game suspension for shoving a reporter. George (knee) sat out the first five games and has played the last four, but not long after he returned, Maxey had a hamstring injury that will sideline him for multiple weeks. The availability issues have left the Sixers in an early-season funk. They blew a 16-point fourth-quarter lead Sunday against Charlotte before recovering to win 107-105 in overtime to snap a five-game losing streak. ""We should still be playing at a high level and competing, trying to win games,"" George said. ""But no doubt about it, you get somebody back like (Embiid), it'll make everybody's job a little easier."" Embiid averaged a career-high 34.7 points and 11.0 rebounds while being limited to 39 games due to injury last season. He had a terrific shooting year from the field (52.9 percent), the 3-point arc (38.8 percent) and the foul line (88.3), all while averaging career highs in assists (5.6) and steals (1.2). ""I mean, obviously, we're not where we want to be without the big fella,"" George said. ""Someone as talented as him ... obviously, he's the (missing) piece."" Embiid's first challenge will be to exact some revenge on the Knicks, who eliminated the Sixers in the first round of last season's playoffs. New York's Jalen Brunson averaged 35.5 points and 9.0 assists in that six-game series, while Josh Hart (16.8 points, 12.3 rebounds, 4.5 assists), was all over the court. Embiid averaged 33.0 points and 10.8 rebounds, while Maxey scored in 29.8 points per contest. ""We're resilient,"" Brunson said after New York finished off Philadelphia in Game 6. ""No matter what the outside people say, positive or negative, we know what we've got to do. We're going to stick together and that's not going to change with us. I like that that's how we think."" The Knicks' resilience has been put to the test already this season. New York has dropped three of its last four games -- including double-digit defeats against the Houston Rockets and Indiana Pacers. Brunson (33 points) and first-year Knick Karl-Anthony Towns (30) paced New York in Sunday's 132-121 defeat to Indiana, as the team was doomed by its own 7-of-25 shooting from 3-point range, combined with a 21-of-46 effort from long range by the Pacers. ""We gave up way too much,"" Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""(We) didn't cover the (3-point) line. We gotta fix it, and we gotta fix it fast. ... We have to be strong on both sides of the ball. If we're just gonna rely on offense, we're not gonna be a good team."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

But Eberflus maintained on Monday that moving rookie No. 1 pick Caleb Williams out of the starting lineup is not one of the many changes he's considering as the Bears shift their attention to the Green Bay Packers.  ""Caleb is our starter,"" Eberflus said, but declared an evaluation of the process of almost everything the team does offensively would be evaluated on Monday. ""There's got to be a change and adjustment,"" Eberflus said. ""There's also the sight that we're 4-5, we haven't played our division yet. ... We're in the process of getting (that evaluation) done. There will be changes and adjustments being made.""  Williams and the Bears were dominated by the New England Patriots (3-7) on Sunday, Chicago's third consecutive loss, and head into Week 11 with a run of 23 consecutive possessions without a touchdown. The Bears scored three points against the Patriots, one week after putting up nine points at Arizona, and were held under 17 points for the fifth time this season. New England sacked Williams nine times one week after the Cardinals posted six sacks against Chicago. Offensive coordinator Shane Waldron received a vote of confidence coming out of the loss to Arizona. But Eberflus didn't guarantee Waldron would be calling plays when the Bears host the Packers (6-3) this Sunday. ""The process of that, we're going through that right now. All those adjustments and changes and things that we're gonna do, we're still in the evaluation phase of that,"" Eberflus said.  Eberflus, 14-29 since he was hired in 2022, is 0-4 against the Packers. His only win against the NFC North to date was 12-10 at Minnesota last season. Williams threw four touchdown passes in a Week 6 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in London and none in the three games since the bye week. He's on pace to be sacked more than 70 times, and the Bears were 1 of 14 on third down against the Patriots, producing 142 total yards and 2.4 yards per play. Williams had 69 net passing yards when the 51 yards lost on New England's quarterback sacks were eliminated. Multiple questions were directed to Eberflus on Monday about whether Waldron would call plays and even remain on his coaching staff. Waldron was selected from a pool of candidates to replace Luke Getsy as offensive coordinator. He was previously with the Seattle Seahawks from 2021-23.  ""It's important that we're using all the people in the building on the coaching staff, getting all the input, putting our minds together to come up with the best answer,"" Eberflus said. ""That's where we are right now. We've got to look at that this afternoon as well."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

When the teams meet Tuesday night in Orlando for their NBA Cup group-play opener, the Magic will try to improve to 5-0 at home. They are coming off a huge second half that helped them crush the Washington Wizards 121-94 on Sunday by scoring 60 points after halftime.   Forward Franz Wagner scored 23 points as the Magic recorded a season-high point total. Wagner has led Orlando in scoring for the past five games.   The Magic now have a season-best three-game winning streak in their sights. They are still adjusting to the absences of injured Paolo Banchero (oblique) and Wendell Carter Jr. (foot), with the responsibility to make up for that production spread around the team.   ""I'm just going to keep trying to put these performances together, keep running my way back into the lineup and just do what I can do,"" said Magic guard Cole Anthony, who scored 16 points off the bench against Washington.   The Hornets fell 107-105 in overtime Sunday against the host Philadelphia 76ers after rallying from 16 points down with 9:44 remaining in regulation.   ""We'll grow from this and learn from it,"" Charlotte coach Charles Lee said.   Guard LaMelo Ball racked up 38 points and eight assists for Charlotte, which is 1-3 in road games. Ball hit a game-tying 3-pointer from the left corner as he was fading out of bounds to force overtime.   ""I expect it every game, so it's not anything surprising,"" teammate Brandon Miller said of Ball. ""That's what he does -- play at a high clip in this league, and he's going to keep getting better every day.""   Ball has scored more than 30 points in four of the last six games.   Anthony has averaged just 12.1 minutes per game to start the season but he is still playing with an edge, something that was evident after he drained a 3-pointer in Sunday's game.   ""He made the 3 on the right wing and came back and stared at me the whole time like he had just made six in a row,"" Orlando coach Jamahl Mosley said. ""But that's who he is ... that fearless, confident leader on the floor when he's out there.""   Anthony is looking to bounce back from a ragged start to the season, averaging 4.8 points per game and shooting 26.3 percent from 3-point range.   ""Obviously it hasn't been the start to the season that I would have liked, but I'm hopeful,"" Anthony said. ""I continue to just put my head down, grind, do what I need to do on and off the court. I'm just going to keep trying to put these performances together.""   The Hornets have been dinged with injuries at the post positions, which makes their 50-40 rebounding edge against the 76ers encouraging.   In the Hornets' backcourt, Tre Mann has been dealing with back soreness to put his availability in question. He has been a spark off the bench.   This will be Orlando's third game in a five-game homestand. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The storied programs will meet for the first time since the 2021 edition of the event, when the Blue Devils topped the Wildcats 79-71 in New York. Tuesday's matchup will look a lot different from the sidelines, as that was the final meeting between legendary coaches Mike Krzyzewski and John Calipari. Krzyzewski retired as Duke's head coach after that 2021-22 season, and Calipari bolted for Arkansas in April. They were replaced by Jon Scheyer and Mark Pope, respectively. Scheyer, in his third year at his alma mater, has the Blue Devils 2-0 after blowing past a pair of outmatched opponents. Behind freshman phenom Cooper Flagg and fellow first-year player Kon Knueppel, Duke topped Maine 96-62 and Army 100-58. When Flagg committed to Duke in October 2023, the 6-foot-9 Maine native became 247 Sports' second all-time perfect-rated recruit to commit to the Blue Devils, joining RJ Barrett. Through two games, the projected No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft is averaging 15.5 points and 9.0 rebounds per game. Knueppel leads Duke with 18.5 points per game. Despite Duke's leaders being just a year removed from high school, Scheyer doesn't think his team lacks any poise. ""It's been that way from Day 1, since we recruited these guys,"" Scheyer said of Duke's maturity. ""I think all of that is contagious. ... I think our freshmen are mature beyond their years. They're about the right things. They're about being coached, and I'm lucky to coach these guys. They want to be here, and I think that needs to show even more as we face adversity this season."" Duke's youngsters will face their first big test on Tuesday against the new-look Wildcats. Kentucky didn't return a single contributor from last season, filling out its roster with a flurry of transfer additions. So far, it's been the signings of Dayton transfer Koby Brea and former Oklahoma guard Otega Oweh that have led the 2-0 Wildcats. Brea, who shot 49.8 percent on 3-pointers for the Flyers last year, paces the team with 19.0 points per game, followed by Oweh's 15.5. In a 100-72 rout of Bucknell on Saturday, Brea led the Wildcats with 20 points on six 3-pointers off the bench. ""I'm really proud of Koby,"" Pope said. ""Like all of our guys, he's trying to figure out his space and how he fits, and if it's really going to work or not. He's boldly committed to loving this game as much as he can. ... He's been really special."" Drexel transfer Amari Williams has added 12.5 points and 13.5 rebounds per game, while Wake Forest transfer Andrew Carr has chipped in 11.0 points.

Since taking over for two-time national champion coach Jay Wright, Neptune has missed the NCAA Tournament in each of his first two seasons at Villanova. The Wildcats (2-1) then absorbed a 10-point home loss to Columbia last week before recovering with a crisp 91-54 victory over NJIT on Friday. Still, Neptune knows there will be plenty of eyes on Villanova's progress as he navigates Year 3 of his tenure. ""For sure, we haven't performed to the standard of where Villanova basketball has been,"" Neptune said. ""If that's the truth, OK. The only thing I can do is worry about what myself and our staff can control, and that's trying to prepare this team to be the best it can be by the end of the season, and doing that with joy and doing that with a positive attitude."" Eric Dixon registered 22 points and 10 rebounds in the win over NJIT and is averaging 27.5 points and eight boards in his two games this season. He'll certainly be a focus of the defensive game plan for the Hawks, who are looking to rebound from a 73-67 loss to Central Connecticut State. Rasheer Fleming led Saint Joseph's with 19 points and 16 rebounds. ""We're not there yet,"" said Saint Joseph's coach Billy Lange, who added that his team is ""still working through voice commands"" on the defensive end. The series between Villanova and Saint Joe's, known as the ""Holy War,"" dates back to 1921. The Wildcats had won 11 matchups in a row before losing 78-65 last November. This game is part of the Big 5 Classic series, in which the six Division I programs in the Philadelphia area compete for the city crown. The victory over Villanova last season helped Saint Joe's win under the new Big 5 format, which also includes Temple, La Salle, Drexel and Penn.

Sabres star Tage Thompson scored his team-leading 11th goal of the season, but left the game early in the second period with a lower-body injury. Sam Montembeault turned aside all four shots he faced in relief of Cayden Primeau, while Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen made 14 saves on 18 shots before being pulled. Suzuki finished with two goals and one assist, while Juraj Slafkovsky tallied three assists. Josh Anderson got the Canadiens on the board less than five minutes into the contest. But just 24 seconds later, the red-hot Thompson tied it up, extending his goal-scoring streak to four games. Caufield first struck on the power play, as with 14:34 to go in the second period the sniper redirected Lane Hutson's no-look pass from the point into the net. Once again, the Sabres refused to go away as Dylan Cozens and Peyton Krebs each found the back of the net just 59 seconds apart to retake the lead for Buffalo.

Ole Miss coach Chris Beard acknowledged that his team didn't play its best last time out, but he pointed out that the Tigers had seven returning starters from last year's team, which won the SWAC regular-season and tournament titles and won a game in the NCAA Tournament before losing to eventual national runner-up Purdue. So the close call maybe should not have been all that surprising, and the bottom line was the final score. ""I'm not pleased with the way we played for 40 minutes, but I am pleased that we won the game,"" Beard said. ""We have lots to learn from. We've got to play better, obviously."" The Rebels struggled with their 3-point shooting, making just 6 of 26, though Beard is unconcerned about that aspect of their game overall. ""We're going to be a good 3-point shooting team. It's who we are,"" Beard said. ""This game the three wasn't our friend. Some of that was self-inflicted with our shot selection, but there were a lot of threes that we're going to take all day every day."" Ole Miss was able to overcome the poor 3-point shooting in part because of a disparity in turnovers. The Rebels scored 26 points off 22 Grambling turnovers and they committed just six turnovers themselves, leading to 11 Grambling points. Another area that Ole Miss plans to work on before it faces South Alabama is its rebounding. The Tigers outrebounded the Rebels 39-33, leading to an 11-4 advantage in second-chance points. ""(Rebounding) will continue to be a focus,"" Beard said. ""That's something we've got to get cleaned up."" In the end Ole Miss was able to overcome a 12-point second-half deficit thanks to a 20-0 run, though the game still went to the wire. Dre Davis led four players in double figures with 13 points; Jaylen Murray paces the Rebels with a 17.0 scoring average thus far. South Alabama evened its record with a 70-64 road victory against Nicholls State last Friday. It trailed by four points before finishing with a 15-5 run in the final five minutes. The Jaguars are hoping to build on that victory, because a point of emphasis for seventh-year head coach Richie Riley is for his team to hit its stride earlier than it has in recent seasons. Last season the Jaguars won six of their last eight Sun Belt Conference regular-season games and finished 16-16 overall. Two years ago, they won 11 of their final 14 games to finish 19-16. ""I do feel like this team is operating at a much higher urgency level than we've operated at in a long time,"" Riley said. ""We want to get off to a better start. The calling card of our team is we get better as the year goes on. We need to play better early."" Myles Corey has averaged 19.0 points and 9.5 assists through two games. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Broncos kicker Wil Lutz lined up for a 35-yard field-goal attempt Sunday as time was set to expire, but the attempt was blocked by the Chiefs' Leo Chenal, who charged right through the middle of the Denver line. The undefeated Chiefs escaped with a 16-14 victory, leaving the Broncos at a crossroad with a 5-5 record. ""They exploited an area that we obviously felt was fixed and stronger, but not fixed enough,"" Payton said Monday. ""I read all the comments afterwards, and I think that it's tough to lose a game that way. This isn't on the player. This is on all of us. This is on us as coaches. ""We've got to continue to look at, ‘Hey, are we big enough stature-wise there for that?' And understanding how the rush was coming. It's disappointing."" Payton clarified the area that was exploited. ""They felt like they had an indication relative to how (center Alex Forsyth's) weight was balanced,"" Payton said. ""All of that is game planning, scouting and then it's us coaching and looking at the self-scout. Again, it's nothing new."" The Broncos are merely third in the AFC West, but with the conference's muddled postseason picture, Denver is currently in possession of the seventh and final playoff spot. The Broncos are listed with a 51 percent playoff probability. And while Sunday ended in a heartbreaking defeat, the Broncos can also look at it as a near miss, on the road against an undefeated team that also won the last two Super Bowls. ""The sky is not falling,"" Payton said. ""There's a lot ahead obviously."" Of the seven games still on the schedule, the Broncos face four teams currently out of the AFC's playoff picture. But they have still have to face the 6-4 Atlanta Falcons on Sunday and finish the regular season with a rematch against the Chiefs. The advantage for Denver is that both of those games are at home. ""I like the leadership on this team. It's an entirely different team than a year ago,"" Payton said. ""It's (a) tough (team) mentally and physically. ... Listen, when you talk to the players about that (loss), you tell them, ‘Hey, that's going to happen periodically in your career.' ""You hope that you have a few of those games that maybe you thought that you didn't deserve to win that you did win. You have to bounce back either way."" That optimism is further fueled by the play of rookie quarterback Bo Nix, who has completed 63.6 percent of his passes for 1,968 yards and 10 touchdowns with six interceptions. He also has 290 yards rushing with four more TDs. ""Offensively, we played that team better than we have in the past with what they do,"" Payton said. ""We had some scoring opportunities certainly at the end of the (first) half that we didn't take a good enough advantage of."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Howard returned home after a good workout with the Bengals and plans to continue training in hopes of another opportunity, per the report. Howard, 31, played in 100 games (99 starts) for the Miami Dolphins from 2016-23. The Dolphins released Howard on March 13 in a cost-cutting move, saving an estimated $18.5 million. The Bengals (4-6) are looking for help in the secondary as they try to make a playoff push. Howard tallied 29 interceptions (two returned for touchdowns), 95 passes defensed and 331 tackles with Miami. The Bengals also reportedly had veteran running back Leonard Fournette in for a workout, but they went on to sign running back Gary Brightwell to their practice squad, according to Brightwell's agent. The Bengals were eyeing Fournette for their practice squad, per reports. The team traded for Khalil Herbert last week after placing RB Zack Moss (neck) on injured reserve. Fournette, 29, appeared in two games last year with the Buffalo Bills, rushing for 40 yards on 12 carries. The former No. 4 overall pick in 2017 has rushed for 4,518 yards and 34 touchdowns in 81 games (61 starts) for the Jacksonville Jaguars (2017-19), Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2020-22) and Bills. Brightwell, 25, played in 37 games across the 2021-23 seasons for the New York Giants, getting 41 carries for 164 yards and a touchdown. He started this season with the Cleveland Browns but saw limited playing time in two appearances before he was released. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Sam Houston State (1-1) beat Tarleton 91-62 on Saturday behind 15 points apiece from Dorian Finister and Lamar Wilkerson. Kian Scroggins scored 14 points and had eight rebounds. The Bearkats won the Conference USA regular-season crown last year. Baylor (1-1) bounced back from its season-opening, 101-63 loss to No. 6 Gonzaga with a 72-67 win on Saturday against No. 16 Arkansas. Jayden Nunn scored 16 points and Norchad Omier had a double-double with 15 points and 12 rebounds. Baylor dropped four spots in Associated Press Top 25 poll released Monday. The Bears had five players score in double figures against Arkansas, which is the kind of balanced approach coach Scott Drew wants as Baylor newcomers get acquainted with the returnees. There are nine new players on the Bears' roster and Drew knows it'll take time before the team jells. Not only did Baylor open the season against a pair of ranked teams, the nonconference schedule still features St. John's, Tennessee or Virginia in the Bahamas and a trip to play UConn, the two-time defending national champions. ""Here's the thing with new players: They are out there learning what you want and how to run stuff,"" Drew said. ""They are out there thinking and if you are thinking you are not playing. Returning players already know what you want them to do, so they are able to play. That's why these guys will all play better, shoot it better and perform better as the season goes on."" While nothing seemed to go right against Gonzaga on Monday, by the time Saturday rolled around, the Bears executed a game plan that valued possessions and handled Arkansas' pressure defense. The game was tied twice, but Arkansas never held a lead. Drew credited the Bears with taking care of the basketball on offense. Baylor only had eight turnovers and were able to get more defensive stops, which allowed them to play in transition. ""We took care of the ball and shared it a lot more,"" Drew said. ""We took much better shots and defended a lot better. It was a typical Baylor game."" The Bearkats hope a rugged nonconference schedule prepares them for meaningful games in February and March. They were 21-12 overall last season and 13-3 in Conference USA play. As the No. 1 seed in the Conference USA tournament, they were eliminated with a semifinal loss to UTEP. It's the kind of success that made nonconference games hard to come by, with potential opponents reticent to face the Bearkats after they put themselves on the map last season. ""This is a really tough nonconference schedule,"" Sam Houston State coach Chris Mudge said. ""I thought last year was tough in the nonconference and then we anted up on this one. It's difficult to get games when you have a good year. People don't want to play you."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The game is an NBA Cup group-play opener for both teams. The Heat and Pistons are part of the tournament's East Group B, which also includes the Indiana Pacers, Milwaukee Bucks and Toronto Raptors. Nikola Jovic's three-point play with 7.8 seconds left proved to be the difference in a 95-94 triumph over the Timberwolves. Miami lost to Sacramento, Phoenix and Denver prior to the one-point thriller. The Heat trailed 88-80 with less than five minutes remaining. ""That was a signature win for us,"" Heat center Bam Adebayo said. After a timeout, Duncan Robinson inbounded the ball to Jovic, who was moving off a back screen. ""It is extremely difficult to generate an open shot on a side out of bounds, particularly against a team that is well coached, they have great length,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""So we were just fortunate. Duncan made a great pass, Niko made a great cut."" Tyler Herro has carried the offense lately, leading the team in scoring in the last four games by averaging 26.3 points. The biggest development Sunday was the defensive effort. Minnesota's point total was the lowest allowed by Miami this season. ""This is the hardest we've played in any of the regular-season games this season,"" Spoelstra said. ""It's the message we tell our team all the time, that does not guarantee you anything. It doesn't. But you put yourself out there as a competitor, you give yourself the best collective chance to win in a tough building. ""This is a tough team, an experienced team and it requires everybody on the roster playing as hard as they can, leaving it all out there and then you obviously have to make plays, which we did at the end."" Miami played without Jimmy Butler, who sprained his right ankle against the Nuggets. There is a good chance he will sit out Tuesday as well. The Pistons' last three games haven't been decided until the closing seconds. They lost to the Houston Rockets 101-99 on Sunday. Tobias Harris had a chance to tie the game on two free throws with one second remaining. He missed the first, forcing him to intentionally miss the second in a futile attempt for a tip-in off a rebound. ""Obviously that's tough, but we trust Tobias to knock his free throws down,"" Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""He just missed it."" Detroit saw Houston grab 17 offensive rebounds, including some key putbacks in the late going. ""I thought our guys did a great job in the scrap; there were times when they beat us to the ball, which is what they've done and what's helped them win basketball games,"" Bickerstaff said. ""I thought our guys fought the fight. We gave ourselves an opportunity, but (seven) offensive rebounds in the fourth quarter; it's just too tough to overcome."" Cade Cunningham's three-game triple-double streak ended, though he came close to extending it. He finished with 26 points, eight rebounds and nine assists. The Pistons got some good news on Monday. Second-year forward Ausar Thompson has been cleared to play after dealing with blood clot issues. However, he may have trouble cracking the rotation Bickerstaff has used through the first 11 games. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The event, which also features No. 7 Duke and No. 23 Kentucky, is in Atlanta for the first time since 2012, when it was held at the Georgia Dome. The 2024 edition features the nation's top team, but its nothing new for the Jayhawks and Spartans to seek out early measuring sticks. Kansas (2-0) breezed past Howard 87-57 on Nov. 4 in its season opener before fending off No. 9 North Carolina 92-89 on Friday. The Jayhawks saw their 20-point, first-half lead disappear at home against the Tar Heels but scored the game's final five points for their first marquee win of the season. South Dakota State transfer guard Zeke Mayo led Kansas with 21 points off the bench, while fifth-year senior Hunter Dickinson recorded 20 points and 10 rebounds. Mayo, a Lawrence, Kan., native and last season's Summit League Player of the Year, leads his new team with an average of 20 points per game. ""(Zeke) met the opportunity with flying colors,"" Kansas coach Bill Self said of his performance on Friday. ""He was fantastic. He made a couple of plays off the bounce that were just fantastic. He was great, and we needed everything he gave us."" Alongside Mayo, Dickinson -- the Big 12 Preseason Player of the Year -- and KJ Adams Jr. return to the Jayhawks, averaging 18 and 10.5 points per game, respectively. Kansas is 8-5 all-time in the Champions Classic, including 2-2 against the Spartans.  The teams most recently met in the event in 2021, with Kansas winning 87-74. Even though his team is favored in Tuesday's game, Self knows not to underestimate a Tom Izzo-coached team. ""Playing Tom's teams is different because he runs more sets than anybody in the country,"" Self said. ""Getting your guys prepared for what they do, it'll be a multi-day scout."" The Spartans (2-0) have blown out two outmatched opponents this season, beating Monmouth 81-57 and Niagara 96-60. Michigan State's top two scorers are both returnees in Jaden Akins -- who is averaging 16.5 points a game -- and Jaxon Kohler (12.5).  Kohler had 20 points and 13 rebounds against Niagara in a lopsided victory, but Izzo knows Tuesday will be a different story. ""We were able to get the ball inside and outside; we had 52 points in the paint,"" Izzo said. ""I don't think that's going to happen on Tuesday night, but it's all about setting the tempo. What we've been doing well is what we've got to continue to do. I think we have some versatility inside and out, and I like the way we've moved the ball.""

Although the Dolphins are 2-6 with three consecutive losses, Miami is far more competitive than the record indicates since starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa returned from a four-game hiatus on injured reserve with a concussion. Miami narrowly lost twice since Tagovailoa stepped back into the start job. The Dolphins dropped a one-point decision to Arizona and were also beaten by Buffalo by a field goal margin. As for the Rams (4-4), they'll look to keep their playoff hopes alive by extending their winning streak to four games and keeping their noses up with the rest of the pack in the NFC West. Given both teams' firepower on offense when healthy, this matchup looks tailor-made to produce a high-scoring affair.  --Dolphins' offense energized with Tagovailoa's return  The Dolphins scored 27 points in back-to-back games with Tagovailoa returning to rescue a group putting up less than two touchdowns per game without him. His presence alone tends to have a calming effect on the offense based on his accuracy and ability to put the ball exactly where he wants it to go. Tagovailoa completed 69.3 percent of his passes last season and is up to 72.7 percent this season. The Dolphins are more likely to remain on schedule with Tagovailoa, who has the fifth-highest success rate among quarterbacks with a minimum of 140 plays. When you're picking up the necessary yardage on early downs, you'll have more flexibility with your playcalling. In their last two games, the Dolphins converted 65.2 percent of their third-down opportunities and 6-for-8 in touchdown conversions inside the red zone. While the offense can sometimes resemble a slow grind, the Dolphins' efficiency under Tagovailoa makes them a real threat to opposing defenses. We're eyeing the over on Tagovailoa completions -- set at 21.5 at DraftKings, ESPN Bet and FanDuel -- given his high-percentage horizontal route connections with wide receivers Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle and the additional threat of running back De'Von Achane. Tagovailoa was 25 of 28 (89.3 percent) at Buffalo last week and 28 of 38 in his first game back from IR.  --Pass defense a mutual concern Los Angeles had its share of injury woes, with wide receivers Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua combining to miss seven games. Both players are now back with the team to significantly boost the Rams offense. The passing game is vital for the Rams because they struggle to run the ball, ranking 31st in yards per carry (3.8). As a result, it's no surprise that Los Angeles has the ninth-highest pass play rate at 58.68 percent. Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford should be eager for his chance to face this Dolphins defense. According to the FTN Fantasy Defense-adjusted Value Over Average (DVOA) metric, Miami ranks 27th against the pass. However, the Rams' pass defense is only one spot better.  Pro Football Focus offers a similar view. It has the Dolphins 26th in pass coverage while grading the Rams as the third worst in this category. Hence, we play the points. This total opened at 47.5 and was bet up as high as 49.5 before we began to see a little bit of buyback. It's now settling at 49 at most sportsbooks. As of Monday morning, 48.5 was still available at FanDuel. In a perfect scenario -- or close to perfect health for both teams -- this number would probably be closer to 52.  Do not pass: take the value and run with it.  Best bet: over 48.5 points (-115 at FanDuel) --Michael Nwaneri, Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Before Williams left for his Korean War assignment, he had dinner with legendary sportswriter Grantland Rice. According to the superb book “The Wingmen: The Unlikely, Unusual, Unbreakable Friendship Between John Glenn and Ted Williams” by Adam Lazarus, Williams understood the stakes. “Then he said—and this is what I can’t get out of my mind,” Rice told fellow New York sportswriter Frank Graham, “(he said) ‘I expect to be killed, of course.’” Berra and Williams are two of the many examples of remarkable athletes who didn’t limit their greatness to the playing field—and risked their lives to do it. Veterans Day represents a wonderful opportunity to relive their sacrifices for the United States of America. Ty Cobb, Warren Spahn, Bobby Jones, David Robinson, Hank Greenberg, Chuck Bednarik and Hoyt Wilhelm are among other athletes who saw active duty or worked as intelligence officers. Bob Feller, who was perhaps the greatest pitcher of his day, enlisted in the Naval Reserve two days after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. Serving as a gun captain on the USS Alabama, Feller earned eight battle stars and six campaign ribbons in North Atlantic and Pacific theaters. After missing nearly four full seasons of his prime, Feller was discharged on Aug. 22, 1945, and earned a complete-game win over the World Series-bound Detroit Tigers two days later. By no means are former Major League Baseball legends the only ones to come to their country’s aid. After four years as a safety for the Arizona Cardinals, Pat Tillman and his brother, Kevin (an Anaheim Angels pitcher), enlisted in the Army in May 2002 as their response to 9/11. They trained to join the Army Rangers, and their regiment was deployed to Iraq and then Afghanistan as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Tillman was killed April 22, 2004, in Afghanistan by friendly fire during a firefight. Forty years before, Roger Staubach enjoyed a wondrous athletic career at Navy. In addition to earning the 1963 Heisman Trophy and being featured on the cover of Time magazine (he was pushed off the cover of Life due to John F. Kennedy’s assassination), Staubach excelled for three years on the baseball team (batting .420 as a sophomore) and received two letters on the basketball team. Upon graduation in 1965, Staubach immediately began to serve his five-year commitment to the Navy, which included one year in Vietnam. He entered the NFL in 1969 as a 27-year-old rookie with the Dallas Cowboys, who had the foresight to spend their 10th-round pick in the 1964 NFL Draft on Staubach. Within three years, Staubach led the Cowboys to the Super Bowl championship. He was awarded the Super Bowl MVP award, which came with a Dodge Charger. Staubach traded it in for a station wagon—the better to transport his three young kids.  Staubach’s Cowboys and Rocky Bleier’s Pittsburgh Steelers met more than once in the Super Bowl—and Bleier’s military journey was more harrowing than Staubach’s. After playing his rookie year in Pittsburgh, Bleier was drafted into the Army. He went to Vietnam and suffered multiple injuries in August 1969. He was shot in the thigh during an ambush. Not long after during that firefight, he saw a grenade bounce off his commanding officer’s back. “It rolls toward me and I wasn’t but three feet from him as I was sitting there,” Bleier told the American Veterans Center. “I got up to jump and it blew up and I was standing on top of it… I had nerve damage coming up out of my (right) foot, broken bones under my foot. Fortunately I didn’t lose any part of my foot.” During his lengthy recovery that included several surgeries, Bleier was told he would not play football again. Instead, he played 10 more seasons with the Steelers and won four Super Bowls to go with his Purple Heart and Silver Star. “Because I became a story and because we were successful, it put Vietnam on the top of the list,” Bleier said. “So all those Vietnam veterans out there who were repressed, who didn’t get the credit or the pat on the back, all of a sudden, here was one of ours that made it. And got through and got recognition for his service, which the rest of us can ride on his coattails or whatever it might be. But it was well-deserved (recognition) that we all should have gotten at that time.”  Copyright 2024"

He has never once played 70 games in a season. And when Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Marcus Hayes criticized Embiid's work ethic, lack of conditioning and pattern of unavailability, it didn't go over well with the 2022-23 NBA MVP. Embiid hasn't played yet this season due to a left knee injury plus the three-game suspension he earned for shoving Hayes after a game on Nov. 2. Embiid was irritated with the reporter for a few reasons, one being that he mentioned the name of the center's dead brother and young son, both named Arthur, in the highly critical column. Embiid certainly has the right to be upset and to deliver sharp words at the reporter—dang, what was the over-under on profane words during the confrontation? No matter what the topic, the second an athlete gets physical with a reporter, they have lost the battle and the war. While announcing the suspension, high-ranking NBA executive Joe Dumars included this nugget in his statement: ""Interactions must remain professional on both sides and can never turn physical."" Keep your hands off, Joel. You're 30 years old. You've been frustrated with the things this whole season. Instead of pushing somebody, have the team set you up with counseling to help figure out why you have so much anger. Embiid, of course, is a spectacular player who has career averages of 27.9 points and 11.2 rebounds. He led the NBA in scoring back-to-back seasons and had a solid chance to do so again last season before injuring the left knee in late January. He underwent surgery on Feb. 6 and later returned to action, but he hobbled through the playoffs. The knee certainly didn't recover because here he is still battling more issues with it. The 76ers need the seven-time All-Star on the floor to make a run at a title. But even with Embiid, Philadelphia hasn't reached the Eastern Conference finals during his career, let alone the NBA Finals. The more the 76ers come up short, the more people question whether Embiid will ever get Philadelphia to the finals. The 76ers last title came in 1983, when NBA MVP Moses Malone and basketball icon Julius Erving led the way. The 76ers added Paul George in the offseason to help with the title quest, and Tyrese Maxey, who just injured a hamstring, is also part of a star-studded trio. But no matter who you break it down, the 76ers need Embiid on the floor. They are a dreadful 2-7, and five of the losses have been by double digits. Embiid is eligible to return from his suspension on Tuesday against the New York Knicks. Those are the same Knicks that eliminated Philadelphia in the first round of last season's playoffs. There's no guarantee Embiid's knee will be ready for the contest against the Knicks. And that's kind of the real problem—when will that knee allow him to take the court and be a dominant force? Because once he's playing games and putting up 30-plus points every night, this whole situation will disappear. The focus will return to his skills, and the 76ers should start winning more games. But exploding on a reporter—even if the Arthur stuff was unnecessary—is not a good look for the so-called face of the franchise. Embiid has seemed to be one of those players that could spend his entire career with one organization. If that doesn't happen, consider the recent weeks as the beginning of the road out of town. Embiid made a big mistake. He'll choose his path moving forward. But big Joel, maybe keep your hands off the working stiffs in the future. Copyright 2024"

Houston was up 23-7 at intermission. Detroit quarterback Jared Goff had already been picked off three times, Texans counterpart C.J. Stroud had completed 70 percent of his passes, and the Lions had never faced such a deficit this season. What could go wrong? A lot, apparently. Detroit stormed all the way back, keeping Houston off the scoreboard in the second half and winning 26-23 on Jake Bates’ 52-yard field goal as time expired. So, make that three losses in four games for the once-mighty Texans, who were 5-1 through their first six games of the season. Injuries have been the main reason for Houston’s steady decline, with a bum hamstring forcing Nico Collins to miss the past five games and fellow wide receiver Stefon Diggs done for the year because of a torn ACL. If the Texans were in any other division than the AFC South, which currently features three teams that a handful of high school JV squads could probably give a run for their money, they would really be in a tight spot. But luckily for Houston, it still has some room for error. However, each setback gives the Indianapolis Colts a reason to keep chasing that division crown. Indianapolis (4-6) is the only team that the 6-4 Texans have to keep their eye on in the AFC South, as the Tennessee Titans (2-7) and Jacksonville Jaguars (2-8) might as well start scheduling offseason vacation plans. There’s a very real possibility that the Colts go 6-1 to close out the campaign. Yes, an optimistic prediction for sure, but colliding with the New York Jets, New England Patriots, New York Giants, Titans and Jaguars could result in a lot of late-season success.  Win those games, then beat either the Broncos or Lions, and congrats, Indianapolis. A 6-1 finish for a 10-7 record. Down Denver and Detroit, and now you’ve shattered all expectations.  Of course, this Colts team has plenty of problems of its own and hasn’t really been able to click all season despite having some serious talent, especially on the offensive side of the ball. Still, Indianapolis can say it has life, which a number of teams would kill for heading into Week 11. After a loss like the one it had on Sunday, Houston could easily go off the rails. It has great opportunities to bounce back ahead of its Week 14 bye -- facing the Dallas Cowboys, Titans and Jaguars -- but dropping any of those games really creates some cause for concern. Following their brief hiatus, the Texans will be greeted by a healthy version of the Miami Dolphins before taking on the Kansas City Chiefs and Baltimore Ravens. Then it’s down to Nashville for the regular-season finale against the Titans. Houston was already on a very slippery slope, and handing off a win to Detroit on Sunday certainly didn’t help it find its footing. The Texans shouldn’t be all that worried just yet, but if they do end up slipping in the standings, what happened in Week 10 won’t soon be forgotten. Copyright 2024"
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",It’s Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson Fight Week and I’m Embarrassingly Excited About It,https://deadspin.com/its-jake-paul-vs-mike-tyson-fight-week-and-im-embarrassingly-excited-about-it/,2024-11-11T13:48:13.575Z,"Jake Paul fights Mike Tyson on Friday November 15th on Netflix, and this fight is highly anticipated because of the unique nature of the matchup.","Top influencer boxer Jake Paul fights the legendary Mike Tyson on Friday, and I am embarrassed to admit just how excited I am for this.  The fight was originally scheduled for July 20, but had to be postponed after a medical scare for Tyson on an airplane, which was later diagnosed as an ulcer flare-up. Between these two dates, Paul hosted a surprisingly exciting fight against former UFC fighter Mike Perry, who had gained a little bit of fame for his success in the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship. Paul was named victorious by way of a technical knockout in the sixth round, as a swollen and beaten Perry just couldn’t proceed. Paul vs. Tyson comes with a fair amount of warranted criticism. Tyson is 58 years old. His last competitive fight was in 2005. In a 2020 exhibition against Roy Jones Jr. that ended in a draw, Tyson looked slow and like an older man that did not take the fight seriously. His fight against Paul will take place without headgear.  This fight with Paul will be different from your normal celebrity face-off, as it’s an actual sanctioned fight that will count on professional records.  This doesn’t feel like Logan Paul vs. Floyd Mayweather, which was a clear money grab. Don’t get me wrong, this is a massive money grab as well. It’ll be a huge spectacle at AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys. While 80,000 can fit inside of that building, millions will watch this freak show live on Netflix. It’s another live event for Netflix, who impressed during their Labor Day broadcast of Joey Chestnut vs. Takeru Kobayashi. It’ll be interesting to see what Netflix can do with a combat sports broadcast. Another reason to be excited. But everyone will be interested in seeing what happens in the ring. Now 27 years old, Paul has taken the world of combat sports by storm. He’s knocked out former UFC stars like Tyron Woodley and Ben Askren. He’s battled older legends like Anderson Silva before. Prior to announcing his fight with Iron Mike, he was beating up some lesser-known boxers with relative ease. Tyson is a +200 underdog in this fight on most major sportsbooks, and that’s likely because of the 30-year age difference. But Tyson is different. He’s a heavyweight. This will be Paul’s first heavyweight bout, a division in which Tyson won six championship titles during his professional career. While training videos can easily be altered and edited, Tyson looks to be in great shape. At a heavier weight, Paul will presumably get tired quicker, and he’s never exactly been known for great endurance. Friday’s arrival will be met with excitement. A large piece of me feels like this could unfold like any other Paul fight, and that could be very apparent early in the match. The way Paul fights typically goes, he will strategically select an older, slower opponent that he could wear down with his heavy right hand. The opponents are typically in it for the pay day, and sometimes that’s very obvious with their clear lack of preparation. But there’s a small piece of me that thinks this one could be different. Surely, Tyson is in this one for the pay day, too. The legend has nothing left to prove inside of that ring. But if he could be the one to finally knock out Paul and put an end to all of this madness? That would be a story that only Netflix could script.  Copyright 2024"

The Thunder said Holmgren is expected to return this season after he endured a right iliac wing fracture. The 7-foot-1 star was injured during a fall after contesting a layup by Andrew Wiggins in the first quarter.  Holmgren, 22, is averaging 16.4 points, 8.7 rebounds and 2.6 blocks in 10 games this season.  The injury is the second significant one in the young career of Holmgren, who was selected by Oklahoma City with the second overall pick of the 2022 NBA Draft. He missed the 2022-23 season due to a Lisfranc injury in his right foot. Holmgren debuted last season and was runner-up for NBA Rookie of the Year after averaging 16.5 points, 7.9 rebounds and 2.3 blocked shots in 82 starts. He became the first player in NBA history to tally at least 150 assists, 150 blocks and 100 made 3-pointers in a season.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Oklahoma City Thunder will have to adjust to being without one of theirs for the time being. On Monday night, the teams will square off in Oklahoma City with the Clippers still without Kawhi Leonard and the Thunder without Chet Holmgren. Leonard has yet to play this season due to inflammation in his right knee. He won't travel with the Clippers during a three-game trip that begins with Monday's contest. The game will be the second of four meetings between the teams this season. Oklahoma City won the first meeting, 105-92, in Los Angeles on Nov. 2. Holmgren played a significant role in that game with 10 points and 14 rebounds. Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said after that game that Holmgren's abilities made the Thunder particularly difficult to defend. But now, Oklahoma City will be without Holmgren for at least eight to 10 weeks after he sustained a pelvic fracture during the first quarter of Sunday's contest against the Golden State Warriors. Holmgren fell hard on his right hip after trying to defend a layup near the rim. The team announced the injury as a right iliac wing fracture and said he is expected to return this season.  Holmgren is averaging 16.4 points, 8.7 rebounds and 2.6 blocks a game this season. Oklahoma City trailed Sunday's game by 30 late in the third quarter before pulling as close as six late before the Warriors won 127-116. ""This is a resilient, tough, competitive, adaptive team,"" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said, ""and that's what we're going to be, regardless of the circumstances."" The Thunder might have to be even more adaptive. Before Holmgren's injury, Oklahoma City already was thin in the frontcourt with Isaiah Hartenstein, Jaylin Williams and Kenrich Williams all injured. Those three have not appeared in a game this season. ""It's kind of a next-man-up thing,"" Oklahoma City's Jalen Williams said. ""Can't dwell too long."" The Thunder's defense, which ranks best in the league with 100.3 points allowed per 100 possessions, figures to be most affected without Holmgren. ""All of us have to figure out how to get stops and rebound,"" Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said. The Clippers' defense also is in the top five in the league, allowing 107.7 points per 100 possessions. After dropping their first matchup with the Thunder, the Clippers fell to 2-4 for the season. But Los Angeles has won four consecutive games since then, including Saturday's 105-103 home victory over Toronto. During the four-game winning streak, Clippers center Ivica Zubac is averaging 14.8 points and 12.3 rebounds. ""Zu's been great,"" Lue said. ""The big man that we've been playing a lot of minutes, but he's one of the most durable big men in the league, probably the most durable big man in the league."" Zubac has played in at least 68 games in each of the last four seasons. The Clippers have lost six consecutive games in Oklahoma City. They haven't won there since March 3, 2020. The Thunder are 2-0 on the second game of a back-to-back this season.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Spurs will play the third contest of a five-game homestand that's seen them split the first two games, defeating the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday and then dropping a 111-110 decision to the Utah Jazz on Saturday.  San Antonio on Saturday received 24 points and 16 rebounds from Victor Wembanyama, who was also called for a crucial offensive foul on a pick late in the game.  Stephon Castle had career-high 23 points in his third start, Devin Vassell scored 21, Keldon Johnson hit for 14 and Harrison Barnes tallied 10 points in the loss.  ""My guys have been in the gym with me,"" Castle said of his best-ever output. ""We're all confident in each other to shoot the ball no matter who it is. If we get open when we're told, we've got to shoot it. (It's about) just stepping up and shooting with confidence.""  Vassell's production came in his first action of the season after he missed more than seven months with a broken foot.  ""I haven't played in a long time,"" Vassell said afterward. ""You know, during the off season, I was kind of frustrated because at the end of the day, I just want to be out there on my teammates and play with them. I was able to get through it. They helped me get back in shape and everything.""  The Spurs have spilt their past four games and will get their first look this season at the Kings, who arrived in the Alamo City early Monday morning after a 127-118 overtime win in Phoenix on Sunday.  DeMar DeRozan led the Kings with 34 points while three other starters -- De'Aaron Fox (21 points, 11 rebounds, eight assists), Domantas Sabonis (20 points, 12 rebounds) and Keegan Murray (14 points, 14 rebounds) -- racked up double doubles in the victory. Kevin Huerter added 17 points for Sacramento.  The Kings have won three of their past four games.  While DeRozan is the most oft-mentioned new player for the Kings, Huerter -- who came to the team from Atlanta in July 2022 -- also has been a key cog. The 6-foot-7 guard underwent a 6 1/2-month recovery after season-ending surgery last April to repair a torn labrum in his left shoulder.  ""I'm still getting myself in the swing of things, still trying to find my rhythm,"" said Huerter, who is averaging 11.3 points a game this season. ""A couple of new guys on our team and a new offense, so I'm trying to fully immerse myself with the team and kind of get my feet under me a little bit. It's been a rigorous summer, and obviously glad to be back in the swing."" Sacramento's super sixth man, Malik Monk, left Sunday's game early in the second quarter when he twisted his ankle after stepping on the foot step of Suns center Mason Plumlee. Monk did not return to the game, and his status for Monday's contest will be in question until game time. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Rockets eked out a 101-99 victory over the Pistons for their third win in the last four games. Houston, which will host the Washington Wizards on Monday night, beat Detroit while shooting just 40.9 percent from the field and missing 27 of 34 attempts from 3-point range. What the Rockets did well on Sunday was lean into their early-season profile by securing 17 offensive rebounds while recording a modest 11 turnovers. According to NBA.com, the Rockets exited the win over Detroit second in the league in offensive rebounding rate (35.9 percent) and fifth in turnover rate (12.5 percent). Their effectiveness in those two categories has offset woeful shooting, with only Portland and Utah posting effective field-goal percentages worse than the Rockets' 49.6 percent. Rebounding saved the Rockets against the Pistons. Alperen Sengun grabbed 10 rebounds while Tari Eason secured nine in 27 minutes off the bench. Starters Fred VanVleet and forward Jabari Smith Jr. shot a combined 5 for 21, including 1 for 11 on 3-pointers, but totaled 14 rebounds. The Rockets employ the offensive talent to turn things around on that end of the court, but their offensive rebounding and ball security should continue to serve as assets. ""That was a point of emphasis all year,"" Rockets coach Ime Udoka said. ""We got nine more shots because of that and took care of the ball. As I always say, you can rely on your defense when the shots aren't falling, so on the nights when they both click, you have a comfortable win. The nights where they're not, you can still dig it out and figure out a way to get it done."" The Wizards surrendered a pair of 30-point quarters in the second half of their 121-94 road loss to the Orlando Magic on Sunday, their fourth consecutive defeat, with three of those losses coming by at least 20 points. Washington again was without its second-leading scorer and rebounder, Kyle Kuzma (17 points, 7.7 rebounds), and his absence continues to be felt. Washington posted a minus-seven rebounding margin and allowed 15 offensive boards that Orlando converted into 22 points. The Wizards' ineffective performance on the glass was a shared responsibility, but 7-foot rookie Alex Sarr corraling only three rebounds in 24 minutes proved noteworthy. Sarr blocked two shots on Sunday after entering play averaging 2.6 per game, which ranked fourth in the NBA. If Sarr is to excel as a rim-protector, he'll need his teammates to cover for him on the glass when he rotates out of position and fills the role as a help defender. ""I think Alex is growing and learning every game,"" Wizards coach Brian Keefe said. ""We're seeing things that he's never seen before. ""I thought Alex came out and established a good presence at the rim early. We've got to keep helping him when he goes to shot-block and help him on the boards.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Flyers suffered a tough 6-4 loss to the Carolina Hurricanes on Tuesday to open their three-game trek before nipping the Tampa Bay Lightning 2-1 in a shootout on Thursday. Then, on Saturday, Philadelphia battled the defending champion Florida Panthers for 65 minutes before falling 4-3 in a shootout. ""The past few games, we're beginning to play better, more to what we're supposed to play like,"" Flyers coach John Tortorella said. Samuel Ersson missed the first two games of the road trip with a lower-body injury before returning to make 28 saves against the Panthers. ""This road trip, I think we played pretty well,"" Ersson said. ""We battled ... against very good teams. We're happy with the way we played. Obviously we want more points, but if we play like this, they're going to come.""  Joel Farabee, Anthony Richard and Garnet Hathaway each scored a goal and Scott Laughton had two assists against Florida. Owen Tippett had the team's lone tally in five shootout attempts.  ""I thought we dictated the speed of the game tonight,"" Hathaway said. ""And that's something that when we're playing to our identity, that's what we do."" The Sharks are playing better in recent weeks, as well, having gone 5-2-0 in their last seven games following an 0-7-2 start to the season. Most recently, they slipped past the New Jersey Devils on Sunday night, 1-0, in the opener of a four-game trip. Mackenzie Blackwood made 44 saves for his 11th career shutout, blanking his former team in his first game as a visiting goaltender at Prudential Center. ""It's just one of those nights where it feels easy,"" Blackwood said. ""I don't know why sometimes that happens and sometimes it doesn't, but sometimes pucks just seem like they're coming in slow. I don't know why, but definitely you could say today was one of those days I was seeing the puck well."" While most teams typically don't start the same goalie on both ends of a back-to-back set, perhaps San Jose coach Ryan Warsofsky has a tougher decision to make after Blackwood's stellar effort on Sunday. ""(Blackwood) was outstanding, probably the best I've seen him play,"" Warsofsky said. ""You could just tell he was dialed in, focused and tracking pucks really well."" Of course, some credit must go to the Sharks' defense for shutting out a talented Devils team that entered with five wins in its previous six games. ""I thought we did a great job for the most part, staying tight,"" said Nico Sturm, who scored the lone goal for San Jose. ""Obviously, (Blackwood) had a huge game."" It remains to be seen if the Sharks' defense will have to contend with dynamic Flyers rookie Matvei Michkov, who has been a healthy scratch in the last two games. ""It's just part of the process,"" Tortorella said. ""With young guys, they can watch games too as far as developing. It's (about) trying to help him."" The Sharks and Flyers split their two-game season series in 2023-24. Five of the last six matchups between the teams have been decided by one goal. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Sturm's goal was enough for Blackwood, who withstood a constant barrage from the Devils and constantly limited rebound opportunities. Jake Allen made 26 saves for the Devils, who had their season high in shots on goal and were blanked for the second time this season.

Eleven different players scored for the Magic, six in double figures, with Cole Anthony scoring a season-high 16 off the bench. Starting center Goga Bitadze had a double-double with 10 points and a game-high 12 rebounds. Washington has lost four in a row, and its scoring output was its lowest of the season.

Bates also drilled a game-tying 58-yard field goal that slipped just inside the right upright with 5:01 left in the game. His heroics helped the Lions (8-1) stretch their winning streak to seven games. Jared Goff threw a career-worst five interceptions while completing 15 of 30 passes for 240 yards and two touchdowns for Detroit. David Montgomery rushed for a touchdown and Amon-Ra St. Brown and Sam LaPorta had scoring receptions for the Lions. C.J. Stroud completed 19 of 33 passes for 232 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions for the Texans (6-4), who lost for the third time in their past four games. John Metchie III caught his first career touchdown pass and Kwamie Lassiter II had two interceptions for Houston. Joe Mixon rushed for a score but had just 46 yards on 25 rushes. Detroit trimmed its deficit to 23-13 on Montgomery's 3-yard run with 11:34 left in the third quarter. The ensuing two-point conversion run failed. The Lions continued to hold the momentum and moved with 23-20 on Goff's 9-yard touchdown pass to St. Brown with 11:38 remaining in the contest. After Bates knotted the score with his first clutch field goal, Houston had a chance to go back ahead but Ka'imi Fairbairn's 58-yard field goal attempt was way wide to the left with 1:51 remaining. The Texans scored the final 13 points of the first half to hold a 23-7 advantage. Houston struck first on Mixon's 8-yard scoring run midway through the first quarter. Fairbairn kicked a 34-yard field goal to make it 10-0 with 2:09 left in the opening quarter.

The Bulldogs (1-1) fell 68-66 to the Governors on Friday, committing 16 turnovers and surrendering 44 points in the paint. Patrick McCaffery finished with a team-high 23 points on 8-for-13 shooting from the field for Butler, which struggled to create separation in the first half before going down by as many as 14 in the second.  Bulldogs coach Thad Matta is hoping that his team will be more resilient on Monday.  ""They just punched us early,"" Matta said of the Governors. ""We've got to get better at taking a punch and fighting back. We didn't handle (the pressure) well. They made us not ready to play."" McCaffery is one of four players who has a scoring average in double figures for Butler. He is putting up 17.0 points per game, ranking second behind Jahmyl Telfort, who averages 18.5 points.  Pierre Brooks II (13.0 points per game) and Finley Bizjack (10.0) have also been key contributors for the Bulldogs.  The Broncos (1-1) will have to find a way to contain that balanced attack after crushing Division II foe Davenport 86-46 on Thursday. Brandon Muntu supplied 17 points in the victory, while Max Burton and JaVaughn Hannah netted 13 apiece.  Western Michigan hasn't had a winning season since the 2017-18 campaign, but that isn't stopping Hannah from having high expectations for the Broncos.  ""We're not just satisfied with making the (Mid-American Conference) tournament. We want to kick in that door, take the next step and win a championship,"" Hannah said. ""That foundation is set. We just want to continue it this season.""  Hannah and Markhi Strickland are each averaging 11.5 points per game to lead Western Michigan in scoring.  Butler last played the Broncos on Nov. 25, 2020, beating them 66-62.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

SMU (2-0) comes off back-to-back lopsided victories, having beaten Tarleton State 96-62 and Florida A&M 102-73. In those wins, the Mustangs shot 53.5 percent from the floor. UNCG (1-0) pulled away late from Florida Gulf Coast for a 73-64 win in its season opener last Monday. Though the Spartans led by as many as 17 points in the first half, FGCU tied the contest at 59-59 with 3:54 left in the second. That was promptly answered by an 11-0 run from UNC Greensboro, sealing the Spartans' victory. Offensively, the Mustangs are led by Wake Forest transfer Boopie Miller, who has averaged 20.5 points through his first two games with SMU. Donovan Atwell and Kenyon Giles each tallied 17 points in UNCG's season opener. SMU surrendered an average of 67.5 points in its first two victories, but the Mustangs also recorded at least 10 steals and forced their opponent into a minimum of 15 turnovers in both contests. Enfield reiterated the importance of quality defense to his team's identity after beating Florida A&M. ""I think through our preseason, we understand that if we don't play hard defensively, we're not very good,"" Enfield said. ""We have to be active. We have to be disruptive."" SMU enters the matchup Monday shooting 42 percent from beyond the arc and had 20 assists against Tarleton State and 23 against Florida A&M. ""They're buying into the team concept,"" Enfield said. For UNCG, team defense was the key down the stretch of its first win, holding FGCU to a scoring drought that spanned 3:25. ""We challenged these guys to get in better shape this season,"" Spartans coach Mike Jones said. ""We challenged them to be able to separate (themselves) in the last four minutes of the game because you're tougher mentally and better conditioned.

Missouri had a big size advantage over Howard on Friday during its 77-62 victory, but the Tigers' poor 3-point shooting kept the Bison in the game for 37 minutes. Tamar Bates hit 3 of 7 shots from behind the arc while leading Missouri with 17 points. But the other Tigers went 0-for-15 from distance while coach Dennis Gates implored them to pound the ball inside. ""The 3-pointer was so tempting for most of them, they couldn't resist it,"" Gates said. ""They could not resist it. And Bates made his baseline out, and it's almost like that that stirred it up again, like ‘Oh, we're open! We're open! Let's shoot it!' And we have to be able to do certain things other than just catch and shoot."" Forward Mark Mitchell had a strong game inside (16 points, eight rebounds), but Gates wanted more players attacking the basket. He used nine players for 12 minutes or more while trying to find effective combinations. Eastern Washington opened its season by losing at Colorado 76-56 and defeating Seattle 93-86 at home. The Eagles raced to a 16-4 lead over Seattle but failed to keep the upper hand, falling behind by the 7:53 mark of the first half. ""We'll get better defense because this is a very coachable group,"" first-year Eagles coach Dan Monson said. ""They have started both games dictating the defense, we just have to sustain it."" On the other hand, the Eagles shot 57.6 percent from the floor against Seattle and made 9 of 22 shots from 3-point range. ""You're going to win a lot of games when you put 93 points on the board,"" Monson said. ""We are still a work in progress, but it's a lot easier to learn after a good win like this.""

The Terrapins (2-0) have opened the season with victories of 30 or more points against Manhattan and Mount St. Mary's. It's the first time Maryland has defeated its first two opponents of a campaign by at least 30 points since the 2014-15 season. Meanwhile, the Rattlers (0-2) have struggled mightily in coach Patrick Crarey II's first season at the helm, allowing over 100 points in losses to TCU and SMU. Rodney Rice, a transfer from Virginia Tech, has been a big part of Maryland's early success. He scored a career-high 28 points on 10-of-14 shooting from the field in the Terrapins' 86-52 win over Mount St. Mary's on Friday. Rice scored 26 of those points in the first half to help break the game open early, and he finished with five rebounds, two assists and two steals. Ja'Kobi Gillespie, a transfer from Belmont, complemented Rice's efforts with 13 points. ""When Ja'Kobi and Rodney are out here together, it's two guys that can really shoot it and score,"" Maryland coach Kevin Willard said Friday. ""This is the way Rod's been playing for the last two to three weeks in practice. It's the way we played the other night, to be honest with you, when he came in the second half and kind of did the same thing. He's got a great knack to score."" Florida A&M has had a major issue with turnovers during its first two games. The Rattlers allowed SMU to convert 15 giveaways into 27 points during a 102-73 loss on Thursday.

The Hokies improved to 2-0 with a 93-74 win against visiting USC Upstate on Friday night, while the Eagles (2-0) defeated visiting Little Rock 82-67 Saturday. Mylyjael Poteat and Brandon Rechsteiner both scored a career-high 19 points in Virginia Tech's win. Freshman Tyler Johnson scored 16 points and Jaydon Young had 14. Despite the win, the young Hokies had a cold-shooting start on Friday. They missed nine of their first 10 shots and trailed 16-2 early. USC Upstate hit six of 10 shots to begin the game and Virginia Tech committed five turnovers early. Virginia Tech trailed by five at intermission but pulled away in the second half. A 7-0 run gave them a double-digit lead and they never looked back. ""I feel like that's a good definition of what the season will look like,"" Young said. ""I think it'll start off pretty ugly, as it should, new team coming together. I feel like a lot of teams look like that right now, but January, February, later on in the season, it might look a little better."" In contrast to Virginia Tech's youth, Winthrop starts five seniors and returns four starters, the top four scorers from 2023-24. Despite that, Winthrop followed a similar narrative to Virginia Tech last time out. The Eagles led Little Rock by four points at halftime before scoring the first nine points of the second half to build a 41-28 lead with 17:38 to play. They pushed the lead to 23 points and Little Rock got no closer than within 13. K.J. Doucet led Winthrop with 17 points and seven rebounds. Tommy Kamarad and Kasen Harrison added 13 points apiece. ""I think we showed the quality of our depth,"" coach Mark Prosser said. ""I think there was a lot of unselfish plays that happened today. A little bit of a lull here and there where I think some of the things we talk about in preparation we can be little bit better in execution when the game starts."" This marks the third meeting between the Eagles and Hokies, who won the previous two. The last meeting was Dec. 3, 2013, when the host Hokies prevailed 81-63. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Murray hit a pair of turnaround jumpers before Irving hit another shot from deep, then the Nuggets scored the next seven points to go ahead 113-108 with 4:45 left in the game.  Luka Doncic rattled off five straight points to tie the game, and Naji Marshall, who had 11 points on the night, later converted a three-point play to give Dallas a 116-115 lead.  Murray soon went 1-for-3 from the free-throw line to tie the game once again, and Irving and Jokic hit two shots apiece down the stretch to knot things at 120 with 48.7 seconds remaining.

Monday at home, the Panthers get another mid-major test against Gardner-Webb of the Big South. Helping fuel the Panthers' 2-0 start have been Damian Dunn, a graduate transfer from Houston, and Cameron Corhen, who arrived from Florida State. While Dunn had 19 points in an 83-68 victory Friday over Murray State, Corhen delivered 13 points and 10 rebounds. Meanwhile, holdover guards Jaland Lowe and Ishmael Leggett produced 20 and 19 points, respectively. While some backcourt players in the transfer portal might have crossed Pitt off their list because of the presence of two veteran guards, Dunn signed on and the trio has been productive. They are averaging a combined 54.5 points, hitting 54.5 percent of their shots, including 45.4 percent from beyond the arc. ""We all have our turns. We all know we have our days. Everybody's gonna eat,"" Dunn said. While the offense was humming last week, Pitt coach Jeff Capel wants to see more from his defense. ""We didn't play as hard and smart as we normally do,"" Capel said after the Murray State win. Zack Austin came off the bench to spark the defense with five blocks and eight rebounds. ""We're not as good as we think we are,"" Capel added. Gardner-Webb (1-1) arrives after delivering Jeremy Luther his first win as a Division I head coach, 88-82 at North Carolina Central on Friday in a game that the Runnin' Bulldogs never trailed. Anthony Selden, who returned to Gardner-Webb after a season at Rice, propelled the Runnin' Bulldogs with 26 points on 10-of-15 shooting. Darryl Simmons II contributed 18 points on 8-of-9 accuracy from the floor. Ademide Badmus made all six of his shots as Gardner-Webb hit a program-record 70 percent from the floor. After losing 80-64 at then-No. 12 Tennessee, Gardner-Webb gets another chance to knock off a power-conference school at Pitt. ""We've got some old guys, some experienced guys,"" Luther said.

Brett Leason, Jackson LaCombe, Leo Carlsson and Isac Lundestrom scored goals for Anaheim, which picked up just its second win in the past eight games.

Anaheim, which entered the game having scored an NHL-low 27 goals, jumped out to a 1-0 lead at the 3:13 mark of the first period on Leason's first goal of the season. Cutter Gauthier set up the score with a backhand pass from below the goal line to Leason in front of the crease.   Columbus, playing the second half of a back-to-back set that began with a 5-2 loss at Los Angeles on Saturday, tied it near the end of the period on a power-play goal by Chinakhov. He blasted a one-timer from the right point that squeaked past Gibson for his fourth goal of the season.   Anaheim took a 2-1 at 4:22 of the second period when LaCombe roofed in a rebound of a Radko Gudas one-timer from the top of the crease for his first goal.   Carlsson made it 3-1 at 10:20 of the third period with a spinning wrist shot from the slot off Brian Dumoulin's pass for his fifth goal.   Marchenko cut it to 3-2 with 3:03 remaining when he snapped in a wrist shot from the top of the slot for his sixth goal.

Curry hit seven 3-pointers and finished 13-of-23 from the field for Golden State, which led by 30 late in the third quarter before Oklahoma City pulled within six with 4:46 remaining in the game. Jonathan Kuminga scored 12 of his 20 points for the Warriors in the second quarter and shot 8-of-11 from the field.  De'Anthony Melton hit five of Golden State's season-high-tying 21 3-pointers and finished with 19 points and 10 rebounds. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 24 points but was just 6-of-17 from the field, including 1-for-5 in the fourth quarter.  Oklahoma City played most of the game without star center Chet Holmgren, who injured his right hip on a hard fall after a midair collision with the Warriors' Andrew Wiggins in the first quarter. Holmgren finished scoreless for the first time in his career, going 0-for-3 from the field, and had four rebounds. The Thunder trailed 107-77 late in the third but got within 114-108 in the fourth after Alex Caruso stole an inbounds pass and streaked to the other end for a dunk. Oklahoma City immediately forced another turnover, this one by Curry, but couldn't take advantage again. Golden State scored on its next two possessions, the latter coming on Curry's sixth 3-pointer that made it 119-108 with 3:23 remaining.  Curry scored five more points the rest of the way as the Thunder never got closer than seven. The Warriors outshot the hosts 50.6 percent (45-of-89) to 44.7 percent (42-of-94) and held Oklahoma City to 11-of-33 shooting (33.3 percent) on 3-pointers. The Thunder initially responded well after Holmgren's injury, stretching their lead to seven by the end of the first quarter. Golden State turned things around in the second, outscoring the Thunder 39-25 to carry a 65-58 lead into halftime. The Warriors' surge continued in the third quarter as Curry exploded for 17 points. Golden State outscored Oklahoma City 42-21 in the third to take a 107-79 lead into the fourth before the Thunder threatened late. The Warriors have won six of their last seven and wrapped up their five-game road trip 4-1. The Thunder have lost two of their last three since starting 7-0. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Mrazek outdueled Minnesota counterpart Filip Gustavsson (20 saves) to help Chicago end a 12-game winless streak against its Central Division rival. The Blackhawks netted the game-winner after intercepting a pass. Seth Jones sent a pass to Kurashev, who streaked down the left side before beating Gustavsson with a wrist shot. The Blackhawks fought off consistent pressure from the Wild, who outshot Chicago 19-4 in the third period. Matt Boldy evened the score at 15:29 of the third period, burying a chance when a rebound trickled to him just inside the left circle. Boldy missed an opportunity to tie the score moments earlier, sending a shot off the crossbar that glanced off Mrazek's body before Nick Foligno poked it away from the net. Chicago's Ryan Donato hit the post shortly after the goal. The Blackhawks opened the scoring at 16:44 of the first period, when Jason Dickinson tallied an unassisted goal. Swooping in to gather a loose puck along the right-wing boards, he came through the circle and moved into the slot before sending a wrist shot over Gustavsson's blocker. Chicago was awarded two power plays on separate tripping calls in the first 5:50 of the game but failed to convert. Mrazek proved especially resourceful in the closing seconds of the second period. After losing his stick in front of the crease, he accepted Taylor Hall's stick and used it to stop Jake Middleton's wrist shot from the left circle. Wild coach John Hynes shuffled lines in stretches during the game, including grouping Kirill Kaprizov, Joel Eriksson Ek and Boldy. Kaprizov saw his streak of eight consecutive multipoint road games snapped, although he did get the primary assist on Boldy's goal. Kaprizov entered the game with back-to-back three-point efforts to begin Minnesota's three-game road trip. Both teams were 0-for-3 on the power play. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

UCLA (1-1) gave up 21 points off 21 turnovers in a 72-64 loss to New Mexico on Friday in Henderson, Nev. The 21 turnovers were the most by a Mick Cronin-coached team since his first season at UCLA, 2019-20, when the Bruins had 22 turnovers vs. North Carolina.  ""I'm extremely disappointed in some of our guards,"" Cronin said. ""There are three things you've got to do: defend, rebound, and take care of the ball. We didn't take care of the ball."" Maintaining possession has been a hallmark of Cronin's UCLA teams. The Bruins averaged fewer than 11 turnovers per game in each of the previous four seasons. In 2021-22, UCLA averaged just 8.9 turnovers a contest.  Rediscovering that identity promises to be a point of emphasis for a veteran, but still new-look Bruins lineup. Four of the five starters against New Mexico are transfers: Eric Dailey Jr., Skyy Clark, Kobe Johnson and Tyler Bilodeau.  Meanwhile, the lone returning starter -- Dylan Andrews -- scored just four points while committing six turnovers on Friday.  Andrews, Sebastian Mack and Lazar Stefanovic, three of UCLA's top performers a season ago, combined for just eight points vs. New Mexico.  ""Dylan and Sebastian were throwing the ball away for layups,"" Cronin said. ""I told them, ‘Guys, we were better than that last year.'"" Just one Bruin scored in double figures on Friday -- Bilodeau with 23 points -- after four Bruins notched at least 12 points in their 85-50 season-opening win over Rider on Nov. 4. UCLA aims to regain that balance when winless Boston University comes to Pauley Pavilion.  The Terriers (0-2) come into the matchup after losing 74-60 at San Diego on Friday. Boston gave up 40 second-half points to the Toreros after surrendering 42 second-half points in its 80-72 loss to crosstown rival Northeastern on opening night.  Forward Malcolm Chimezie was a bright spot for Boston in its first two games. After scoring 14 points against Northeastern, he had nine points and nine rebounds at San Diego.  Boston guard Ben Palacios, who missed the season opener, scored 15 points in 17 minutes off the bench against San Diego. The Terriers head into UCLA missing forward Otto Landrum, who averaged 8.5 points and 5.3 rebounds a season ago; and guard Ethan Okwuosa, who averaged 7.5 points and 4.2 rebounds last season.  ""This is going to be our team for a while. We're going to be without Ethan and Otto for a good stretch, and we're going to have to figure this out,"" Terriers coach Joe Jones. ""This is not the same team from last year because of the injuries, but we're still a good enough team to win. We're going to have to figure it out.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Diebler is in his first full campaign as head coach for Ohio State after replacing the fired Chris Holtmann on Feb. 14. Diebler went 8-3 as the Buckeyes' interim head coach last season. Sharp 3-point shooting was key for Ohio State (1-0) against the Longhorns. The Buckeyes shot 14-of-28 from distance, 50 percent clip they surpassed only four times last season. ""We really just want to get a good look,"" Diebler said. ""We want to play with an aggressiveness and confidence to take the first good look we can get."" Youngstown State's Ethan Faulkner won his head coaching debut for the Penguins (1-0) with an 80-60 victory at Chicago State on Saturday.  Faulkner was the associate head coach the past two seasons after three as an assistant coach at Youngstown State. It was a delayed start of the season for the Penguins because the originally scheduled opener against Westminster on Nov. 4 was postponed due to a power outage on the Youngstown State campus. The Penguins have won 20 games in consecutive seasons, but Faulkner has only three returning letterwinners and knows his team is a work in progress.  ""We are certainly making progress, but I think we need to continue to improve in all areas,"" Faulkner told the Tribune Chronicle.  ""When you recruit the way that we have recruited, and really just the day and age of college basketball we're in, you don't always have a lot of continuity as you bring new people in.

After a 20-17 overtime loss in Germany at the hands of Bryce Young’s Carolina Panthers, the Giants are 2-8. Now let’s be clear on something. Nobody really expected the Giants to be much of anything this year. They pretty much waved the white flag on 2024 when they let the best running back in the game, Saquon Barkley, walk away to a division rival on a long-term deal back in March. Their 2-8 record isn’t as embarrassing when you realize that it should not be unexpected. Despite never showing the true, intangible traits of a Super Bowl-caliber quarterback, the Giants decided to extend Jones to a four-year, $160 million contract. Everyone online trolls Jones for his ineptitude, but that’s just who he is as a quarterback. It’s who he has always been. It’s who he will always be. But it’s time to move on. The contract has an out this offseason and the Giants would be flatout stupid to not exercise that clause. They likely will. Remember, they were in on several quarterbacks in the 2024 NFL Draft class, but ultimately selected wide receiver Malik Nabers with the No. 6 overall selection. Moving off of the No. 6 overall pick in 2019, Jones would cost the Giants about $22 million in dead cap space, but that’s not that much money as long as your new quarterback is still on his rookie deal. It’s practically how the Denver Broncos have their head above water after the Russell Wilson fiasco, which is comedically working out for the Pittsburgh Steelers as well. But Jones isn’t a solo actor in the crime of the 2024 Giants. Daboll shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near the next quarterback. Neither should offensive coordinator Mike Kafka.  It’s time for a fresh start with a fresh quarterback.  Jones has a 22-44-1 record as the starter for the Giants. Replacing Eli Manning was never going to be easy, but Jones probably was never going to be the guy to make that happen. Dynasties in football are rare. Not everyone can be the Green Bay Packers, who consistently spit out franchise quarterbacks. The Steelers have struggled to replace Ben Roethlisberger since his retirement. After Tom Brady's departure, the New England Patriots have already drafted two different first round QBs. These guys don't exactly grow on trees. There's no guarantee that the next guy will be a hit for the Giants, and that goes for the coach or quarterback. But it can’t really be much worse than what they have now. Copyright 2024"

It was the Magic's second straight win without injured star Paolo Banchero, who last played Oct. 30 because of a torn oblique. Eleven different players scored for the Magic, six in double figures, with Cole Anthony scoring a season-high 16 off the bench. Washington has lost four in a row, and their scoring output was their lowest of the season. The Wizards' starting lineup included three rookies (Alex Sarr, Kyshawn George and Carlton Carrington) and second-year pro Bilal Coulibaly, who scored 20.  Jordan Poole led the Wizards with 24 points on 8 of 19 from the floor, including 3 of 10 from 3-point range. Carrington was hurt when Moritz Wager fell into his leg with 4:49 left in the game. He did not return. Orlando broke open a five-point game at halftime with a big third quarter, outscoring Washington 30-16. The Magic put together a game-changing 13-2 run capped by a traditional three-point play by Kentavious Caldwell-Pope to make it 77-62 in 6:25 left in the third. The lead changed hands in the first quarter with the Wizards taking a 15-12 advantage on a three by Sarr, but Orlando closed the quarter strong. Moritz Wagner and Franz Wagner made back-to-back threes to give Orlando a 24-20 lead, and they maintained a four-point edge after one. George got hot for Washington in the second quarter, making four threes, but the Wizards' defense collapsed. The Magic went on a 10-0 run with rookie Tristan Da Silva making a corner three followed by a three by Caldwell-Pope, Fritz Wagner's layup and a two-pointer from Da Silva to go up 54-40. George answered for the Wizards with eight straight points, including two threes, but the Magic led 61-56 at half.  The third quarter was all Magic. Poole collected three quick fouls in the first three minutes, giving him four for the game, and went to the bench. The Magic capitalized. Franz Wagner converted a traditional three-point play, Jalen Suggs sank a three and the Magic led 83-66 with 3:15 left in the quarter. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Vegas is 8-0-0 at T-Mobile Arena this season, outscoring its opponents an impressive 43-19 in the process. The eight-game home unbeaten streak matches the team record set in its inaugural season in 2017-18 when the Golden Knights made a storybook run to the Stanley Cup Final. The home-ice success is the main reason the Golden Knights are just one point behind the first-place Los Angeles Kings in the Pacific Division. Vegas has won just once in six road games (1-3-2). The Golden Knights return from a two-game road trip that saw them pick up their first road win of the season, 4-2, at Edmonton on Wednesday, and then follow that up with a 4-3 overtime loss at Seattle on Friday. Vegas jumped out to a 2-0 first-period lead over the Kraken but needed a fortunate 6-on-5 goal by Alex Pietrangelo with 1:22 to go to force overtime. Pietrangelo was attempting a pass that deflected in off the skate of Seattle defenseman Adam Larsson to tie it, 3-3. Jared McCann scored on a breakaway 29 seconds into overtime to win it for the Kraken. ""We got three of a possible four (points) on the road trip, so it's definitely a step in the right direction, but we definitely have some things to clean up, too,"" forward Tanner Pearson said. ""We wanted four (points), three's pretty good,"" Golden Knights coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""If you look at the big picture that part is pretty good. I just felt we certainly had a chance to get all four. We let that get away."" The win over the Oilers was a costly one, however. Captain Mark Stone, second on the team with 21 points (six goals, 15 assists) suffered a lower-body injury that kept him out of the Seattle loss. ""Day-to-day but we don't anticipate that he'll play (Monday),"" Cassidy said of Stone's status. Carolina had an eight-game winning streak snapped with a 6-4 loss to Colorado on Saturday night. The Hurricanes had to fly to Denver on the morning of the game because of extreme winter weather on Friday and the long day of travel, combined with the mile-high altitude, seemed to take its toll on Rod Brind'Amour's squad as the contest went on. Carolina took a 3-2 lead in the second period on a power-play goal by Martin Necas, but Colorado answered with three goals over a three-minute span at the end of the period to build a 5-3 cushion. The Hurricanes cut it to 5-4 on Jordan Martinook's second goal of the game early in the third period, but Mikko Rantanen sealed the victory for the Avalanche with an empty-netter with 50 seconds remaining. Brind'Amour refused to use his team's travel problems as an excuse for their first loss since Oct. 19 at St. Louis. ""There's no excuses because we came out really well,"" Brind'Amour said. ""But once we got into it, you could see that we were just hanging on really, and you can't hang on against that team. We had a couple guys (who) just didn't have it tonight. You could see we were just out of gas."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Penguins sent down their former top netminder, who led the league with six shutouts last season, to AHL affiliate Wilkes-Barre/Scranton on Oct. 24 after he struggled mightily on the ice. In three games with the top club, Jarry yielded 12 goals on just 73 shots. He stayed on the ice less than 12 minutes in his last game with the Penguins, giving up three goals on just five shots against the Buffalo Sabres on Oct. 16, a game that Pittsburgh rallied to win 6-5 in overtime. Jarry went 4-1 in five games in the AHL with a 2.16 goals-against average. He told reporters Sunday that he appreciated being able to play consecutive games. Whether he gets that chance immediately with Pittsburgh, which earned three points on its three-game road trip, will be up to coach Mike Sullivan. The longtime leader behind the bench now has three goalies from which to choose. While praising Jarry, he did not say whether he'd immediately come back to the No. 1 position. ""I think one of the potential benefits of it is, one of them will have an opportunity to get quality practice time if that particular goalie isn't backing up,"" Sullivan told reporters Sunday. ""For example, this week, we got four games this week. There's a lot of opportunity there."" Pittsburgh capped its road trip with a 4-2 win Friday over the rival Washington Capitals. The Stars, meanwhile, are finally getting back into the swing of things after playing two games in Finland against the defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers to start the month. They had five days off before the two-game, two-day series, and then another four days off before beating the Chicago Blackhawks 3-1 on Thursday. On Saturday, Dallas lost 4-1 at Winnipeg, which has lost only once in 15 games this season. Much like the two games in Finland, which the Stars lost to the Panthers, Dallas coach Peter DeBoer said Saturday's game was also a chance to see where his team ranks among Cup contenders. Winnipeg jumped out to a 4-0 lead with more than 12 minutes left in the second period. DeBoer pulled netminder Jake Oettinger midway through the game after giving up the four goals on just 15 shots. ""I think so,"" DeBoer told reporters after the loss. ""I think when you look at these guys and Florida, you know, they've exposed us, and we've got to be a lot better. I think we've beaten the teams we should beat, but when we've had opportunities to play the top teams in the league, we haven't risen to the occasion."" The game will also be a showcase for some of the top veteran scorers in the league. Stars center Matt Duchene, 33, leads the team with seven goals and 15 points. Right behind him in goals with six is 32-year-old Tyler Seguin. For Pittsburgh, the ageless duo of Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby continues to lead the way. Malkin, 38, leads the team with 13 assists and 18 points. Crosby, 37, is tied with Rickard Rakell to lead the team with six goals. Crosby also ranks second on the team with 16 points. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""After a loss, you want to come out with a good response,"" Kings defenseman Mikey Anderson said. ""First period, we all thought was so/so but we liked it a lot better in the second, so everyone is happy to come away with two points.""

The Flames trailed in the third period during all three games of the trip. The comebacks are a point of pride, but Calgary is aware that good teams don't trail time and time again. ""We know that we've got to be better going home now,"" Calgary captain Mikael Backlund said. ""We know first period's going to be a big key for us. It's great that we (came) back and showed character, resilience, staying in every game, fighting back and get points, but if you want to win games, we've got to start to have better first periods."" That said, Calgary coach Ryan Huska is not about to criticize his players too much. The Flames have gained points in four of their past five games and are hanging tough in the standings. ""There's a lot of good things,"" Huska said. ""There's areas that we have to work on, and they're the common things that we'll continue to hammer on with our players."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Colorado hung on to win, splitting its last two games because goaltender Alexandar Georgiev seems to have found his confidence. Georgiev was pulled from his first two starts and appeared to have lost his grip on the No. 1 role, but he has turned it around. He will likely be in net Monday night in Denver when the Avalanche play the Nashville Predators in the second of a four-game homestand. Georgiev was strong in a 1-0 loss at Winnipeg on Thursday night, and big saves in the first period against Carolina on Saturday night gave Colorado a chance to rally to a 6-4 win. ""I felt like that game could have got away from us in the first 10 minutes and it didn't, and that was because of Georgie,"" Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said. ""He just gave our team a chance to come around. And that's what we need from our goaltending."" If Georgiev can keep performing, it bodes well for Colorado as it starts getting other players back. Miles Wood has been out two weeks with an upper-body injury but skated with the team on Sunday. Jonathan Drouin (upper body) hasn't played since the opener but is trending towards a return and Bednar confirmed Sunday that Valeri Nichushkin, who has been suspended since last May, will be in the lineup Friday night against Washington. The Avalanche have plugged holes to get through the beginning of the season, and it helps having Nathan MacKinnon and Cale Makar in the lineup. MacKinnon had four points in the win over the Hurricanes to move atop the scoring leaders, and Makar leads NHL defensemen with 24 points. Despite their production, Colorado has a losing record. ""All you can do is have a great effort and we've been doing that. Probably Chicago, at home, was our last bad game. We've been playing really well. I think we deserve more wins than we've gotten,"" MacKinnon said. Nashville enters Monday night's game having lost five of its last seven. One of the two wins came against the Avalanche on Nov. 2 and the other was Saturday night's 4-0 win over the Utah Hockey Club. Forward Jonathan Marchessault had a goal, just his third in 15 games, but he isn't concerned about his low output. ""Sometimes it's about getting chances, and I felt tonight I had a couple chances,"" Marchessault said. ""So that's a positive. Score or don't score, I think at the end of the day I just want scoring chances. That means I'm doing something good. And create chances for my teammates as well."" The Predators have been streaky this season, just like Colorado. They lost their first five, then won three straight before this latest stretch. Forsberg, who leads the team with eight goals, scored twice Saturday night. ""To see (Forsberg) be (Forsberg) and take over a game was really important for our group,"" coach Andrew Brunette said. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

To begin round-robin action in the Ilie Nastase Group, Sinner defeated No. 7 seed Alex de Minaur of Australia 6-3, 6-4, and Fritz upended Russian fourth seed Daniil Medvedev 6-4, 6-3. The top eight players on the ATP Tour reached the season-ending Finals and were drawn into two groups. The top two players after the group stage will move on to a four-man knockout round. The other group features Alexander Zverev of Germany, Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, Norway's Casper Ruud and Russia's Andrey Rublev. Novak Djokovic, who won the last two years, is not competing due to injury. On Sunday, Sinner hit eight aces with just one double fault and finished the match with an 18-7 advantage in total winners as he coasted past de Minaur in an hour and 25 minutes. ""I'm glad that I managed to play this kind of level,"" said Sinner, who lost to Djokovic in the championship match last year. ""It's a great start for my side for this event, for this tournament, considering I haven't played an official match in four weeks. ""Every match, it's very difficult to play against (de Minaur). He's a great fighter. You have to earn every point you play. Every time we play, he changes a couple of things, so I have to be very aware. It's very difficult. We don't have to see only the result, but also how the match goes."" Fritz's serve was his biggest strength in his opening match. He won 33 of his 39 first-service points (84.6 percent) and hit nine aces without a double fault. By contrast, Medvedev had eight aces but suffered eight double faults. ""(The serve) was a big part of it for sure,"" Fritz said. ""(Medvedev) is such a good returner. You can make a lot of first serves, but if they are not very high quality, he just puts so many returns in the court. ""It was huge for me. I hit a lot of lines, a lot of spots to start out games."" Fritz and Sinner are scheduled to square off on Tuesday for their second group match, following Medvedev facing de Minaur. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The school told media outlets on Sunday that there has been no change in Golden's employment status. ""Todd Golden's status as UF men's basketball coach has not changed. He will be coaching the game Monday night,"" a school spokesman told ESPN. Golden released a statement Saturday that acknowledged the investigation and said he has been in touch with attorney Ken Turkel and considering filing a defamation suit. ""For the last month, I have actively participated in and respected the confidentiality of an ongoing school inquiry,"" Golden wrote on social media. ""I have recently engaged (attorney) Ken Turkel to advise me on my ability to bring defamation claims while this confidential investigation is ongoing. My family and I appreciate the support we have received and remain confident the university will continue its efforts to finish its review promptly."" The Alligator, a Florida student publication, cited Title IX documents filed on Sept. 27 that said Golden has been accused of potential violations of the school's Gender Equity Policy. They include acts of sexual exploitation, sexual harassment and the stalking of Florida students over the past year. Per the report, Golden sent ""photos and videos of his genitalia while traveling for UF,"" used social media to make sexual advances and request sexual favors, and stalked women. He is alleged to have taken photos of women, then send the pictures to them, and also of making visits to places where he knew he could find those same women. The Alligator interviewed two women who said they had complained about Golden, and they corroborated the Title IX documents. They said Golden had followed, then unfollowed, numerous women on social media to avoid suspicion, and one of them said his reach to women was vast. He told many women they were ""his drug"" or ""his good luck charm"" before games, she said. ""He just had this manipulation tactic over everyone,"" the woman told The Alligator. ""And he sent us all the same (messages). It was copy-paste to every girl."" Golden, 39, was hired March 18, 2022, as the 20th head coach in Gators history.

Last season, in his second campaign with the Gators, Golden led the team to 24 wins, a No. 7 seed in the NCAA Tournament, and the SEC tournament championship game for the first time since 2014.

Country Club. Langer, 67, shot his age or better for the third day in a row with his final-round, 5-under-par 66 to get to 18-under 266 for the week at the PGA Tour Champions' season finale. He hadn't won a tournament this season until Sunday, meaning at the last possible minute he extended his streak to 18 straight seasons winning at least one title. Langer also extended his record to 47 wins on the PGA Tour Champions. ""Was that exciting or what?"" Langer said on the Golf Channel broadcast. Alker, 53, won his second Schwab Cup in three seasons on the 50-and-older circuit. He entered the week No. 2 in the points race and passed leader Ernie Els of South Africa by tying for second in the 72-hole finale. Langer hit a poor tee shot and second shot at the 17th hole, leading to a bogey and a three-way tie at 17 under with Alker and Richard Green of Australia. Green was in the clubhouse with a 6-under 65 and preparing for a possible playoff at 17-under 267. He entered the week No. 6 in points and needed to win the tournament to win the Schwab Cup. Langer landed his approach shot at the par-5 18th much further than Alker, but his putt turned from left to right at the last second and dropped for a massive birdie. Langer dropped his putter and tossed his visor in celebration. Langer said his caddie, Terry Holt, had told him, ""It's one more putt."" ""He's a prophet, I guess,"" Langer said. Alker then left his birdie try short, failing to force a playoff. But with Green also coming up short, Alker had the Schwab Cup in the bag. ""It's been a heck of a journey,"" Alker said at the trophy presentation before thanking his team. ""... Obviously, I would have liked to win today, but Bernhard, we're gonna give a hand for Bernhard because he's incredible. He really is."" Alker shot a 66 with six birdies and one bogey, following Saturday's hugely important round of 63. He collected the Schwab Cup despite winning just one tournament this season, the season opener in Hawaii. But he had four runners-up and 15 top-10s entering the week. ""It's a season-long race, right, and so consistency, you want to try to get some wins in there as well,"" Alker said. ""I'm proud of the fact that I kept that consistency over the last few years."" Langer arrived at the course with a one-shot lead over Alker through 54 holes. He birdied his first four in a row and six of his first nine for a 6-under 30 before bogeying Nos. 10 and 11. ""I played good and then got a little unraveled there on the back nine, and Steven Alker got going,"" Langer said. Alker birdied Nos. 14, 15 and 17 to join the late tie with Langer and Green. Germany's Alex Cejka (68) was a distant fourth at 13 under. Australian Rod Pampling also shot 68 and placed fifth at 10 under.

It is the best start through 10 games for Arizona since it opened the 2021 season with seven straight wins.

A Nsiah 3-pointer at 17:44 capped the game-opening run. Creighton tied the game at 10-10 on Ashworth's trey at 15:05 of the first half. Kalkbrenner -- who set a new school record on Wednesday for field goals made with 20 -- jab-stepped and slid to the side to nail a top-of-the key 3-pointer to give the Bluejays a 22-17 lead. The 7-foot-1 center is now 3-for-3 from 3-point land on the season. As part of a 13-0 run, Ashworth hit a triple off a dribble handoff. On its next possession Neal scored on a nifty layup in transition as Creighton took a 33-26 lead and forced FDU to call its second timeout. The rally wouldn't stop though, as Creighton sailed to a 50-34 halftime lead. Kalkbrenner finished the first half with 15 points, featuring two dunks and a tip-in. Kalkbrenner and Neal highlighted back-to-back possessions with dunks for a 56-37 Creighton lead. Ashworth followed with a 3-pointer and Kalkbrenner had another dunk and was fouled as the Bluejays pulled away with a 12-0 run that gave them a 62-37 lead. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Chargers took over from there, moving 43 yards on seven plays to take a 20-10 lead on a 16-yard TD pass from Herbert to Quentin Johnston.

With the Bulldogs trailing, Huff dove to the floor to make a steal at midcourt and got the ball to Nembhard. He looked ahead and found Battle for an alley-oop dunk that tied the score at 63-all with 8:48 remaining and sent the crowd at the McCarthey Athletic Center into a frenzy. With 2:52 to go, Nembhard found a wide-open Battle in the left corner and he knocked down a 3-pointer to put Gonzaga up 78-73. ASU never got closer than four points the rest of the way. Battle added four free throws in the final 19 seconds to help clinch the victory. It was tied at 38-all after a back-and-forth first half.

Bohannon, who turns 54 next month, has a career record of 72-38, including 5-6 in the ASUN Conference in 2022, and 3-6 in a transition season as an independent in 2023. The Owls have the losing record this year as a new member of Conference USA, which led to media reports that he was in danger of being fired. The Owls' lone victory came at home Oct. 23 against previously undefeated Liberty, 27-24. Kennesaw State has lost two games since then, including a 43-35 double-overtime loss to UTEP on Saturday in El Paso, Texas. ""Coach Brian Bohannon informed me this morning that he has decided to step down as our head football coach,"" Kennesaw State athletic director Milton Overton said. ""I want to express my sincere appreciation to Coach Bohannon and his family for their dedication to Kennesaw State University and our football program over the past 11 years. ""Coach Bohannon led Kennesaw State into the football era, poured his heart and soul into this program, and represented our university with the highest standards of professionalism and character."" Chandler Burks, the co-offensive coordinator and a former star quarterback for the Owls, will serve as interim head coach for the rest of the season. The Owls have home games on Saturday against Sam Houston and Nov. 23 against FIU before visiting Louisiana Tech in Ruston on Nov. 30. Kennesaw State hired Bohannon in March 2013 to launch an FCS program, which made its debut in 2015 and quickly enjoyed success, going 49-10 from 2017-21. His teams won three Big South Conference titles and made four FCS playoff appearances. He was twice selected the Big South Conference Coach of the Year and was the 2017 FCS national coach of the year by the American Football Coaches Association. A former wide receiver at the University of Georgia (1991-93), Bohannon was an assistant coach at Gardner-Webb (1996), Georgia Southern (1997-2001), Navy (2002-07) and Georgia Tech (2008-12) before he was hired to start the program at Kennesaw State in 2013. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

After passing William Byron by going from fifth to first in one lap following a restart with 54 laps to go, Logano kept his No. 22 Team Penske Ford out front and went on to win by 0.33 seconds over defending champion Blaney, giving owner Roger Penske his third straight title. Logano made it into the championship playoffs after Alex Bowman was disqualified after the Southern 500 at Darlington. He parlayed that into his third title -- also doing it in 2018 and 2022 -- and became the 10th racer all-time to win at least three Cup titles. Byron, Kyle Larson and Christopher Bell completed the top five in the race that featured four cautions. Title contender Tyler Reddick was sixth. Carson Hocevar finished 18th and earned Rookie of the Year honors. Two-time champion Kyle Busch was 21st and failed to win over the 36 races, ending his NASCAR-record streak of 19 consecutive seasons with at least one win. In his final start as a full-time driver, 2017 Cup winner Martin Truex Jr. brought them to green from the pole position at the Arizona desert's 1-mile track, but teammate Ty Gibbs created the first caution when he scrubbed the wall in Turn 4 in his No. 54 then smacked the Turn 2 wall hard on Lap 2 in a single-car incident. Logano powered past Truex on the restart and set the pace in the 312-lap event to close 2024. Soon, all four of the title contenders were running inside the top 10 before the halfway point of 60-lap Stage 1, which Logano won after leading 54 laps. However, Logano's pit crew had difficulties on the right side during the pit stop, gridding him fifth when the group led by Chase Elliott left pit road with Byron and Blaney running in third and fourth. In the race's oddest moment as the field was about to restart, the Toyota pace car turned late onto pit road and made hard contact with the sand-filled yellow barrels abutting the beginning of the pit road outer wall. That wreck created a red-flag period. A week after being penalized for wall-riding on the final turns at Martinsville and eliminated from title contention, Bell had the look of a champion on the rare Champ 4 weekend when Joe Gibbs Racing did not have an entry among the quartet of Cup seekers. A day after saying he felt wronged by NASCAR and ""cheated"" out of a title chance, Bell had a strong No. 20 JGR Toyota for most of Stage 2. However, Blaney showed his strength by moving past Bell in the final laps as Penske Fords pulled off the segment sweep in the first 185 circuits around the slightly banked layout. With Bell leading following Stage 2's conclusion, Blaney, Byron and Logano occupied the next three spots, while Reddick slotted ninth with 117 laps left. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Its lone win came against Cal on Sept. 21. The Seminoles have dropped six straight games since that victory. Last season, Florida State went 13-1 and barely missed a College Football Playoff spot in the four-team system. The Seminoles lost 63-3 to Georgia in the Orange Bowl.

A third-year pro out of Oklahoma State, Eckroat joined the tour in 2023 and previously won at the Cognizant Classic in The Palm Beaches in March. Eckroat began the day a stroke behind leaders Justin Lower, Carson Young and Colombia's Nico Echavarria while he was also tied with two other players, Max Greyserman and Joe Highsmith.  That group, with the exception of Echavarria, was tightly aligned through nine holes Sunday, but Eckroat caught fire to begin the back nine of El Cardonal at Diamante, creating some needed separation with four birdies across the first five holes (Nos. 10-12, 14). That hot stretch, paired with his six birdies over his first eight holes, was ultimately necessary, as Eckroat fired his second bogey of the day on the par-5 18th, putting him at 24-under 264 for the tournament. That opened the door ever so slightly for Young (7-under 65), who could have forced a playoff with an eagle on 18. But Young, who carded seven other birdies on the day, settled for another to finish 23 under for the tourney, giving Eckroat a one-stroke victory. Lower (65), who was three strokes back after 17 holes, made up two of them with an eagle on 18 to finish in a tie for second with Young. Eckroat finished with 11 birdies against two bogeys to complete his remarkable day. Greyserman, meanwhile, was steady throughout but could never quite get into position to apply pressure. His eight-birdie, one-bogey day left him at 7 under for the round and 22 under for the tournament. Highsmith finished in fifth place at 19 under with his 4-under 68 final round, while Echavarria landed in a six-way tie for sixth place at 17 under after his 1-under 71. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

After a fairly quiet first half, the action picked up in the second, and the two sides finally converted. Tierna Davidson broke the scoreless draw to give Gotham a 1-0 lead in the 67th minute off a set piece. Lavelle served the ball into the center of the box and it landed by Davidson, who was amid a crowd of Thorns but got her foot on the ball to send a shot past the arm of goalkeeper Shelby Hogan. It was Davidson's first NWSL goal since 2019, then with the Chicago Red Stars. The Thorns capitalized on a free kick of their own to pull level in the 75th minute. Olivia Moultrie served a cross from the left, and Reilyn Turner jumped for header on the far side, directing just inside the right post. Gotham controlled much of the play in the first half, working more time in the attacking third while managing four shot attempts, one on target. Portland had only one shot attempt, not on target, in the opening 45 minutes. Gotham goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger nearly served up a golden opportunity for Christine Sinclair in the 40th minute when her attempt at midfield hit the star Canadian forward before Gotham recovered the ball in the defensive third. Berger coming out of the box nearly bit the hosts again in the 43rd minute when Portland's Sophia Smith got to the rolling ball first and put it into the empty net, but the goal was nullified for offside.

They're also aware that a torrid start quickly has transformed their profile. ""We know how hard it is to win in this league,"" the Cavaliers' Darius Garland said. ""And now, 11 in a row, 11-0. We're the hunted. We're not the hunters no more."" Cleveland earned its most recent victory behind a furious comeback. Hosting the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday, the Cavaliers sputtered after halftime, scoring only 13 points in the third quarter. Behind a double-double from Evan Mobley (23 points, 16 rebounds) and big scoring efforts from Donovan Mitchell (22 points) and Garland (20), Cleveland steadied things. An 82-68 deficit with 1:03 left in the third became a 105-100 victory. ""Normally, this is 11 games in, you're not thinking about a streak,"" Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""But tonight, you're like, man, 'I don't want it to end that this way.' ... We're trying to win every game, but it's kind of weirdly in the back of your mind when you're out there competing, like, 'man, we got to keep this thing going.' "" Chicago is aiming to win consecutive games for the second time this season. The Bulls stopped a four-game slide with Saturday's 125-113 win in Atlanta, relying on a big fourth quarter of their own. Chicago outscored Atlanta 35-15 in the final period, benefiting from a balanced attack that produced eight scorers in double figures. Ayo Dosunmu led the way with 19 points, Nikola Vucevic posted a double-double of 18 points and 12 boards, and Zach LaVine and Coby White added 18 points apiece. LaVine returned after missing the past three games with a right adductor strain. ""It's always good to get guys back in the lineup,"" he said. Opponents have outscored the Bulls in the first quarter nine times in 10 games to begin the season. Improved pace and ball movement have been catalysts for helping the team regroup; the Bulls have recorded at least 30 assists five times. ""We just wanted to find a way to get back in the winner's column,"" Chicago guard Josh Giddey said. ""I thought we started the game not great, and that third quarter really got us back in it and that group starting the fourth did an awesome job; the energy was great. I think it was a complete team effort tonight and that's what we needed against a group like this."" Challenging the Cavaliers, the 12th team in NBA history to start a season 11-0, will require sustained sharpness. Cleveland knows that well from the other side, with Saturday's frantic finish continuing the good vibes. ""Defensively, we locked in, got stops, got rebounds, boxed out, didn't miss opportunities,"" Mitchell said. ""We did all the little things, and I think that's what you saw tonight, just the effort as a whole. And that's what made this one special."" Cleveland has won seven of the past eight meetings against Chicago, but the Bulls lead the all-time series 133-101. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

It was the first catch as a Steeler for Williams, who was acquired Tuesday in a trade with the New York Jets, and came on third-and-9 play after the Steelers had fumbled at Washington's 1-yard line on their previous drive. After Chris Boswell's extra point, Washington (7-3) drove to midfield, but Jayden Daniels' pass to tight end Zach Ertz came up a yard short on fourth-and-9. The Commanders would have gotten the ball back, but Russell Wilson drew an offside penalty on fourth-and-1 at the Washington 49 with 1:02 remaining. Wilson was 14-of-28 for 195 yards, three touchdowns and one interception for the Steelers (7-2). George Pickens caught five passes for 91 yards and a score. Daniels finished 17-of-34 for 202 yards. Terry McLaurin had five catches for 113 yards and Austin Ekeler had two rushing scores. Early in the fourth quarter, Pittsburgh drove inside the 10. On second down at the 8, Jaylen Warren bulled his way to the 1, but as several Washington players struggled to bring him down the ball came out. Jeremy Chinn recovered for the Commanders. Pittsburgh took the early 7-0 lead when Wilson hit Pickens, who made a twisting, diving catch in the end zone for a 16-yard touchdown. Special teams factored heavily into the next two scores. On fourth-and-15 from deep in their own territory, the Steelers faked the punt, but James Pierre dropped the wide-open pass from Miles Killebrew. Washington took over at the 15, and three plays later Ekeler scored from the 1. Early in the second quarter, Washington's Olamide Zaccheaus muffed a punt. The Steelers started again at the 14 and Wilson hit Pat Freiermuth for a 3-yard touchdown. Trailing 14-10, the Commanders took over on their own 6-yard line with 5:39 in the half. On third-and-4 from the Pittsburgh 38, Daniels hit Luke McCaffrey for 23 yards and Ekeler later scored on another 1-yard run to send the Commanders to the locker room ahead 17-14. Washington got the second-half kick and on the first play, Daniels hit McLaurin for 54 yards to the Pittsburgh 17. Three plays later, the pair connected for 16 yards. Jeremy McNichols punched it in and the lead was 24-14. On the next drive, Wilson hit Pickens for a 34-yard catch-and-run to the Commanders 12, and Najee Harris scored from the 1 to pull the Steelers within 24-21. Zane Gonzalez, filling in for the injured Austin Seibert, hit from 41 yards out to make it 27-21 Commanders late in the third quarter. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Moody had earlier missed field goals of 49, 50 and 44, with the final one of the bunch coming with 3:09 remaining. Moody's third miss led to Chase McLaughlin's 26-yard field goal for the Buccaneers to tie the game 20-20 with 41 seconds remaining. The Bucs drove to the 49ers' 8-yard line to set up for the game-tying kick with the help of three penalties and a circus 8-yard completion by Baker Mayfield, who escaped pressure and fended off defensive end Nick Bosa long enough to get off a throw. Purdy's 13-yard pass to Jauan Jennings set up San Francisco's game-winning field goal from Moody. Jenings had seven receptions for 93 yards. 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan worked McCaffrey back into the offense mix immediately after missing the first eight games of the season with bilateral Achilles tendinitis. His presence also freed up opportunities for wide receivers Deebo Samuel and Jennings - both of whom had been dealing with injuries - and tight end George Kittle.  McCaffrey, the 2023 Offensive Player of the Year, finished with 39 yards rushing on 13 carries and 68 receiving yards on six catches for San Francisco (5-4). Purdy finished 25-for-36 for 353 yards with touchdown passes to rookie Ricky Pearsall and Kittle. Pearsall's 46-yard TD reception in the first quarter, that gave the 49ers a 7-0 lead, was the first score of the rookie's career and came after he was shot in the chest in a robbery attempt in August. He finished with four receptions for 73 yards. Tampa Bay (4-6) lost All-Pro left tackle Tristen Wirfs to a knee injury in the first half. Rachaad White's 9-yard touchdown reception from Mayfield tied the game 10-10 just 55 seconds into the second half as Tampa Bay exploited a muffed punt by Jacob Cowing at the San Francisco 21. Kittle's 11-yard TD catch came after Purdy extended the play gave San Francisco a 20-17 lead with 7:02 left. The eight-play, 52-yard drive was helped by an over-the-shoulder catch by McCaffrey that went for 30 yards. Tampa Bay took its first lead of the game 17-13 with 14:18 left against a defense withering in 90-degree heat. Running back Bucky Irving sliced in from 12 yards to cap a 12-play, 70-yard drive.

Romo, a 27-year-old rookie who signed with the Vikings this week after rookie kicker Will Reichard went down with an injury, provided all of the scoring for Minnesota (7-2). The Vikings' defense had three takeaways in the fourth quarter to seal the victory. Mac Jones scored on a 1-yard run to mark the only scoring for Jacksonville (2-8). Jones completed 14 of 22 passes for 111 yards and two interceptions as a replacement starter for Trevor Lawrence, who missed the game because of a shoulder injury. Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold completed 24 of 38 passes for 241 yards but threw three interceptions. Minnesota running back Aaron Jones finished with 101 total yards (88 rushing, 13 receiving). Romo put the Vikings on top 9-7 with 7:14 remaining in the fourth quarter. His 34-yard field goal sneaked inside the right upright for the go-ahead score. On the next possession, the Jaguars committed their first turnover on a botched snap. Jones could not handle the ball, and Vikings defensive lineman Harrison Phillips pounced on the fumble at the Jacksonville 25-yard line. Five plays later, the Vikings settled for another field goal to take a 12-7 lead. Romo connected from 29 yards for his fourth field goal. Jones followed with another turnover on the next drive. He underthrew a pass toward receiver Gabe Davis, and Byron Murphy Jr. stepped in front of it for an interception. The play marked Murphy's fourth interception of the season and his third in the past three games. Jacksonville's final drive ended in a third consecutive turnover. Camryn Bynum intercepted a deep pass at the Vikings' 1-yard line with 1:52 remaining. The Vikings opened the scoring midway through the first quarter. Romo made a 45-yard field goal to finish a 12-play, 53-yard drive. Jacksonville took a 7-3 lead with 3:44 to go in the first quarter. Jones scored on a quarterback keeper from the 1-yard line for his second career rushing touchdown.

It's the recent off-court concerns with Title IX allegations,"No. 21 Florida has been doing just fine on the court after a pair of season-opening wins. It's the recent off-court concerns with Title IX allegations against coach Todd Golden that have dominated the news. In a home battle with Grambling on Monday in Gainesville, Fla., the Gators will try to keep the focus on a promising hoops season. The Gators (2-0) come in off a 98-83 win over South Florida and an 81-60 victory over Jacksonville in the first week of the season. After 24 wins and an NCAA Tournament berth in Golden's second season, Florida is well-positioned to continue an upward trend. The Gators have been led by a powerful scoring quartet who have accounted for over 77 percent of the Florida offense. Senior guards Walter Clayton and Will Richard have averaged 19 and 18 points per game, respectively, while Aussie sophomore Alex Condon (18 ppg) and junior guard Alijah Martin (14 ppg) complete the high-scoring group. Florida has connected on 72.9 percent of its 2-point attempts through two games, which is among the nation's leaders. The Gators' biggest early weakness has been the glass, where they have a net-zero rebounding margin. Despite two early wins, Golden has room for concern with the Gators. ""Fundamentally, we're not great right now,"" he said after Florida's win over Jacksonville. ""Part of it is a combination of being too amped up and trying to run in and trace down the ball, as opposed to hitting bodies."" Golden later reiterated, ""We did not rebound well enough if we want to be the team we're capable of."" Meanwhile, Grambling (1-1) is led by veteran coach Donte Jackson and presents a legitimate challenge. Jackson led the Tigers to 21 wins and the school's first NCAA Tournament berth last season.  This year, Grambling topped NAIA-level opponent Southern-New Orleans 92-42, then dropped a close battle with No. 24 Ole Miss, 66-64. The Tigers led by eight points at halftime in that game but were eventually done in by 22 turnovers. Four Tigers are currently scoring in double figures, led by Kintavious Dozier at 15.0 ppg. Dozier earned all-SWAC honors last season. Among the other top Tigers are Mikale Stevenson (13.5 ppg), NC State transfer Ernest Ross (12.5 ppg) and Antwan Burnett (12.0 ppg, 8.5 rebounds per game). The Tigers, unlike their hosts, have been excellent on the boards, outrebounding opponents by 10.5 rebounds per game, including a plus-six margin at Ole Miss. On the downside, they are one of the worst free-throw shooting teams in the nation at just 59.4 percent. Ole Miss coach Chris Beard spoke at length in praise of Grambling after his hard-fought win. ""We didn't play our best, but the reason we didn't play our best was a lot on the other team -- Grambling,"" Beard said. He later clarified, ""They had our full attention. This isn't going to be one of those deals where Ole Miss didn't play well. That's an NCAA Tournament team. That's where we're trying to get."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

In the 96th minute, a Spirit cross in front of the Bay FC goal bounced off the shoulder of defender Caprice Dydasco and landed in the back of the net. It proved to be the difference in a defensive battle that needed extra time to decide. The second-seeded Spirit will advance to the semifinals and host the winner of Gotham FC and the Portland Thorns, while the inaugural season for expansion side Bay FC ended in disappointment for the No. 7 seed. Neither side netted a goal until deep into the second half, as the Spirit's Aubrey Kingsbury and Bay FC's Katelyn Rowland put forth some of their best goalkeeping efforts of the season. Kingsbury had a highlight-worthy stop in the 35th minute, leaping into the air to punch an attempt over the bar. Rowland denied Trinity Rodman a goal in the 24th minute. In the 82nd minute, Asisat Oshoala finally broke the scoreless draw, knocking in a right-footed shot from very close range to put Bay FC ahead 1-0 with minutes remaining. The ball came to her Penelope Hocking, who corralled a delivery from the corner and sent it to Oshoala to tap in her eighth goal of the season. The Spirit countered, scoring in the 86th minute. After a cross from Rodman was knocked out of the box, Tara McKeown charged up the middle of the field, took possession of the ball and fired a right-footed shot that took a few bounces before dribbling past Rowland into the left corner of the net. Nothing was produced between the two sides in nine minutes of stoppage time to send the elimination game into extra time.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Vanderbilt won despite shooting 12.0 percent on 25 attempts from 3-point range but had just nine turnovers and won the rebounding battle 53-32, while making 78.0 percent of its 41 free throws.  McGlockton, a transfer from Boston College, recorded his second double-double in as many games.  BJ Ward scored 22 points, Teddy Washington Jr. had 19 and TJ Biel added 12 for the Redhawks (0-2), who hit 48.0 percent of their 25 shots from 3-point range. Southeast Missouri State went 8 of 13 (61.5 percent) from the free-throw line.  It was the Redhawks' 36th-straight loss against a power-conference team.  The game was the Vanderbilt debut for Hoggard, who returned from an NCAA suspension in his first game after transferring from Michigan State. Nickel canned his second 3-pointer of the second half with 16:10 left, giving the Commodores their first double-figure lead at 56-45.  Southeast Missouri State continued to hit wide-open 3s, with Washington making one with 8:00 left, that cut the margin to 70-65. But the fouls began to pile up on the Redhawks. Washington picked up his fourth as part of a double-technical with Hoggard, while starter Troy Cole Jr. fouled out with 3:57 left. Ward checked out with 6:06 left with the training staff attending to the area around his knee before checking back in with 3:35 left and the Redhawks trailing 78-70. They never got closer from there.  Ward had 14 points at half, as the Redhawks made seven 3-pointers compared to one on 13 attempts for Vanderbilt. But Vanderbilt had a 40-38 edge at half thanks to 14 offensive rebounds and a 15 of 22 showing from the foul line.  The Redhawks led 16-6 early but Hoggard, who checked in at the 16:25 mark of the first half, keyed a 17-4 run that gave Vanderbilt its first lead.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Ospreys (3-0), who defeated SEC member South Carolina in the season opener, earned their first win over an Atlantic Coast Conference opponent. They became the first opponent to score 100 against Georgia Tech at McCamish Pavilion since Duke in 2017. Harris was 8-for-10 from the floor with seven rebounds.

But North Florida was 8-for-9 at the line, while Georgia Tech was just 1-for-6, allowing the Ospreys to hold a 53-49 halftime lead. North Florida continued its hot shooting to start the second half. The Ospreys outscored the Yellow Jackets 11-0 to take a 66-56 lead at 16:27 and never slowed down. UNF built the lead to 20 when Lliteras drove the lane for a slam, drew a foul and finished the three-point play to complete a 14-0 run that made it it 80-60 with 11:08 left.

Rubin Jones made a final foul shot for Michigan and intentionally missed the next attempt, but the Wolverines couldn't secure the rebound for a final shot. Freshman Juke Harris scored 11 points off the bench in Wake Forest's first game away from home. Roddy Gayle Jr. led Michigan (1-1) with 11 points, Tre Donaldson had 10 points and nine rebounds and L.J. Cason also scored 10. Sam Walters (nine points), Nimari Burnett (nine), Jones (nine) and Vladislav Goldin (eight) were contributors. Spillers' 3-pointer gave Wake Forest its first lead at 44-43 with 15:56 to play, but there was a back-and-forth stretch after that. Michigan led 57-53 before failing to score for more than five minutes. Sallis posted six points during a 10-0 Demon Deacons run. Leading 65-63, Wake Forest benefited from a Michigan airball as the shot clock expired. The action stayed at the other end for 90 seconds as the Demon Deacons collected a pair of offensive rebounds before a turnover. On the final of Michigan's three straight turnovers, Spillers scored on a breakaway dunk for a 67-63 edge with 38 seconds left. Gayle hit a pair of free throws for Michigan at the 30.3-second mark. Michigan shot 14-for-28 from the field in the first half but 10-for-29 in the second half.

The Scarlet Knights (1-0) started the season with a 75-52 victory Wednesday over Wagner despite the absence of Ace Bailey, the nation's No. 2 overall recruit in 2024. Bailey, a 6-foot-10 guard/forward, is listed as day-to-day after suffering an unspecified injury during practice last week. ""Every year is exciting in its own way, but every year is challenging in its own way too,"" Rutgers coach Steve Pikiell said. ""So quick reminder with Ace, the challenges that come with your season and having guys ready, and early in the season, is always a challenge."" Another five-star recruit, guard Dylan Harper, led host Rutgers with 20 points and added four assists Wednesday, playing 32 minutes in the 23-point victory. ""It was a dream come true, to be honest,"" Harper said. ""Getting a chance to play in front of this crowd, in front of the Riot Squad, it's just crazy. Honestly, a blessing."" Freshman Lathan Sommerville had 11 points and eight rebounds in his first collegiate game. PJ Hayes IV scored 12 points and Jeremiah Williams added 10. Despite the lopsided win, Pikiell is looking for improvement in his team in Game 2. ""We gotta rebound better, we gotta do a lot of things, but we've got a lot more players to decide from,"" he said. Wagner outrebounded Rutgers 42-39, but the Scarlet Knights' defense helped them overcome the deficiency on the boards and come away with the victory. Rutgers held Wagner to 34.9 percent shooting from the field and forced 11 turnovers, scoring 16 points off those mistakes. Now, the Scarlet Knights will face Saint Peter's (0-2), which is working in eight new players under coach Bashir Mason. ""Toughness,"" Mason said about the Peacocks' style of basketball. ""We practice it every day. Just being able to withstand adverse conditions, rough handlings, staying together and staying connected. Figuring out ways to win."" Although Saint Peter's is winless, both losses have come by seven points or fewer after second-half comeback efforts. On Friday, the Peacocks traveled to UMass Lowell and fell 81-74. Saint Peter's trailed by nine at halftime and by 15 early in the second half before drawing within four points five times down the stretch. Marcus Randolph led Saint Peter's with 16 points, and Stephon Roberts was two points shy of a double-double with eight points and 11 rebounds. The Peacocks started the season with a 57-53 loss at Seton Hall on Monday. Saint Peter's will play eight of its first nine games on the road this year. Last season, the Peacocks traveled to Rutgers, too, losing 71-40 on Nov. 27. Saint Peter's recovered at the end of the season to win the MAAC Tournament title and gain its second NCAA Tournament berth in the three seasons. In 2022, the Peacocks won three tournament games before falling to North Carolina in the Elite Eight. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Golden Eagles were pleased with how they put Friday's game to bed and will try to bring a similar composure into Monday's contest against visiting Central Michigan in Milwaukee. In a game played at Marquette's campus arena that only students were allowed to attend, the Golden Eagles trailed pesky George Mason multiple times in the second half. They slipped behind 51-50 with 13:36 to go after allowing a 3-pointer to Darius Maddox. Marquette (2-0) scored the next five points to flip the lead, then pulled away with a dominant 21-2 run in the closing minutes. Head coach Shaka Smart praised the poise shown by his younger players in particular. ""That's part of doing things the way we do things, is putting up a level of investment,"" Smart said in his postgame press conference. ""Intentionality with their growth in every second of every day. And knowing that on Nov. 8 you are not going to be anywhere near where you want to be at the end of the year. These are valuable, valuable experiences, these games. You just can't replicate them."" The freshmen and sophomores are coming along, but Marquette continues to be steered by a group of veteran leaders. David Joplin put up a game-high 27 points, 10 rebounds and three steals.  Kam Jones, who dropped 32 points in a season-opening win over Stony Brook, was the driving force behind the offense again. He scored 24 points on 9-of-14 shooting and dished eight assists to go with five rebounds and three steals.  ""I'm just out there with a mentality of making the right play, whatever that means,"" Jones said, per the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. ""If that means me scoring, fine. If that means me passing. If that means I'm in the corner with the correct spacing. Whatever it is, that's what I'm trying to do every possession on both ends."" Chase Ross also made key contributions, including scoring seven of his 11 points in the second half. He added five rebounds, four assists and a career-high five steals. Marquette has 23 steals through two games and has scored 46 points off opponents' turnovers. Central Michigan (1-1) hosted Stony Brook on Thursday and squandered a 12-point lead en route to a 73-72 loss. Bryan Ndjonga missed two free throws after being intentionally fouled, and the Chippewas yielded a game-winning layup to Collin O'Connor with three seconds left. Jakobi Heady leads Central Michigan with a 14.5 scoring average through two games. Damarion Bonds, a junior college transfer, made his team debut against Stony Brook and scored 10 points in 10 minutes off the bench, including back-to-back 3-pointers during the first half. ""He has the chance to be an electric scorer, and we got a small glimpse of what he has the ability to do,"" coach Tony Barbee told the Central Michigan student newspaper.

But coach Will Wade and the reigning Southland Conference champion McNeese State have proved they aren't a team to sleep on. McNeese State became one of the mid-major darlings of college basketball last season, going 30-3 in the regular season and conference tournament. They made the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 22 years, losing to Gonzaga 86-65 in the first round. McNeese State (1-1) started this season on a down note as it fell to South Dakota State 80-73 in their season opener.  ""We've got to get better with our attention to detail, especially with the scouting report,"" Wade said after the opener. ""We've got to get better with our movement on offense and create double gaps. And we've got to get better at driving and playing through contact."" It's likely McNeese State worked through some of those issues as it rebounded with a 111-57 win over the College Of Biblical Studies, who play in the National Christian Collegiate Athletic Association. Guard Javohn Garcia is averaging 18 points for the Cowboys on 60.9 percent shooting from the field. Providence transfer Alyn Breed scored 18 points in the season opener but missed their second game for precautionary reasons. He is expected to play against Alabama. ""His knee had some swelling after our practices (Wednesday),"" Wade said Thursday. ""We had a couple practices (Wednesday), one in the afternoon and one at night, and he had a little swelling after that, so we decided not to risk it. He could have played today, but we got to be smart about that."" The Crimson Tide (2-0) entered the season ranked second in the Associated Press Top 25. They backed up their ranking with a resounding 56-point win over UNC Asheville in the season opener before beating Arkansas State 88-79 in a much tighter affair in their second game.  Mark Sears, the Southeastern Conference preseason player of the year, has been leading the charge for Alabama over the first two games with an average of 19.5 points per game. Guard Labaron Philon leads the team with an average of 6 assists per game in addition to 11 points per game. Philon was one assist shy of a double-double in his collegiate debut. ""He's a great two-way player,"" Alabama coach Nate Oats said about Philon, a freshman. ""He plays really hard on both sides of the ball. ... He's got size and athleticism and he's been playing the right way, really, since he stepped on campus."" Big man Clifford Omoruyi also has been a difference maker for the Crimson Tide.

The No. 14 Boilermakers (2-0) look to please their leader when they battle Yale (1-1) on Monday night in nonconference play at West Lafayette, Ind. A showdown with No. 2 Alabama looms on Friday for the program that lost to UConn in last season's national championship game. Also, the contest against the Bulldogs definitely rates tougher than opening foes Texas A&M-Corpus Christi and Northern Kentucky. Yale was one of the darlings of March Madness last season. The 13th-seeded Bulldogs of the Ivy League stunned fourth-seeded Auburn 78-76 in the first round before getting stomped by San Diego State in the second round. So Painter wants a larger effort in Game No. 3 of the season. ""He kind of ripped us a little bit, but it's simple stuff,"" Boilermakers guard Fletcher Loyer said in the postgame press conference following Friday's 72-50 home win over Northern Kentucky. ""It's just talking to each other. We talk off the floor so we can talk on the floor. And he always says, 'If you're doing it, you're saying it.' ""Just making sure we're all being positive with each other, make or missed shots. Just keep talking to each other, and ultimately that leads to success."" Loyer certainly isn't the cause of any dismay as he leads the Boilermakers with an 18.5 scoring average and has knocked down 7 of 10 3-pointers. Trey Kaufman-Renn is averaging 14.5 points and a team-best 7.0 rebounds while top-notch point guard Braden Smith is averaging 11.5 points and a team-high 11.0 assists per game. Starting center Daniel Jacobsen unlikely will be available after sustaining a knee injury one minute into the game against Northern Kentucky on Friday. Painter said Jacobson would undergo an MRI exam Saturday. Will Berg is the likely starter against Yale. The Bulldogs split their first two games, beating Quinnipiac to open the season before losing 91-79 to Illinois-Chicago on Friday. March Madness hero John Poulakidas scored 21 points against UIC and is averaging 20.0 over the first two games. Poulakidas scored 28 points in the mammoth upset of Auburn. He made 10 of 15 shots, including 6 of 9 from 3-point range. Yale coach James Jones is in his 24th season at the school. That upset was his second NCAA Tournament victory. Jones is worried about whether last March could be the Ivy League's last hurrah as recent changes like NIL and the transfer portal work against the education-minded schools in his conference. ""I don't know how feasible it is to continue the success we have nationally in the league, given the new structure of things, where everybody is being paid except for our guys,"" Jones told reporters earlier this month. ""I don't know if we can sustain. Five years from now, is an Ivy League team going to be able to go to the NCAA Tournament and beat an Auburn team? I don't know. ""From that standpoint, it makes it hard. We're 40 minutes away from a Sweet 16 last year and we've gotten (to the second round) twice. I don't know. Different world. Absolutely different world. It's changed, and I don't know if it's changed for the better."" Yale is 0-2 against Purdue and the most recent matchup came in the 2022 NCAA Tournament. The Boilermakers prevailed 78-56. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The group's mentality is to always find areas to improve, and that will be the case as Iowa State (1-0) tips off against Kansas City (2-0) on Monday night in Ames, Iowa. ""Yeah, we have to do a better job of playing simple basketball,"" Otzelberger said. ""I think, offensively, there are times the ball got stuck with one guy and we over-dribbled it,"" he said. ""There are plays on the defensive end that we didn't finish with two hands. We (would get) a rebound, we dribble it off of someone's foot or we have a careless turnover. Things that were just sloppy that are uncharacteristic of how we play."" Despite those imperfections, Iowa State cruised to an 83-44 win over Mississippi Valley State in its opener last Monday. Keshon Gilbert scored 17 points, Tamin Lipsey contributed 16, and Joshua Jefferson and Milan Momcilovic added 10 apiece to lead the Cyclones, who shot only 23.8 percent (5 of 21) from beyond the arc.  That's an area Otzelberger will look to improve upon against Kansas City. ""I thought we had good looks,"" he said. ""Curt (Jones) and Milan, specifically, had really good looks. Overall, we want to shoot the ball better than we did. But I didn't think it was because we didn't have good looks. It was because they weren't falling for whatever reason."" Kansas City will aim to challenge the Cyclones after opening its season with back-to-back, double-digit victories. The Roos cruised to a 124-36 win over Kansas Christian in their most recent game Friday night. The 88-point margin of victory against the NCCAA Division II program is the biggest in program history for Kansas City. The previous record was a 73-point win over Bacone (111-38) on Nov. 18, 2019. ""I felt like we put ourselves in position early to just execute and not have to worry about winning the game, so to speak,"" Roos coach Marvin Menzies said. ""That's something we didn't do in our last game (91-68 win over Hannibal-LaGrange last Monday), so I felt like we took a step in the right direction."" Anderson Kopp scored 22 points to lead Kansas City on Friday. He added five rebounds and three steals. Kasheem Grady II also will look to stay hot for the Roos. He scored 21 points on 7-of-11 shooting from the field, including 5 of 7 from beyond the arc, against Kansas Christian. Menzies said his team needs to be focused for a tough test at Iowa State. ""The train is out of the station now,"" he said. ""So it's rolling. We'll put this game behind us and put all our focus into the next possession."" Menzies and Otzelberger share a connection: Both men were head coaches at UNLV. Menzies spent three seasons there (2016-19) and was immediately succeeded by Otzelberger (2019-21). Monday will mark the sixth meeting between Iowa State and Kansas City. The Cyclones are 5-0 in the series. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Panthers (3-7) got the ball at the New York 23 for its only possession of overtime. Bryce Young completed 15 of 25 passes for 126 yards with a touchdown and Chuba Hubbard churned out a career-high 153 yards on the ground on 28 carries. Giants quarterback Daniel Jones went 22-for-37 for 190 yards with two interceptions. He ran for a touchdown.  Running back Tyrone Tracy Jr. gained 103 yards on 18 carries with a touchdown, but his fumble on the first snap of overtime set up Carolina's winning points. Graham Gano's 42-yard field goal with five seconds to play forced overtime for the Giants (2-8), who've lost five straight games.  With the score at 17-14, the teams traded turnovers in the final eight minutes. The Panthers lost a fumble, only to have Jones throw an interception four plays later. New York got the ball back at its own 21-yard line with 2:23 remaining and drove for the tying field goal.  The Giants opened the second half by going 65 yards in 10 plays while consuming more than six minutes off the clock. Tracy ran 32 yards for the touchdown. Carolina responded by marching 80 yards in 10 plays with Hubbard scoring on a 1-yard run. Then in the fourth quarter, the Giants covered 96 yards in 13 plays and used almost seven minutes in doing so. Jones capped the drive by running 2 yards for a score as New York closed within 17-14. Aside from one drive, there wasn't much offense in the first half. The Panthers scored first by going 90 yards in eight plays, with Young connecting with tight end Ja'Tavion Sanders for a 5-yard touchdown play. Carolina added to its lead on the next possession, using 10 plays to go 56 yards to set up Pineiro's 53-yard field goal. Trailing 10-0, the Giants threatened in the second quarter, but Gano -- a former Carolina kicker in his first game back after an injury -- sailed a 43-yard field goal attempt wide right. New York reached Carolina territory again before halftime, getting all the way to the 18-yard line before Xavier Woods intercepted Jones on the first play after the two-minute warning.

NFL Network reported that rest and rehab appear to be the plan of the Jaguars (2-7) for Lawrence. However, surgery remains an option Lawrence and the Jaguars will consider. Mac Jones, who was acquired by Jacksonville via trade in March, will start Sunday's game versus the Vikings (6-2).  Lawrence, 25, will miss the second game of his NFL career. He sustained the injury in the second quarter of Jacksonville's 28-23 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles last Sunday. He finished the game, however, and completed 16 of 31 passes for 169 yards and two interceptions. Jones became party to a controversy when current Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores was fired by the Dolphins. According to former NFL executive Michael Lombardi, Flores told his then-starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa that Miami should've drafted Jones instead. As the starting quarterback of the Patriots, Jones lost to Flores and the Dolphins twice in 2021. The No. 1 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, Lawrence has completed 61.3 percent of his passes for 2,004 yards, 11 touchdowns and six interceptions through nine starts in 2024. Also on Sunday, the Jaguars listed defensive end Myles Cole, offensive lineman Ezra Cleveland and defensive tackles Esezi Otomewo and Maason Smith.  Cornerbacks Fabian Moreau and Dwight McGlothern, defensive lineman Levi Drake Rodriguez, offensive linemen Dan Feeney and Walter Rouse, and quarterback Brett Rypien are inactive for the Vikings. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Sabres followed impressive blowout wins over the Ottawa Senators and the New York Rangers with a 3-2 shootout victory over the Calgary Flames on Saturday. J.J. Peterka scored the game-winning shootout goal, while Tage Thompson fired home his team-leading 10th goal of the season in the victory. Thompson has goals in three straight games and could improve his totals versus a Canadiens' team that he has found success against in his career. The 27-year-old forward has seven goals and seven assists across 12 outings against Montreal. Sabres goaltender Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen has been pivotal to their recent success. Luukkonen has allowed just 2.25 goals per game while winning six of his past eight starts. Head coach Lindy Ruff gave praise to his Finnish netminder following Saturday's shootout victory.  ""He's played very well, the team play has been better and his play has been better,"" Ruff said. ""He's really made key saves. You look at that overtime save he made for us, that allowed us to get the extra point."" Another key to the Sabres' recent success has been their special teams play. After failing to score on their first 22 power-play opportunities to start the season, Buffalo is 7 for 23 on the man advantage over their past seven games. A win on Monday would give the Sabres their first four-game winning streak in 21 months. At the other end of the spectrum, the Canadiens fell to the Toronto Maple Leafs 4-1 on Saturday night, en route to their sixth consecutive loss (0-5-1). One bright spot for the Canadiens has been the play of veteran winger Brendan Gallagher. The 32-year-old scored the Canadiens' lone goal on Saturday, giving him seven on the season, and extended his goal-scoring streak to three games. The 2010 fifth-round pick now ranks 19th all-time in the Canadiens' goal-scoring ranks with 225 career tallies. Canadiens' top scorers Cole Caufield and captain Nick Suzuki have both been held off the scoresheet in each of the past four contests. ""Some of us, myself included, are struggling to produce and find the back of the net,"" Suzuki told reporters after his team's most recent loss. ""I expect better from myself, I'm sure the other guys (do) as well. We need our whole lineup to produce."" Along with their lack of goal scoring, the Canadiens have struggled to keep the puck out of their net. They have allowed 29 goals over the past six losses and scored just 12. The Canadiens recent string of losses seems to be taking a toll on the young squad.  ""It's not great right now. But we're still trying to be positive right now,"" forward Josh Anderson said of the team's feelings. ""Trying to still find our swagger and do the right things. Once we find one, we'll be fine."" The Canadiens enter the matchup in last place in the Eastern Conference and have lost the past two games against the Sabres. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Harlan blasted the officiating late Saturday after the Utes lost to rival BYU, 22-21, on Utah's home field. ""This game was absolutely stolen from us,"" Harlan said. ""We were excited about being in the Big 12, but tonight I am not. We won this game. Someone else stole it from us. Very disappointed."" The Utes, accustomed to being in the mix atop the Pac-12 standings, are struggling in their first year in the Big 12 at 4-5 overall, 1-5 in the conference. Utah clung to a 21-19 led for most of the fourth quarter after a BYU touchdown at the 12:35 mark of the final frame. And twice late in the quarter, the Utes looked as if they were headed to the win. While Harlan didn't specify a call that riled him in particular, it likely occurred in the final two minutes. With 1:56 left, BYU took possession on its 9-yard line, and quarterback Jake Retzlaff fired three straight incomplete passes. The Cougars called a timeout, and on the ensuing fourth-and-10 play, Retzlaff was sacked for a loss that put the ball on the BYU 1-yard-line with about 90 seconds to go. But a holding penalty called on Utah cornerback Zemaiah Vaughn gave BYU new life and the ball at its 19. Retzlaff took advantage, completing passes of 30 yards and 12 yards, and running back Hinckley Ropati's 14-yard run took the ball to the Utah 25 with 1:07 on the clock. A false start penalty on BYU sent the ball back to the Utah 30, and the Cougars spent the next three plays positioning the ball and running down the clock to give Will Ferrin a 44-yard field-goal attempt. which he hit with just three seconds left. ""I will talk to the commissioner. This was not fair to our team,"" Harlan said. ""I'm disgusted by the professionalism of the officiating crew tonight."" Utah coach Kyle Whittingham was angry with officials on the field but let his boss address the officiating postgame. ""Couldn't get that last stop when we needed it, unfortunately,"" Whittingham said. ""That's kind of been the story for several games."" BYU coach Kalani Sitake said refereeing comes with the territory. ""Whatever decision the refs make, I don't think they're trying to get it wrong, so that's just part of the game,"" BYU coach Kalani Sitake said. ""The refs are part of the game. We were able to capitalize on that."" With the win, which came before the largest crowd (54,383) ever at Rice-Eccles Stadium in Salt Lake City, No. 9 BYU moved to 9-0, 6-0 in the conference, to stay firmly in the mix for a College Football Playoff berth.

As part of the series, the Nets will take on the alternate identity of “Les Nets” during their six Quebec-based games. The team’s temporary red-and-blue logo features two fleur-de-lis on a blue circle, a nod to the Quebec flag. A large red circle within the blue includes Montreal’s Mount Royal cross, stylized to represent a basketball while incorporating the city name. The incorporation of red isn’t because the Long Island Nets typically use red (I mean, of course, it is); it’s a tribute to Montreal’s McGill University, where James Naismith, the inventor of basketball, taught in the 1880s. “Montreal has a vibrant basketball legacy, and this partnership presents a unique opportunity to blend our culture with the Laval community,” said Morgan Taylor, Head of Business Operations for the Long Island Nets, in the press release. “We look forward to engaging with a new fanbase and creating memorable moments both on and off the court.” The arrangement brings up memories of the unique situation Minor League Baseball’s Buffalo Bisons found themselves in during the 2021 season. With their MLB affiliate from Toronto residing in their home stadium due to COVID-19 restrictions, the Bisons shifted their home games to Trenton, NJ. They played with a split identity, using their usual Bisons name and uniforms on the road but taking on that of the Trenton Thunder at home.

FC Barcelona announced the new “multi-year partnership agreement” on their website on Saturday, November 9. The club said the deal “brings a new collaborative strategic partnership model between the two organizations.” This new partnership consolidates Nike as a Main Partner of the Club and Official Technical Partner across all professional and amateur teams, bringing a unique model that strengthens the brands association and fuels the global retail and licensing business growth. Nike has a key strategic role in the Club’s Retail Operations and together with Barça Licensing & Merchandising will join forces in the development of specific plans related to product creation, supply chain and global distribution.   Nike has outfitted Barça since 1998. Since then, Barça’s men’s first team has won four Champions League titles, 12 La Liga titles, seven Copas del Rey, three World Club Cups and three European Super Cups wearing Nike uniforms, while the women’s first team has won nine league titles, three UEFA Women’s Champions League titles and nine Copas de la Reina in that time. The terms of the deal between Barça and Nike were not disclosed in Saturday’s announcement, but ESPN reports “the deal will total significantly more than €100 million ($107m) per year, but that the agreement is incremental and that the total amount is also dependent on certain add-ons.” They also report that Barça president Joan Laporte has previously claimed it would be the biggest deal of its kind in world soccer. According to Mundo Deportivo, Barça will receive €1.7 billion over 14 years, or about €121 million per year. It also includes a signing bonus of €158 million, which will also be spread over the 14 years of the contract. Mundo Deportivo also reports that Barça was allowed to field offers from other companies, and they did receive a proposal from German sportswear brand Puma, which Nike then matched. The previous contract between Nike and Barça was set to expire in 2024. There was some friction between the two sides earlier this year, with Footy Headlines reporting in July that a Spanish court had blocked Barça’s attempted to end their contract early. They also reported that retailers were having a hard time ordering Barcelona products from Nike, and Barça’s 2024-25 third kit celebrating women’s sport was released about three weeks later than similar third kits for other high-profile clubs outfitted by Nike."

The Smokies, who play in the Southern League, announced this week that with their return to their once and future hometown, the team will change its geographic designation from Tennessee to Knoxville. With that announcement came an armful of updated logos—though their familiar bear character, originally created by Dan Simon of Studio Simon in 2015, remains largely unchanged. The new suite of logos, design in house, includes a series of type-based marks as well as an alternate mark featuring three stars from the Tennessee state flag. “With the upcoming move to Knoxville, it is imperative to embrace our new home, while maintaining the Smokies brand,” said Boyd Sports President Chris Allen, quoted on MiLB.com. “It is our desire that the new logo honors the city of Knoxville and the rich tradition of Smokies Baseball.” The franchise played in Knoxville from 1921 to 1999 under a handful of names, including the Pioneers (1921–1924), Sox (1972–1979), Blue Jays (1980–1992), and two stints as the Knoxville Smokies (1925–1967 and 1993–1999). After the 1999 season, the team moved 20 miles east to the town of Kodak, where they played from 2000 to 2024 as the Tennessee Smokies. The Smokies will play at a new ballpark, Covenant Health Ballpark, set to open in 2025."

New look from a familiar era. Get your City Edition Jersey 11.14.24 pic.twitter.com/svaZdznsxa The white uniforms feature a slanted “H-Town” wordmark across the chest that is inspired by the uniforms worn by Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler during those championships seasons, particularly the lowercase “t.” The red and blue striping pattern on the collar, shoulders, sides of the jerseys and – most notably – around the shorts mirrors the shape and trimming of the Rockets’ championship banners, which hang in the rafters at Toyota Center. The logo on the side of the shorts matches the center-court logo at The Summit, Houston’s home from 1975-2003. It was where the Rockets clinched their titles with a Game 7 victory over the New York Knicks in 1994 and a sweep of the Orlando Magic in 1995. The logo matches Houston’s primary logo at the time, but also includes a “Summit” wordmark at the bottom. The Summit’s logo – which is reminiscent of the Portland Trail Blazers’ logo – can also be seen in gold on the waistband of the shorts, matching the Nike swoosh on the shoulder and hip. The uniforms are complete with Olajuwon and Drexler’s signatures and a “Believe It! Again!” wordmark, which is a nod to the team’s rally cry during their second title run, above the jock tag. This marks the second straight year the Hall of Famers’ signatures are included in Houston’s City Edition design. The Rockets will wear their new City Edition uniforms 13 times this season, including against the Indiana Pacers on Nov. 20, Blazers on Nov. 23, Minnesota Timberwolves on Dec. 27, Los Angeles Lakers on Jan. 5, Phoenix Suns on Feb. 13, Golden State Warriors on Feb. 13, Milwaukee Bucks on Feb. 25, San Antonio Spurs on Feb. 26, Magic on March 10, Suns on March 12, Philadelphia 76ers on March 17, Denver Nuggets on March 23 and Oklahoma City Thunder on April 4."

The Rangers unveiled the jerseys on their website and social media accounts on Friday, November 8, making this the 19th straight season the team has produced a Remembrance Day jersey. This year’s edition commemorates the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Normandy — better known as D-Day — which took place on June 6, 1944. The base of the jersey is royal blue, with grey, red and white stripes around each sleeve and the waist. The front of the jersey features a shield “based on imagery of soldiers entering the battle on the beaches of Normandy,” according to the Rangers’ website. Above the blue soldier rushing off a landing craft is the inscription “1944-2024”, while three red maple leaves swirl around the soldier. The 1944 Battle of Normandy was one of the pivotal events of the Second World War and the scene of some of Canada’s greatest feats of arms. Canadian sailors, soldiers and airmen played a critical role in the Allied invasion of Normandy, also called Operation Overlord, beginning the bloody campaign to liberate Western Europe from Nazi occupation. Nearly 150,000 Allied troops landed or parachuted into the invasion area on D-Day, including 14,000 Canadians at Juno Beach. The Royal Canadian Navy contributed 124 vessels and 10,000 sailors and the Royal Canadian Air Force contributed 39 squadrons to the operation. Total Allied casualties on D-Day reached more than 10,000, including 1,096 Canadians, of whom 381 were killed in action. By the end of the Battle of Normandy, the Allies had suffered 209,000 casualties, including more than 18,700 Canadians. Over 5,000 Canadian soldiers died. A poppy sits on the left chest of the jersey as a symbol of remembrance honoring armed forces personnel who have died in conflict. The left shoulder has a “D-DAY 80” logo while the Rangers’ primary logo sits on the right shoulder. The jersey was pictured with blue pants, gloves and helmets in photos released with Friday’s announcement. The socks are also blue with the same striping as found on the sleeves. The Rangers will wear their Remembrance Day jerseys tonight (Friday, November 8) when they host the Soo Greyhounds at the Kitchener Memorial Auditorium. It’s their only home game this Remembrance Day weekend, as they visit the Owen Sound Attack on Saturday and the Oshawa Generals on Sunday. Rangers fans can purchase game-worn Remembrance Day jerseys through a silent auction that will run throughout Friday’s game. Five of the jerseys will also be available for auction online through DASH. Proceeds from both auctions will benefit the 78th Fraser Highlanders Fort Conestoga Garrison and the Kitchener-Waterloo Poppy Fund."

The Moose unveiled the jersey on their website and social media channels on Thursday, November 7, and they’ll wear them on the ice for the first time on Saturday, November 23, when they host the Chicago Wolves. The focal point of the jerseys is the team’s classic “Happy Moose” logo, which appears on the front of the jersey recolored in the team’s current color palette. The Moose used a green and purple version of this logo when they were members of the International Hockey League from 1996 to 2001, and then a green and black version from 2001, when they moved to the AHL, until 2005. In 2011, the Winnipeg Jets brought NHL hockey back to the city, meaning the Moose moved to St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador, where they were renamed the St. John’s IceCaps. But in 2015, the team moved back to Winnipeg and the Moose name and logo were revived, but the logo was recolored to match the Jets’ palette. The base of the 25th season celebration jersey is bright blue, with a navy blue collar and shoulder yoke. Navy blue, silver and white stripes run around each sleeve and the waist. The front of the jersey also includes a “25 SEASONS” patch with a map of Manitoba on the left chest. The Jets’ logo appears on the left shoulder, while an “MM” monogram appears on the right shoulder. “EST. 1996” is printed inside the collar. The numbers on the sleeves and back match those found on the Moose’s regular jerseys, with moose antlers built into the numerals. Along with the jerseys, the Moose also launched a line of 25th season merchandise on their online shop Thursday. This line includes hoodies, sweatshirts, caps, pucks and pins. The Moose will wear the 25th season celebration jerseys four times during the 2024-25 AHL regular season. At each of these games, the first 1,000 fans will receive one of four collector pins featuring either one of the team’s primary logos from past 25 years or the team’s 25th season logo.

The PWHL launched new jersey designs for all six of its clubs on Thursday, November 7, all manufactured by Bauer. The league’s press release from the league focused heavily on the dark jerseys that will be worn for home games, but light away jerseys — either white or off-white — were also included in some teams’ social media posts. After teams played the 2024 season using just their geographic names, the PWHL unveiled team names and logos in early September. The teams retained the primary colours they wore during the PWHL’s inaugural season, though some added additional colours. “Players and fans alike have been waiting for this moment and we couldn’t be happier with the six unique looks each team will don moving forward,” said Amy Scheer, PWHL Senior Vice President of Business Operations, on the league’s website. “These jerseys mark the latest evolution in our league’s history, and we can’t wait to see them showcased both on the ice and in the stands.”  Each team will have contrasting shoulder yokes, with the PWHL logo on the right shoulder and space for advertising patches on the left shoulder and right chest. Each team also has an insert at the front of the collar with the PWHL logo inside. Teams will all use the same block number font, but each will have small team-specific icons in the numbers. Each jersey incorporates elements that embody the spirit of the team, all while supporting athletes on the ice with advanced materials and construction. Through a series of design sessions, unique elements such as stripe size, number style, and the crest were meticulously developed to enhance their identities. Crafted from breathable and durable fabrics, these jerseys are engineered to withstand intense physical play and offer a tailored fit for maximum mobility, comfort, and aesthetic appeal. The PWHL worked closely with Creative Agency Flower Shop in creating the jersey designs as part of the overall team brand identity work.  The jersey design process was led by PWHL Vice President of Brand and Marketing Kanan Bhatt-Shah and done in collaboration with New York-based creative agency Flower Shop, which also worked on the team names and logos. Here’s a closer look at the new jerseys and what the league had to say about them in Thursday’s announcement: Anchored by the team’s signature “B” across the chest, the Fleet’s home jersey features a deep green base, complemented by oceanic blue accents on the shoulders, sleeve stripes, and waist. The classic hockey design incorporates alternating bands of color, forming a wave-like pattern that evokes a strong connection to the sea. The numbers on Boston’s jersey carry a unique wave motif inspired by the crest, further reinforcing its maritime heritage.  The Frost’s home jersey embraces the chill with a deep purple base that channels the spirit of Minnesota winters. White accents on the shoulders, arms, and waist add a crisp, icy contrast, capturing the sharpness of the frozen landscape. Light purple details introduce a modern touch, blending seamlessly to create a layered, frosted look that embodies both the intensity and elegance of the Frost on the ice. The jersey numbers feature a motif inspired by the shape of the team’s crest, bringing a distinct edge to the design.  Anchored by the burgundy base, the Victoire’s home jersey reflects Montréal’s timeless elegance and strength. The navy shoulders and dynamic sleeve design draw inspiration from the angular lines of the team’s crest, adding a sense of movement and precision. A bright blue stripe accents the overall design, providing a vivid contrast while maintaining a classic style that honors the heritage of both the city and team. The jersey numbers are adorned with a Fleur-de-lys motif, reinforcing Montréal’s cultural pride.  Inspired by the hexagonal shape of their team crest, the Sirens’ home jersey captures the spirit of New York’s multifaceted energy. Angular sleeve stripes, echoing the crest’s geometric form, combine the city’s signature navy, orange, and grey hues, creating a striking, modern motif. The lower waist reflects the same hexagonal pattern, grounding the design in New York’s intense and dynamic identity. The numbers on New York’s jersey feature linework inspired by sound vibrations, echoing the city’s constant hum and buzz.  The Charge’s home jersey energizes the ice with its vibrant red base, embodying Ottawa’s unyielding drive. Dark and light grey bands run across the sleeves and waist, adding depth and a sense of momentum, while a bold pop of electric yellow pulses through the design. The overall look captures the energy and intensity that defines the Charge’s fierce presence on the ice. Custom numbers on the jersey incorporate small electrical charges, adding a spark to the back of the jersey.  The Sceptres’ home jersey reflects a modern, confident Toronto, with a rich blue base that captures the city’s leadership and pride. Navy paneling along the sleeves and waist brings depth and contrast, while clean, precise yellow lines and a matching collar add sharp, dynamic details. The striking gold and yellow of the team crest stands out, creating a look with bold presence, embodying the energy and spirit of Toronto fans. Custom numbers nod to the Sceptres’ crest design. Last season, the PWHL ran a pilot project during which Molson Breweries paid to place its logo on the upper back of jerseys, allowing nameplates to be placed under the numbers where they wouldn’t be covered by players’ long hair. Based on the photos released with Thursday’s announcement, it appears this pilot project will not continue in the upcoming season. PWHL home jerseys are available to buy now on the league’s official online shop. They’ll be available through Bauer’s website and key retailers starting on Thursday, November 14. The 2024-25 PWHL regular season begins on Saturday, November 30, when the Boston Fleet visit the Toronto Sceptres at the Coca-Cola Coliseum at 2 p.m. ET. Later that same day is an all-Canadian matchup between the Ottawa Charge and the Victoire de Montréal at Place Bell in Laval, Quebec. The defending champion Minnesota Frost open their season on Sunday, December 1, when they host the New York Sirens at the Xcel Energy Center."

The Crows launched the new logo on their website and social media channels on Wednesday, November 6. It depicts the full body of a navy blue swooping crow — a throwback to previous logos in the club’s history and a stark contrast to the most recent iteration of their logo, which only depicted a crow’s head — with a gold outline, red and gold streaks in the wings and a red eye. The angles of the logo are sharper than the previous version, and the color scheme returns to the club’s “original bolder colors,” including a darker shade of navy blue, a “richer” red and a “deeper” gold. The logo is a celebration of the Club being born from the state’s thriving football landscape in 1990, with the wing of the Crow emanating from the actual shape of South Australia. In a further change, the word ‘Adelaide’ now solely sits below the crow and reinforces the connection between the Club, the city and state.  The new Crows logo was developed in partnership with Fuller Brand Communication, a creative agency based in South Australia. The process involved “widespread consultation with members, supporters and focus groups, such as the Member Engagement Panel.” The Crows’ logo was last revamped in 2010. Their first crest upon joining the AFL in 1991 featured a crow with swooping red, yellow and blue lines behind it inside a white shield with a red outline; “ADELAIDE” and “CROWS” were written out above the crow in yellow on a navy background. In 1996, the writing was changed to emphasize the city name. Then, from 1999-2009, the club ditched the shield and used the crow with the swooping lines behind on its own, with the team name in navy underneath. “The logo is one of the Club’s most recognisable features and our supporters take great pride in it, and the throwback to the original swooping Crow reinforces our connection to this city and state by the way it now incorporates the actual shape of South Australia,” said Crows CEO Tim Silvers on the team’s website. “We also wanted to make sure we celebrated our heritage but with a modern look and feel, which we think will resonate with our next generation of supporters. We’ve consulted and listened to a wide range of stakeholders, including and most importantly sections of our supporter base, over the past 18 months.  “Now is the perfect time to make this change as our new headquarters at Thebarton Oval is moving closer and closer to reality, so it really is the start of a new era.”  New guernseys were not unveiled as part of Wednesday’s announcement. But merchandise with the new logo is already available on the Crows’ official website and at the team shop in the Adelaide suburb of West Lakes. The Crows are the first of three teams who were reported to be unveiling new logos this offseason to do so. The other two teams named in an article on the AFL website in August are St. Kilda Football Club and Gold Coast Suns."

Napoli unveiled the new kits on Saturday, November 2, and wore them the following day in a match at home against Atalanta. The predominantly dark grey kit is inspired by Japanese culture and the twinning of Naples and Kagoshima, Japan, which have been sister cities since 1960. The tonal pattern on the kit is a mixture of Japanese and Italian artistic styles. It includes several Samurai objects — including the kabuto (helmet), the menpo (mask) and the katana sword — while melding a Japanese wave motif with a Neopolitan baroque style. Down the right side of the shirt are Japanese characters representing the seven Bushido virtues that are the principles of the Samurai: righteousness, respect, courage, honor, compassion, honesty and loyalty. Despite being so far away from each other, the twinning of the two ports is a symbol of their affinity and the unique characteristics that they share, from the gulfs to the volcanos that dominate the landscape: Vesuvius in Naples and Sakurajima in Kagoshima. The friendship between the two cities has led both of them to dedicate street names to each other: “Napoli-dori” (Naples street) in Kagoshima and “Via Kagoshima” in Naples. The collar, side panels and sleeve cuffs feature black trim, while the Napoli crest and sponsor logos on the chest are light blue. The kit was designed in collaboration with the Ten Shin – Cuore di Cielo Puro Soto Zen Temple in Naples and the Samurai Academy Naples. “The third kit perfectly places itself at the heart of our project ‘From Napoli to the World,’” said Tommaso Bianchini, the club’s chief revenue officer. “Starting in Naples, we arrive at the Japanese city of Kagoshima to tell the story of the relationship between these two distant cultures that are linked by a warrior’s spirit. With this shirt, we celebrate strength, respect and loyalty, which are values that we proudly bring onto the pitch.” Napoli’s next Serie A match is on Sunday, November 10, when they travel to the San Siro to face defending champions Inter Milan."

The wordmark and number font on the off-white uniforms matches the signage seen around the United Center, including gate and seat numbers, while the overall color scheme was based on the exterior of the building, with shades of brown, gray and white.  Details steeped in history.@MotorolaUS | https://t.co/PqhESWUXtq pic.twitter.com/ZyZc75upU7 The design across the shoulders and down the sides of the shorts are supposed to mimic in-arena lights during the Bulls’ starting lineup introductions, while the logo on the waistband pulls inspiration from the windows near the top of the United Center’s walls. The uniforms are complete with the Bulls’ iconic diamond-shaped shorts design and a uniquely shaped logo above the jock tag on the jersey, which pays homage to the original marquee that stood outside of the arena and read “Home of The Bulls.” Chicago will wear its new City Edition uniforms eight times this season, including games against the Memphis Grizzlies on Nov. 23, Boston Celtics n Dec. 21, Milwaukee Bucks on Dec. 28, New York Knicks on Jan. 4, Philadelphia 76ers on Jan. 25, Golden State Warriors on Feb. 8, Phoenix Suns on Feb. 22 and Dallas Mavericks on March 29. The Bulls’ 2023-24 City Edition uniforms, meanwhile, were inspired by the old Chicago Stadium, which stood on the Near West Side for nearly 60 years before it was replaced by the United Center in 1994 and was affectionally referred to as the “Madhouse on Madison.”"

The club officially announced today that they are now known simply as Athletics. The new location-less name will stick for as long as the team plays in Sacramento, which looks like it will be for the next three seasons before they move to Las Vegas, where *I assume* they’ll be known as the Las Vegas Athletics. Once they take the field, this will be the first time in North America’s “Big Four” major sports leagues that a team has officially played a game without a location name in 80 years. The closest we saw to this in recent times was when the Anaheim Angels became the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and spent the next decade referring to themselves only as the Angels in just about everything aside from their preferred abbreviation, “LAA.” There’s really no obvious reason for the Athletics to go this route. The team already owns the trademarks for both Sacramento Athletics and Sacramento A’s. They could’ve proceeded just as the Angels did previously and reserved the use of Sacramento for standings and scoreboards while sticking to “Athletics” on their uniforms and all official releases. Along with the official name change came the official primary logo the Athletics will use while playing in Sacramento. There’s no surprise here; they’ll use just the “A’s” portion of Oakland’s logo, removing the green circle and the team name. Club officials had previously revealed the team’s uniforms would remain largely the same when they shifted to Sacramento, with all the “Oakland” logos replaced with “Athletics.” This would mean changes only to their road greys and Kelly green alternate jerseys. According to a post from @EvanDrellich on Twitter, the Athletics request the following: The club should be referred to only as “Athletics,” with the shorthand “A’s” allowed only after they’ve already been called Athletics. The team abbreviation will now be “ATH,” so you’ll see this on the TV scoreboards instead of “OAK” going forward. The A’s also do *not* play in Sacramento (my bad); they play in *West* Sacramento (maybe this is why they didn’t go with Sacramento Athletics?). They also mentioned the change, as I discussed earlier, to their primary logo. The name change has already been reflected in the club’s online presence.

SportsLogos.Net News,Women’s Pro Baseball League Set to Launch in Summer 2026,https://news.sportslogos.net/2024/11/04/womens-pro-baseball-league-set-to-launch-in-summer-2026/baseball/,"Mon, 04 Nov 2024 18:27:06 +0000",League co-founded by Justine Siegal — first woman to coach a pro men's team and to throw batting practice in MLB — aims to ride wave of women's sports by throwing out first pitch in summer 2026 with six teams primarily in northeast United States,"The recent surge in women’s professional sports leagues is set to continue with the announcement of a baseball league taking the field in the summer of 2026. The Women’s Pro Baseball League (WPBL) announced last week that they are aiming to throw out their first pitch in less than two years’ time. The league is co-founded by Justine Siegal, also the founder of Baseball for All and the first woman to coach a professional men’s baseball team and to pitch batting practice against a Major League Baseball team. The logo on the league’s website depicts the letters in “WPBL” connected to each other, set in white on a black background. A baseball is depicted to the left of the W, aligned with the bottom of the letters. The league name is spelled to the right. The WPBL is also using a secondary logo as their social media profile picture. This logo consists of the W from the league logo, along with the baseball. Unlike the website, though, the background on this logo is navy blue. The WPBL will re-write history by creating an elite league that provides the world’s best female players with the platform they deserve and serve as a catalyst for the creation of a women’s baseball culture in America. “I am so excited that there will finally be a professional women’s baseball league – it is a dream come true for all the girls and women who play America’s Pastime,” Siegal said in a press release. “The Women’s Pro Baseball League is here for all the girls and women who dream of a place to showcase their talents and play the game they love. We have been waiting over 70 years for a professional baseball league we can call our own. Our time is now.” The WPBL’s other co-founder is Keith Stein, a Toronto-based lawyer and businessman who also serves as CEO of the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Intercounty Baseball League. IBL players are college players and former professionals, and all nine teams are based in Southern Ontario. “We believe that the success of other women’s professional leagues such as the WNBA and NWSL demonstrates the incredible interest and support for women’s sport,” Stein said. Legendary Japanese pitcher Ayami Sato has joined the league as a special advisor, as has former Toronto Blue Jays manager Cito Gaston. The WPBL said in its press release that it will launch in summer 2026 with six teams based largely in the northeastern United States. Team names and logos were not included in last week’s announcement. The league also hopes to have a national broadcasting deal in place by the time the first pitch is thrown. More details about the league — including information for prospective team owners and players — is available on the WPBL website.  No related stories."

Numbers to know for Week 9📰: https://t.co/BortIHSW58 pic.twitter.com/uDrzHXhIUF That includes the New York Giants breaking out their 1980-99 throwback uniforms for Sunday’s game against the Washington Commanders, marking the third straight year they’ll make an appearance against their NFC East rival. The uniforms feature a navy blue helmet with an underlined and italicized “Giants” wordmark on both sides, a royal blue jersey with a classic striping pattern on the collar and cuffs and white pants with red and blue stripes.  New York is 3-0-1 in the throwback uniforms since they debuted two years ago, including victories over the Chicago Bears in 2022 and the Commanders and Green Bay Packers in 2023. They also tied with Washington in 2022. TURN US UP. It's Kelly Green Week! pic.twitter.com/7y0wDacGX6 Elsewhere in the division, the Philadelphia Eagles will wear their Kelly green throwback uniforms on Sunday afternoon against the Jacksonville Jaguars, marking their third straight appearance against an AFC opponent.  The uniforms replicate the Randall Cunningham and Reggie White era, with Kelly green helmets and Kelly green jerseys featuring white block numbers outlined in black and the Eagles’ 1987-95 alternate logo on the sleeves. Philadelphia went 2-0 in the throwback uniforms after unveiling them prior to last season, including wins over the Miami Dolphins and Buffalo Bills. They’ll also be worn later this season against the Dallas Cowboys on Dec. 29.  A classic look for a classic matchup#DETvsGB pic.twitter.com/NdhHY37ayw Keeping with the theme, the Green Bay Packers will wear their 1950s throwback uniforms during Sunday’s game against the Detroit Lions, marking their first appearance against an NFC North divisional opponent. The uniforms are reminiscent of what the Packers wore from 1950-53, with green jerseys featuring gold numbers and two gold stripes on the sleeves, green pants with a single gold stripe down the sides and green socks with stripes that match the sleeves.  The Packers are 2-1 in the throwback threads since they were unveiled, including wins over the Washington Football Team in 2021 and Los Angeles Chargers last season. Their lone loss came at the hands of the New York Jets in 2022. Taking advantage of the opportunity.MNF 🔜 pic.twitter.com/XsxlPSgHRm The weekend will end with visual rematch of Super Bowl LV, with the Kansas City Chiefs wearing their standard home uniforms when they host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers – who will wear their road white jerseys and pewter pants – on Monday Night Football. Interestingly, the Buccaneers were considered the home team in that matchup, which they won 31-9, but chose to wear their white jerseys in the Super Bowl after having success in that combination throughout the 2020-21 playoffs."

The Quebec Maritime Junior Hockey League team based in the provincial capital held a special “Les Boys” night on Friday, November 1, paying tribute to the 1997 comedy film that remains one of the most successful Quebecois movies ever. The Remparts’ jerseys for the game against the Sherbrooke Phoenix closely mirrored those worn by Les Boys, the team at the heart of the movie. The base of the jersey was yellow, with red shoulders and red, black and white stripes on the sleeves and waist. The front of the jersey featured a black puck with red streaks behind it and “Les REMPS” written overtop, taking cues from the logo used on the movie’s poster. Nos joueurs ADORENT le chandail des Remps…et on les comprend!Billets de c̷i̷n̷é̷m̷a̷ hockey » https://t.co/801IAPzOYP pic.twitter.com/1DaKuyCNEF The Remparts’ usual primary logo appeared on both shoulders. The names and numbers were red with yellow and black outlines. “LES REMPARTS DE QUÉBEC” was spelled out in black between the waist stripes to mimic where the name of the team’s sponsor appeared in the movie. The jerseys were paired with black helmets, pants and gloves. The socks were yellow with the same black, red and white striping pattern found on the sleeves. “Les Boys” was released in 1997 and directed by Louis Saïa. It follows a low-level amateur hockey team made up of a ragtag group of players, including a mechanic, a police officer, a doctor and a lawyer. In order to settle a gambling debt, the owner of the pub that sponsors the team puts up against a team assembled by a local crime boss. If Les Boys win, the debt is erased; if the mobster’s team wins, though, he gets the pub. “Les Boys” earned $3.3 million at the box office in Quebec, which, given the small market size, was considered a big success. It earned a total of $6 million at the box office across Canada and another $4 million in the United States. It also spawned three sequels — one of which featured appearances by several French-Canadian members of the Canadian Olympic women’s hockey team — one prequel and a television show that lasted five seasons."

The Final Generation O Combo: Warp Speed.#GoDucks pic.twitter.com/CZZLb9vY8E The “Warp Speed” set is effectively the road version of the Ducks’ all-black “Fly Era” uniforms, which combine various elements from their previous uniform designs and debuted in their 32-31 win over Ohio State on Oct. 12.  That includes the wing pattern with a carbon fiber infill on the shoulders of the white jerseys, the diamond plate pattern that fits into the V-shaped seam of Nike’s Vapor F.U.S.E. template and the iridescent numbers, along other smaller details. The diamond plate pattern, specifically, was pulled from Oregon’s 2005-08 uniforms, and the decision to debut them in Ann Arbor isn’t a coincidence, either, as the Ducks notably beat the Wolverines, 39-7, in 2007. While our sources previously indicated the Ducks would wear dark green helmets on Saturday, just like they did in 2007, we’ve been told their equipment staff decided to switch up some combinations based on our reporting. Blinding speed. The story behind the threads.#GoDucks pic.twitter.com/tgecpLlqcO That’s why Oregon’s new “Warp Speed” uniforms are now complete with silver chrome helmets that feature silver wings and a green “O” on the back, creating a combination that was most recently worn in last season’s 38-30 win at Texas Tech. Interestingly, this won’t be the first time the Ducks wear the white pants from their “Warp Speed” set this season, as they also appeared in their 37-34 win over Boise State on Sept. 7 and 35-0 win at Purdue on Oct. 18. The other iiterations of Oregon’s new “Generation O” uniforms include the aforementioned “Fly Era” set, the “Gang Green” and “Mighty Oregon” throwback-inspired designs and their yellow and black “Heroes” uniforms, which are dedicated to those who have battled cancer."

Yeah, well, she just had this to say:  This is not isolated, this is a colossal event of avoidance. Not just in Florida, but you will find avoidance in the Carolinas. Senior leadership will lie to you and say that they do not know, but if you ask the DSA crew leads and specialists what they are experiencing in the field, they will tell you.  Marn'i said withholding [checks notes] federal assistance from the majority of her countrymen in Florida was justified because [checks notes again] those people who vote differently than her would have been hostile (she just knows this in her soul). Do you think she's telling the truth about the widespread avoidance of Trump supporters, or is she just trying to deflect heat? And if her allegations are true and critical aid was withheld from destroyed communities in states like North Carolina, where over a hundred people are dead, was the withholding of such aid responsible for any of these deaths??

(The following video is from 2016, but it works here so I'm leaving it.)  Multiple outlets have begun reporting that Trump is making his picks, starting with Florida Senator Marco Rubio as Secretary of State. President-elect Trump is expected to nominate Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida as Secretary of State, a source familiar tells Fox News.The source noted that while Trump could still change his mind at the last minute, as of now he's planning on offering the job to Rubio, the three-term senator whom the former president considered as his running mate this summer before naming Sen. JD Vance as the GOP vice presidential nominee ...Rubio, who sits on both the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee, has taken similar positions to Trump on international conflicts, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Israel's war with Hamas.In April, the 53-year-old senator voted against the $95 billion in U.S. aid to Ukraine and has urged the eastern European nation to negotiate an end to its war with Russia.

In April, the 53-year-old senator voted against the $95 billion in U.S. aid to Ukraine and has urged the eastern European nation to negotiate an end to its war with Russia. Yes, it seems like Rubio has begun aligning himself with the Trump agenda when it comes to foreign conflicts, and he appears to be on the fast track to the Secretary of State position. The other reported pick is a bit more out of left field: South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as the Director of Homeland Security.  Noem would replace the utterly awful Alejandro Mayorkas in overseeing Customs and Border Patrol, FEMA, ICE, and the Secret Service. And if there is anyone who is going to run their department as a Trump loyalist who will fight for the President's agenda, you can expect Noem to do so. Other key positions reportedly filled by the President-elect include: Chief of Staff: Susie Wiles, Trump's 2024 campaign manager. National Security Adviser: Mike Waltz, 3-term Florida Congressman, National Guard veteran, and former Pentagon policy adviser. Border Czar: Tom Homan.  (Enough said.) United Nations Ambassador: Elise Stefanik, Congresswoman, New York. MAGA Republican. Third-ranking member of Congress after replacing Liz Cheney as House Republican Conference Chair. Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy: Stephen Miller. Yes, that Stephen Miller. The man behind Trump's immigration agenda since 2015. Environmental Protection Agency: Lee Zeldin, Congressman, New York. MAGA Republican. A mix of insiders and outsiders, but, so far, there's no doubt that all of these folks are Trump picks and Trump loyalists, which appears to be his primary motivation for selecting his cabinet.

The GOP really did a number this year, my friends: Republicans saved some of their most vulnerable incumbents, like Reps. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) and David Valadao (R-Calif.), while defeating several vulnerable Democratic incumbents. State Rep. Ryan Mackenzie (R-Pa.) unseated Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.), while businessman Rob Bresnahan defeated Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-Pa.). With control of the White House, both chambers of Congress, and a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court (and potential chances to expand that number in the next 4 years), the MAGA platform has a very rare window of opportunity to enact its reforms.

Domski worked for Blue Cross Blue Shield in the state for 30 years, and was 100% remote during the pandemic (as well as 75% remote previously) while working as an IT specialist. Despite requesting a religious exemption for the Covid vax, Blue Cross refused, triggering a lawsuit from Domski, who claimed she was a victim of religious discrimination. Her attorney, Jon Marko, said this in a statement: Our forefathers fought and died for the freedom for each American to practice his or her own religion. Neither the government nor a corporation has a right to force an individual to choose between his or her career and conscience. Lisa refused to renounce her faith and beliefs and was wrongfully terminated from the only job she had ever known. The jury's verdict today tells BCBSM that religious discrimination has no place in America and affirms each person's right to religious freedom.  The jury awarded Domski $10 million in punitive damages, $1.7 million in lost wages, and $1 million in noneconomic damages. Meanwhile, Blue Cross is super sad that their corporate HR tyranny got slapped down: While Blue Cross respects the jury process and thanks the individual jurors for their service, we are disappointed in the verdict. Blue Cross is reviewing its legal options and will determine its path forward in the coming days.  Follow Ian on Substack or X (@ighaworth).

The veteran anchor says he feels ""liberated"" having a break from the media, telling CNN, ""This is the first time in 55 years I've been between jobs."" Not only is he leaving CNN, the fakest of the fake news, but he seems to be done with old media as a whole.

I'm just saying it's weird that the Wisconsin Republican candidate for Senate was winning until the trajectory totally changed in a huge ballot dump that favored the Democrat.     Oh, this happened at the exact same time that Wisconsin was recounting 31,000 absentee votes in Milwaukee after officials ""were made aware that doors covering on-off switches on some of the machines used to tally those votes had not been properly closed."" This was from our internal staff chat on Election Day.  There are a number of additional factors that make this as fishy as two-day-old gas station sushi:  Shylock says that this ""16% swing to the Democrats"" put the race ""in the 91.7th percentile of vote updates that most favored the Democrats."" One or two of these factors being combined could have innocent explanations, but as Mr. Shylock goes into in-depth (go read the whole thing if you are a statistics person), the combo of all these factors is very suspicious. And as with most of these ""anomalies"" in races across the country, it favored the Democrat candidate:  And as always, the saying ""nothing good ever happens after midnight"" is usually true.  There's also the issue of more people voting in Milwaukee than there are registered voters...  Maybe there's a good explanation for this. As such, I'm not claiming that there was anything illegal that happened in this scenario. But wouldn't it be nice if Wisconsin had a professional class of college-trained investigators who knew how to objectively ferret out the truth by interviewing statisticians, election officials, and other inside sources? They might even be able to get their hands on additional data that would allow them to inform the public whether there is merit in the claim of election interference. That way, we wouldn't be suspicious of everything all the time.

Not everyone can afford to go buy an extra house in Portugal like some British expats can. But, there are other options for the slightly less affluent. For example, Villa Vie Residences announced that they will be launching a four-year cruise for those looking to flee the country because of Trump, and they are calling it the ""Skip Forward"" cruise.  Here's the pitch from Villa Vie Residences: 'Residents have the flexibility to join their customized journey at any port during the continuous global adventure for up to 4 years,' Villa Vie Residences said in a press release. The cruise is 100% all-inclusive. 'Pay once and never worry about it again,' the site reads. 'The moment you step on board, your journey begins. Leave behind the familiar and embrace the unknown as you navigate the world's most iconic and inspiring locations.' The ship resembles the Pacific Princess from the Love Boat series.  One might think, surely, there must be a catch. Well of course there is: three in fact. First off, there's the cost. The four-year cruise costs $159,999 per person for a double room or $255,999 for a single-occupancy cabin. Even in our high-inflation era, that's roughly the price of a house in some parts of the country, which you can live in forever, not just four years. Secondly, the cruise line is somewhat notorious for stiffing people. Last year, the maiden voyage, which was sold as a three-years-at-sea adventure to retirees, was called off two weeks before departure, leaving some of the passengers homeless. It turned out that they hadn't even procured a ship for the voyage yet. The company promised a full refund but had to make it in monthly installments to the passengers. And finally, while it does appear that the company has a ship now, I think the biggest catch would be the real deal breaker for me. Even if I had the money and was willing to risk doing business with a company with a less than stellar reputation, imagine what socializing with people who equate Trump to Hitler would be like all day, everyday, with no way to escape for four years.

Jon Keith Miller, 84, was arrested Thursday after he ‘confirmed his involvement' in the vicious stabbing of Mary Schlais, whose body was found at a Spring Brook intersection in February 1974. Schlais had been hitchhiking to Chicago at the time of her murder; the only evidence obtained from the scene was ""a stocking cap found near her body, from which a few hairs were pulled."" Recently, however, the Dunn County Sheriff's Office ""teamed up with the genetic genealogy department at Ramapo College in New Jersey"" to try and obtain information from the evidence. Genetic genealogy - which uses genetic material to establish family trees from which both victims and perpetrators can be identified - has been used in solving numerous long-dormant criminal mysteries in recent years:   In this latest case, genetic testing led police to Jon Keith Miller's daughter (don't surrender your DNA to any of those ancestry services if your relatives are murderers 😅), and eventually to Miller himself: When police interviewed Miller, who now lives in Minnesota, on Thursday, he initially denied knowing anything about the murder - but once presented with the DNA evidence he fessed up. The suspect said he picked Schlais up and propositioned her; after she refused he stabbed her to death. He tried to bury her body in a snowbank, but he was spooked by a passing car and left his hat behind. Police said the old man was likely ready to confess: ‘I believe it's got to even be a relief for him after 50 years of living with this. It's had to have been on his mind almost every day,' Dunn County Sheriff Kevin Bygd told reporters Friday, according to CNN.‘You would think anybody with a conscience, it would. So, I think he was done fighting it, personally.' ‘You would think anybody with a conscience, it would. So, I think he was done fighting it, personally.' The sheriff called the arrest ""a huge victory for our agency.""

The aircraft, which left from Fort Lauderdale, was diverted to an airport in the Dominican Republic where it landed safely, sources told the Miami Herald. At least one person, a flight attendant, was grazed by a bullet, a source said. Imagine being that flight attendant!  The incident forced the airport authority at Toussaint Louverture International Airport in Haiti's capital to ground all commercial flights.

Fortunately for the broken-up couple, Mitchell would experience a concussion the next day after crash-landing on the ski slopes at Beaver Mountain, Utah, and forget the breakup ever happened.  After paramedics treated him, and learning he was unable to drive, Mitchell contacted Jenna for a ride home. She had no idea why he would do such a thing, since she'd broken up with him the day before. I'm like, ‘Why is he messaging me this? I just broke up with him.' The couple had committed to remaining friends, but when Mitchell continued to contact her and treat her nicely she got a little confused. At one point, Mitchell even brought Jenna and her roommates cupcakes because they were having a bad day.  That's when Jenna started to have second thoughts about the breakup. And then this happened: In March 2020, after returning from a spring break trip, Jenna planned on getting back together with Mitchell. After he texted her to hang out, she was ready to have the conversation. ‘I was nervous to swallow my pride and ask if he would date again,' Jenna admitted. That evening, she asked Mitchell if he'd want to start dating again. ‘That was when I realized he had no clue we even broke up,' Jenna revealed.To jog his memory, she explained how the conversation went down. ‘I told him about how we were in my car and what I said to him and what he said back,' she said. ‘He told me he didn't remember any of that except for chatting in the car, but he didn't remember what we chatted about. He thought it was super funny, and I was relieved. It made it easy to get back together because to him, we never weren't together!' To jog his memory, she explained how the conversation went down. ‘I told him about how we were in my car and what I said to him and what he said back,' she said. ‘He told me he didn't remember any of that except for chatting in the car, but he didn't remember what we chatted about. He thought it was super funny, and I was relieved. It made it easy to get back together because to him, we never weren't together!'  I can just imagine Mitchell's speech ""Jenna tried to break up with me, but I made a commitment to smacking my head on the ski hill the next day so I wouldn't remember the breakup. It was the best decision I've ever made.""  [Faints and hits his head on the table, concussing himself again and forgetting the wedding altogether.] I checked Jenna's TikTok, and it looks like the couple now has one child, a boy, with another on the way. (Or if you secretly want to get back together with him, do the opposite!)

But this year, thanks to the Biden FDA, there are going to be a lot of disappointed families because Costco was just forced to recall 79,200 pounds of Kirkland Signature butter off of the shelves due to an undeclared allergen.  The undeclared allergen?      The ingredients do list cream, though, so maybe the FDA isn't sure that people know cream comes from milk? Then the cream gets churned, and then you get butter.

Dr. Javad A. Sajan, a plastic surgeon out of Seattle, seems to be in a hurry to do ""all my trans surgeries before Trump tries to stop me."" Watch:   I looked at this guy's TikTok, and he does, in fact, do transgender surgeries. In fact, he's proud of it. Here's all the trans operations he performs:  And now he's apparently rushing to get a bunch of them done before Trump takes the freedom to mutilate children off the table. I wonder how much he'll make on these surgeries profiting off of the mental illnesses of others. Also, this is the same guy who recently had to pay $5 million for illegally manipulating consumer ratings. Allure Esthetic and Dr. Javad Sajan must pay $5 million as a result of Attorney General Bob Ferguson's consumer protection lawsuit. Allure and Sajan threatened patients with illegal non-disclosure agreements and falsified online reviews to inflate the plastic surgeon's reputation. He needs those millions back, folks, and the only answer is to do those transgender surgeries, which are likely in high demand after last Tuesday. Hate to see this guy scrambling to get these disgusting surgeries done before they become illegal (hopefully), but I'm glad we've got a president coming into office who's making these cons shake in their boots.

Lady, if you're a liberal, don't you preach about ""tolerance"" and ""inclusion""? Your sons are merely expressing their own unique self-identity, don't ya know! They identify as Trump supporters. What are you, a bigot who won't let them express their true selves?? Or would you only support them if they, say, decided to identify as women?  It amazes me that affluent white female liberals (AWFLs) will celebrate their sons' decision to sterilize themselves forever and end their family tree, but if they vote for a politician that they don't like just one time, they'll disown them in front of the whole world.   Don't assume that voting for a different candidate makes your kids either idiots or Nazis. Feel free to politely note your disappointment, but continue loving them. Tell them to use their brains to see whether their choice led to positive outcomes for the nation/world. It pains me to see how people have been brainwashed to think the celebrity real estate developer who appeared in movies and Pizza Hut ads for decades (and already served 4 years as president) is actually Hitler/Satan.

But today, curiously, Skynet-1A is actually half a planet away, in a position 22,369 miles (36,000km) above the Americas. Now, if you're like me, that might not sound so odd. I mean, it's a satellite in space, right? So it just sort of ... drifts, right? Like a boat.  Not quite! It turns out that ""orbital mechanics mean it's unlikely the half-tonne military spacecraft simply drifted to its current location."" Almost certainly, it was commanded to fire its thrusters in the mid-1970s to take it westwards. The question is who that was and with what authority and purpose?  There is the possibility that the United States may have had something to do with the shift. The craft was manufactured in the U.S., while American specialists tested its software before handing over control to England at the RAF Oakhanger facility. There were apparently regular instances of the satellite being controlled on U.S. soil: A Skynet team from Oakhanger would go to the USAF satellite facility in Sunnyvale [California] (colloquially known as the Blue Cube) and operate Skynet during 'Oakout'. This was when control was temporarily transferred to the US while Oakhanger was down for essential maintenance. Perhaps the move could have happened then? Now, ultimately it might not seem all that relevant. There are, after all, more than 11,000 satellites zipping above the planet. What difference does it make if one of them is over Mozambique or the East Pacific Rise? Well, apparently it matters quite a bit: [Skynet is] now in what we call a 'gravity well' at 105 degrees West longitude, wandering backwards and forwards like a marble at the bottom of a bowl. And unfortunately this brings it close to other satellite traffic on a regular basis.Because it's dead, the risk is it might bump into something, and because it's 'our' satellite we're still responsible for it...

A 45-year-old Wisconsin father named Ryan Borgwardt reportedly went missing back in August while kayaking in Green Lake County, Wisconsin. Turns out he faked his disappearance and is now possibly in Europe.  Locals spent 54 DAYS searching for Borgwardt, including Keith Cormican, who runs a nonprofit called Bruce's Legacy that conducts water searches. Meanwhile, local authorities tapped the feds, who discovered that Bogwardt had left the country and had taken steps to cover his tracks: In October, [Green Lake County Sheriff Mark] Podoll said he found out law enforcement in Canada ran Borgwardt's passport Aug. 13, the day after he disappeared.‘Wow. Yeah. That was something we didn't expect,' Podoll said. ‘Wow. Yeah. That was something we didn't expect,' Podoll said. Police had found Borgwardt's kayak and life vest on the lake, with his fishing gear abandoned nearby. Authorities now believe he may have fled the country to be with a woman he met on the internet. An investigation found Borgwardt had a second passport, replaced a hard drive on his laptop, cleared browsers on the day of his disappearance, had inquiries about moving funds to foreign banks, purchased airline gift cards, took out a $375,000 life insurance policy, and was communicating with a woman in Uzbekistan, according to the GreenLake County Sheriff's Office. THE HECK! A bunch of people spent 54 days looking for this guy's body in a lake and he's off traveling the world? 'It's a little tough to swallow because it required a lot of expenses on this one,' said Cormican. Meanwhile, the Borgwardt family is devastated. ‘I cannot imagine what [his wife is] going through, and they're going through; it's really hard, because one, they felt that the dad was drowned a day ago. They found out that he wasn't,' said Sheriff Podoll. Imagine thinking your husband, or your dad, had drowned in a Wisconsin lake and then finding out later that he'd abandoned you to fly across the world for some online thot.  Police are trying to make contact with Borgwardt, and they plan to sue him for wasting county resources once they get ahold of him.

Of course the only way that could happen is if one of the three lefty judges retires. And since Justice Sotomayor is the oldest, and she has type-one diabetes, she's the one they want to throw under the bus. And after Sotomayor gets out of the way, Harris can be appointed.    Not all the lefties are on board with this, mind you. Bernie Sanders, for example, thinks it's a crazy idea:  And of course, the big push is for Biden to resign and make Harris the first female president.  And get this, the Democrats could be accused of ""ableism"" here because the main reason they want Sotomayor off the court is because of that type-one diabetes, which makes her a health risk going into a four-year term where Trump would be nominating judges.  Maria Town, president of the nonpartisan American Association of People with Disabilities, in April called the concerns 'ableism, pure and simple.'Mia Ives-Rublee, director for the Disability Justice Initiative at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, also spoke out against calls for Sotomayor to step down earlier this year.'I trust that, like all disabled people, she knows best about her body.

The incident happened on Monday when the elderly snowflake approached a group of Trump supporters who'd gathered at an intersection to promote the president. The 82-year-old suspect, who was not publicly identified by police, was accused of pushing and punching a 55-year-old female and a 66-year-old female after getting into a verbal altercation, the Edmonds Police Department said in a release. There's no footage of the fight, but there is bodycam footage of her confessing her crime to police.  Sadly, that's the mindset of many liberals, at least up until they got beat in a landslide. Violence is okay because these people are Nazis. I approached her and I said, 'I want to know why you're voting for Trump.' That's the only reason I wanted to know, that's the only thing. And I said 'because you're brown-skinned.'...I was a teacher, I hate the racism in this country, I hate how people are treated. And so I'm wondering why would someone with brown skin support this man, and that was my question. And she immediately started screaming, 'racist,' and came in with her face right up to me, just screaming at the top of her voice.And my response was to push her away and I put my hand to her chin and I pushed her shoulder. ...I was a teacher, I hate the racism in this country, I hate how people are treated.

And the cop says, ""If that's your stance, how does it look that you're placing hands onto someone else with different views?"" Her response: ""It's anger."" As for the victims: During a subsequent investigation into the altercation, the 55-year-old woman told officers that the elderly woman had ""gotten into her face,"" commented on her clothes and skin color, and then pushed her and punched her on the chin.A second victim, a 66-year-old Edmonds woman, said when she saw what was happening, she intervened.

According to The Washington Post, the company was a minor focal point in the New York criminal case of Donald Trump, since it was the same company that sponsored a celebrity golf tournament where he met Stormy Daniels, who was there to promote the studio. What a time to be alive. Anyway, given last year's lackluster toy sales, it's possible this pre-Christmas hit is going to be devastating for Mattel.

	Barrett did a literal double-take and couldn't stop from blurting out ""Game of Thrones!""","There is no team that has more celebrities attend their games than the Lakers (the Knicks being a close second), as the courtside seats at L.A. games often go a few rows deep with stars from the world of entertainment. There are the regulars like Jack Nicholson and Denzel Washington, but on any given night you might find an actor from your favorite TV show or movie watching the Lakers play.  That happened to Toronto wing RJ Barrett on Sunday night as the Raptors made their annual trek to Los Angeles. After finishing through contact for an and-1, Barrett turned to the crowd in the corner to celebrate only to find himself face-to-face with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, best known for playing Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones. Barrett realized this mid-celebration and did a literal double take, turned back to Coster-Waldau, pointed, and blurted out “Game of Thrones!” at him before turning around and walking to the free throw line.   A post shared by Dime (@dimemagazine)  It’s a very funny thing to happen in the middle of an NBA game, but also, that’s exactly how I would react if I turned around and was suddenly face-to-face with the guy that played Jaime Lannister.

	We caught up with Liv Morgan after she made history as the first Women's Crown Jewel Champion.","Before kicking off the Liv Morgan World Tour, and before becoming the first Women’s Crown Jewel Champion, the current Women’s World Champion sat at home nursing a dislocated shoulder. As Liv Morgan recovered for six months throughout 2023, she says she had a moment of clarity.  Over the first decade of her career, she’d allowed her ring work to speak for itself. During her time away, Morgan took a step back and felt like she had lacked a true voice or character. As she plotted her return to the ring, she created the Liv Morgan Revenge Tour built around the realities of her injury, while envisioning a path back to the top of the WWE mountain.  “The Liv Morgan Revenge Tour,” Morgan tells Uproxx Sports, “gave me such a purpose.” Some of the best stories in professional wrestling have been at least somewhat based in reality, and the way Morgan was injured gave her a motive, direction, and something so personal and true, that it allowed her for the first time in her career to really sink her teeth into a story. “Rhea (Ripley) really did dislocate my shoulder,” Morgan says. “I really sat home for six months watching her ascend to the top of the division. And so it was all really personal to me, and I used all that to come back and do exactly to her what she did to me. But I did that and more.” While she’s navigated trying to find her character throughout a decade in WWE, elements of who Morgan is as a person have helped her continue to chip away at this dream. Her drive, passion, wanting to learn as much as she can, and desire to give herself an opportunity to see what she could achieve has brought her this far.  “(My time away) just gave me the time and space that I needed to really settle into my own, which brought out the best version of Liv Morgan than we’ve seen thus far,” Morgan says.  The last seven months have been a whirlwind for Morgan. She kicked off the Raw after WrestleMania 40 with a beatdown of Ripley that would alter the trajectory of her career. A legitimate shoulder injury suffered in the melee forced Ripley to relinquish the title and led to Morgan beating Becky Lynch for the belt. That win kickstarted the pivotal run of her career, with new twists and turns added by the month.  “I like to believe that everything happens for a reason. Even if you don’t know the reason, I know that’s so cliche, but I really live my life by that. And so even when things happen that I feel are bizarre or even unfortunate things, I always tend to think that on the other side of it, it is going to be for a greater purpose,” Morgan says.  “There’s so much beauty in the madness and it’s cool to be able to pivot and adjust when things aren’t going the way we anticipated it, because we took something that was supposed to be great and we made it even greater. And so I just think that the stars are aligned and everything is happening exactly as it should.” Morgan has embraced the “crazy, messy love triangle” that’s followed her dynamic with Dominic Mysterio and Ripley, “whether they love to hate us or hate to love us.” Mysterio switched allegiances, Morgan joined the Judgement Day while Ripley was ousted, Raquel Rodriguez returned to join her side, and Ripley recently suffered another injury that will sideline her for the foreseeable future. Paired alongside Mysterio and thus far able to hold off Ripley, Morgan isn’t just matching the status quo for a world champion — she’s literally doing things that haven’t been done before.  The latest in her evolution from charting a Revenge Tour to creating a Liv Morgan World Tour came with a championship-worthy diamond ring, after claiming the first-ever Women’s Crown Jewel Championship in a win over Nia Jax last week.  “It means so much to me on so many different levels,” Morgan continues. “We’ve made history in Saudi Arabia. We had the very first women’s title match for the Women’s Crown Jewel Championship. And that is so much progress. I feel like since I’ve started in WWE, all I’ve wanted to do is really carve my own path and see how great I could become. And the fact that I’ve made history and the first and only Women’s Crown Jewel Champion, I am just so proud and so honored. And I just hope that I do it justice.” The opportunities are endless for where Morgan goes from here. She’s open to the idea of a second Evolution all-women’s wrestling show, with a loaded roster across Raw, Smackdown, and NXT.  “I don’t think we need our own show to be more prestigious,” Morgan says. “I think we are prestigious and I think people tune in specifically for the women’s segments and for women’s wrestling. But to give the fans what they want is why I would love to have another all women’s show in Evolution part 2.” A WrestleMania main event is something that’s eluded Morgan across her career, but calls it the pinnacle of wrestling in WWE and is without a doubt an accomplishment she’d love to check off her bucket list. “You can’t get any bigger, higher, better, more prestigious than main eventing WrestleMania,” Morgan says. “I spend a lot of my life dreaming and hoping and wishing. And I’ve been fortunate and lucky and blessed enough to have a lot of those things come true. So yes, main eventing WrestleMania is definitely on my list. With whom, I don’t know what that looks like or what it is but I hope that we can find out together.” Morgan can accomplish just about anything because at this very moment she genuinely has the faith and belief that she can. As she continues to build upon her second world title run, the Liv Morgan we see onscreen every week couldn’t be any more different than the one that was Smackdown Champion two years ago.  “It’s just a different Liv Morgan. The Liv Morgan that won the SmackDown Championship from Ronda Rousey, that girl she was just happy to be there. She maybe didn’t even see herself or believe in herself as a champion yet. She was a girl with just a pipe dream, cash in her briefcase at the right moment in the right time,” Morgan says. “This Liv Morgan is the most confident version of herself so far. This Liv Morgan knows her worth. This Liv Morgan knows she’s the greatest women’s champion of all time. This Liv Morgan knows she’s untouchable. This Liv Morgan knows she has the most dominant faction in all of WWE by her side. That’s the difference.”"

	Holmgren fell hard on his right hip after contesting a shot and had to be helped off the floor without putting weight on his right leg.","The Oklahoma City Thunder entered Sunday tied with the Suns for the top spot in the Western Conference, and figured to face a stiff test with the red-hot Golden State Warriors in town. OKC got off to a strong start, taking a 33-26 lead after the first quarter, but there was some considerable concern about their star big man as Chet Holmgren had to be helped off the floor and into the locker room after landing hard on his right hip after contesting an Andrew Wiggins layup attempt at the rim (watch here).  Holmgren slams down onto the hardwood and immediately grabbed at his right hip in pain. He was ultimately helped off the floor and into the tunnel without putting any weight on his right leg by a pair of Thunder staffers. Holmgren has gotten off to a tremendous start to his sophomore campaign, averaging 18.2 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 2.9 blocks per game coming into Sunday’s contest, asserting himself as a serious threat for DPOY with his work protecting the rim for the league’s best defense so far.  The Thunder will hope Holmgren’s injury was just a painful fall and not something more serious that could lead to an extended absence, as they are already incredibly thin at the center position with Isaiah Hartenstein still out with a fractured hand.  UPDATE: Holmgren was ruled out for the game with what the Thunder officially called a right hip injury. Shams Charania reported later Monday night that Holmgren would miss 8-10 weeks with a hip fracture."

	Giannis played a little prank on Jaylen Brown after catching him with an elbow, but the Celtics star wasn't a big fan of Giannis' antics.","The Milwaukee Bucks and Boston Celtics have had two very different starts to the season, as the defending champs have picked up where they left off with another strong beginning to their repeat bid, while the Bucks have been one of the NBA’s worst teams despite having a healthy Damian Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo.  It has not been the kind of start Milwaukee envisioned, and they were hoping to kickstart a turnaround on Sunday when they played host to the Celtics with a chance to alleviate some of the panic about the team’s start by beating one of the league’s best. As they’ve done on a few occasions this season, the Bucks came out hot, scoring 40 in the first quarter to take a double-digit lead, but couldn’t maintain that offensive output, scoring just 38 in the entire second half to see the Celtics pull ahead and pull away for a 113-107 win.  During the game, Giannis and Jaylen Brown had an interesting exchange, as Antetokounmpo elbowed Brown in the head on a post move and then hit Brown with a fake handshake as they went back down the court, which Brown didn’t seem to appreciate.   A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston)  After the game, Brown gave some brief, but unfiltered thoughts on the exchange. “Giannis is a child,” Brown dead-panned. “I’m just focused on helping my team get a win, and that’s what we did tonight.”  Giannis certainly wasn’t the chief culprit for the Bucks struggles on Sunday, as he had 43 points and 13 rebounds, but this kind of silly exchange doesn’t quite land as well with fans when the team is falling to 2-8 on the season, with the only team worse than them in the East being the Embiid-less Sixers."

	The Chiefs moved to 9-0 after blocking a 35-yard kick by Denver with one second left that would've won the game.","The Kansas City Chiefs entered Sunday as the NFL’s last remaining undefeated team at 8-0, and were heavy favorites to move to 9-0 at home against their divisional rival from Denver. However, the Chiefs offense, which has been sluggish at times this season, could not finish off drives with touchdowns and allowed the Broncos to hang around all game.  On Sunday, it looked like that would finally catch up to them and result in a loss, as the Broncos moved the ball inside the Chiefs 20 on their final drive of the game, trailing 16-14, setting up a 35-yard field goal attempt for the win by Wil Lutz. However, the Chiefs special teams unit still had at least one more miracle in them, as George Karlaftis, Leo Chenal, and company caved in the left side of the Broncos field goal unit and blocked the kick to preserve the 16-14 win.  A post shared by NFL (@nfl)  It’s an insane way for the Chiefs to win that game, as they were completely unable to run the ball (19 carries for 57 yards, 19 yards coming from Patrick Mahomes scrambling), missed a number of big play opportunities and had to settle for field goals, and gave up a critical late game drive deep into their own territory. And yet, they move on to Week 11 at 9-0 on the season with a schedule that isn’t the most difficult if they can get past a road trip to Buffalo next week — although, as Sunday proved, division games can always get weird."
Sports – UPROXX,The Bucks Have ‘Called The Whole League’ Trying To Find A Trade After Their Awful Start,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/milwaukee-bucks-trade-rumors-called-whole-league/,"Fri, 08 Nov 2024 22:30:53 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	The Bucks are trying to find a roster upgrade, but with their cap situation, they're finding it nearly impossible despite their best effort.","The Milwaukee Bucks came into the 2024-25 season hopeful that having both Damian Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo fully healthy and coming off a full training camp together would vault them back into being a threat in the Eastern Conference. Instead, the Bucks are 2-6 with their only wins over the tanking Jazz and the Sixers on opening night — who were without Joel Embiid and Paul George and have also looked awful to start the season.  It’s been rough on both sides of the ball for the Bucks, as they are in the bottom half of the league in both offensive and defensive rating through the first few weeks of the season, and while things should improve if and when Khris Middleton can get back healthy for an extended period of time, it’s also pretty clear this roster has some flaws in need of fixing. The problem for the Bucks is, as a second apron team, making a trade is extremely difficult, as they’ve found out the hard way recently.  On Friday’s episode of NBA Today, Brian Windhorst said the Bucks have “called pretty much the whole league” trying to find a trade that could improve their roster, but have run into the same issues with just about everyone.  “The Bucks are doing something that we don’t see very often, which is scouring the trade market in the first week of November,” Windhorst said. “As I was talking to teams this week, they were like, ‘The Bucks just called. The Bucks just called.’ I think the Bucks right now are just kind of searching and trying to cover their bases. And by the way, Giannis is not on the table, Dame is not on the table, they’re looking to try and (find) help for some of their wing play — Khris Middleton’s absence has been extended.  “I talked to one team who said, ‘Yeah, we talked to the Bucks. We came up with two or three different scenarios and realized we’re not allowed to make any of those trades.’ The Bucks are hemmed in as a second-apron team with the new rules. They can’t aggregate players together, they can’t put like two or three players together in a trade. They can’t do a trade where they bring in more money. They have traded away the next six first round picks, either the picks or the swaps, they have traded away the next six second round picks. They are $75 million in the luxury tax. I don’t think help is on the way through the trade market. But they are making calls, which is interesting because from what I can tell, they called pretty much the whole league.” The two players the Bucks were reported to be shopping over the summer (and even last trade deadline) were Bobby Portis and Pat Connaughton, but as Windhorst notes, being unable to aggregate those salaries together means they have to find a player to trade for that matches salary exactly or makes just a little less than either of those two. Given Portis makes just over $12.5 million and Connaughton makes just under $9.5 million, that’s a tough thing to do if the goal is to add a strong contributor for a contender. As such, Windy doesn’t expect them to find a miraculous deal out there, and it sounds like, despite the front office’s best efforts in working the phones, it’s going to come down to this roster to turn things around in Milwaukee."

	Come get these winners.","More than half of the 2024 NFL regular season is over. That reality is painful for those enjoy consuming every aspect of professional football and, in this space, things haven’t gone particularly well. In fact, it was largely a disaster for the first seven weeks but, after back-to-back winning performances, optimism is beginning to creep in.  Would it have been better if the Cleveland Browns or Green Bay Packers could’ve taken care of business last week? Certainly. But here we are after a 3-2 showing. Before handing out this week’s selections, let’s take stock as we dig out of the hole.  Come get these winners. I am actually quite high on the Bills dating back to the summer, but I can’t get them to -4 here. Buffalo is riding high with a four-game winning streak, which helps to explain the number, and Indianapolis has flopped with two straight losses. Still, Joe Flacco and company shouldn’t be getting a full four at home, and we have to take the candy. This is just a principle play. We’re taking advantage of a Wong teaser here, sending Pittsburgh through a pair of key numbers and doing the same with Kansas City. The Steelers have been a wagon as an underdog under Mike Tomlin. The Chiefs will eventually lose (I think) but it won’t be here.  As noted a week ago, this credit goes to UPROXX editor Robby Kalland, but NFC South overs are unbeaten this season. Perhaps that will come to an end here, but Atlanta’s offense can put up points in bunches and its defense is capable of letting the Saints hang around. Let’s go touchdowns. I have to admit that I hate this. I know my editors will hate this. But Los Angeles is laying more than a touchdown with a total in the 30’s? It isn’t as if the Chargers have a real home-field advantage either. I’m holding my nose as I type this, but I simply must. New York has been a sharp side all week, and that makes sense. I couldn’t quite give out the Jets in an awesome spot last week, but I think this is a sell-high spot on Arizona after their blowout win over Chicago. Take me there, Aaron Rodgers."

Earlier this month, fans of Kelce’s holiday project with his former Philadelphia Eagles teammates Lane Johnson and Jordan Mailata heard the first track off of their upcoming album A Philly Special Christmas Party, which featured Kelce teaming up with his brother, Travis Kelce, and Boyz II Men on the track “It’s Christmas Time (In Cleveland Heights).” Kelce collaborated with another legendary artist for the latest track off of the upcoming release, as he recorded a duet with Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks. The track, a cover of Ron Sexsmith’s “Maybe This Christmas,” got teased on the project’s Instagram account over the last week and on the latest edition of the Kelce brothers’ podcast, and was officially unveiled on Friday.  A post shared by A Philly Special Christmas (@aphillyspecialchristmas)  “There are no words to describe how incredible it is to have Stevie Nicks on this record,” executive producer Conner Barwin said in a statement given to Rolling Stone. “There is so much emotion in this song, and it was thrilling to be with them in the studio and watch her and Jason connect, be creative together, and witness this beautiful song become a reality.” A Philly Special Christmas Party will come out on Nov. 22, 2024, but if you’d like to listen to the new track, you can do that right here."

	NBA players have been appearing in music videos for years, and today, we highlighted some of the best cameos.","NBA players and musical artists have always been close with one another. One frequent way that we’ve seen that over the years is music videos, as NBA players have frequently made cameos in them, whether they’re just showing their face for a moment or they’re a main character in the story that an artist is trying to tell. Today, we wanted to highlight some of our favorite appearances that NBA players have made in music videos over the years. Players from a number of different eras — and songs from a number of different genres — made it on the list, but all of them feature artists making it a point to get some of the biggest names in basketball into their videos. This wasn’t the only time Kobe linked up with Destiny’s Child — he recorded a verse on a remix of their track “Say My Name.” He does have a cameo in the video for “Bug-a-Boo,” though, as Destiny’s Child — which is trying to get away from a group that is bugging them — dips into a locker room. While going through there, they come across Bryant, who is sitting there and getting ready to play basketball. MJ and MJ just had to appear in a music video together at some point, no? The two appear on a basketball court and shoot hoops with one another, and at one point, Michael (Jackson) teaches Michael (Jordan) some dance moves. These might have been the two most famous people in the world when this video came out in 1992, and it’s a pretty remarkable cultural artifact. The newest release on this list, DeRozan was one of the many celebrities who made a cameo in Lamar’s summer anthem that doubled as the high point of his feud with Drake from earlier this year. It turns out DeRozan has known Lamar for quite some time, and while he said he still has love for Drake despite appearing in this video, well, it sure seems like there might be some tension here. Shaq, as we’ve laid out before, has been in a ton of music videos over the years. His first was the iconic “Make ‘Em Say Uhh!” video, where he sits courtside and looks like he’s having the time of his life as Master P and co. put on a show on the hardwood. One of the biggest music videos of all time — it’s a little more than 14 and a half minutes long, and is absolutely jam packed with some of the biggest names in sports and entertainment at that time. Names like Deion Sanders, Rickey Henderson, and Wayne Gretzky make cameos, while the NBA is well-represented with two members of the Dream Team and, uh, a third player who was almost on the Dream Team. Easily the most … unique video on this list. It features Jimmy Butler dressed up in what I can only describe as an emo cowboy costume and really committing fully to the bit. (The bit, of course, is “Jimmy Butler dressing like this in a Fall Out Boy video.”) There is no one in the NBA quite like Jimmy, and this video is a pretty good example of why that is the case."

	Travis Kelce caught a stray on 'Jeopardy!.'","Travis Kelce has long been one of the NFL’s most visible stars, but recently, he has achieved a new level of widespread cultural notoriety thanks to his relationship with Taylor Swift. Jeopardy! made a nod to that during the November 6 episode. In the episode’s opening round (per J! Archive), the $200 clue in the “The TV Show In Question” category read, “Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity? is hosted by this man who’s maybe more famous as a BF than as a 3-time Super Bowl champ.” Contestant Derek Hieronymus correctly responded with Kelce. Here’s a video of the moment. This came shortly after Jeopardy! found itself in a bit of hot water. As USA Today notes, Heather Ryan, a contestant on the October 28 episode, recently spoke out about a clue that read, “Men seldom make passes at…,” with the correct response being, “Girls who wear glasses.” She said, “It is definitely an odd choice. I think it made everybody in the audience and on stage — and Ken Jennings, too — a little uncomfortable. It was like, ‘Oh, that was unexpected.’ Maybe we choose better rhyming phrases in 2024. […] Unfortunately, there are still girls who are (in) middle school, and they don’t want to wear their glasses and they’re losing out on their education. So, I think it’s much better to be able to see than anything else.” Jennings apologized following the incident, saying, “A little problematic, sorry Heather.”"

	Vivek Ranadive has unsurprisingly taken DeMar DeRozan's side in his simmering feud with Drake.","The Toronto Raptors traveled to Sacramento to take on the Kings on Wednesday night in a game that has suddenly given us a little spiciness off the court. Sacramento went to Toronto on the night of Vince Carter’s jersey retirement ceremony last week, which was the first time that DeMar DeRozan played in front of Drake since he appeared in the music video for Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us.” While DeRozan, in the immediate aftermath, said he has tons of love for Drake despite his cameo in the video, Drake expressed that he doesn’t want to see DeRozan get his number retired in Toronto when his career comes to an end, and DeRozan seemed to have a lot of fun responding. And on Wednesday with Drake’s beloved Raptors in town, Kings owner Vivek Ranadive decided to show some support to his star forward by wearing a shirt with the words “THEY NOT LIKE US” on it.  A post shared by SLAM (@slam)  The Kings picked up a 122-107 win on Wednesday to move and 5-3 on the season. All five starters scored in double-figures for Sacramento, with DeRozan leading the way with 27 points on 11-for-21 shooting.

	Windhorst thinks the Warriors have an ""itchy trigger finger"" when it comes to trade talks and chasing another star.","The Golden State Warriors picked up a big early season win on Wednesday night when they defeated the Boston Celtics to improve to 7-1 on the young season and offer an early confirmation point that their hot start is the real deal after beating a number of teams in the middle and bottom of the standings.  The Warriors’ depth has been showcased during their hot start, but this is a team that was very active on the trade market this summer trying to land another star-level player to fit between Stephen Curry and Draymond Green. Paul George and Lauri Markkanen were well known pursuits of the Warriors, and their hot start may only further embolden the front office to go star-chasing during the season.  As Brian Windhorst laid out on Thursday’s First Take, the Warriors are the team he most expects to make a splash trade this season, as they have the contracts, young players, and draft assets to make a competitive offer for just about anyone.  ""The Warriors are the biggest candidate in my mind to make a big trade. They tried to trade for LeBron James last trade deadline… This is a team that's got an itchy trigger finger trying to make a big deal."" – Brian Windhorst 👀pic.twitter.com/0wYql9bYW4 — ClutchPoints (@ClutchPoints) November 7, 2024  Windhorst notes this front office seems to have an “itchy trigger finger” when it comes to trade talks, noting their efforts at landing another star date back to last deadline when they called the Lakers about LeBron. While a move isn’t imminent and they’ll likely ride this wave of positivity for awhile, by the time 2025 arrives and trade season kicks into full gear, they should be seen as a top threat for any star that comes available. We know the likes of Brandon Ingram and Zach LaVine are still available, but that was the case this summer and the Warriors seemed to balk at making a move for either of those two players. Instead, it seems Golden State is keen to wait to see if someone else comes available they could make a run at, but Windy, at the very least, would be very surprised if this Warriors roster looks the same by mid-February when San Francisco is hosting the All-Star Game."

	We caught up with Mercedes Moné to discuss her return from injury, regaining confidence, and how she's blazing a trail for the AEW women.","The last year has been a whirlwind for Mercedes Moné, and more than six months into her AEW tenure, there’s plenty to be grateful for.  What was once considered a career-ending ankle injury could have sidelined Moné for good, she refused to accept the possibility of her childhood dream being over, instead choosing optimism, and willing herself back into the ring. “It’s really just leading with gratitude, thankful to be a part of this wrestling community still,” Moné tells Uproxx Sports. “The last year was the craziest year of my whole life, not knowing where I was going to be in wrestling, but leading with gratitude and staying positive.” Moné landed in AEW in March, carrying the same mindset she’s had throughout her career as she’s trail blazed a new path for women’s wrestling.  “(I knew) where I wanted to be and what I want to leave in professional wrestling, to take this women’s division to whole new heights all over the world,” Moné says. “I wanted to have more for women’s wrestling, so I knew going to AEW was the place to be to make that happen. I feel like the women’s division has really changed the game. The women’s division has been the best it’s ever been. The women’s storylines are headlining AEW pay-per-views. So it’s just been amazing to come this far and I’m really excited for more.” For most athletes, an injury the severity of Moné’s typically requires at least two years to be back at full strength. She says she feels amazing being back in the ring and admits the toughest part of this journey is in the past.  “For me, it was just mentally going into the ring and training and being like, okay, I don’t want to be scared of climbing the top rope. I don’t want to be scared of jumping off the top rope. I don’t even want to be scared of running, because due to my injury, I couldn’t walk for over three months,” Moné says. “So just telling myself that I still got this. I got to train with Tyler Breeze for three months preparing myself for my AEW debut. And it was just getting my confidence back in the ring. That’s what really took some time. But now I’m feeling better than ever, and here I am as two belts Moné, so I’m feeling great.” After returning to the ring in May, Moné was quick to find gold around her waist. She defeated Willow Nightingale to earn the TBS title before claiming the NJPW STRONG Women’s championship just a month later. After sitting in the stands at All In at Wembley Stadium last year, Moné battled Britt Baker in London this year. She’s continued to find her footing in matches against Hikaru Shida, Emi Sakura, and most recently, Queen Aminata.  Moné isn’t just talking the talk, she’s leading the AEW women’s division to new heights and opening doors to elevate talent across the roster.  “I was born to be the best. I was born to have this purpose of leading a charge of making sure that women’s wrestling is known and respected and it deserves the respect that it’s given,” Moné says. “So just leaning on the standard that I put for myself, I’m here to be the best, to show the world that I’m the best, and I’m here to bring the women along with me. So that’s the goal.” While she has her eyes firmly on her next challenger for the TBS championship, Kris Statlander at the Full Gear pay-per-view on November 23, Moné isn’t stopping at defending the belts already in her possession. Mariah May told me ahead of All In earlier this year that she’s interested in mixing it up down the line with Moné, a dream opponent for the talented AEW Women’s champion. When — and if — that match happens remains to be seen.  Moné is never one to shy away from a challenge and says she’s “coming for all the titles” in AEW, while offering praise for one of the promotion’s brightest young talents. “I am super proud to watch from afar. She came in as a super fan, just loving wrestling, loved it so much that she moved from England to Japan, trained out in Stardom just to hone her craft, and now she’s here,” Moné says.   “She is our women’s world champion, beating Toni Storm in one of the best storylines in women’s history. So to see her rise this fast and to see how good she is in the ring, it’s so incredible. Like I said, we have the best women’s division in the game right now. And I’m definitely looking at the title that she has around her waist.”"

	Morant and the Grizzlies beat the Lakers at home for the first time since their tense playoff series in 2023.","Ja Morant and the Memphis Grizzlies took down the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday night. It was the first time that Morant got to play L.A. at home since the two teams went head-to-head in a tense playoff series back in 2023 — Los Angeles won in six games — and Morant sure did play like he still has that postseason failure on his mind. In the 131-114 Grizzlies win, Morant tied for the team high with 20 points, along with five assists, four rebounds, a steal, and a block. At one point, he scored over Gabe Vincent and hit him with a too small … only for LeBron James to come back on the very next possession and get him right back.  Ja Morant gave a ""too small"" to Gabe Vincent, and then LeBron gave it right back to Ja 😅pic.twitter.com/0N3OnwlMu1 — Dime (@DimeUPROXX) November 7, 2024  After the game, Morant spoke to the media, and after saying that James’ too small was done “respectfully,” he expressed that he really does not like the Lakers. “I don’t like ’em,” Morant told the press. “They knocked me out the playoffs … they beat us last time, I didn’t get to play, like I said, last year. They came on our home floor, beat us on our home floor, was laughin’, playin’, lookin’ at me, talkin’. My message was, I was in street clothes. This is my first opportunity to get back on the floor playing against them.” As for the whole “getting a too small for LeBron” thing, well, Morant took to Twitter after the win and addressed that."

	JJ Redick was blunt when asked why his starting guard got benched in the third quarter of Wednesday's loss to the Grizzlies.","The Los Angeles Lakers fell to the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday night, 131-114, as they attempt to navigate what has been a pretty difficult spate of injuries. One guy who hasn’t been injured, though, is starting guard D’Angelo Russell, although he saw his minutes cut on Wednesday — Russell came out of the game with 5:54 left in the third quarter, did not reenter, and only played 21:33 on the evening. New Lakers coach JJ Redick decided to close the game with Gabe Vincent on the floor, and after the game, he was asked why he kept Russell on the bench. As he explained, part of it was just wanted to see what Vincent gave him, but with Russell, there were some things that he did not like to see. “Level of compete, attention to detail, some of the things we’ve talked with him about for a couple weeks and, at times, he’s been really good with that stuff, and other times, it’s just reverting back to certain habits,” Redick told the press after the game at the 3:05 mark of the above video. “Wasn’t like a punishment, just felt like for us to have a chance to win this game, that was the route we wanted to take. Gabe, in the first half, especially defensively, was fantastic, and I just wanted to see what that looked like.” Russell went 4-for-12 from the field for 12 points, three assists, and two steals before his evening came to an end."

	Miller had 19 points on the night, with his biggest bucket coming as the clock hit zero.","The Charlotte Hornets are built around a young and exciting 1-2 punch in LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller. On Wednesday night, both of the franchise’s pillars needed to come up big in order for Charlotte to pick up a 108-107 win over the Detroit Pistons, with Miller, in particular, playing the hero in the waning moments of the game. After a turnover by Miller, the Pistons went the other way and got a layup from rookie forward Ron Holland to take a 1-point lead. On the ensuing possession, the Hornets were able to get a good look for Grant Williams, who pulled up from behind the three-point line but was not able to convert. Fortunately for everyone in Charlotte, Miller was able to sneak his way into the lane and clean up the miss. He immediately attempted a layup, which went in and gave the Hornets their third win of the season.  A post shared by SportsCenter (@sportscenter)  It wasn’t the most productive night for Miller, who had 19 points on 6-for-16 shooting with six rebounds and four assists. But he got the biggest two points of the evening, so it’s safe to say that he had a pretty good evening. As for his star running mate, Ball had 25 points, eight assists, six rebounds, and two steals."

But they are determined to make the mogul proud, one up their rivals, and bring the school’s band program into a new era. Though the reaction to the planned performance is mostly love, Mills has gotten a bit of trepidation from alums worried about “protecting certain traditions.” He’s not deterred though, “This yields an opportunity to say ‘Look, I got it.’” Blaze, on the other hand, couldn’t be more excited about the collab. “I’ve been waiting for this moment all my life, and didn’t even realize it until now.” He’s not the only person thoroughly anticipating a great performance. Denise Saunders Thompson, Assistant Dean to the Chadwick Boseman College of Fine Arts, takes time out of her busy schedule to meet Mills, Blaze, and the band on the field to complement and encourage their progress. “Were gonna break the internet with this performance,” she tells the group, hoping to manifest this new standard-setting moment with her words.

	Embiid has not played yet this season, but his suspension will not go into effect until after he is eligible to play.","The Philadelphia 76ers will have to wait a little longer for Joel Embiid to play in his first game this season. On Tuesday afternoon, the NBA announced that Embiid received a 3-game suspension following an incident in the locker room on Saturday night where he shoved a member of the media. It is believed that Embiid shoved Marcus Hayes of the Philadelphia Inquirer, who recently published a column criticizing Embiid over not playing this season that referenced his son and late brother, which upset the former NBA MVP. “Mutual respect is paramount to the relationship between players and media in the NBA,” Joe Dumars, the NBA’s Executive Vice President, Head of Basketball Operations said in a statement. “While we understand Joel was offended by the personal nature of the original version of the reporter’s column, interactions must remain professional on both sides and can never turn physical.” Embiid criticized Hayes earlier in the week during a media availability, but he was not in attendance. In its statement, the league announced that Embiid — who has been working his way back from a knee issue — will not start serving his suspension until he is eligible and healthy enough to play. The Sixers have gotten off to a slow start this season without Embiid, as the team is 1-5. Their high-profile offseason addition, Paul George, only just made his regular season debut on Monday night against the Phoenix Suns after getting hurt in the preseason."

	Lou Williams wasn't a fan of what Drake said about DeMar DeRozan on the night the Raptors retired Vince Carter's jersey.","The Toronto Raptors retired Vince Carter’s jersey last week, the highest honor the team can give to one of the most iconic players in franchise history. The game happened against the Sacramento Kings, which are the current team of someone else who will probably get his jersey retired by the Raptors some day, DeMar DeRozan. While the night was all about Carter, there was some tension between DeRozan and noted Raptors fan Drake, which presumably all revolves around DeRozan appearing in the music video for Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us.” The whole ordeal rubbed former Toronto player Lou Williams the wrong way, which he expressed on FanDuel’s “Run It Back.” “If I’m gonna speak candidly, I thought that was selfish of Drake,” Williams said. “Drake, as well as the country of Canada, the city of Toronto, they know what DeMar DeRozan has contributed to the culture up there, and what he’s contributed to the Toronto Raptors, and to that community. It goes way bigger than his personal relationship with Drake, it goes way bigger than his personal relationship with Kendrick Lamar. So for Drake to say, ‘If you put up a banner and I’ll personally pull it down,’ it’s like, is it just about you or is it about the Toronto Raptors?” Drake expressed during the game that if the Raptors put up a DeRozan banner, “I’ll go up there and pull it down myself.” DeRozan was asked to respond to this after the game and told the press that “He gonna have a long way to climb to take it down. So, tell him good luck.” The following day, DeRozan posted a clip from Friday to his Instagram Story, and it’s not hard to read between the lines that he was talking about Drake."

	Caitlin Clark is excited to play for an Indiana legend, and saw how she had the Sun prepared and thinks that'll make the Fever better.","More than half of the WNBA is changing coaches this offseason, as seven of the league’s 13 teams parted ways with their head coach from the 2024 season — and the Golden State Valkyries are entering the league with a new coach as an expansion franchise. Among the teams that fired their coach after the season was the Indiana Fever, as they let Christie Sides go after guiding Indiana to a second-half push that saw them nab a playoff berth before a first round loss.  The Fever figured to be a highly coveted job as it provides an opportunity to coach the last two Rookie of the Year winners in Caitlin Clark and Aliyah Boston. On Monday, the team officially introduced Stephanie White as their head coach, after White parted ways with the Connecticut Sun to return home to Indiana to take the Fever job for the second time in her career. This time, White takes over a roster that has a ton of talent, and in her intro presser she stated her belief that Clark and Boston can be the best guard-big tandem the WNBA has ever seen.  Those two were at White’s introductory presser, and spoke with ESPN’s Michael Voepel about their excitement to play for White, with Clark explaining that the detailed approach the Sun always had in facing the Fever makes her believe White can help them improve some of their weaknesses quickly.  “We know how much of a legend she is in Indiana,” Clark said Monday. “I think that’s really cool. Playing against her, I would say I felt like her teams always had the best scouts against us. I think that just speaks to her knowledge of the game and her way to analyze, and she clearly was on to something. Hopefully, in turn, now that she knows how to stop us, that should be a good way to know how to [help us] beat certain things as well.” Boston added, “There’s nothing better than playing for a coach that you can already tell she’s going to pour into us. She knows the talent that we have and I’m super-excited to get out on the court. You can feel the intensity already.” White will have the next six months to self-scout the Fever and identify the areas they can improve for 2025, as the expectations will only get bigger for Indiana. At the very least, White believes her young star duo is only scratching the surface and if Clark and Boston can level up in 2025 together, Indiana will have a chance to be a real threat to the WNBA’s top-4."

	Ja Morant hit a wild 360 layup against the Nets and decided to do it again later just for fun.","With Ja Morant missing almost all of last season due to suspension and injury (playing just 9 games), he found himself a bit outside the conversation for top point guards in the NBA coming into the 2024-25 season. It was a lost season for both Morant and the Grizzlies last year, and both player and team are looking to remind the NBA of their talents early this season.  While it’s been an up-and-down start to the year, Morant has offered reminders of his unique brilliance with highlight reel plays that only he produces right now in the NBA. On Monday night in Brooklyn he offered up a pair of outrageous finishes as he was strong on the B-button with two 360 layups against the Nets. The first came on a drive against Nic Claxton, where Morant jumped in the air and spun all the way across the lane for a silky finish with his left. The second was even more spontaneous, as Morant went up thinking about a poster dunk on Cam Johnson before changing his mind for another spinning lefty layup, changing hands in mid-air.  A post shared by NBA (@nba)   A post shared by NBA México (@nbamex)  It’s a pair of plays that perfectly encapsulate Morant’s singular ability as a high-flying guard. The first is so smooth as he just glides effortlessly through the air, while the second started with him thinking power but he had the time and ability to change his plan (and hands) mid-flight for the finish."

	The former teammates crossed paths in a pretty tense way on Monday night.","The Golden State Warriors traveled to Washington to take on the Wizards on Monday night, which meant that the Warriors crossed paths with an old friend, Jordan Poole. An important part of the team’s last title, Poole was traded to the Wizards last season in the aftermath of a tumultuous year with the Dubs. During Monday night’s game, the player responsibility for all that turmoil crossed paths with Poole once again, as the high-scoring guard had a run-in with Draymond Green. Poole knocked down a triple in the waning moments of the second quarter as Green attempted to contest his shot, and after it went in, he pointed right at Green. On the ensuing Warriors possession before the half, Steph Curry knocked down a three — Poole tried to contest it, he was unsuccessful, and Green immediately pointed right at him.   A post shared by SportsCenter (@sportscenter)  During training camp ahead of the 2022-23 season, Poole and Green were involved in an altercation during practice that ended with Green punching his then-teammate. Green received a suspension and a fine from the team as a result. While Poole received a 4-year, $140 million contract extension from the team not long after this, he really struggled during the ensuing season, and the following summer, he was sent to Washington in a trade for Chris Paul."

Kelce is on ESPN’s Monday Night Countdown now and has a wildly popular podcast with his brother Travis, as the brothers have seen their stardom leap from the sports world to pop culture in general, due in no small part to Travis’ relationship with Taylor Swift that has brought her legions of fans to them.  While there are the obvious benefits of that popularity in the form of massive media deals, there are also the trappings of fame that come with the territory of being immediately recognizable to most any person. On Saturday, Jason was reminded of that when he was in State College for Ohio State-Penn State and had a heckler call Travis a gay slur for dating Swift while holding his phone out recording. That jackass was seeking a reaction and got one in the form of Jason grabbing his phone and spiking it on the ground, with videos from other nearby going viral immediately.

	Stephen A. went on a lengthy rant wondering who is allowed to criticize Kevin Durant.","Kevin Durant and Stephen A. Smith aren’t exactly on the best term, as the Suns star has taken exception to some of Smith’s reporting and pontificating for years. Most recently, Durant expressed his frustration with Smith claiming he isn’t a good leader.  Smith reported this summer that the Suns wanted out of Durant amid rumors the Rockets were pursuing the star in a trade. The Sun’s then denied that publicly and as the 2024-25 season began, Durant was in a Phoenix uniform. Still, Smith continued to prod at the star, calling him out for a lack of vocal leadership and being an aloof star in the locker room. Durant responded on Twitter (as he often does) and then again this weekend when asked about the leadership talk by The Athletic’s Doug Haller.  Durant questioned why anyone listens to Stephen A., calling him “a clown” and calling into question his sources, noting he’s never in practices or the locker room. Unsurprisingly, Smith responded on Monday morning on ‘First Take’ with a lengthy diatribe where he said he wouldn’t respond with the same “kind of pettiness and childishness” and questioned who is allowed to talk about Durant, listing off all the people KD has taken issue with (watch here).  “I got bad news for Kevin Durant, if you’re expecting me to reciprocate with that kind of pettiness and childishness, it’s not gonna happen,” Smith said. “Kevin Durant is one of the greatest players to ever play this game. He’s a future Hall of Famer, he’s a two-time champion, two-time Finals MVP, and I’ve been on the record saying he’s also a good dude. So if he wants to resort to that level, even though we’re both grown men and if he had something to say he knows my number and he refrains from doing so, that’s something he has to live with.  “Having said all of that, respectfully, Kevin Durant can you stop lying, please? I’ve been an NBA reporter and I was a columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer as well. Kevin Durant has seen me in the locker room when he was at Oklahoma City. He has seen me in the locker room when he was at Golden State. He has certainly seen me at games throughout his career. But, unfortunately for him, I don’t have to be at shootaround and I don’t have to be in the postgame locker room. I happen to have a hit show that’s been No. 1 for 12 years, I have other things to do with my time. I go to games all the time. I’m not a beat writer anymore.  “The other thing I would say is this, Kevin Durant is going to have to answer this question: Who is allowed to talk about him? Charles Barkley played this game as a Hall of Famer. He got at Charles Barkley. Shannon Sharpe is a Super Bowl champion and a Hall of Famer. He got at Shannon. He got at players, the CJ McCollums of the world, the Dennis Schroders of the world, and others. He’s gotten at fans, and did it discreetly because he had accounts that didn’t reveal who he was. It’s contemporaries and colleagues, it’s former players, it’s present players, it’s the media, it’s fans, it’s whoever. Is anyone allowed to talk about Kevin Durant? Because I don’t understand it. I don’t get it.” The “he can call me” thing from Stephen A. is always funny to me, because it implies that only he is allowed to talk about people in front of a microphone and if they want to discuss him and his commentary they should do it privately. His final point is probably his strongest, as he notes that Durant has bristled at comments from fellow players, former greats, and all manner of media members and fans. It’s a fair point, and his use of burner accounts in the past has, in particular, left a reputation of Durant having thin skin. That said, at this point, KD happily replies to folks from main, and I think his directness in responding to people — whether it’s Barkley, Smith, or some random Twitter account — breaks down the wall that typically exists in the athlete-critic relationship.  Most athletes either ignore it or internalize it for motivation, but rarely do they so regularly respond and push back on it directly. Athletes love to prove doubters or haters wrong, but they typically throw everyone into one bucket and respond generally. Durant, meanwhile, takes a very different approach by responding directly and asking for critics to elaborate or explain their reasoning further. That tends to throw folks off, including Smith. There is certainly fair criticism to be made about Durant, but I also don’t think it’s unreasonable for him to push back if he doesn’t believe it."

But after the “Not Another Love Song” singer shared her sophomore album, Heart On My Sleeve, Ella Mai slowly began to disappear from the public’s eye. Today (November 3), Ella Mai reappeared online to announce her surprise EP, 3, to celebrate her birthday.  “AVAILABLE NOW EVERYWHERE! My 30th birthday gift to you all. 3 songs. November 3rd. one of my favorite numbers I’ve missed you all, three times over ❤️,” she wrote in the Instagram post’s caption.

On the track “Little Things,” Ella sings: “Be right hеre when you’re wakin’ up / Breakfast on the table, know you like / Eggs, and they’re all scrambled up / Pancakes, bacon, OJ on the side / Packed your bag with extra clothes, your toothbrush in the Louis tote / Love notes for when you on the road / Cleaned your watch and Cuban links / Silk pillowcase for you to take / Boy, you deserve the little things.” The line hints at Tatum’s demanding sports schedule with the Boston Celtics. This heartfelt fluttering can also be heard on “One Of Those,” where Ella sings: “Girl you better get you one of these / Wake up in the morning, he got flowers at my feet / Get one of these, yeah, I don’t wanna leave / Dancing ’round him got me like a puppet / I’ma let him pull my strings / Get you one of these / Kinda man that get you what you want, then he gon’ give you want you need / I’m just saying get you one of these.” Continue below to view Ella Mai’s 3 tracklist and cover. 1. “Hearts On Deck”

	Barkley spun to break one tackle and then hurdled a defender while facing the other way in an insane run on Sunday.","Hurdling an opponent is one of the great risk-reward moves a ball-carrier can make, as going airborne to avoid a tackle can lead to a huge play but also can result in a player getting absolutely blasted. Some players are much better at it than others, and Saquon Barkley is among the best in all of football at leaping defenders, going all the way back to his college days at Penn State.  On Sunday, the star running back decided to innovate on his trademark move one one of the greatest 14-yard runs you’ll ever see, where he broke out a spin move into what I can only describe as a reverse hurdle, as he leaped over a defender while facing the opposite direction.  THE 180 HURDLE??? DID SAQUON JUST INVENT THIS?! 📺: #JAXvsPHI on CBS/Paramount+📱: https://t.co/waVpO8ZBqG pic.twitter.com/tYThjnbdgG — NFL (@NFL) November 3, 2024  I really don’t know how you pull this off without injuring yourself or fumbling, but Barkley cleared the defender cleanly and landed on his feet — before taking a shot from another defender and needing to check out for a play or two. Tiki Barber in the FOX booth rightfully loses his mind over this move, and I really hope no young running backs look at this and decide they want to replicate it because it would go extremely poorly for anyone without Barkley’s insane athleticism."

	KD called out Stephen A. Smith for being ""a clown"" and isn't sure why people still listen to him.","The Phoenix Suns picked up their fourth straight win on Saturday night in Portland, improving to 5-1 on the young season to remain tied for second in the West with the Warriors, a game back of the NBA’s last remaining undefeated team, Oklahoma City.  It’s the second season for the Suns star trio being all together, and that has, historically, been when those teams take a leap if they ever do. The first year is figuring out how it all should work and learning how not to step on each other’s toes, and then the second year is when we find out if the ceiling really is as high as it appears on paper. For that reason, the strong start to this season is a very good sign for the Suns, even if there’s still a long way to go this season in confirming their status as a top threat in the West.  An additional subplot to this Suns season is that of Kevin Durant’s reputation, as the future Hall of Famer still gets nagged about whether he’s an effective leader, largely because his greatest team success came when he joined the Warriors where it was clearly Stephen Curry’s team. Charles Barkley has prodded at KD pretty consistently, calling him a follower and bus rider, while Stephen A. Smith regularly takes aim at Durant’s leadership as the thing he lacks compared to other top stars of his generation.  Durant and his Suns teammates and coaches have scoffed at that notion, and on Saturday night Durant was again asked the leadership question by Doug Haller of The Athletic and had some pointed words for Stephen A., calling him “a clown.”  “Yeah, Stephen A., I don’t understand how people even listen to Stephen A.,” he told The Athletic. “I’ve been in the league for 18 years. I’ve never seen Stephen A. at a practice, or a film session, or a shoot-around. I’ve never seen him anywhere but on TV talking s— about players. … He’s a clown to me. He’s always been a clown. You can write that, too.” Durant went on to note that he isn’t taking a different approach or trying to be more vocal this year, insisting that he’s going about his business as always. He bristled, in particular, at commentary from the likes of Smith that he is aloof and distant from his teammates, which his Suns teammates push back on as well when asked by Haller. “To say that I’m just sitting here, you paint this picture of me coming into the locker room, not talking to my teammates, quiet, not talking to my coaches,” Durant said. “Like, come on, man. It’s just ridiculous.” Durant is far from the only NBA star who gets frustrated by Smith’s commentary and, particularly, when he offers up sourced reporting despite not being on the ground covering the league on the road regularly. Smith certainly knows a ton of people in and around the league, but players and fans are constantly skeptical of what he says, largely because it often feels his opinion and any reporting get blended together all into one. That makes it tough to separate the two, especially because he can’t help but go over the top with how he presents things. Durant has voiced his annoyance with Smith in the past, but this is some of his firmest criticism that hasn’t been levied on Twitter."

	Drake also hurled insults at DeRozan during the game's broadcast.","You may have moved past Kendrick Lamar’s chart-topping Drake diss, “Not Like Like Us.” But Drake surely hasn’t. After Akademiks dispelled rumors of a reconciliation between Drake and Future, the “First Person Shooter” rapper attempted to flex his star power against another foe.  Yesterday (November 2), Drake attended the Toronto Raptors and the Sacramento Kings game at Scotiabank Arena. Instead of focusing on the friendly matchup, Drake and his longtime friend Nessel “Chubbs” Beezer decided to laser in on former Raptors star DeMar DeRozan (now the the Kings). Throughout the game, Drake could be heard hurling remarks at DeRozan (supposedly including “p*ssy” and “goof“), and it doesn’t seem to be sports related tension.  At one point, Drake and Chubbs (both courtside) can be seen standing up and staring down DeRozan (viewable here). Well, just as viewers at home caught the suspenseful moment, so did DeRozan. Over on Instagram, DeMar DeRozan decided to troll Drake back by posting a video clip from Friday (viewable here).  In the scene, starring Ice Cube (playing Craig) and Chris Tucker (playing Smokey), Tucker’s character attempts to regain tough points after being punked by the neighborhood bully, Deebo (played by the late Tommy Lister). “I got mind control over Deebo,” says Tucker. “He be like shut the f*ck up. I be quiet. But when he leaves I be talking again.” This comes after Drake vowed to “pull down” DeRozan’s number should the Raptors ever decide to retire it after Vincent Carter’s number retirement celebration. DeRozan claimed that he and Drake were “still family” even after he appeared in the “Not Like Us” music video. However, it appears Drake doesn’t feel that same."

	DeRozan, of course, was in Kendrick Lamar's ""Not Like Us"" video, which surely had nothing to do with any of this!","It was a night for celebration in Toronto, as the Raptors retired the iconic number 15 worn by Vince Carter. And to put a cherry on top of what was a joyous evening in the 6, the Raptors were able to pick up a thrilling, 131-128 win over the Sacramento Kings in overtime, thanks to a 31-point outing by RJ Barrett. Playing the Kings meant that another Toronto legend, DeMar DeRozan, was back in town. Drake, unsurprisingly, was also there, which set up a pretty funny back-and-forth. While sitting in the broadcast booth, Drake expressed that he does not want DeRozan to get a banner, saying “If you ever put a DeRozan banner up, I’ll go up there and pull it down myself.” Now, it’s unclear if this is serious or a joke, but it’s worth remembering that DeRozan was in the music video for Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” and appeared on stage at The Pop Out while Lamar performed the song at the height of his feud with Drake earlier this year. And after the game, DeRozan got asked about Drake’s comments and had a simple response before getting up and walking away. “He gonna have a long way to climb to take it down,” DeRozan said. “So, tell him good luck.” It’s worth mentioning that when DeRozan was asked about the Drake-Kendrick feud, he said that “Drake’s still my man, still my man, none of it changed.” We’ll be sure to let you know if all of this tonight was in good fun or if things have changed between these two."

	The incident happened after Philly fell to the Grizzlies on Saturday night to move to 1-4 on the year, with Embiid not playing in the game.","The Philadelphia 76ers fell to 1-4 on the regular season on Saturday night, as the team picked up a 124-107 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. As has been the case every time they’ve taken the floor this year, the Sixers were without the services of Joel Embiid, who is ramping up following an issue the team discovered in his left knee. But despite not taking the floor, Embiid was involved in an incident after the game. According to Keith Pompey of the Philadelphia Inquirer, Embiid “assaulted a reporter in the locker room.” There wasn’t a ton of information in the aftermath, but eventually, Shams Charania of ESPN reported that Embiid got into it with the person who wrote “a recent column that referenced his late brother,” which featured a shove but no punch. Earlier this week, Embiid spoke with the media in Philly and got uncharacteristically fired up, saying “When I see people saying he doesn’t want to play. I’ve done way too much for this city, putting myself at risk for people to be saying that. So, I do think it’s bullsh*t.” In particular, he called out “that dude, he’s not here, Marcus, whatever his name is,” a reference to Pompey’s colleague, Marcus Hayes. Presumably, the reporter Embiid got into it with is Hayes, who wrote a column in October titled “Joel Embiid disrespects the Sixers, the game, its greats, and himself. Shaquille O’Neal and Charles Barkley are right to rip him.” While the piece has since been edited to remove the references to Embiid’s son and late brother, you can read what it originally said here. UPDATE: Kyle Neubeck of PHLY Sports spoke about the altercation on the PHLY Sixers Postgame Show and explained how the altercation came about, with Embiid telling Hayes not to mention his family, before the two went back and forth for nearly two minutes with Embiid eventually shoving Hayes. Per Neubeck, Sixers security staff and players stepped in quickly."

	Goldberg announced he'll have one last match in 2025.","Goldberg is finally going to get his sendoff match in the WWE, he announced on Saturday morning ahead of Georgia-Florida. 🚨 BREAKING: @Goldberg just announced that his retirement match will take place NEXT YEAR! 👀 🎥: @SECNetwork pic.twitter.com/e5KtwfOGnY — WWE (@WWE) November 2, 2024  Goldberg’s return to the WWE comes after he was confronted by World Heavyweight Champion, Gunther, at last month’s Bad Blood live event. Gunther downplayed Goldberg’s wrestling ability, then told his son he hopes he was a better father than he was a wrestler. This caused Goldberg to jump the barricade and go after Gunther before security intervened. While Sami Zayn successfully attacked the champ, Goldberg made his way into the ring and told the camera, “You’re next.” During the Bad Blood press conference, we asked Triple H about the possibility of seeing Goldberg wrestling another match in WWE, after the former world champion has been quite vocal about his desire to have a retirement match. “Atlanta loves Bill Goldberg, and that’s why he was here tonight. He was with his wife and his son, always going to get a huge reaction here enjoying the show,” Triple H said at the time. “Things get said. I can tell you when Bill came back, he was not too happy with Gunther and we’ll see. The further you go, time catches up with all of us. The further you go, the talks get further and further away from reality. But I don’t know, I saw Bill earlier in the day and it was great. And I saw Bill later in the day, and there was a different look on his face and a spark in his eye. So I would say never say never.” Goldberg last wrestled at the Elimination Chamber in 2022 against Roman Reigns. There’s no current word on the time, date, or location of Goldberg’s final match. It will, however, seemingly coincide with John Cena’s retirement tour."

Today (November 2), one person learned this lesson the hard way. In a now viral video, Jason Kelce came face-to-face with a troll. Given that the former Super Bowl champion announced his retirement in March, the hate wasn’t exactly aimed at him. Outside of the Ohio State Buckeyes and Penn State Nittany Lions’ game, Jason was surrounded by fans. As many hoped to snag a selfie with the former professional footballer, one person can he heard hurling insults at Jason about his brother Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s budding romance. In the video captured by an onlooker, the person yells, “How does it feel that your brother’s a f****t for dating Taylor Swift?” Shocked by the use of the homophobic slur, the filmer lowered their camera. Once the camera panned back up (viewable here courtesy of Pop Crave), you can see Jason slamming a cell phone to the ground.  Now, users online have jumped to Jason’s defense. “Jason is so real for this… no brother would hear such remarks against his own brother and his gf btw,” wrote one user. “We need more men like him,” penned another. “Oh, he put him in his place real quick, King 👑,” chimed another. “That’s disgusting and unacceptable behavior. No one deserves to be harassed or insulted like that,” added another. In the past, Jason has expressed his fondness of his brother Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s relationship after spilling the beans."

	Braun dunked all over Gobert then celebrated, which Gobert did not like.","Christian Braun is maybe the most interesting player on the Denver Nuggets not named Nikola Jokic. Braun, the third-year wing out of Kansas, has been a nice player up to this point in his NBA career, but has to step into a much bigger role after the team decided to not bring back Kentavious Caldwell-Pope in free agency. While he’s still young and a work in progress, the flashes Braun has shown have been awfully fun. Our latest glimpse of that came on Friday night in the Western Conference Semifinals rematch between Denver and the Minnesota Timberwolves, as Braun got met at the rim by Rudy Gobert and just did not care, as he went over and through the linchpin of the Timberwolves defense for a ridiculous dunk.   A post shared by NBA (@nba)  As you can see in the full clip that the NBA unsurprisingly did not want to put on its social media channels, Gobert was not exactly a fan of how Braun celebrated — it did not look like he was trying to scream in Gobert’s face, more that he was fired up in the exact wrong spot. It led to some pretty aggressive pushing and shoving, but ultimately, Braun and Gobert were the only players to receive any sort of reprimand from the referees, as they were each hit with technical fouls. Unfortunately for Braun and the Nuggets, Gobert and co. would get the last laugh, as Minnesota picked up a 119-116 win."

	The former teammates were at he center of a tense moment during Friday's Celtics-Hornets game.","Grant Williams spent the first four years of his NBA career as teammates with Jayson Tatum on the Boston Celtics. He’s moved around a few times since he left the team, and on Friday night, Williams and the Charlotte Hornets played host to his old squad. He did not, however, see the end of the game, as Williams was ejected after committing a Flagrant 2 foul on Tatum. Late in the fourth quarter with the Celtics up, 114-105, Tatum reeled in a rebound and took off down the floor. While that happened, Williams came in and gave him a hip check near mid-court, which sent both of them to the ground.  A post shared by NBC Sports Boston (@nbcsboston)  Tatum got right up and walked away from it, but another one of Williams’ former teammates in Boston, Jaylen Brown, made it a point to get in his face and say something while he was being helped up. After it was reviewed, the officials determined that Williams “accelerates, makes significant impact to the dribbler — a non-basketball play, potential for injury,” and as a result, the foul was upgraded to a Flagrant 2. It’s hard to tell exactly why Williams did this, but our hunch is after the game, he’s going to say it had something to do with the rebound Tatum grabbed right before this. You can see it at the very start of the above video, but presumably, he thought Tatum extended his arm and had LaMelo Ball hit the deck. Either that, or he just really wanted to hip check his old teammate. The Celtics went on to win, 124-109."

	All eyes are on Happy Valley for a showdown at the top of the Big Ten.","November is coming in with a bang. It’s the best month of the college football season because of its unparalleled ability to separate the wheat from the chaff in the sport, to determine which teams are real contenders to compete for conference and national titles, and which ones are unable to turn up when the pressure becomes a little more real. Week 10 doesn’t exactly give us a jam-packed slate of games, but think of it like a really fun UFC fight nit. There is a ton on the undercard — a bunch of games that should be close and will keep you flipping back and forth. There’s the co-main event that should be really good, a matchup between a pair of fun ranked team. But everything this week is going to revolve the heavyweight fight at the top of the card, which you can read about right, well, right now. The Nittany Lion fan who co-writes this every week is, in the immortal words of that kid in Christmas Vacation, sh*tting bricks. Penn State hasn’t beaten Ohio State since that famous 2016 game where they won on a blocked field goal return for a touchdown, and since then, you can make the argument that no team (outside of Michigan the last few years) has played the Buckeyes as consistently well as James Franklin’s team. But close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades, and Ohio State is on a 7-game winning streak over their Big Ten foes. Both teams have elite defenses — by SP+, the Buckeyes are No. 1 and the Nittany Lions are No. 3 in the country on that side of the football. They’re both rock solid and don’t really have a fatal flaw, although Penn State really does need to start turning its high pressure rate into sacks at some point. What this game is going to come down to, in all likelihood, is how each team overcomes potentially gigantic injuries to key parts of their offenses. For the Buckeyes, this involves their offensive line, as standout left tackle Josh Simmons is out for the year and his replacement, Zen Michalski, struggled against Nebraska before leaving with an injury that Ryan Day thinks will keep him out on Saturday. The reshuffling up front is going to be a major challenge, particularly against standout edge rusher Abdul Carter. But Penn State might have a bigger issue on its hands with an injury to starting QB Drew Allar, an Ohio native who was a disaster in Columbus last year and looked like he was primed for a monster game against his childhood team this season. Allar appeared to hurt his knee against Wisconsin last week, and while he’s a game-time decision who reports indicate will play, his backup, Beau Pribula, was able to lead a comeback in Camp Randall while he was out. Pribula is a totally different QB — Allar is a pure pocket passer, Pribula is a dual-threat — and when he was in, the Nittany Lion rushing attack took off against the Badgers. He’s not on Allar’s level as a passer, though, and to beat the Buckeyes, you have to be able to throw the ball down the field.  The margins have been awfully tight in this game over the years, and there’s no reason to think that won’t be the case again this time around. Will Day be able to get the sort of win over a top-5 team his critics think he can’t, or will Franklin be able to finally slay one of the Big Ten’s giants as he tries to secure the Nittany Lions’ spot as one of the nation’s elite? Big week for things in Pennsylvania, eh? Pitt is coming off of maybe the weirdest win of all time, a 41-13 drubbing of Syracuse where they were outgained, 327-217, but forced five interceptions and turned three of them into pick sixes. They keep finding ways to win, whether it’s behind talented young QB Eli Holstein, a physical running game led by Desmond Reid, a defense that is very good at generating havoc plays, or the top special teams unit in the country based on SP+. SMU, however, will be their toughest test by some margin, especially because dynamic signal caller Kevin Jennings was cleared to play despite an injury. When he is in, the Mustangs love to put the ball in the air and generate big plays, and how they manage to do that against a talented and opportunistic Panther secondary might end up deciding a game that has serious aspirations at the top of the ACC, which I did not expect to say about the game between Pitt and SMU at the start of the year. Is this game going to be good? Probably not. Does it have the potential to be a completely insane matchup of two teams smashed in the middle of the Big 12 that could really use a win? Absolutely. TCU quarterback Josh Hoover is capable of absolutely lighting teams up. Baylor is capable of running all over you with one of their five dudes who have at least 100 rushing yards this year. The Horned Frogs aren’t great at stopping the run, the Bears could be better at stopping teams from passing. If you like points, watch this one. Listen, Miami is going to win in all likelihood — they’re just way more talented than Duke, which has done an admirable job gutting out wins this year, in fairness. However, if Miami’s ACC title hopes take a big hit because they lose to Manny Diaz, we are going to see a gigantic meltdown out of Canes fans. Auburn beat Kentucky last week, 24-10. The Wildcats had 224 yards of total offense. Hunter, on his own, ran for 278 yards. It’s really hard to carry the ball 23 times and average 12.1 yards per carry, but Hunter did just that — plus he found the end zone twice, which is again more than Kentucky did. This line feels like an overreaction to Illinois getting outclassed by the best of the Big Ten while Minnesota has been beating a few mediocre Big Ten teams. The Illini getting points at home against a team that is a much more comfortable caliber of opponent should bring their offense back to life a bit, and I think their defense will look much faster and better against this Minnesota offense compared to Oregon. I like Illinois to win this on the field, but will also happily take three points."

	Embiid is apparently very unhappy with the discourse around his inability to play to start the season.","The Philadelphia 76ers haven’t had Joel Embiid to start the 2024-25 NBA season. Embiid missed all of the preseason, and when the first game of the year rolled around, the team said he was out with “left knee management” — the Sixers star dealt with left knee issues that limited him to only 39 games last season, and while he was able to play in the Olympics, he hasn’t taken the floor since. It’s led to Embiid getting a ton of criticism. Charles Barkley and Shaquille O’Neal both hit him pretty hard on TNT, while one column by a local reporter — titled “Joel Embiid disrespects the Sixers, the game, its greats, and himself. Shaquille O’Neal and Charles Barkley are right to rip him.” — seemed to especially rub him the wrong way, which he made clear while speaking to the media on Friday. “It was never decided,” Embiid told the press when asked when it was decided that he’d slow play his debut this year. “Like I said, everybody has been on the same page. If your body doesn’t react well, and if your body tells you one thing — I’ve done it. From what I can tell you, I’ve broken my face twice, I came back early with the risk of losing my vision, I’ve had broken fingers, I still came back. So, I’m not gonna sit here and be like … When I see people saying he doesn’t want to play. I’ve done way too much for this city, putting myself at risk for people to be saying that. So, I do think it’s bullsh*t. Like that dude, he’s not here, Marcus, whatever his name is, I’ve done way too much for this f*cking city to be treated like this. Done way too f*cking much. “But, like I said, I wish I was as lucky as other ones, but that doesn’t mean that I’m not doing whatever it takes to be out there, which I’m gonna be here pretty soon.” Earlier this week, the NBA fined the Sixers $100,000 for how it approached the Embiid injury situation."

	Come get these winners.","Week 9 of the NFL season is here, and that means the halfway point of the campaign has arrived. Eight weeks are in the books. Eight weeks are still to come. And here we are in the middle. In this space, the first half of the season was not at all kind on the whole, but we did post a winning record in Week 8. Perhaps that is a sign of things to come. At least I will tell myself that until Week 9. Before getting to the five-pack of selections, let’s take stock.  Come get these winners. We’re going back to the Jameis train after an outright win a week ago. I do like the Browns as a standalone investment at +1.5, but the teaser is even more appealing against a low-octane Chargers offense in a game with a very modest total. On the other side, the Bengals burned us a week ago, but this is a good spot for Cincinnati at home in what amounts to a virtual must-win. This is a tail of UPROXX colleague and editor Robby Kalland and I like it quite a bit. NFC South overs might be a principle until it falls off, and Carolina’s defense is just as bad as it seems to be. Take us there, Derek Carr. The Eagles have won three in a row and all is right with the world again, right? Well, I don’t quite buy it yet. Jacksonville isn’t very good, which I will acknowledge, but the Jags have played at a much higher level in recent weeks, including in Week 8 against Green Bay. I like this above 7. In the interest of transparency, I nabbed this at 3 earlier in the week, but that line is gone now outside of opportunities to buy the half-point. Alas, I still like it at 2.5. Detroit has the best point differential in the league and things are rolling, but I’m a bit skeptical of the Lions defensively right now and, perhaps more importantly, this is the first trip outdoors for Jared Goff and the offense this season. The Bucs are very banged-up, which is part of why this line is where it is. With that said, I think Tampa Bay is the side against a Chiefs offense that is still figuring things out. Kansas City is unbeaten and rightly so, but the Chiefs haven’t exactly dominated from an ATS perspective when laying more than a touchdown. We were right against them in Week 8. Going back to the well here."

	Wemby recorded the second 5x5 game in just his 79th career game, making a bit of NBA history in the process.","Victor Wembanyama played in his 79th career NBA game on Thursday night in Utah, as the Spurs came back from an early 11-point deficit to blowout the Jazz, 106-88. Last year’s Rookie of the Year led the way on both ends of the floor for San Antonio as he often does, and he made a bit of NBA history along the way.  For the second time in his young career, the 20-year-old Frenchman posted a 5×5 performance, with 29 points, 10 rebounds, six assists, five steals, and five blocks, and in doing so, he became just the third player in NBA history to record multiple 5×5 games in his career, alongside Hakeem Olajuwon (6) and Andrei Kirilenko (3). 🚨Victor Wembanyama with an UNREAL 5×5 night 🚨 🔥25 Points🔥9 Rebounds🔥7 Assists🔥5 Steals🔥5 Blocks pic.twitter.com/hYXbfSWR4e — NBA TV (@NBATV) November 1, 2024  To be third all-time in anything in the NBA at 20 years old is insane, and he certainly has set a pace where he figures to obliterate Olajuwon’s record of 5×5 performances. Given that Olajuwon is one of the all-time great two-way players, that’s pretty terrific company for Wemby — and Kirilenko is one of those guys that was perhaps a bit ahead of his time as a do-it-all wing. What’s still terrifying is that Wembanyama is still figuring a lot of things out at the NBA level, particularly how to consistently reach his ceiling offensively given he’s already one of the league’s best defensively. Once he gets comfortable with where his spots are on the court and starts to trim the fat, so to speak, with his shot diet and pick up the efficiency on that end, there’s just not going to be anything you can really do with him."

	The catch drew immediate comparisons to Odell Beckham Jr.'s famous catch against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014.","For all the questions that surround the New York Jets right now, one thing that is pretty clear is that the team’s top receivers are capable of doing some incredible things. Davante Adams has been a monster throughout his NFL career, while Garrett Wilson is one of the brightest young stars at the position in the league. And on Thursday night when the Jets desperately needed one of their two standouts on the outside to make a player, he answered with a catch that drew immediate comparisons to Odell Beckham Jr.’s famous catch against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. On third-and-19 from deep in Houston Texans territory, Aaron Rodgers looked Wilson’s way and fired towards the back of the end zone. Wilson went up against Kamari Lassiter, created a little separation, and plucked the ball out of the air with one hand. Unfortunately for him, it looked like he only got one foot down, but then, replay stepped in.  (after review) HOLY ONE-HAND GARRETT FREAKING WILSON TOUCHDOOOOOWN❕❕❕#HOUvsNYJ on @NFLonPrime pic.twitter.com/htLVwK7TA6 — New York Jets (@nyjets) November 1, 2024  When this was slowed down, it was determined that Wilson’s left shin landed inbounds before his knee landed out of bounds, which meant that he was considered in and scored a touchdown. The Jets really needed this, as it put them ahead of the Texans in a game they absolutely have to win if they want to keep their playoff hopes alive, but more importantly, everyone who saw it got to say that they witnessed one of the greatest one-handed snags in NFL history on a night when the Jets also did this."

	Banchero will be evaluated in 4-6 weeks.","Paolo Banchero has been spectacular to start the 2024-25 NBA season. The former No. 1 overall pick has looked like the face of the franchise the Orlando Magic have sought for years, which included a 50-point outing in a win over the Indiana Pacers earlier this week. Unfortunately for the Magic, they’ll have to navigate at least the next month without their star forward. In a bit of news announced by Shams Charania of ESPN that the team confirmed not long after, Banchero suffered a torn oblique late in the team’s 102-99 loss to the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday evening, which will sideline him indefinitely, and he will not be evaluated again for 4-6 weeks. “After undergoing further testing today in Cleveland, Orlando Magic forward Paolo Banchero has been diagnosed with a torn right oblique, President of Basketball Operations Jeff Weltman announced today,” the team said in a statement. “Banchero will be out indefinitely and his return to play will depend on how he responds to treatment. He will be re-evaluated in four-to-six weeks. Banchero suffered the injury during the fourth quarter of Orlando’s game at Chicago on Oct. 30.” It’s hard to put into words just how big of a loss this is for Orlando, which had aspirations of building on last year’s fifth-place finish in the East. While it’ll be impossible to completely replace Banchero — who has averaged 29 points, 8.8 rebounds, and 5.6 assists in 36.4 minutes per game this year — much will presumably be asked of Franz Wagner and Jalen Suggs to carry the team in his absence."

	The ball rolled out of the back of an end zone, meaning it was a touchback and went to the Texans.","The New York Jets keep holding on to any little bit of hope that they can turn their season around and reach the heights they aspired towards when the year began, and on Thursday Night Football this week, they had a chance to pick up a win against the Houston Texans, which are considered one of the up-and-coming teams in the AFC. Their defense had a good opening quarter, and after some difficult drives for the offense, it looked like they were able to finally get on the board when Malachi Corley took an end around in for a touchdown. The problem: Even live, it looked like Corley might have pulled a DeSean Jackson and dropped the ball before he crossed the goal line. The bad news was that, yes, he did that. The considerably worse news was that because the ball rolled out of the back of the end zone, this became a touchback, and possession went to Houston. What we thought was a Jets TD… is a touchback! Houston ball 😳#HOUvsNYJ on Prime VideoAlso streaming on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/D3liGAROrt — NFL (@NFL) November 1, 2024  All New York needed was for this to not roll out of the end zone and they would have gotten the ball at the spot where Corley dropped it, which was about two inches out of the end zone.

It’s not ideal for a team that has aspirations of making it back to the Eastern Conference Finals, but it’s still very early in the season, and as we saw last year, when this team gets hot, they can take it to anyone. Their best player to this point has been Pascal Siakam, who has looked like the exact sort of star forward the team envisioned when they acquired him midway through last season and especially after they handed him a lucrative contract extension this summer. And with the Pacers having an off night on Thursday before a matchup with the Pelicans in New Orleans on Friday, Siakam decided to have a little fun away from the court by dressing up for Halloween as Andre 3000 in the video for “Hey Ya!”  A post shared by Pascal Siakam (@pskills43)  It is an absolutely fantastic costume, but Siakam wanted to take things a step farther. Not only did he dress up like 3 Stacks, he actually recreated a portion of the iconic music video.  A post shared by Pascal Siakam (@pskills43)  Halloween isn’t necessarily a competition among NBA players or anything like that, but it is always fun to see the lengths guys will go to in order to have the most elaborate costume. I think we can safely say that, as of this point, Siakam has set the bar pretty high for the best costume in the league this year."

While they’ve taken their time developing the second edition of his signature sneaker, the AE1 has continued to be a hit and they’ve continued to support it with new colorways in both lowtops and midtops, and a tremendous ad campaign.  They’ve steered into Ant’s bravado and authentic personality with the campaign, which is largely why it’s been such a hit. Recently, they put Ant on a lie detector test and for Halloween they cooked up something special for Ant with kids telling ghost stories about “the scariest player in the game.”   A post shared by adidas Basketball (@adidasbasketball)  It’s a refreshingly simple campaign built around one of the NBA’s best personalities and players, and having kids tell ghost stories around a camp fire about what “the Ant Man” does to opponents on the court is just a great Halloween addition. Edwards certainly doesn’t shy away from the expectations on him, and that only makes these better as he’s not afraid to proclaim himself the best in the game. Eventually, he’ll have to find the team success to back that up, but for now he’s enjoying the climb and adidas is doing an incredible job creating something authentic around their star."

	An NFC North showdown headlines this week of games in the NFL, as the AFC and NFC have wildly different playoff races.","As we arrive at the midway point of the 2024 NFL season, and there are very different vibes in the NFC and AFC when it comes to the playoff race. In the AFC, the top teams have already separated from the pack. There are really only nine teams that qualify as “in the hunt” for the seven playoff spots, with the Bills, Chiefs, and Texans in commanding leads already in their divisions. In the NFC, it’s much more condensed with 11 teams at .500 or better and two more teams at 3-4. Only the Saints, Panthers, and Giants feel firmly out of the hunt, and no team holds more than a 1-game advantage in their division. As we shift towards the second half of the season, we’ll have to see if anyone can create separation in the NFC, while in the AFC, we might know the seven playoff teams by Christmas.  It’s not the best primetime slate this week, but Monday Night Football will bring the game that has the most potential for fun. The Bucs have been in shootouts seemingly every week, with six of their eight games finishing with point totals of 49 or more, including last week when both Mike Evans and Chris Godwin were out. Now, they welcome in an undefeated Chiefs team that has been dragging teams into the mud each week and asking them to out-execute Patrick Mahomes and company late in games. No one’s been able to do that yet, and if there were ever a time for the Chiefs offense to breakout for a big scoring week, it’s against a Bucs team that is giving up a ton of points this season.  The NFC North is the best division in football by a healthy margin, and the best game of the week pits the top two teams in that division against each other. The Lions have been an absolute buzzsaw, but Jared Goff tweaked an ankle in practice and we’ll have to see if that has any impact on his movement on Sunday. The Packers, meanwhile, just keep finding ways to win games. It’s not always pretty, but here they are at 6-2 and can move into first in the division with a win over Detroit. I expect a fun one in Lambeau, where the elements might play a role, as the forecast calls for a high of 51, rain, and winds at 14 miles per hour.  If you’re a fan of defense, this is the game for you this week. The Browns defense held the Ravens explosive offense to 24 last week and there’s suddenly some juice in Cleveland with Jameis Winston under center on offense. The Chargers, meanwhile, have been the stingiest defense in football this season, allowing just 13 points per game and are fully committed to playing Har-ball on offense, which is to say, running the ball and working clock. I’m not sure this will be a game that you’ll want to lock in on for all 60 minutes, but I do expect it to be tight in the fourth quarter and watching both of these offenses trying to score in crunch time should be fascinating and/or hilarious to watch.  Deshaun Watson has never thrown for a 300 yard game as a member of the Browns and Jameis Winston stepped in and did that in his first game starting, throwing for 337 yards and three touchdowns to beat the rival Ravens (and lead the league in passing for the week). Now, it should be said that, being Jameis, he did actively try to throw multiple interceptions that the Ravens dropped (including one by Kyle Hamilton that would’ve won the game for Baltimore), but that’s all part of the experience. Having a quarterback with some life in his arm and a willingness to trust a read and throw it was all it took for the Browns offense to come back to life.  We will be betting NFC South Overs until proven otherwise. We smashed it last week in Falcons-Bucs and we’re going right back to the well with Saints-Panthers. The Saints went over this number by themselves in Week 1 against Carolina, and while I know neither of these offenses have looked great of late, their defenses are both bad enough to give up points — especially the Panthers. The only teams not to score 28 on the Panthers this season are the Chargers and Raiders (who both still scored 26 and 22 respectively), and those two teams actively hate the concept of scoring points. Derek Carr is back and I know Saints fans don’t love him, but he can carve up this Panthers team and I expect New Orleans to get into the 30s and for Carolina to do enough themselves to take us home."

	LaMelo getting terrified by a creepy clown and then knocking its head off is the best NBA Halloween video of the year.","The Hornets picked up their second win of the season on Wednesday night, beating the Raptors 138-133 in a shootout in Charlotte. That win to get the team back to .500 early in the year had vibes high on Thursday morning in the Hornets facility, where the win seemed to have made some forget what holiday it was.  On Halloween every year, teams in the NBA and NFL love to set up their players for a jump scare that they can capture on social media. At this point, a lot of players keep their guard up when they arrive at the facility on Halloween, but LaMelo Ball did the opposite and strolled through the Hornets facility singing and happy right until he walked through a door and was greeted by a creepy clown.   A post shared by Charlotte Hornets (@hornets)  The transition from singing “waaayyyy up I feel blessed” to a blood-curdling shriek to slapping the head off of the clown while yelling “boy, what the F**K” is incredible. It’s a good thing this was just a doll and not a person in a costume, cause they would’ve had to go into concussion protocol after LaMelo got done with them. The Hornets staffer cackling only makes this video better as poor LaMelo lays down on the stairs to try to get his heart rate back down, and I bet he’ll never be trusting of that walk to the practice court again."

	Kansas City is reportedly in contention to get the W's next team as it continues to expand.","Three new teams are slated to come to the WNBA over the next two years. The Golden State Valkyries will kick off their inaugural season in 2025, while teams in Toronto and Portland are coming to the league in 2026. While this would bring the league up to 15 teams, WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert has expressed that she wants the WNBA to have 16 teams by 2028, and there are plenty of cities that make a ton of sense as this round of expansion gets wrapped up. Apparently, Kansas City is one such place, and a group spearheaded by Patrick and Brittany Mahomes is working to get the WNBA to come to their city. According to Adam Schefter of ESPN, the pair met with the league along with the rest of the ownership group of the KC Current, the city’s NWSL team. “As WNBA expansion continues, ownership of the NWSL’s KC Current — which includes Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany — has met with the WNBA and is in contention to bring the league’s next franchise to Kansas City,” Schefter said. “Mahomes also co-owns the KC Royals and Sporting KC.” There’s no word on a potential timetable for when the league will announce its 16th team. As for what’s next on the expansion horizon, the Valkyries will build out their roster via an expansion draft in December."

	The voices in The Viper's head? Well, those would be Megan Thee Stallion, Cardi B, GloRilla, and other female rappers when he's in the gym.","There are few things more important to getting a good workout in than having the right playlist. Having the right soundtrack is vital for most people to getting maximum output, and sometimes what you need in the gym varies by what you’re doing — for example, cardio and weights might need different genres.  Everyone’s taste is a bit different, which is why there’s few things worse than forgetting headphones when going to the gym and having to listen to whatever they’ve got playing over the speakers. That is, unless you have your own fully built out home gym and can pick the music blasting through the speakers, as is the case for WWE superstar Randy Orton. The 44-year-old has been in WWE for more than two decades, and he looks like the kind of guy that is likely playing something pretty heavy in the gym.  However, as he recently explained to Sheamus in his home gym, he goes to a different genre and is far more up to date on his playlist than you’d expect. The Viper is all about the ladies when it comes to the gym, explaining that he has “an extensive female rap artist playlist” rattling off everyone from Megan Thee Stallion to GloRilla and fellow St. Louis native (and WWE fan) Sexxy Red.   A post shared by WWE (@wwe)  It’s clearly not the answer Sheamus was expecting, but as Orton explained, “they get my blood pumpin, what can I say.” I think my only follow-up questions would be what did Randy used to listen to in the gym back in the day and when was he introduced to some of these artists, because he’s been in the gym for decades and I’d be fascinated to know when he figured out that Cardi B and Nicki Minaj got the blood going and the muscles firing in just the right way."

	Durant is certainly the caliber of player that could get a statue, but he knows his nomadic NBA life takes him out of the running.","Dwyane Wade’s new statue outside the Kaseya Center in Miami has garnered a lot of conversation, unfortunately much of it making fun of how it looks nothing like Wade, but it has also sparked some discussion of who will be next to get a statue in the NBA.  LeBron James in Cleveland and Stephen Curry in Golden State are locks, but the other top star from their generation doesn’t expect to end up with a statue anywhere. Kevin Durant is a surefire Hall of Famer with a pair of championships and an MVP award, but he’s been something of a basketball nomad over his career and explained to Kay Adams on “Up and Adams” that, despite Wade saying he deserves a statue, he “highly doubts” that happens. .@KDTrey5 on Kay and D-Wade saying he deserves his own statue one day…  ""I highly highly doubt I get a statue of me put anywhere for playing basketball… It's usually those guys that got the HOF career, with championships, you been with one city for a long time. That's not… pic.twitter.com/QcyOZf3TZl — Up & Adams (@UpAndAdamsShow) October 30, 2024  Durant is nothing if not pragmatic, and he knows that statues are reserved for those with extended runs as the face of a franchise that have own. His longest tenured stop was in Oklahoma City, but he didn’t deliver the Thunder a title and left on bad terms with the organization, bolting for the rival Warriors — and if anyone’s getting a statue in OKC, it’s Russell Westbrook. He won a pair of titles and Finals MVP awards in Golden State, but spent just four years there on a team with Curry as the established face of the franchise. His time in Brooklyn didn’t go according to plan, and he joined a Suns team that, even if they go on to win a championship or two, would build a Devin Booker statue before a Durant one.  I appreciate that Durant doesn’t try to act like this would be some great injustice, but simple states it as a matter of fact. It is, in a way, the price he’s paid for his journey, but he’s also been highly successful at just about every stop, even if some have fallen short of the loftiest expectations. He’ll be good with his Hall of Fame plaque and the respect of his peers, even as his colleagues will surely be getting immortalized in bronze in San Francisco and Cleveland in the not too distant future."

	We caught up with Bronson Reed about his his Crown Jewel match against Seth Rollins and how he's elevated his career in WWE.","Every WWE star is looking for their breakout moment. Occasionally that happens when momentum builds with the support of fan involvement, a spoken line in a segment catches fire, or the visual of an instance transcends the moment to become an iconic image. But sometimes, it’s simply serendipity, where suddenly everything connects in ways that even the superstars don’t anticipate. For Bronson Reed, attacking Seth Rollins wasn’t enough of a statement just two months ago. The 300-pound Aussie dropped Tsunami after Tsunami on The Visionary as the audience roared and social media was set ablaze. Eventually, Reed left Rollins laid out in the middle of the ring after landing six Tsunamis. That moment was a turning point for Reed as he transcends to the main event of Monday Night Raw with hopes of claiming an elusive world title.  “The Austin 3:16 promo is one of those pivotal moments that, unfortunately, not everyone has that one moment in their career where things sort of change,” Reed tells Uproxx Sports. “I feel like the six Tsunamis is that for me. Since then it has been different, and I’m going in the right direction that I want to be. Hopefully I can keep that momentum up and we will look back at the six Tsunamis as that turning point. But now it’s making sure that I deliver in the match (at Crown Jewel). We’ve had all the attacks and everything with Seth and now it’s about actually delivering an in-ring match that’s worthy of a (PLE).” As Becky Lynch once told me, these moments are when preparation meets opportunity. The pressure has built for Reed over the last two months after his crushing beatdown of Rollins. He’s continued to be a highlight of weekly episodic television with viral moments, whether he’s smashing Braun Strowman on a car or forcing a table to explode five feet into the air. As Reed prepares for arguably the biggest match of his career on Saturday against Rollins at Crown Jewel, he isn’t getting caught up in the pressure that comes with rising up the card though. He understands the path to the top, and he’s built confidence in his in-ring abilities over the span of about half of his life at this point.  “I think a lot of people, when they have these moments, they want the trajectory just to go straight up,” Reed says. “But in our business, it’s definitely more of a roller coaster. You’re always going to have those highs and lows, but it’s just trying to make sure whenever you have those highs that you deliver. Those things start adding up and it’s not just this one pivotal moment. It’s all these things building up together. So that’s what I’m trying to do is have a body of work where you can go, ‘Oh, look at everything that he did in the year.’” The journey to Saturday’s showdown has been one with plenty of bumps along the way. After being released from WWE in 2021, Reed spent just a year away before his return. During his time away, Reed says it was one of those moments that reaffirmed his love of wrestling.  “I think it’s a good thing to learn that you still have passion for the business that you love. I’ve always been a huge wrestling fan and I’ve loved it since I was a kid. And I feel like something like this could crush certain people and they might not ever wrestle again or they might do something else,” Reed says. “But it was one of those moments where I’m like, ‘I love this. I’m not going to change what I do.’ But it was reassuring to me that I can do this elsewhere, that I can be a commodity elsewhere. So in the hands of WWE, I should be an even bigger commodity. And I kept that in my mind coming back.” Continuing to build his confidence in and outside of WWE has helped Reed reach the next level. In his return, he needed to be patient before his time to step into the spotlight would come. He says it was good that he wasn’t propelled right away into a prominent position, rather it was a slow burn where he was able find his feet, understand who he is, and turn the volume on his character all the way up.  He’s not overthinking things. He’s simply creating chaos.  “I’ve realized that in the moment, just to go with what I think will work and generally that’s been working for me,” Reed says. “But also I feel like the Bronson Reed character, you can have more fun with it because I’m a big, indestructible sort of guy that just goes out there and destroys things, almost a Godzilla-like figure. And I remember seeing a quote from an artist, I don’t remember who, and they said ‘I don’t create art, I create chaos.’ And that’s what I think of every time when I step through the curtain is Bronson Reed isn’t here to create five-star wrestling matches, he is here to create chaos.” Following in the footsteps of pro wrestling’s great big men, Reed is moved by comparisons to the likes of Bam Bam Bigelow and Big Van Vader, who he says he’s drawn inspiration from. While WWE has historically been the land of giants, the amount of monster big men who move the way Reed does reaching the top of the mountain are few and far between. For Reed, that’s the long-term goal, breaking the mold and claiming WWE’s top crown.  “These guys were never the champion. You look back at history, Vader never became WWE champion, Bam Bigelow never reached those heights. Those people in the same sort of body type that I am, even a Dusty Rhodes was not a WWF champion at the time,” Reed says.  “So I want to break that mold and eventually, I’ve told people, I want to be world heavyweight champion. I want to be WWE champion. I remember speaking to Mark Henry and he was telling me obviously he had a great career, he became champion and he said, ‘This doesn’t happen for guys like us all the time, so make sure you keep doing what you’re doing, give it a hundred percent and you’ll be that next big man.’”"

He even found creative ways to bring together football and music, like his 2011 track “Green & Yellow” which was an homage to the Green Bay Packers. In 2016, he created “No Mercy” which was Shannon Sharpe and Skip Bayless’ theme song on Undisputed.

ESPN reports that the rookie NBA player will make his debut with the minor league squad in a Saturday exhibition against Salt Lake City. However, Bronny will be on the Lakers roster for their game on Friday, squaring off against the underperforming Philadelphia 76ers. 
	Sources close to the Lakers state that Bronny will only play for South Bay during their home games. James will then “shuttle” between both teams during an undisclosed period of time. While it may come as a shock to some fans, Lakers head coach JJ Redick explained that this was the plan they had for Bronny “since day one.” 
	Bronny James’ situation isn’t unique to him, either. As he was selected to the Lakers with the 55th pick of the 2024 NBA Draft, it was expected that he would get some burn in the G League. Historically speaking, players selected late in the second tend to spend time in the minor league to get additional coaching, structure in their respective team’s culture, and gain game reps.

	








 A post shared by South Bay Lakers (@southbaylakers) 
	Bronny James has only played in four games this season for the Los Angeles Lakers out of the eight games so far. The Lakers are currently 10th in the Western Conference with their 4-4 record.

	“I think many people want to blame others for their problems without realising they are a part of their own story and they can redirect their life at any time. But that’s only possible if you’re honest with yourself about how you got to where you are now.” 
	Elsewhere in the interview, Tyson opened up about his usage of testosterone, attacking the stigma placed around the hormone and those who take it for health and wellness. 
	“I think there is this misconception that if men take testosterone it’s because physically there is something wrong with them,” the 58-year-old said, adding that an insufficient level of the hormone has been shown to alter one’s mind-state and emotions. 
	“But from the age of 30, I don’t care how healthy you are, your testosterone levels drop. This affects more than just your physicality, it also affects your mood,” he reasoned. “Getting a testosterone plan as you age should be as normal for a man as taking a daily supplement in my opinion, because it does so much to stabilize the body and mind.”

	Joel Embiid’s suspension will force him to miss Wednesday night’s game against the Los Angeles Clippers (Nov. 6), Friday’s game against the Los Angeles Lakers (Nov. 8) and Sunday’s matchup with the Charlotte Hornets (Nov. 10).

Take DeMar DeRozan for example, whom he went back-and-forth with at the recent Toronto Raptors and Sacramento Kings game. 
	The 38-year-old rapper was courtside at Scotiabank Arena on Saturday evening (Nov. 2,) as he often is, but it was a special occasion this time; Vince Carter became the first former Raptors player to have his number retired by the franchise.

	Footage showed him and longtime friend Chubbs standing up and glaring at DeRozan, a former Raptors player, when he was on the court. At one point, in true Drizzy fashion, he got on the commentary microphone and spoke with the game’s announcers. “If you ever put up a DeRozan banner, I’ll go up there and pull it down myself,” he said during an interview. At another point in the evening, when discussing the significance of VC’s jersey retirement, the 6 God said “Unfortunately, we’re playing this goof [DeRozan] tonight, but it is what it is.”

	DeMar DeRozan had a chance to be the hero and send the game into overtime with a game-tying three-pointer, but he missed the shot. As the Sacramento Kings and Toronto Raptors players exited the court, Drake could be seen mouthing “F**k outta here, pussy.” 
	In the post-game press conference, reporters asked the six-time All-Star for his thoughts on the Toronto rapper saying he would pull his banner down if the Raptors ever gave him one. “Well he gon’ have a long way to climb to take it down, so tell him good luck,” DeRozan said before exiting the podium. 
	Later that evening on his Instagram story, the Compton-born hooper responded to the situation with a clip from Ice Cube and Chris Tucker’s 1995 movie Friday. “Man sit yo a** down,” Cube’s character Craig told Tucker’s character Smokey as the antagonist, Deebo, left their presence. “Man, I got mind control over Deebo,” Smokey said in response. “He be like ‘Shut the f**k up.’ I be quiet. But when he leave, I be talkin’ again.” The clip was especially fitting as Friday is set in South Central Los Angeles, near Compton, where DeRozan and Kendrick Lamar are from.

	This begs the question: Why is Drake angry at DeMar DeRozan, one of the best players ever to don the Toronto Raptors’ jersey, who spent nine seasons with the team and was on record being his good friend? It all goes back to his feud with Kendrick Lamar a few months ago. In June, when K. Dot held his concert The Pop Out in Los Angeles, DeRozan was captured on stage dancing to “Not Like Us.” He doubled down in July when he appeared in the music video for the track. 
	The 35-year-old hooper had been asked about his relationship with the For All The Dogs rapper following the two appearances and assured people that he still had love for him. “Love Drake, always can play him,” he told FOX40 when asked if he could still play Drake’s music following his feud with the Pulitzer Prize winner. “[But] Kendrick been a friend of mine—Damn near family, we both from the same city. Grew up damn near in the same neighborhood, but it’s always been there, it hasn’t been always publicized, but that’s basically family.”  
	Kendrick Lamar made this clear on “Not Like Us,” when he rapped “I’m glad DeRoz’ came home, y’all didn’t deserve him neither,” referring to DeRozan joining the Sacramento Kings this past summer after stints with the Raptors, San Antonio Spurs, and Chicago Bulls.

	In another interview, DeRozan doubled down and stated that they are still friends, but he did what he did for the culture. “Drake’s still my man, still my man, none of it changed,” he told The Sacramento Bee. “It’s so easy to get overlooked and look at it for what it looks like, but at the end of the day it’s music, entertainment. Two of the biggest rappers in the world went at it from a competitive standpoint and they battled it out.” 
	As for being at The Pop Out and in the “Not Like Us” music video, Derozan said: “It was fun to be a part of. For that moment, it was so much bigger than what people look at it as a beef between (Lamar) and Drake. It brought our whole city together in a different type of light where there wasn’t no issues, no violence. Everybody was coming together in a peaceful manner and that was the beauty out of those moments.”

	








 
	Given the fact DeRozan was one of the people Drake unfollowed on Instagram over these last few months, it is safe to believe that Drake felt betrayed; especially by someone whom he comforted in a difficult time. DeRozan spoke with Shannon Sharpe on a 2021 episode of Club Shay Shay about being traded from the Toronto Raptors to the San Antonio Spurs in 2018.  
	DeMar DeRozan was devastated, especially after being told he would not be traded, and the five-time Grammy winner welcomed him into his home to talk for hours. “When it come to him, he’ll forever have a friend in me and loyalty out of me because he cared,” DeRozan told Shannon Sharpe. “He was there for me when everything was just going crazy.”   Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox"
Sports,Angel Reese Asserts She Can “Afford” Her Bills Now With Reebok Contract,https://www.vibe.com/news/sports/angel-reese-can-afford-bills-reebok-contract-1234936258/,"Fri, 25 Oct 2024 20:51:47 +0000",The joke comes after she revealed that her WNBA salary barely covers her expenses.,"Angel Reese has made it clear that she can pay her monthly bills just fine — especially since she’s now extended her contract with Reebok.  
	The Chicago Sky star will continue her relationship with the sports apparel brand while also releasing a signature sneaker, according to ESPN’s Shams Charania as of Thursday (Oct. 24). Reese initially signed with Reebok last year while attending LSU. 
	Following the news, Reese took to X to joke that she can now “afford her bills.” The quip comes after she revealed that her WNBA salary doesn’t cover her $8,000 rent and barely covers her car note. 
	Reese reportedly made $73,439 in her rookie season as the No. 7 overall pick of the 2024 WNBA draft. Besides her base pay, the 22-year-old has also signed a slew of endorsements, including Raising Cane’s, Topps, Airbnb, Tampax and Beats by Dre. She also recently dropped her Unapologetically Angel podcast where she’s already seen much traction for her past guests including Kayla Nicole, Shaquille O’Neal, GloRilla and more.

	








 
	Additionally, with Reese’s sneaker gearing up to release under Reebok, that’s sure to bring in much revenue for the company, as well. 
	“I’m extremely excited to let you guys know that we are officially coming out with a Reebok by Angel signature shoe,” she said in a statement, per Bleacher Report. “We’ve already kicked off the design process, and it means the world to me to have Reebok’s full support and confidence with this shoe and overall partnership.” Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox"

	During an appearance alongside Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton on the Young Man and the Three podcast, the former United States President aired his grievances regarding the NBA All-Star Game, which has drawn increasing criticism in recent years. 
	According to Obama, concern of players geting injured during the star-studded game are overblown, as many of those same players regularly participate in summer leagues and offseason runs that are intense without being overtly physical.

	








 
	“Y’all gotta have a little more pride in that All-Star Game,” the 63-year-old told Haliburton, a two-time All-Star himself.

	“It’s not as if you all don’t play pickup during the summers. You know how to play in a way that, ‘Alright, I’m not going to hurt anybody, I’m not going to take anybody out.’ But that All-Star Game, it’s broke, man.” 
	The avid basketball fan continued, comparing current players’ lack of physical exertion with that of greats from past eras. “Like, people just like not running,” Obama continued. “Everybody just trying all kinds of… it used to be when Kobe and Michael and Isaiah and those guys were playing, man. I mean they weren’t playing the way they did regular season, but they wanted to win.” 
	Obama also lamented the perception the All-Star game gives off to casual fans, who may otherwise be inclined to tune into other games during the season, but decide not to. “It insults the game,” the former Senator added.  
	“This is your business. This is your product. You don’t want people thinking you’re all out there just half-a**ed.” Obama concluded his rant by declaring that he will no longer be watching the NBA All-Star Game if no changes are made in the near future. 
	“Y’all need to do something because I ain’t watching that thing no more,” the avid basketball fan warned,   a sentiment that has been echoed by others regarding the NBA All-Star Game activities as a whole.

	It all went down with 4 minutes left in the second quarter as LeBron returned to the court and Bronny checked into the exhibition for the first time that night. The duo received a standing ovation from the Staples Cen—err, Crypto.com Arena, as both of the athletes tore off their warm-ups and took the floor. Bronny finished the game with 0 points and attempted two shots, while his pops finished with 16 points in the evening.

	“That moment, us being at the scorer’s table together and checking in together, something I will never forget,” LeBron told ESPN during a post-game presser. “No matter how old I get, no matter how my memory may fade as I get older or whatever, I will never forget that moment.” 
	“I tried not to focus on everything that was going on around me and tried to focus on going in as a rookie and not trying to mess up,” Bronny told the media. “But yeah, I totally did feel the energy, and I appreciate the Laker Nation for showing the support for me and my dad.” LeBron James, Ken Griffey Sr., Bronny James, and Ken Griffey Jr. ? pic.twitter.com/hprJFmfnQo 
	Leading up to the season opener, Bronny spoke with Men’s Health about his journey to the NBA and his health scare that almost derailed it. He expressed that he had to double down on his workouts and be more mindful of his body because he can’t afford to live a “normal” life anymore. 
	“I got real on top of my routines to get back to where I was,” detailed the 19-year-old. “I had to do breathing exercises and stuff. It was a total reset. I have to stay on top of my heart medications, and I got my heart pillow…My days aren’t normal anymore.

	On Tuesday (Oct. 22), ESPN released their latest cover story featuring the NBA and NFL stars, respectively, with the photo being a direct nod to legends Randy Moss and Kevin Garnett. Edwards and Jefferson rocked designer shades for their cover, but just as the Minnesota greats did before them, the duo showed respect to each other by donning each other’s jerseys. Behind the scenes of the cover story’s photoshoot showed Jefferson and Edwards bonding and cracking jokes, so much so, you wouldn’t even be able to tell that they went to rival SEC colleges.  
	The two quipped about possibly playing each other’s sport and what positions they’d play. Ant-Man asserted that he would be as big as the Baltimore Raven’s star runningback, Derrick Henry, if he hit the gym because right now he’s “lowkey fat for real.” BossMan Dlow’s “Get In With Me” could be heard soundtracking the visual experience, with the stars going aura for aura as they tried on outfits, flashed their grills, and debated about sports, of course.

	








 
	Meanwhile, the article component to the story followed the superstar’s eventual rise to become the new faces of Minnesota sports. ESPN’s story also explores the similarities between the two men, such as attending SEC colleges before being drafted into the NBA and the NFL in 2020. Regardless of the drip, the swag, and the talk about Randy and Kevin, the two spoke longingly about bringing a championship to Minnesota in their respective sports.

	On Wednesday (Oct. 16), Ball suited up for the Chicago Bulls’ preseason game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, marking a miraculous comeback after numerous knee surgeries and doubts that he would ever play in an NBA game again. 
	Limited to 15 minutes as part of a restriction as he eases himself back into game action, Ball was productive in his return, scoring 10 points on 4 of 6 shooting from the field.

	








 
	Prior to the game, Ball spoke about the effect his injury has had on his playing style and approach to the game. “It’s not the same body I started off with,” Ball said after the Bulls’ shootaround. “But I think I can still be productive and effective on the court. That’s why I’m still trying to play.”

	Ball was initially injured on Jan. 14, 2022 during a game against the Golden State Warriors, which the Bulls lost 138-86 in blowout fashion. The former No. 2 overall draft pick underwent three separate arthroscopic procedures on his left knee in the time since, including a rare double cartilage transplant in March 2023. 
	Ball touched on the struggles surrounding his lengthy recovery process, expressing his gratitiude for the journey, which he feels is now “behind” him.  
	“Long. Really long,” he said of his rehab. “But looking back on it, it went a lot faster than I thought. … Them telling me 18 more months recovery [after the third surgery], it sounds crazy in the moment, but now I’m here. It’s all behind me now.”

	








 
	Ball credited his comeback to his unwavering faith in himself, as well as his trust in the medical staff that assisted him throughout the process.  
	“I think it’s the belief in myself — knowing what I was feeling, knowing that I was a good age to come back from it,” the 26-year-old said. “I’m just trusting in the doctors and people around me.” Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox"
