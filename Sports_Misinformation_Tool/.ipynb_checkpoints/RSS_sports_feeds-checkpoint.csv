Now, redemption cards for complete sets of 1986-87 Fleer basketball are part of the 'Finale' of Jersey Fusion's ode to the original landmark product.","November 11, 2024 By Rich Mueller  Late last spring, cards from 50 complete sets of 1986-87 Fleer basketball and another hoard of 125 Michael Jordan rookie cards and stickers were put into a new product from Sportscards.com’s Jersey Fusion Line. Described as a years in the making “passion project” for company founder Bobby Poll, the Beckett encapsulated cards include small swatches of game-used gear used by the player on the card. Thousands of one card boxes were sold but six months later, the company has added some fresh content to the remaining inventory, including three redemption cards for fully PSA graded complete sets of cards and stickers, each with a Jordan rookie graded NM/MT 8.   The 1986-87 Fleer Jersey Fusion “Finale Edition” boxes also include a fourth redemption for a complete Jersey Fusion set of the 132 cards and 11 stickers that included the memorabilia pieces embedded in the holder. That set was originally pieced together by a collector who took advantage of the company’s offer last spring to trade it in for a game-worn, autographed 1991-92 Jordan jersey.  Sportscards.com is now giving that set back to the collecting community through the sales of the Finale edition. The product contains cards and memorabilia for all 131 players that were featured on the landmark Fleer set, which was the first in five years to be sold via wax packs.    At least three of the five boxes in a display case have autographed cards. Full cases contain six display cartons with a total of around 20 autographs. Some of the autographed cards carry inscriptions.  One of the biggest hits in the product One of the top pulls was an autographed Jordan rookie that carries a 9 autograph grade from Beckett and a portion of an NBA ‘Logoman’ patch from one of Jordan’s 1987-88 home uniforms. Other chase cards carry pieces of basketballs used in the NBA Finals.   Autographs from about 100 of the players in the set are possible, including Jordan, Julius Erving, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Charles Barkley and the late Bill Walton. A checklist that’s been pulled includes autographs of Erving, Bird and Johnson.  The back of each card in the product has a QR code on the reverse side that bring the collector to the site to see the original game-used  memorabilia item from which it was taken. Memorabilia used in the Jersey Fusion product came from jerseys, warm-ups, trunks, shoes, basketballs and even surfaces of NBA courts. Boxes and cases of the most recent edition are available here.  The previously released version, which still offers randomly packed Jordan rookie cards and stickers are still selling on eBay here.

Sports Collectors Daily,"After Tom Brady Signing Fiasco in Miami, Collectors Still Looking for Answers",https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/after-tom-brady-signing-fiasco-in-miami-collectors-still-looking-for-answers/,"Mon, 11 Nov 2024 03:29:39 +0000","Collectors who thought they could get a nice Tom Brady autograph on some valuable game-worn items and Super Bowl tickets are still frustrated, months after getting barely a scribble from the seven-time Super Bowl champ.","November 10, 2024 By Horacio Ruiz  More than six months after a much anticipated Tom Brady autograph signing in Miami, the collectors whose items were inked by Brady with an illegible scribble remain as disheartened, angry, and confused as the day it happened.  One collector is selling off his Brady collection, and another is trying to recoup some of his losses.  The entrance to Brad Jarrett’s house near Orlando, FL prominently featured his Brady memorabilia. The collection featured autographs and inscriptions on helmets, jerseys, and plaques. To Jarrett, Brady was a transcendent football player, but more importantly, a leader he hoped to emulate at his workplace.  “I’m still hurt by what happened at that event,” Jarrett told SC Daily. “I lost all my respect for Tom Brady.” What occurred at that event has been well documented. Brady was the keynote speaker for a business conference organized by EXMA Global, a marketing company specializing in leadership and development events.  As part of his appearance at the Watsco Center in Miami, Brady was contracted to sign about 100 items for patrons who paid $3,600 for a package deal that included Brady’s speech, a photo op and an autograph. The tickets also included a yacht tour of Downtown Miami and networking events at art galleries. Most of the attendees were there for business and networking opportunities and wouldn’t have requested Brady’s autograph on high value items.
 Before delivering a one-hour speech that the attendees praised, Brady was ushered into a room where the items collectors were hoping to have signed were located.  All were meticulously prepared for Brady by a local dealer named Salomon Lutwak. Instructions were placed by each item regarding where to sign with colored pens.    Lutwak, who lives in South Florida, wanted to get a Brady rookie card signed. He volunteered to prepare the items for the signing room because he was friends with many of the collectors in attendance.   When Brady entered the room, Lutwak was asked to leave by Brady’s handlers. When he returned, he couldn’t believe his eyes. Near the end of the speech, Lutwak approached Greg Nazareth, a friend of Jarrett’s, who was also at the conference.  “Bro, all the signatures look like s***,” Lutwak told Nazareth.  Lutwak recorded the room for 18 seconds, sending the clip to Nazareth, who then sent it to the other collectors. They were stunned.  One of the gems in Jarrett’s collection was a ticket from the 2000 NFL Draft, where Brady was famously picked 199th overall. It is one of a handful that are known to exist. From the moment he bought it, Jarrett knew it was the one item he wanted signed in person by Brady. He thought the signing session would be the time and place. He knew Brady’s signature wasn’t a work of art, but he expected it to be similar to others. As the event moved forward, Jarrett was unsure how his ticket had been signed. He didn’t see it in the short video circulating among the collectors. But he saw enough of the autographs on his friends’ items to get angry. He took the photo op to voice his displeasure directly with Brady.   “Tom, I saw the signatures, and it’s messed up what you did,” Jarrett recalls telling Brady. “It’s not right. I spent a lot of money on this.” He walked 30 feet off the stage, turned around, and found Brady staring at him.  “He looked at me like he was shocked I had said something,” Jarret said. “Or surprised that he impacted people with that autograph. I’m not really sure.
 “Brady just gave a great speech about effort and how when he started putting forward the effort in college, small gradual results started happening and that shaped him into giving 100% effort in everything he does. He just lied because he put 0% effort into his signing.”  Nazareth was next in line behind Jarrett, about nine feet away, when he saw Brady’s face. He brought the only known used Brady helmet in the hands of a collector to get signed – a Tampa Bay Buccaneers practice helmet. He considers himself lucky with the autograph he received.  “It wasn’t good,” said Nazareth of his autograph. “But it was better than some of the other crap I saw. Brady turned to [Brad] and gave him a look almost as if to apologize.” The events that unfolded in the room are still up for speculation, but what’s not up for debate is that Brady didn’t sign all the items with his customary autograph for some reason. Instead, some items were marked with a scribble that one would never have guessed came from the legendary quarterback. Brady is known to give a quick, shorthand autograph in large crowds, earning a moniker among collectors as Tornado Tom. However, in their opinion, most of the autographs were worse than those administered by Brady when in a rush.  Many of the items – rare collectibles and, in some instances, unique pieces – were no better off than if a child had taken a marker and scrawled across them.  It’s believed that Brady entered the room expecting to find items like copies of his book, “The TB12 Method,” and glossy photos to sign. Instead, he may have been taken aback to find rare one-of-a-kind items tracing the arc of his career and equipment he once wore on the field, like game-used Super Bowl balls, game-used cleats, the used practice helmet, and the NFL Draft ticket. Typically, Brady signs through Fanatics, with whom he has an exclusive autograph deal. Through Fanatics, Brady will sign items for $4,000. Game-used memorabilia carries a $10,000 fee. Many of the types of items he encountered that day would typically be channeled through Fanatics.  When Brady entered the signing room, he could have: Instead, Brady went with a fourth option, doling out an illegible scribble for many of the items that had been laid out for him. Brady did appear to sign some items in a condensed version that earned him the Tornado Tom nickname. But even those were few and mostly reserved for lower-end items like replica jerseys and pennants.  When Jarrett saw his autographed ticket, he was crushed. It looked a little better than the Super Bowl ticket Brady had signed for another collector, but not much. With his regular autograph, some items would have gone up in value by tens of thousands of dollars. “Tom is a smart guy, and he knows how much his signature adds to what items,” Jarrett said. “He doesn’t like people profiteering off him. If I was in his shoes, and there was all this collectible stuff, I’d be pissed too, but you don’t take it out on the fans. He could have not done it.” At the center of the dispute are the terms set by Brady’s representatives and EXMA Global Founder and CEO Fernando Anzures. Anzures admitted to not knowing much about the signing portion of the event. He sourced that responsibility to Fernando Regato, a sports collector based out of Mexico, who used the EXMA Conference as an opportunity to run his first-ever signing event.  It’s believed that Anzures sold the signing portion of the event to Regato and left it up to him to coordinate and iron out the details.  If the contract between EXMA Global and Brady included a clause about the type of items that could be signed, that wasn’t communicated to the collectors who attended.     Brady’s signing and photo op for the VIPs were a small portion of the EXMA Global Conference that ran through the weekend. However, to the collectors who bought the tickets for $3,600, the autograph opportunity was the primary draw. A handful of die-hard Brady collectors first learned about the signing on the Tom Brady Collectors Group on Facebook.  Derek Wagner, a high-end Brady collector for more than 20 years, was excited about flying to Miami to meet Brady and take a picture with him. He learned about signing on Facebook and became the liaison between himself and four other collectors, including Jarrett, Nazareth, and Regato.  “It was supposed to be one of the greatest times of my life,” Wagner told SC Daily. “How many people get to meet Tom Brady and get his autograph? He’s been my idol for 20-plus years.” The exact terms between Brady and EXMA are unknown, but it appears the seven-time Super Bowl champion wasn’t expecting to see a room with multiple high-value items.  “Regato was telling us any item would be signed,” Jarrett said. “We were wondering, ‘Is this for real?’ We asked a bunch of questions.” “I knew Brady is signed exclusively through Fanatics,” Nazareth said. “We knew he doesn’t do these public signings. But finally, enough of us bit, and we did the event.” Each $3,600 ticket would get one item signed. Wagner bought 15 tickets, six for him, one each for Jarrett and Nazareth, and seven tickets for two other collectors. He paid a portion of the tickets with a credit card and arranged with Regato to pay the remainder in cash. The cash came from Regato, who purchased two game-used Super Bowl balls from Wagner at the event. Regato included those two Super Bowl items in the signing, ironically receiving subpar Brady autographs.  The items Wagner submitted were:  In the aftermath, Anzures admitted to knowing less than he should have about the signing’s details. But he also pledged to make things right. Some wanted a full refund. Wagner filed a dispute with his credit card company, which Anzures did not fight. That resulted in a partial $1,900 refund for each ticket bought. However, Wagner says Regato never reimbursed him for the portion paid in cash.  The tickets were purchased under Wagner’s name, and he felt responsible for getting the money back for his friends.  “He straight up told me he doesn’t have it,” Wagner said of Regato. “He said, ‘I have $8,000 to my name and you can have it.’ I didn’t want $8,000. I wanted the entire thing refunded.” Anzures fully refunded some collectors who were trying to get rookie cards signed, according to USA Today, because Brady did not sign them due to his exclusive autographed card deal with Fanatics. Wagner says Regato told him that Anzures even refunded some collectors their flights and hotels. SC Daily contacted Anzures on multiple occasions, but he did not respond to our interview request.  After the event, Jarrett decided to write directly to Brady via his official Facebook and Instagram accounts.  “I was heartbroken when I saw pictures of the signatures before meeting you,” Jarrett wrote. “I hate admitting it as a grown man, but I was fighting back tears telling you this because I had envisioned the moment so differently. But I had to speak up for what I felt was right.” He wrote him about the 2000 NFL Draft ticket he had purchased less than a year before the signing.  “This ticket meant a lot to me. I had spent years hunting it down, and there have only been three known to come up. For me, this item represented that no matter where others rank you, you can turn yourself into greatness by hard work and dedication. I considered myself blessed that my prized possession wasn’t as messed up as others, but it still hurts, and I wish I had never attended this event.” Jarrett never heard back from anyone.  Wagner is a well-known collector and dealer in the northeast and Massachusetts. He had done various signings with former Red Sox and Patriots players. He reached out to multiple players who could help connect him with Brady, but no one was willing to try.  “Nobody was willing to give us a shot,” Wagner said. “I had never seen anything like it. It’s like they were scared of him.” Within a week of the event in Miami, Jarret, Nazareth and Wagner were referred to a Florida law firm with experience working cases involving celebrities. Over five months, Jarrett and Nazareth discussed scenarios where they sued Anzures and EXMA, Brady, or both. But Jarrett and Nazareth increasingly felt it would be a difficult case. After all, Brady had signed their items – and it would be difficult to argue any intentionally malicious destruction of property.  Ultimately, the firm wanted a $50,000 retainer plus a contingency fee from any monetary wins. The three men countered with a higher percentage for the contingency fee and lower retainer, but the firm declined.  At the same time, Wagner was talking to a prominent Boston-based lawyer. The lawyer agreed to work on a contingency basis, but after a month he told Wagner there wasn’t a case.  “The lawyer was working on it for a month, and he came up with three things we could go after him for, but then he said they’re not valid points,” Wagner said. “He said, ‘If this ever goes to court, there’s no case.’”  Now, it appears that a lawsuit won’t happen. “We were getting exhausted with what was going on,” Jarrett said. “At the time, Derek had made a deal with Goldin Auctions, where he was going to auction off all of the items that he had signed as long as he had consigned all the items with them.” Wagner still felt the weight of the responsibility for being the point person between the collectors and Anzures/Regato. While he was able to file a successful claim with his credit card company, the group was still down $26,000 from the trip to Miami.  Wagner was contacted by a representative from Goldin Auctions, who felt they could sell his six items for a premium, given the provenance from the Miami event and because of the controversial autographs on them. Goldin would give Wagner a bonus for consigning all six items from the signing with the auction house. Wagner would use the bonus to make everyone “whole” from the event and compensate for the cash that was never reimbursed. Wagner would also keep whatever amount the items sold for. But after three signed items were auctioned off in late September, Wagner broke the contract and pulled the other three items from being auctioned off. “They were very confident the items were going to sell for more than normal pieces because they were from this high-profile event,” Wagner said. “But they sold for all-time lows because the autographs clearly destroyed them.” A game-used cleat signed by Brady sold for $4,575, with a buyer’s premium. In all, Wagner says he lost $22,000 with the sale of the three items, including what he paid to get them signed.  “I signed a contract saying they would sell my other three items, and I broke the contract,” Wagner said. “My goal was to refund these other guys in full. I didn’t mind getting rid of my stuff to help everyone out. But I couldn’t keep taking that kind of beating.”  As a result, Goldin revoked the bonus. Wagner still has the Brady to Gronkowski Super Bowl ball, a Super Bowl 55 photo-matched game ball, and a game-used ball from the 2000 NFL Hall of Fame Game – Brady’s pro debut.  All the collectors remain baffled by what happened that day.  They wonder why Brady signed the way he did. Nazareth believes Brady didn’t know those items belonged to collectors but might have thought they belonged to the event organizers trying to take advantage of him.  “I think he knew exactly what he was doing,” Nazareth says. “I’ve followed Brady since he was in high school. He’s humble, he’s friendly, I think he genuinely cares about his fan base. The speech he gave for an hour was amazing and it’s stuff like that that makes me love the guy. I think he thought he might’ve been doing it to people who were trying to get one over him. Trust me, I was not trying to get one over him.”  A fan outside of the Watsco Center who did not attend the event was lucky enough to have a football signed with a nice autograph.  The ticket Jarrett was so eager to have signed by Brady is now in a closet, hidden in a bin along with other Brady programs and items. The ticket was sent to JSA for authentication, where three months after being sent, the autograph was authenticated.    “I am planning on holding onto the ticket for right now,” Jarrett says, “but I’m not really sure what I will do with it going forward. I’ve been slowly selling some of my smaller Brady items, but the collectible market is down right now. If I could break even on all my items, I would sell it all.” Wagner wants to know why Brady signed the way he did. He doesn’t want money or anything else signed; he just wants a direct answer.  “I have completely lost every ounce of respect I had for Brady, which is terrible because I was one of the biggest Brady collectors out there,” Wagner said. “I just want the stuff out of my house. I would love to know why he did that. Maybe he wasn’t trying to be an a-hole. I don’t know his side.  “As much as Tom is a celebrity and a GOAT, he’s human. He could’ve lost his temper. Just let us know what happened unless he was really out to get us, which I would find really hard to believe.” Horacio is an educator and writer living in Staten Island, NY.

The jersey has been photomatched to multiple games and bears numerous marks from use–even faint blood stains.  It was worn during a year in which Orr scored 122 points and led the Bruins to the Stanley Cup Final. The consignor is Patrick Schmautz, whose uncle Bobby Schmautz was acquired by the Bruins from the Vancouver Canucks on February 7th 1974. A young Patrick met Orr after a game when the superstar handed him the jersey, which was later signed by 22 men who played for the Bruins during the following season. The signatures, including Orr, Phil Esposito, Ken Hodge and Terry O’Reilly. Also part of the auction are items from the personal collection of Hall-of-Famer Phil Esposito, including his 1969-70 Stanley Cup ring and ’71-72 Stanley Cup championship trophy, a jersey from the 1975-76 season, his 700th goal stick, his last game-used stick from the 1980-81 season and over 30 additional items.  Thomas items include game-used sticks and masks from his time in the NHL and the US Olympic team.  In all, there are more than 1,600 lots being offered in the auction. One of the famous ‘eagle’ masks from Ed Belfour is part of a group consigned by the former goalie.  Another former netminder’s personal collection is on the block as well.  Carey Price has turned over some game-used equipment, bags and signed sticks from other NHL players. There are items from the career of Mats Naslund, including a 1986-87 Montreal Canadiens jersey, his 1986 NHL All-Star jersey and other pieces from the NHL and Swedish Olympic team. Mark Messier’s 1995-96 New York Rangers “500th goal” game-worn captain’s jersey is among dozens of other game jersey lots.  Among the trading card lots are 1979-80 O-Pee-Chee Wayne Gretzky rookie cards in various grades, a 1911-12 Imperial Tobacco Hockey C55 PSA-graded complete set and a 1962 Topps baseball set.

Sports Collectors Daily,1 of Few Surviving 1919 World Series Rings Consigned to Auction,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/1-of-few-surviving-1919-world-series-rings-consigned-to-auction/,"Sun, 10 Nov 2024 19:21:26 +0000",One of only a few known rings from the Reds-Black Sox World Series of 1919 is making its auction debut after consignment by the family of the Reds' shortstop.,"November 10, 2024 By Rich Mueller  It would become tainted by scandal, but the Cincinnati Reds weren’t about to let a championship go by without honoring those who made it happen.  Now, 105 years after it ended, a 1919 World Series ring has emerged and is on the auction block. Presented to shortstop Larry Kopf, the gold ring with a small diamond in the center, was a late consignment to next weekend’s Louisville Slugger Factory & Museum Auction by the Kopf family.  It’s expected to sell for $25,000-$50,000.   1919 World Series rings were originally created as 14k gold pins and are extremely rare.  Three, including one given to Kopf, were fashioned into rings. Championship rings didn’t become popular until later as they were associated more with women’s apparel at the time.  Kopf’s wife Erma wore the ring for many years and it has some moderate wear.  It has an inset diamond with a baseball field and “1919 World’s Champions” engraving. “The pin façade was then affixed atop a simple gold ring band with the perimeter of the top being slightly shortened and pin back removed during that same process,” Hunt Auctions notes in its auction description.  The Reds’ victory over the Chicago White Sox was an upset.  Gamblers struck a deal with members of the Sox to throw the series but after the deal soured, the Sox attempted to rally. However, the Reds emerged to win the first title in franchise history. Kopf was one of the better shortstops on the era. He played in all eight games of the series, collecting six hits, including a two-run triple in Game 2 and the go-ahead run in Game 4. Embed from Getty Images Hunt calls the ring “one of the most coveted baseball award scarcities of its type with relation to one of the most infamous events in the history of the game.” Bidding is open now and concludes this Saturday, with a live finale at the Louisville Slugger Factory & Museum.

Sports Collectors Daily,Veterans Day: Honoring Athletes Who Served,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/veterans-day-honoring-athletes-who-served/,"Sun, 10 Nov 2024 19:11:02 +0000","A look at a few athletes who put country, duty and honor ahead of sports and the cards we remember them by.","November 10, 2024 By Bob D'Angelo  As the United States honors its military veterans on this Veterans Day, it’s instructive to understand that some very real sacrifices were made by athletes to keep the country free. Some  paid with their lives; others sacrificed the primes of their athletic careers to serve in the military. Some are household names. Willie Mays, Joe DiMaggio and Jackie Robinson come to mind. Hank Greenberg was the first American League player to register for America’s first peacetime draft, taking the oath on May 7, 1941. He was discharged on December 5, 1941, but re-enlisted the following February after Pearl Harbor was attacked two days after his honorable discharge. Greenberg would miss 3 1/2 seasons before returning in 1945. Others athletes have been obscured by history, but are just as important. One who comes to mind is Eddie Grant, one of the few players killed during World War I. The New York Giants had a plaque dedicated to his memory at the Polo Grounds on Memorial Day, 1921. It would take a lengthy series to mention all of those military heroes, but here are just a few: Jack Lummus
 Lummus was a defensive end for the New York Giants. One month after New York lost the NFL’s Eastern Division title to the Chicago Bears, Lummus became an officer in the Marine Corps. Lummus, who also starred collegiately at Baylor, distinguished himself at Iwo Jima in 1945 and received the Congressional Medal of Honor. He continued to fight despite being injured in the shoulder and helped his platoon eliminate fortified enemy positions. He stepped on a land mine, which blew off both his legs. As doctors tried to save him, Lummus was quoted as saying, “Well, doc, the New York Giants lost a mighty good end today.” Lummus was one of 23 NFL players killed during World War II.  He didn’t have any cards during his playing days but Tri-Star’s Obak series has honored him. Yogi Berra He might have been famous for his pithy statements and a stellar baseball career — three American League MVP awards, a 15-time all-star, and catcher/outfielder for 14 pennant winners (and 10 World Series champions) and manager for the 1964 A.L. champion Yankees — but Lawrence Peter Berra saw some major action during World War II. Berra served in the Navy from 1944 to 1945, joining the armed forces as an 18-year-old. He was a gunner’s mate on a landing craft on D-Day, as Allied troops stormed Omaha Beach on the Normandy coast on June 6, 1944. Berra told interviewer Keith Olbermann that the attack “was like the Fourth of July.” “I said, “Boy, it looks pretty, all the planes coming over.” And I was looking out and my officer said, “you better get your head down in here, if you want it on.’” Berra would keep his head and go on to a Hall of Fame baseball career, one that included cards and autographs from 1948-present. Bob Feller “Rapid Robert” won 266 games during his 18 seasons with the Cleveland Indians. He won 20 games six times, including 27 in 1940. He also lost nearly four years of pitching time, enlisting in the Navy the day after Pearl Harbor was attacked in 1941. In the three years leading up to his enlistment, Feller won 24, 27 and 25 games. When he returned from the war he put together 26- and 20-win seasons. It’s fair to say that Feller would have won more than 300 games had World War II not interrupted his career. Feller was signing autographs before a spring training game in Winter Haven, Florida, about a decade ago. One fan told him it was a shame that he lost so many prime seasons to the war effort. Feller didn’t even hesitate. “I’d do it all over again,” he said. Feller was not happy serving in a special physical fitness program. He enrolled in gunnery school and was assigned to the USS Alabama in late 1942. He spent the next 26 months as the Alabama’s chief specialist in charge of a crew that controlled the ship’s anti-aircraft equipment. Feller was involved in several battles in the Pacific, including skirmishes in the Gilbert and Marshall island chains.  He was used in numerous War-era advertising campaigns which are very popular collectibles today and appeared in the ‘Armed Forces’ subset of this year’s Panini Cooperstown set. Rocky Bleier After being drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1968 and playing a season, Bleier was drafted by the U.S. Army and shipped to Vietnam in May 1969. He was part of the 196th Light Infantry Brigade and took a load of shrapnel in his leg during fighting. He was awarded a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star, but doctors told Bleier he’d never play football again. Undaunted, Bleier returned to the Steelers in 1971 and became the blocking back for Franco Harris. He played 130 regular-season games and 10 playoff contests over the next decade and won four rings as a member of Pittsburgh’s four Super Bowl championship teams. Bleier included some Army inscriptions on this rather unique signed Steelers helmet.  His rookie card was in the 1975 Topps set and he appeared in a few others as well. Bob Kalsu He was an All-American offensive tackle in 1967 at Oklahoma, the year the Sooners went 10-1 and beat Tennessee in the Orange Bowl. Bob Kalsu was drafted in 1968 by the Buffalo Bills and by season’s end was voted the team’s rookie of the year. In 1969, he was called to serve in Vietnam, leaving his pregnant wife Jan and 10-month-old daughter Jill.  A 1st lieutenant for the 11th artillery unit of the 101st Airborne unit, Kalsu was killed on July 21, 1970, at the remote Firebase Ripcord in Thua Thien, along with 60 other fellow soldiers. At the time of his death, Kalsu and his unit had been pinned down for weeks by enemy fire. He was the only active NFL player to die in the Vietnam war. Early on July 23, 1970, Jan Kalsu gave birth to a son, named Robert Todd Kalsu. That afternoon, a uniformed Army officer informed the family of the death of Bob Kalsu. Later that night, Jan changed the boy’s name to James Robert Kalsu Jr. In 2000, the Bills added Kalsu’s name to the Wall of Fame at Ralph Wilson Stadium. Kalsu also appears in the Obak sets. Warren Spahn Spahn is the winningest left-handed pitcher in major-league history with 363 victories. He won 2o or more games 13 times and won the Cy Young Award in 1957, receiving 15 out of a possible 16 votes after a 21-11 season. Spahn made his major-league debut with the Boston Braves in 1942, but had no decisions in four games. He spent the next three seasons in the Army with the 276th Engineer Combat Battalion, the 1159th Engineer Combat Group. Spahn’s unit fought in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, and then monitored and protected the flow of traffic over the Ludendorff Bridge — the only bridge spanning the Rhine River that allowed passage into Germany. A staff sergeant, Spahn was injured by shards of shrapnel in his foot as the Germans maintained a steady, daily fire. Spahn was awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart and was promoted to 1st lieutenant. Topps included him in its 2007 Distinguished Service set. Ted Williams  One of major-league baseball’s greatest hitters and the last player to bat .400 in a season, Williams had a career .344 average and hit 521 home runs. He won the Triple Crown in 1942 and ’47 and was a two-time American League MVP. Williams enlisted in the Navy after the 1942 season. His goal was to become a Naval fighter pilot, and by May 1944 he had earned his wings and was commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant. Until June 1945, he served as an instructor with the U.S. Marine Corps reserves. Williams also served a second stint in the military, recall
ed in 1952 and deployed with Marine Aircraft Group 33 to Korea. Williams flew 39 combat missions over Korea before being relieved due to complications from an ear infection. He had missed most of the 1952 and ‘’53 baseball seasons, but returned full time in 1954 and remained with the Red Sox until his retirement after the 1960 season. He homered in his final at-bat, on September 28, 1960. His best cards span three decades. Pat Tillman Tillman would have turned 38 on November 6. He was the first NFL player to be killed in combat since Bob Kalsu in 1970. Tillman is the only player to ever give up a multimillion dollar contract to serve his country, and he did it voluntarily. Tillman turned down a three-year, $3.6 million offer from the Arizona Cardinals after the 2001 season and enlisted in the Army.  He appeared in the 2001 Upper Deck set. Joining the Army Rangers was motivated by the September 11 attacks. Tillman already was an all-pro safety with the Cardinals and was 25 in 2002, entering the prime of his career. He was deployed to Iraq, then was serving in Afghanistan when he was killed by friendly fire on April 22, 2004. After his death, the Pat Tillman Foundation was established, in hopes of inspiring and supporting individuals seeking positive change in themselves and the world. Eddie LeBaron The left-handed “Littlest General” was drafted by the Washington Redskins in 1950. He played two preseason games, then entered the Korean War as a 2nd lieutenant with the Marines. He was wounded twice during his nine-month hitch in Korea and won a Purple Heart. He also won a Bronze Star. LeBaron appears in several 1950s and 60s football sets. Forest K. Ferguson Jr. “Fergie” is the classic case of what could have been. The second All-American in University of Florida history, Ferguson set the pass receiving record at Florida with a 74-yard catch against Miami in 1941. He had received letters from several NFL teams, including the Steelers and Lions, but his mission after graduation was to enlist in the Army. Ferguson distinguished himself at D-Day, helping to blow a gap in the German lines on Omaha Beach. He was mortally wounded that day, halting his athletic career. Ferguson would die from his wounds in 1954, nearly 10 years to the day after the Normandy landings. Florida named an annual award after Ferguson, presenting it to the Gators senior who displays leadership and courage. I don’t believe any cards have been released of Ferguson, but I know of at least one recent book written about him. Bob has been a sportswriter and copy editor for more than 45 years and a blogger for two decades. He is celebrating his 60th year of card collecting, and still counts his 1965 Topps Mickey Mantle as his favorite.  You can reach him at [email protected].

Sports Collectors Daily,1974 WHA Canada-Soviet Summit Series Celebrates 50th Anniversary,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/1974-wha-canada-soviet-summit-series-celebrates-50th-anniversary/,"Fri, 08 Nov 2024 02:31:40 +0000","Bobby Hull, Gordie Howe and others reflect on the 1974 WHA Canada-Soviet series as the ""Forgotten Series"" marks its 50th anniversary.","November 7, 2024 By Jeff Morris  Rick Smith reflected on the 50th anniversary of the second Canada-Soviet hockey series, which took place in the fall of 1974. Like the 1972 Summit Series, the second Canada-Soviet series was an eight-game affair with four games in Canada and then four in Moscow. The difference, however, was that the Canadian team would be comprised of WHA players and not NHL players. Smith, now 76, lives along a big lake near Westport, Ontario, north of Kingston. He makes sure he has a perfect sheet of ice on the lake through the winter, and is out on the blades almost daily. He still participates in alumni events with the Boston Bruins and Ottawa Senators. “It was really exciting to be asked to play for Canada in the series,” Smith said. “It was more than a Canada-Russia thing for us. It was a chance for us to represent the WHA and show that we were on par with the NHL.” Smith won a Stanley Cup with the Boston Bruins in 1970 and was traded to the California Golden Seals in 1972. Bruins goalie Gerry Cheevers jumped to the WHA’s Cleveland Crusaders and thus was left off the 1972 Canadian team, as only NHL players were allowed to participate. Bobby Hull was among the other players left off the 1972 team. Cheevers pushed for Smith to be part of the team, as Smith was a steady defender who was always in position and fundamentally sound. By 1974, Smith was playing for the Minnesota Fighting Saints of the WHA. The bulk of the players on Team Canada were former NHLers who jumped to the new league. Frank Mahovlich, Paul Henderson and Pat Stapleton played in the 1972 series as they were still in the NHL. Gordie Howe and Bobby Hull did not play for Canada in 1972. Hull had jumped to the Winnipeg Jets for hockey’s first million-dollar contract. Howe retired before the 1972 series, but then came out of retirement the following year to join the Houston Aeros of the WHA and play with his sons, Mark and Marty. “I remember the time leading up to the 1972 series, and no one really thought they had a chance against the best players in the NHL,” Howe said during an interview with SCD several years ago. “They were amateurs, and they had won all these world championships, but they had never played actual professionals.” Howe, like every other hockey-loving Canadian, was shocked when the Soviets upset Team Canada 7-3 in the first game. What ensued was the most dramatic and globally important tournament in hockey history. “As the series went on, and the Canadians came together and won the series, all of us watched,” Howe said. “There was no way we could lose that series. It meant to much. All of these players who battled each other night after night for years all came together – the players playing for Canada as well as all of us at home watching on TV. I was 44 years old at the time and thought my hockey career was over, but as the series went on, I wished I was over there and a part of it. I think all of the NHL players watching probably felt the same way.” In 1974, Howe got the opportunity to play in the series with his sons, Mark and Marty. “I wasn’t sure what to expect, but the first time I put that Canada sweater on, it was a special feeling. Then I looked over in the dressing room and I saw Mark and Marty put their sweaters on. I was so proud as a father that my sons were playing for Canada. Getting to play with them for Canada in that series was a feeling I can’t really describe.” Howe was 46 years old in the 1974 series but was still a dominant force, as he had seven goals in seven games. Bobby Hull, meanwhile, was the player the world was watching. He led the tournament with seven goals and two assists for nine points in eight games. “I get asked about the 1976 Canada Cup a lot, and I am often asked about missing the 1972 series,” Hull said in an interview with SCD in the early 2000s. “But I rarely get asked about the 1974 series. “I was not happy about not being able to play in the 1972 series. That’s why I was so happy to get the chance to play for Canada in 1974. We had a very talented team and we were better than people thought we were. The series was not just a chance to play the Russians. It was a chance to show the world that our league was just as good as the NHL.” The feeling was different for Game 1 in 1974 compared to 1972. Hockey fans in Canada knew nothing about the Soviets when the 1972 series began. In 1974, the Soviet stars were household names in Canada. Aside from Howe, Hull, Henderson, Mahovlich and Cheevers, Canada had its share of household names on its roster. John “Pie” McKenzie, Rejean Houle, Ralph Backstrom, Mike “Shakey” Walton, Tom Webster, J.C. Tremblay and Rick Ley were among the stars on the team. Le Colisee in Quebec City only seated a little more than 15,000. There was a lottery in Quebec for the rights to buy tickets. Two million lottery tickets were sold for the rights to those 15,000 tickets. The WHA Team Canada got off to a better start than the 1972 team. Trailing 3-2, Hull scored the tying goal with 5:42 remaining. Canada had a chance to get the win late in the game. “I found Frank Mahovlich with a long pass and sent him in on a breakaway,” Smith recalled. “Unfortunately, Tretiak made the save, and I missed my chance to get on the scoresheet.” Smith did get on the scoresheet in the series, as he led Canada with 14 penalty minutes. Game 2 was played in Toronto, and Canada won 4-1. Game 3 in Winnipeg was won by the Soviets 8-5. In Game 4 in Vancouver, Hull scored three goals in the first period and Canada led 5-2, but the Soviets came back and managed a 5-5 tie. In Game 3, Canadian coach Billy Harris decided to sit some of the star players to let some of the other players get some playing time. Goalie Gerry Cheevers missed the game, as he was at the hospital tending to his father who was seriously ill. Don McLeod took his place. Howe, Mahovlich, Ley, House and Brad Selwood were all scratches for Canada in Game 3 in favor of players got their first taste of action in the series. “That changed everything for us,” Howe said. “We wanted to win. Once we realized that giving everyone ice time was more important than winning, the intensity seemed to disappear for us.” In 1972, some of the players on the roster who had been scratched and did not get playing time quit the team and went home. Harris wanted to avoid that from happened from his team, but he swung the pendulum too far the other way. In Game 4, with their “A” line-up back on the ice, the teams played to a 5-5 tie. Hull scored three goals in the first period, but the Soviets chipped away at Canada’s 5-2 lead. Late in the third period, Alexander Maltsev and Alexander Gusev scored for the Soviets to tie the game. “When I do autograph signings and meet fans, they often talk about their favorite moments of my career,” Hull said. “That hat trick was one of the biggest moments of my career. I scored three goals in one period against one of the greatest teams in the world. Maybe people forgot about it because they came back and tied the game and we didn’t win. No one ever brings that game up, but it is one of the biggest highlights of my career.” Hull and Howe were treated like celebrities and the Soviet hockey fans were warm and welcoming, though there were the usual complaints about accommodations and scheduling. “I wasn’t sure what to expect when we got to Moscow,” Howe recalled. “The fans were great. Even though we were rivals, they were very welcoming and they respected us.” The Soviets won Game 5 3-2, and then the frustrations of the Canadians began to show when they lost Game 6 5-2. “Mark put a big hit on Petrov,” Howe recalled, talking of his son. “Things got pretty heated after that. At the end of that game, Ricky Ley got in a fight with Valeri Kharlamov. He was their biggest star and he was a very good player. Rickey punched him out and Kharlamov’s face was bloodied up.” Kharlamov played at 5’8”, 165 pounds and was the most talented Soviet player. In the 1972 series, Bobby Clark broke Kharlamov’s ankle with a slash. The teams tied 4-4 in Game 7 and the Soviets won Game 8 3-2. Smith recalled that playing with Howe and Hull was a highlight of his career. “I played against those guys for years, but you don’t really get an appreciation for someone like that until you get a chance to be teammates and to paly with them,” he said. While in Ottawa in the 1990s, Tretiak talked openly about the two Summit Series, the Canada Cup, and the Super Series that saw Red Army come to North America to play NHL teams. “We didn’t know what to expect with the WHA team,” Tretiak said. “We knew about Bobby Hull and Gordie Howe, but we had never seen them or played against them. When we saw their roster, we thought they were very old and that they would not be able to keep up with us. “But even though they were older, they were better than we expected. Gordie Howe was still a great player, and bobby Hull was a great goal scorer. I thought that the 1974 team was better and harder to play against than the 1972 team.” The series gave the WHA exposure. While their TV contracts with CBS and CTV did not put a lot of games on the air, some was better than none. “Before the series, we heard everyone talk about Gordie playing with his sons, Paul Henderson playing the Russians again, Cheevers, Mahovlich and myself,” Hull said. “People who followed the series got to see how good Andre Lacroix was, and how good Mark Howe was.” After the series, O-Pee-Chee decided to produce their first WHA exclusive hockey card sets. The first was a 66-card set, while after that, the WHA sets featured 132 cards. But while there were Team Canada inserts in the 1972-73 O-Pee-Chee set, and while there were sets dedicated to the 1972 series and the 1976 Canada Cup, there is very little in the way of cardboard for the 1974 series. The odd retrospective autographed card of Hull, Howe and Cheevers have been produced, but for the most part, there is almost nothing to collect from that series. “I have signed a lot of autographs, photos, pucks and cards – everything,” Hull said. “When I do shows, the promoters always have stacks of 8x10s for fans to get signed. I never see photos from the 1974 series. It’s like they don’t exist.” Hull never called himself a collector, but he did get one special item after the series. “The Russians were great players, and it was a privilege to play against them,” he said. “Alexander Yakushev was their best scorer. After the series, he asked for my autograph, and I asked for his. I always wished some of those guys could have come to North America to play.” Jeff Morris is a hobby veteran who has been a collector for more than 50 years.

Among the modern offerings is a 2000 Playoff Contenders Tom Brady Rookie Ticket Autograph (BGS 8.5 with a 10 signature grade), a 2018 Bowman’s Best Ohtani rookie autograph Green Refractor #91/99 graded PSA 10 and a PSA 9 1986-87 Fleer Michael Jordan rookie.  Some of the other notable items in REA’s November Encore Auction include:   The auction also features a number of near-complete and complete set breaks spanning a number of issues. A near-complete master set of 1952 Topps, highlighted by a complete set of “Canadian” gray backs, including the very tough #189 Pete Reiser is presented card by card. Nearly 500 different 1909-1911 T206 White Border cards in PSA EX 5 are offered individually along with near-complete SGC-graded sets of 1911 T205 Gold Borders and 1912 T207 Brown Backgrounds.  The auction runs through Sunday, November 17.

Panini has released a card of the memorable moment through its Instant brand.
 He wasn’t the first to do it on the field, but Amon-Ra St. Brown may have become the first athlete to appear on a football card doing a headstand. Here’s his touchdown catch and, very brief, celebratory headstand against the Packers on Sunday… Amon-Ra St. Brown’s TD on 4th down, backs up his pregame fit and he hits the headstand celly. 👏👏pic.twitter.com/6eiuVIx9g9 — Fantasy Life (@MBFantasyLife) November 3, 2024  Panini Instant captured the moment thanks to an alert photographer who captured it at just the right time.

Sports Collectors Daily,"Hall of Fame Bats, Jordan Trunks, Signed MJ Star Card Headline SCP Auctions Fall Sale",https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/hall-of-fame-bats-jordan-trunks-signed-mj-star-card-headline-scp-auctions-fall-sale/,"Thu, 07 Nov 2024 01:40:44 +0000","A look inside the hobby's latest major catalog auction, which includes game-used items from some sports legends.","November 6, 2024 By Rich Mueller  Bats once swung by a trio of baseball icons, a pair of shorts worn by Michael Jordan in the ‘Last Dance’ NBA Finals of 1998 and a signed example of Jordan’s rookie year NBA trading card kicked off SCP Auctions’ 2024 Fall Premier sale on Wednesday. As we reported last week, Willie Mays’ 660th and final career home run bat is making its auction debut.  The bat has been photomatched by PSA/DNA and carries a PSA/DNA GU 10 rating. Jim Beauchamp, Mays’ teammate with the New York Mets, lent Mays one of his Adirondack bats when he stepped to the plate on August 17, 1973. The story goes that Mays was tired and wanted to try out Beauchamp’s lighter bat. Mays proceeded to use the borrowed bat to hit what turned out to be his last big league dinger off Cincinnati’s Don Gullett.  The sale also includes some other landmark game-used lumber. A 1951 Ted Williams H&B bat graded PSA/DNA GU 10, a 1965-68 Roberto Clemente H&B bat graded PSA/DNA GU 9.5, and a 1967-68 Mays H&B bat graded PSA/DNA GU 10 will be among the featured lots as well as a1940’s Ty Cobb Signed H&B Pro Model bat Inscribed to the biological Mother of Babe Ruth’s daughter.    White trunks worn by Jordan during all three Chicago Bulls home games in the 1998 Finals are expected to draw interest from hard core basketball collectors. The shorts are the last pair Jordan ever wore as a member of the Bulls and have been conclusively photomatched to all three games by both MeiGray and Sports Investors Authentication.  Two LeBron James game worn Lakers jerseys are up for grabs. One dats to a triple-double in a victory over the Spurs in November 2019. The other is from ring night on December 22, 2020. Aaron Judge’s 2017 Opening Day jersey from his Rookie of the Year season and a Stephen Curry jersey from his scoring champion 2020-21 season are also among the game worn lots. A trio of Olympic medals won by USA swimmer Steve Genter during the 1972 Munich Olympics are also in the catalog. Genter had a collapsed lung a week before his first competition at the Olympics but battled on to win a gold medal in the 4×200 meter relay, a silver medal in the 200 meter, and a bronze medal in the 400 meter. There is championship jewelry, too, including a 2006 Miami Heat NBA championship ring, a 2012 Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XLVII ring, and a 2021 Los Angeles Rams Super Bowl LVI ring.    The auction contains some significant vintage and modern trading cards as well. An autographed copy of the 1984-85 Star Co. Jordan graded BGS NM-MT+ 8.5, a PSA 8 1933 Goudey #144 Babe Ruth, a PSA 8 T206 Cy Young Portrait and a 1915 Cracker Jack Ty Cobb graded PSA Mint 9 (OC) are among the top lots.

The event, which also features No. 7 Duke and No. 23 Kentucky, is in Atlanta for the first time since 2012, when it was held at the Georgia Dome. The 2024 edition features the nation's top team, but its nothing new for the Jayhawks and Spartans to seek out early measuring sticks. Kansas (2-0) breezed past Howard 87-57 on Nov. 4 in its season opener before fending off No. 9 North Carolina 92-89 on Friday. The Jayhawks saw their 20-point, first-half lead disappear at home against the Tar Heels but scored the game's final five points for their first marquee win of the season. South Dakota State transfer guard Zeke Mayo led Kansas with 21 points off the bench, while fifth-year senior Hunter Dickinson recorded 20 points and 10 rebounds. Mayo, a Lawrence, Kan., native and last season's Summit League Player of the Year, leads his new team with an average of 20 points per game. ""(Zeke) met the opportunity with flying colors,"" Kansas coach Bill Self said of his performance on Friday. ""He was fantastic. He made a couple of plays off the bounce that were just fantastic. He was great, and we needed everything he gave us."" Alongside Mayo, Dickinson -- the Big 12 Preseason Player of the Year -- and KJ Adams Jr. return to the Jayhawks, averaging 18 and 10.5 points per game, respectively. Kansas is 8-5 all-time in the Champions Classic, including 2-2 against the Spartans.  The teams most recently met in the event in 2021, with Kansas winning 87-74. Even though his team is favored in Tuesday's game, Self knows not to underestimate a Tom Izzo-coached team. ""Playing Tom's teams is different because he runs more sets than anybody in the country,"" Self said. ""Getting your guys prepared for what they do, it'll be a multi-day scout."" The Spartans (2-0) have blown out two outmatched opponents this season, beating Monmouth 81-57 and Niagara 96-60. Michigan State's top two scorers are both returnees in Jaden Akins -- who is averaging 16.5 points a game -- and Jaxon Kohler (12.5).  Kohler had 20 points and 13 rebounds against Niagara in a lopsided victory, but Izzo knows Tuesday will be a different story. ""We were able to get the ball inside and outside; we had 52 points in the paint,"" Izzo said. ""I don't think that's going to happen on Tuesday night, but it's all about setting the tempo. What we've been doing well is what we've got to continue to do. I think we have some versatility inside and out, and I like the way we've moved the ball.""

Although the Dolphins are 2-6 with three consecutive losses, Miami is far more competitive than the record indicates since starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa returned from a four-game hiatus on injured reserve with a concussion. Miami narrowly lost twice since Tagovailoa stepped back into the start job. The Dolphins dropped a one-point decision to Arizona and were also beaten by Buffalo by a field goal margin. As for the Rams (4-4), they'll look to keep their playoff hopes alive by extending their winning streak to four games and keeping their noses up with the rest of the pack in the NFC West. Given both teams' firepower on offense when healthy, this matchup looks tailor-made to produce a high-scoring affair.  --Dolphins' offense energized with Tagovailoa's return  The Dolphins scored 27 points in back-to-back games with Tagovailoa returning to rescue a group putting up less than two touchdowns per game without him. His presence alone tends to have a calming effect on the offense based on his accuracy and ability to put the ball exactly where he wants it to go. Tagovailoa completed 69.3 percent of his passes last season and is up to 72.7 percent this season. The Dolphins are more likely to remain on schedule with Tagovailoa, who has the fifth-highest success rate among quarterbacks with a minimum of 140 plays. When you're picking up the necessary yardage on early downs, you'll have more flexibility with your playcalling. In their last two games, the Dolphins converted 65.2 percent of their third-down opportunities and 6-for-8 in touchdown conversions inside the red zone. While the offense can sometimes resemble a slow grind, the Dolphins' efficiency under Tagovailoa makes them a real threat to opposing defenses. We're eyeing the over on Tagovailoa completions -- set at 21.5 at DraftKings, ESPN Bet and FanDuel -- given his high-percentage horizontal route connections with wide receivers Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle and the additional threat of running back De'Von Achane. Tagovailoa was 25 of 28 (89.3 percent) at Buffalo last week and 28 of 38 in his first game back from IR.  --Pass defense a mutual concern Los Angeles had its share of injury woes, with wide receivers Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua combining to miss seven games. Both players are now back with the team to significantly boost the Rams offense. The passing game is vital for the Rams because they struggle to run the ball, ranking 31st in yards per carry (3.8). As a result, it's no surprise that Los Angeles has the ninth-highest pass play rate at 58.68 percent. Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford should be eager for his chance to face this Dolphins defense. According to the FTN Fantasy Defense-adjusted Value Over Average (DVOA) metric, Miami ranks 27th against the pass. However, the Rams' pass defense is only one spot better.  Pro Football Focus offers a similar view. It has the Dolphins 26th in pass coverage while grading the Rams as the third worst in this category. Hence, we play the points. This total opened at 47.5 and was bet up as high as 49.5 before we began to see a little bit of buyback. It's now settling at 49 at most sportsbooks. As of Monday morning, 48.5 was still available at FanDuel. In a perfect scenario -- or close to perfect health for both teams -- this number would probably be closer to 52.  Do not pass: take the value and run with it.  Best bet: over 48.5 points (-115 at FanDuel) --Michael Nwaneri, Field Level Media Copyright 2024"
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",Veteran’s Day Salute to Pro Athletes Who Served Their Country,https://deadspin.com/veterans-day-salute-to-pro-athletes-who-served-their-country/,2024-11-11T14:09:43.057Z,"On Veteran's Day, we salute the professional athletes who served the United States of America.","On D-Day, 19-year-old Yogi Berra and five Navy mates parked the USS Bayfield two long home runs from Omaha Beach and launched rockets and fired machine guns at the Germans—trying to smooth the way for the Allied invasion.  They stayed there 12 more days with orders to shoot down enemy aircraft.  Ted Williams, whose Boston Red Sox battled Berra’s New York Yankees hundreds of times during the 1940s and 1950s, served as a naval aviator for three years in World War II and gave 15 more months as a fighter pilot—occasionally serving as John Glenn’s wingman—in the Korean War. Before Williams left for his Korean War assignment, he had dinner with legendary sportswriter Grantland Rice. According to the superb book “The Wingmen: The Unlikely, Unusual, Unbreakable Friendship Between John Glenn and Ted Williams” by Adam Lazarus, Williams understood the stakes. “Then he said—and this is what I can’t get out of my mind,” Rice told fellow New York sportswriter Frank Graham, “(he said) ‘I expect to be killed, of course.’” Berra and Williams are two of the many examples of remarkable athletes who didn’t limit their greatness to the playing field—and risked their lives to do it. Veterans Day represents a wonderful opportunity to relive their sacrifices for the United States of America. Ty Cobb, Warren Spahn, Bobby Jones, David Robinson, Hank Greenberg, Chuck Bednarik and Hoyt Wilhelm are among other athletes who saw active duty or worked as intelligence officers. Bob Feller, who was perhaps the greatest pitcher of his day, enlisted in the Naval Reserve two days after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. Serving as a gun captain on the USS Alabama, Feller earned eight battle stars and six campaign ribbons in North Atlantic and Pacific theaters. After missing nearly four full seasons of his prime, Feller was discharged on Aug. 22, 1945, and earned a complete-game win over the World Series-bound Detroit Tigers two days later. By no means are former Major League Baseball legends the only ones to come to their country’s aid. After four years as a safety for the Arizona Cardinals, Pat Tillman and his brother, Kevin (an Anaheim Angels pitcher), enlisted in the Army in May 2002 as their response to 9/11. They trained to join the Army Rangers, and their regiment was deployed to Iraq and then Afghanistan as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Tillman was killed April 22, 2004, in Afghanistan by friendly fire during a firefight. Forty years before, Roger Staubach enjoyed a wondrous athletic career at Navy. In addition to earning the 1963 Heisman Trophy and being featured on the cover of Time magazine (he was pushed off the cover of Life due to John F. Kennedy’s assassination), Staubach excelled for three years on the baseball team (batting .420 as a sophomore) and received two letters on the basketball team. Upon graduation in 1965, Staubach immediately began to serve his five-year commitment to the Navy, which included one year in Vietnam. He entered the NFL in 1969 as a 27-year-old rookie with the Dallas Cowboys, who had the foresight to spend their 10th-round pick in the 1964 NFL Draft on Staubach. Within three years, Staubach led the Cowboys to the Super Bowl championship. He was awarded the Super Bowl MVP award, which came with a Dodge Charger. Staubach traded it in for a station wagon—the better to transport his three young kids.  Staubach’s Cowboys and Rocky Bleier’s Pittsburgh Steelers met more than once in the Super Bowl—and Bleier’s military journey was more harrowing than Staubach’s. After playing his rookie year in Pittsburgh, Bleier was drafted into the Army. He went to Vietnam and suffered multiple injuries in August 1969. He was shot in the thigh during an ambush. Not long after during that firefight, he saw a grenade bounce off his commanding officer’s back. “It rolls toward me and I wasn’t but three feet from him as I was sitting there,” Bleier told the American Veterans Center. “I got up to jump and it blew up and I was standing on top of it… I had nerve damage coming up out of my (right) foot, broken bones under my foot. Fortunately I didn’t lose any part of my foot.” During his lengthy recovery that included several surgeries, Bleier was told he would not play football again. Instead, he played 10 more seasons with the Steelers and won four Super Bowls to go with his Purple Heart and Silver Star. “Because I became a story and because we were successful, it put Vietnam on the top of the list,” Bleier said. “So all those Vietnam veterans out there who were repressed, who didn’t get the credit or the pat on the back, all of a sudden, here was one of ours that made it. And got through and got recognition for his service, which the rest of us can ride on his coattails or whatever it might be. But it was well-deserved (recognition) that we all should have gotten at that time.”  Copyright 2024"
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise",Philadelphia 76ers Star Joel Embiid Is Incapable of Taking the High Road,https://deadspin.com/philadelphia-76ers-star-joel-embiid-is-incapable-of-taking-the-high-road/,2024-11-11T14:02:05.448Z,"After serving a suspension for shoving a reporter in the locker room, Joel Embiid is incapable of taking the high road as the Sixers look to make up g","Joel Embiid has played in just 433 regular-season games since being the No. 3 overall pick of the 2014 NBA Draft by the Philadelphia 76ers. He has never once played 70 games in a season. And when Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Marcus Hayes criticized Embiid's work ethic, lack of conditioning and pattern of unavailability, it didn't go over well with the 2022-23 NBA MVP. Embiid hasn't played yet this season due to a left knee injury plus the three-game suspension he earned for shoving Hayes after a game on Nov. 2. Embiid was irritated with the reporter for a few reasons, one being that he mentioned the name of the center's dead brother and young son, both named Arthur, in the highly critical column. Embiid certainly has the right to be upset and to deliver sharp words at the reporter—dang, what was the over-under on profane words during the confrontation? No matter what the topic, the second an athlete gets physical with a reporter, they have lost the battle and the war. While announcing the suspension, high-ranking NBA executive Joe Dumars included this nugget in his statement: ""Interactions must remain professional on both sides and can never turn physical."" Keep your hands off, Joel. You're 30 years old. You've been frustrated with the things this whole season. Instead of pushing somebody, have the team set you up with counseling to help figure out why you have so much anger. Embiid, of course, is a spectacular player who has career averages of 27.9 points and 11.2 rebounds. He led the NBA in scoring back-to-back seasons and had a solid chance to do so again last season before injuring the left knee in late January. He underwent surgery on Feb. 6 and later returned to action, but he hobbled through the playoffs. The knee certainly didn't recover because here he is still battling more issues with it. The 76ers need the seven-time All-Star on the floor to make a run at a title. But even with Embiid, Philadelphia hasn't reached the Eastern Conference finals during his career, let alone the NBA Finals. The more the 76ers come up short, the more people question whether Embiid will ever get Philadelphia to the finals. The 76ers last title came in 1983, when NBA MVP Moses Malone and basketball icon Julius Erving led the way. The 76ers added Paul George in the offseason to help with the title quest, and Tyrese Maxey, who just injured a hamstring, is also part of a star-studded trio. But no matter who you break it down, the 76ers need Embiid on the floor. They are a dreadful 2-7, and five of the losses have been by double digits. Embiid is eligible to return from his suspension on Tuesday against the New York Knicks. Those are the same Knicks that eliminated Philadelphia in the first round of last season's playoffs. There's no guarantee Embiid's knee will be ready for the contest against the Knicks. And that's kind of the real problem—when will that knee allow him to take the court and be a dominant force? Because once he's playing games and putting up 30-plus points every night, this whole situation will disappear. The focus will return to his skills, and the 76ers should start winning more games. But exploding on a reporter—even if the Arthur stuff was unnecessary—is not a good look for the so-called face of the franchise. Embiid has seemed to be one of those players that could spend his entire career with one organization. If that doesn't happen, consider the recent weeks as the beginning of the road out of town. Embiid made a big mistake. He'll choose his path moving forward. But big Joel, maybe keep your hands off the working stiffs in the future. Copyright 2024"

Houston was up 23-7 at intermission. Detroit quarterback Jared Goff had already been picked off three times, Texans counterpart C.J. Stroud had completed 70 percent of his passes, and the Lions had never faced such a deficit this season. What could go wrong? A lot, apparently. Detroit stormed all the way back, keeping Houston off the scoreboard in the second half and winning 26-23 on Jake Bates’ 52-yard field goal as time expired. So, make that three losses in four games for the once-mighty Texans, who were 5-1 through their first six games of the season. Injuries have been the main reason for Houston’s steady decline, with a bum hamstring forcing Nico Collins to miss the past five games and fellow wide receiver Stefon Diggs done for the year because of a torn ACL. If the Texans were in any other division than the AFC South, which currently features three teams that a handful of high school JV squads could probably give a run for their money, they would really be in a tight spot. But luckily for Houston, it still has some room for error. However, each setback gives the Indianapolis Colts a reason to keep chasing that division crown. Indianapolis (4-6) is the only team that the 6-4 Texans have to keep their eye on in the AFC South, as the Tennessee Titans (2-7) and Jacksonville Jaguars (2-8) might as well start scheduling offseason vacation plans. There’s a very real possibility that the Colts go 6-1 to close out the campaign. Yes, an optimistic prediction for sure, but colliding with the New York Jets, New England Patriots, New York Giants, Titans and Jaguars could result in a lot of late-season success.  Win those games, then beat either the Broncos or Lions, and congrats, Indianapolis. A 6-1 finish for a 10-7 record. Down Denver and Detroit, and now you’ve shattered all expectations.  Of course, this Colts team has plenty of problems of its own and hasn’t really been able to click all season despite having some serious talent, especially on the offensive side of the ball. Still, Indianapolis can say it has life, which a number of teams would kill for heading into Week 11. After a loss like the one it had on Sunday, Houston could easily go off the rails. It has great opportunities to bounce back ahead of its Week 14 bye -- facing the Dallas Cowboys, Titans and Jaguars -- but dropping any of those games really creates some cause for concern. Following their brief hiatus, the Texans will be greeted by a healthy version of the Miami Dolphins before taking on the Kansas City Chiefs and Baltimore Ravens. Then it’s down to Nashville for the regular-season finale against the Titans. Houston was already on a very slippery slope, and handing off a win to Detroit on Sunday certainly didn’t help it find its footing. The Texans shouldn’t be all that worried just yet, but if they do end up slipping in the standings, what happened in Week 10 won’t soon be forgotten. Copyright 2024"

Between these two dates, Paul hosted a surprisingly exciting fight against former UFC fighter Mike Perry, who had gained a little bit of fame for his success in the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship. Paul was named victorious by way of a technical knockout in the sixth round, as a swollen and beaten Perry just couldn’t proceed. Paul vs. Tyson comes with a fair amount of warranted criticism. Tyson is 58 years old. His last competitive fight was in 2005. In a 2020 exhibition against Roy Jones Jr. that ended in a draw, Tyson looked slow and like an older man that did not take the fight seriously. His fight against Paul will take place without headgear.  This fight with Paul will be different from your normal celebrity face-off, as it’s an actual sanctioned fight that will count on professional records.  This doesn’t feel like Logan Paul vs. Floyd Mayweather, which was a clear money grab. Don’t get me wrong, this is a massive money grab as well. It’ll be a huge spectacle at AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys. While 80,000 can fit inside of that building, millions will watch this freak show live on Netflix. It’s another live event for Netflix, who impressed during their Labor Day broadcast of Joey Chestnut vs. Takeru Kobayashi. It’ll be interesting to see what Netflix can do with a combat sports broadcast. Another reason to be excited. But everyone will be interested in seeing what happens in the ring. Now 27 years old, Paul has taken the world of combat sports by storm. He’s knocked out former UFC stars like Tyron Woodley and Ben Askren. He’s battled older legends like Anderson Silva before. Prior to announcing his fight with Iron Mike, he was beating up some lesser-known boxers with relative ease. Tyson is a +200 underdog in this fight on most major sportsbooks, and that’s likely because of the 30-year age difference. But Tyson is different. He’s a heavyweight. This will be Paul’s first heavyweight bout, a division in which Tyson won six championship titles during his professional career. While training videos can easily be altered and edited, Tyson looks to be in great shape. At a heavier weight, Paul will presumably get tired quicker, and he’s never exactly been known for great endurance. Friday’s arrival will be met with excitement. A large piece of me feels like this could unfold like any other Paul fight, and that could be very apparent early in the match. The way Paul fights typically goes, he will strategically select an older, slower opponent that he could wear down with his heavy right hand. The opponents are typically in it for the pay day, and sometimes that’s very obvious with their clear lack of preparation. But there’s a small piece of me that thinks this one could be different. Surely, Tyson is in this one for the pay day, too. The legend has nothing left to prove inside of that ring. But if he could be the one to finally knock out Paul and put an end to all of this madness? That would be a story that only Netflix could script.  Copyright 2024"

The Oklahoma City Thunder will have to adjust to being without one of theirs for the time being. On Monday night, the teams will square off in Oklahoma City with the Clippers still without Kawhi Leonard and the Thunder without Chet Holmgren. Leonard has yet to play this season due to inflammation in his right knee. He won't travel with the Clippers during a three-game trip that begins with Monday's contest. The game will be the second of four meetings between the teams this season. Oklahoma City won the first meeting, 105-92, in Los Angeles on Nov. 2. Holmgren played a significant role in that game with 10 points and 14 rebounds. Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said after that game that Holmgren's abilities made the Thunder particularly difficult to defend. But now, Oklahoma City will be without Holmgren for at least eight to 10 weeks after he sustained a pelvic fracture during the first quarter of Sunday's contest against the Golden State Warriors. Holmgren fell hard on his right hip after trying to defend a layup near the rim. The team announced the injury as a right iliac wing fracture and said he is expected to return this season.  Holmgren is averaging 16.4 points, 8.7 rebounds and 2.6 blocks a game this season. Oklahoma City trailed Sunday's game by 30 late in the third quarter before pulling as close as six late before the Warriors won 127-116. ""This is a resilient, tough, competitive, adaptive team,"" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said, ""and that's what we're going to be, regardless of the circumstances."" The Thunder might have to be even more adaptive. Before Holmgren's injury, Oklahoma City already was thin in the frontcourt with Isaiah Hartenstein, Jaylin Williams and Kenrich Williams all injured. Those three have not appeared in a game this season. ""It's kind of a next-man-up thing,"" Oklahoma City's Jalen Williams said. ""Can't dwell too long."" The Thunder's defense, which ranks best in the league with 100.3 points allowed per 100 possessions, figures to be most affected without Holmgren. ""All of us have to figure out how to get stops and rebound,"" Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said. The Clippers' defense also is in the top five in the league, allowing 107.7 points per 100 possessions. After dropping their first matchup with the Thunder, the Clippers fell to 2-4 for the season. But Los Angeles has won four consecutive games since then, including Saturday's 105-103 home victory over Toronto. During the four-game winning streak, Clippers center Ivica Zubac is averaging 14.8 points and 12.3 rebounds. ""Zu's been great,"" Lue said. ""The big man that we've been playing a lot of minutes, but he's one of the most durable big men in the league, probably the most durable big man in the league."" Zubac has played in at least 68 games in each of the last four seasons. The Clippers have lost six consecutive games in Oklahoma City. They haven't won there since March 3, 2020.

The Spurs will play the third contest of a five-game homestand that's seen them split the first two games, defeating the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday and then dropping a 111-110 decision to the Utah Jazz on Saturday.  San Antonio on Saturday received 24 points and 16 rebounds from Victor Wembanyama, who was also called for a crucial offensive foul on a pick late in the game.  Stephon Castle had career-high 23 points in his third start, Devin Vassell scored 21, Keldon Johnson hit for 14 and Harrison Barnes tallied 10 points in the loss.  ""My guys have been in the gym with me,"" Castle said of his best-ever output. ""We're all confident in each other to shoot the ball no matter who it is. If we get open when we're told, we've got to shoot it. (It's about) just stepping up and shooting with confidence.""  Vassell's production came in his first action of the season after he missed more than seven months with a broken foot.  ""I haven't played in a long time,"" Vassell said afterward. ""You know, during the off season, I was kind of frustrated because at the end of the day, I just want to be out there on my teammates and play with them. I was able to get through it. They helped me get back in shape and everything.""  The Spurs have spilt their past four games and will get their first look this season at the Kings, who arrived in the Alamo City early Monday morning after a 127-118 overtime win in Phoenix on Sunday.  DeMar DeRozan led the Kings with 34 points while three other starters -- De'Aaron Fox (21 points, 11 rebounds, eight assists), Domantas Sabonis (20 points, 12 rebounds) and Keegan Murray (14 points, 14 rebounds) -- racked up double doubles in the victory. Kevin Huerter added 17 points for Sacramento.  The Kings have won three of their past four games.  While DeRozan is the most oft-mentioned new player for the Kings, Huerter -- who came to the team from Atlanta in July 2022 -- also has been a key cog. The 6-foot-7 guard underwent a 6 1/2-month recovery after season-ending surgery last April to repair a torn labrum in his left shoulder.  ""I'm still getting myself in the swing of things, still trying to find my rhythm,"" said Huerter, who is averaging 11.3 points a game this season. ""A couple of new guys on our team and a new offense, so I'm trying to fully immerse myself with the team and kind of get my feet under me a little bit. It's been a rigorous summer, and obviously glad to be back in the swing."" Sacramento's super sixth man, Malik Monk, left Sunday's game early in the second quarter when he twisted his ankle after stepping on the foot step of Suns center Mason Plumlee.

The Rockets eked out a 101-99 victory over the Pistons for their third win in the last four games. Houston, which will host the Washington Wizards on Monday night, beat Detroit while shooting just 40.9 percent from the field and missing 27 of 34 attempts from 3-point range. What the Rockets did well on Sunday was lean into their early-season profile by securing 17 offensive rebounds while recording a modest 11 turnovers. According to NBA.com, the Rockets exited the win over Detroit second in the league in offensive rebounding rate (35.9 percent) and fifth in turnover rate (12.5 percent). Their effectiveness in those two categories has offset woeful shooting, with only Portland and Utah posting effective field-goal percentages worse than the Rockets' 49.6 percent. Rebounding saved the Rockets against the Pistons. Alperen Sengun grabbed 10 rebounds while Tari Eason secured nine in 27 minutes off the bench. Starters Fred VanVleet and forward Jabari Smith Jr. shot a combined 5 for 21, including 1 for 11 on 3-pointers, but totaled 14 rebounds. The Rockets employ the offensive talent to turn things around on that end of the court, but their offensive rebounding and ball security should continue to serve as assets. ""That was a point of emphasis all year,"" Rockets coach Ime Udoka said. ""We got nine more shots because of that and took care of the ball. As I always say, you can rely on your defense when the shots aren't falling, so on the nights when they both click, you have a comfortable win. The nights where they're not, you can still dig it out and figure out a way to get it done."" The Wizards surrendered a pair of 30-point quarters in the second half of their 121-94 road loss to the Orlando Magic on Sunday, their fourth consecutive defeat, with three of those losses coming by at least 20 points. Washington again was without its second-leading scorer and rebounder, Kyle Kuzma (17 points, 7.7 rebounds), and his absence continues to be felt. Washington posted a minus-seven rebounding margin and allowed 15 offensive boards that Orlando converted into 22 points. The Wizards' ineffective performance on the glass was a shared responsibility, but 7-foot rookie Alex Sarr corraling only three rebounds in 24 minutes proved noteworthy. Sarr blocked two shots on Sunday after entering play averaging 2.6 per game, which ranked fourth in the NBA.

The Flyers suffered a tough 6-4 loss to the Carolina Hurricanes on Tuesday to open their three-game trek before nipping the Tampa Bay Lightning 2-1 in a shootout on Thursday. Then, on Saturday, Philadelphia battled the defending champion Florida Panthers for 65 minutes before falling 4-3 in a shootout. ""The past few games, we're beginning to play better, more to what we're supposed to play like,"" Flyers coach John Tortorella said. Samuel Ersson missed the first two games of the road trip with a lower-body injury before returning to make 28 saves against the Panthers. ""This road trip, I think we played pretty well,"" Ersson said. ""We battled ... against very good teams. We're happy with the way we played. Obviously we want more points, but if we play like this, they're going to come.""  Joel Farabee, Anthony Richard and Garnet Hathaway each scored a goal and Scott Laughton had two assists against Florida. Owen Tippett had the team's lone tally in five shootout attempts.  ""I thought we dictated the speed of the game tonight,"" Hathaway said. ""And that's something that when we're playing to our identity, that's what we do."" The Sharks are playing better in recent weeks, as well, having gone 5-2-0 in their last seven games following an 0-7-2 start to the season. Most recently, they slipped past the New Jersey Devils on Sunday night, 1-0, in the opener of a four-game trip. Mackenzie Blackwood made 44 saves for his 11th career shutout, blanking his former team in his first game as a visiting goaltender at Prudential Center. ""It's just one of those nights where it feels easy,"" Blackwood said. ""I don't know why sometimes that happens and sometimes it doesn't, but sometimes pucks just seem like they're coming in slow. I don't know why, but definitely you could say today was one of those days I was seeing the puck well."" While most teams typically don't start the same goalie on both ends of a back-to-back set, perhaps San Jose coach Ryan Warsofsky has a tougher decision to make after Blackwood's stellar effort on Sunday. ""(Blackwood) was outstanding, probably the best I've seen him play,"" Warsofsky said. ""You could just tell he was dialed in, focused and tracking pucks really well."" Of course, some credit must go to the Sharks' defense for shutting out a talented Devils team that entered with five wins in its previous six games. ""I thought we did a great job for the most part, staying tight,"" said Nico Sturm, who scored the lone goal for San Jose. ""Obviously, (Blackwood) had a huge game."" It remains to be seen if the Sharks' defense will have to contend with dynamic Flyers rookie Matvei Michkov, who has been a healthy scratch in the last two games. ""It's just part of the process,"" Tortorella said. ""With young guys, they can watch games too as far as developing. It's (about) trying to help him."" The Sharks and Flyers split their two-game season series in 2023-24. Five of the last six matchups between the teams have been decided by one goal. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Brett Leason, Jackson LaCombe, Leo Carlsson and Isac Lundestrom scored goals for Anaheim, which picked up just its second win in the past eight games. It also marked the first time since a 5-4 overtime win against Utah on Oct. 16 that the Ducks scored four goals in a game. Gibson, making his 467th career start in his 12th season, picked up his 194th career victory for the Ducks. The 31-year-old had missed the start of the season after undergoing emergency appendectomy surgery in September.

Nico Sturm scored on a fortuitous bounce in the first period as the Sharks won for the fifth time in seven games after their season-opening, nine-game losing streak. Sturm's goal was enough for Blackwood, who withstood a constant barrage from the Devils and constantly limited rebound opportunities. Jake Allen made 26 saves for the Devils, who had their season high in shots on goal and were blanked for the second time this season. New Jersey fell to 5-2-0 in its past seven games and was unable to win a fourth straight contest. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Mercer, meanwhile, looks to pull off an upset and keep the Blue Demons from opening the campaign 3-0 on Monday night in Chicago. First-year coach Chris Holtmann wanted a fast-paced style that looks for the open 3 to be the hallmark of DePaul's offense. Through two games, the Blue Demons are 25-for-70 from beyond the arc. They made 14 threes during an 80-78 overtime victory against Southern Indiana in their season opener last Monday, then hit 11 in a 92-59 rout of Prairie View A&M on Thursday. DePaul made 10 or more 3-pointers only twice during its brutal 3-29 campaign last season. ""We have a lot of shooters,"" said DePaul forward JJ Traynor, who knocked down a 3 and had 11 points on Thursday. ""I want to say everybody on our team can shoot the ball. We want to play fast and take the best shot. Sometimes that's the 3. ""Shoot the ball with confidence."" Traynor is one of eight Blue Demons to make a 3 this season. Isaiah Rivera, a UIC transfer, is 8-for-16 from distance while averaging a team-leading 21 points through two games. Meanwhile, former Coastal Carolina standout Jacob Meyer is 5-for-13 from beyond the arc and is averaging 18 points for the Blue Demons, who are shooting 46.4 percent overall. Mercer (1-0) allowed Virginia-Lynchburg to go 5-for-16 from 3-point range during its season-opening, 125-54 rout on Thursday. Fordham transfer Angel Montas Jr. had 18 points and Tyler Johnson made four threes to finish with 16 for the Bears, who could test DePaul's perimeter defense after going 13-for-30 from beyond the arc in their opener.

After an easy win in its season opener last week, Oklahoma will get another chance to showcase its new roster when it hosts Northwestern State on Monday in Norman, Okla. The Sooners (1-0) enjoyed solid showings from their veterans and newcomers in their 93-60 home win over Lindenwood last Monday.  Jalon Moore led all scorers with 22 points, while fellow returning starter Sam Godwin had 11 points and a game-high 15 rebounds. Perhaps more importantly, Oklahoma coach Porter Moser said the duo's poise helped the rest of the team shed any first-game jitters. ""That's the joy of having retention,"" Moser said. ""Jalon and Sam, you could see in the shootaround ... they were totally sure of what we were doing. I thought they got us out of the gates."" As for the new arrivals, Jeremiah Fears had 16 points, six assists and five rebounds in his freshman debut, and High Point transfer Duke Miles buried 4 of 6 3-pointers and finished with 14 points. ""Duke looked like an older guard (Monday),"" Moser said. ""It was great to see him step in with confidence and (make) those shots. We need it. That's what we want to do ... space (the floor) and continue to use that 3-point line."" The Sooners will enter the game Monday on six days of rest, while the Demons (1-1) will be just two full days removed from their 86-65 loss at Texas Tech on Friday. Jon Sanders II scored 18 points off the bench against the Red Raiders to lead Northwestern State. The transfer guard also paced the Demons with 16 points in their 96-55 win over Division II Dallas Christian College last Monday.  Sanders made all eight of his free-throw attempts on Friday, but his teammates missed nine of their 14 foul shots. The wasted opportunities at the line irked Northwestern State coach Rick Cabrera, as did Texas Tech's 17-3 advantage in fastbreak points. ""Thirteen of 22 (from the free-throw line) on the road is unacceptable,"" Cabrera said.

Tamar Bates hit 3 of 7 shots from behind the arc while leading Missouri with 17 points. But the other Tigers went 0-for-15 from distance while coach Dennis Gates implored them to pound the ball inside. ""The 3-pointer was so tempting for most of them, they couldn't resist it,"" Gates said. ""They could not resist it. And Bates made his baseline out, and it's almost like that that stirred it up again, like ‘Oh, we're open! We're open! Let's shoot it!' And we have to be able to do certain things other than just catch and shoot."" Forward Mark Mitchell had a strong game inside (16 points, eight rebounds), but Gates wanted more players attacking the basket. He used nine players for 12 minutes or more while trying to find effective combinations. Eastern Washington opened its season by losing at Colorado 76-56 and defeating Seattle 93-86 at home. The Eagles raced to a 16-4 lead over Seattle but failed to keep the upper hand, falling behind by the 7:53 mark of the first half. ""We'll get better defense because this is a very coachable group,"" first-year Eagles coach Dan Monson said. ""They have started both games dictating the defense, we just have to sustain it."" On the other hand, the Eagles shot 57.6 percent from the floor against Seattle and made 9 of 22 shots from 3-point range. ""You're going to win a lot of games when you put 93 points on the board,"" Monson said. ""We are still a work in progress, but it's a lot easier to learn after a good win like this."" Four Eagles are scoring in double figures this season: Andrew Cook (16.0), Sebastian Hartman (11.0), Mason Williams (11.0), and Nic McClain (10.5). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

While the visiting Eagles (0-3) are playing for the fourth time in eight days, the Cavaliers (1-0) opened the season on Wednesday with a 65-56 win over Campbell, fueled by Jacob Cofie and Blake Buchanan.   Cofie, a 6-foot-10 freshman, scored a game-high 16 points off the bench on 7-of-8 shooting with two 3-pointers and grabbed six rebounds. Buchanan, a 6-foot-11 sophomore starter, contributed 10 points, seven boards, five assists and three blocked shots. They had only one turnover and three fouls between them.   ""He had a great game,"" Buchanan said of Cofie. ""I'm super, super happy for him. I'm pretty hard on him in practice, and I get on him, and I try to do my best that I can to kind of mentor him a little bit.""   Buchanan scored in double figures for the first time since the second game of his freshman season, an 18-point effort against Florida on Nov. 10, 2023.   ""I just feel a lot more natural this year,"" Buchanan said. ""I'm not reactive. I know where to be. I know what to expect. I've already done a year of college basketball, so the game's a lot slower this year than it was last year. I definitely am stronger from last year, so I'm more physical and I can do a little bit more stuff with that.""   It was the first win for Virginia under interim head coach Ron Sanchez. During his final season as the head coach at Charlotte in 2022-23, his 49ers opened the season with an 82-59 victory against Coppin State.   Coppin State fell 64-53 against Rider in its home opener in Baltimore on Saturday.   Derrius Ward and Toby Nnadozie scored 18 points each but the rest of the Eagles combined for just 17. Ward, a two-time transfer, leads the team with 15.3 points per game.   Coppin State went 2-27 in alumnus Larry Stewart's first season as head coach in 2023-24.

The Terrapins (2-0) have opened the season with victories of 30 or more points against Manhattan and Mount St. Mary's. It's the first time Maryland has defeated its first two opponents of a campaign by at least 30 points since the 2014-15 season. Meanwhile, the Rattlers (0-2) have struggled mightily in coach Patrick Crarey II's first season at the helm, allowing over 100 points in losses to TCU and SMU. Rodney Rice, a transfer from Virginia Tech, has been a big part of Maryland's early success. He scored a career-high 28 points on 10-of-14 shooting from the field in the Terrapins' 86-52 win over Mount St. Mary's on Friday. Rice scored 26 of those points in the first half to help break the game open early, and he finished with five rebounds, two assists and two steals. Ja'Kobi Gillespie, a transfer from Belmont, complemented Rice's efforts with 13 points. ""When Ja'Kobi and Rodney are out here together, it's two guys that can really shoot it and score,"" Maryland coach Kevin Willard said Friday. ""This is the way Rod's been playing for the last two to three weeks in practice. It's the way we played the other night, to be honest with you, when he came in the second half and kind of did the same thing. He's got a great knack to score."" Florida A&M has had a major issue with turnovers during its first two games. The Rattlers allowed SMU to convert 15 giveaways into 27 points during a 102-73 loss on Thursday.   One of the bright spots for the Rattlers so far has been Sterling Young, who led the team in scoring against SMU with 15 points. He went 3-for-8 from 3-point range in that setback.  Young is averaging a team-high 15.5 points over the first two games of the season.  ""Sterling is a really good offensive player who was an all-conference player at the best juco conference in the county,"" Crarey said in May, when it was officially announced that Young had transferred from Charlotte. ""He spent this last year playing in the (American Athletic Conference). His experience on that level will be a huge asset to our program."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

While Dunn had 19 points in an 83-68 victory Friday over Murray State, Corhen delivered 13 points and 10 rebounds. Meanwhile, holdover guards Jaland Lowe and Ishmael Leggett produced 20 and 19 points, respectively. While some backcourt players in the transfer portal might have crossed Pitt off their list because of the presence of two veteran guards, Dunn signed on and the trio has been productive.

Gibson, making his 467th career start in his 12th season, picked up his 194th career victory for the Ducks.

Cutter Gauthier set up the score with a backhand pass from below the goal line to Leason in front of the crease.   Columbus, playing the second half of a back-to-back set that began with a 5-2 loss at Los Angeles on Saturday, tied it near the end of the period on a power-play goal by Chinakhov. He blasted a one-timer from the right point that squeaked past Gibson for his fourth goal of the season.

After the duo of Markus Burton and Braeden Shrewsberry led the way in a 29-point win over Stonehill, the second-year coach will be curious to see what the follow up performance looks like Monday night against visiting Buffalo in South Bend, Ind. Notre Dame (1-0) followed its strong finish to the first half with a stellar second half in Wednesday's 89-60 win over the Skyhawks. The Fighting Irish began putting the game away with a 10-2 run to end the first half and never let up in the second half, leading by at least 20 throughout the final 16 minutes. ""I'm sitting in the locker room by myself thinking, 'Man, we've got to be better.' I didn't think we played well,"" Micah Shrewsberry said. ""And then someone hands me a box score and they scored 60. ""It's a start. You don't want to be perfect on night one. Do not peak on Nov. 6. We have a lot of work to do."" The work began with Burton and Braeden Shrewsberry each finishing with 18 points, while Princeton transfer Matt Allocco chipped in 10 points. Buffalo (2-0) was picked to finish last in the preseason poll in the 12-team Mid-American Conference after going 4-27 in coach George Halcovage's first season. The Bulls are coming off a pair of high-scoring wins over Old Dominion and Fredonia State. After Tyson Dunn hit the go-ahead 3-pointer to beat Old Dominion last Monday, he posted the fourth triple-double in school history with 14 points, 10 rebounds and 14 assists on Friday. Dunn's big game complemented strong showings by Anquan Boldin Jr. (22 points) and Ryan Sabol (28 points). ""We needed them tonight,"" Halcovage said.

Guerschon Yabusele added 20 points for Philadelphia, which continued to play without stars Joel Embiid (knee) and Tyrese Maxey (hamstring). Paul George scored 15 points on 6-of-18 shooting and dished out nine assists for the Sixers, but he didn't play in OT after logging 33 minutes in his continued return from a knee injury.   LaMelo Ball scored 38 points to pace Charlotte, which rallied from a 16-point fourth-quarter deficit and forced overtime on Ball's corner 3-pointer with eight seconds remaining. Brandon Miller chipped in 22 points for the Hornets, while Grant Williams had 17 off the bench.   The Sixers survived in overtime to snap a five-game losing streak and defeat the Hornets for the 24th time in the last 26 meetings.  McCain's bucket with 1:26 left in overtime put Philadelphia in front, 103-102, and Kelly Oubre Jr.'s foul shots with 58 seconds remaining gave the Sixers the lead for good. Caleb Martin made two clutch free throws with two seconds left to make it a three-point game. Williams split a pair of free throws after being fouled by Yabusele following Martin's foul shots.   Philadelphia led 16-15 after an ugly first quarter, and still held a one-point lead, 46-45, at the half.   The Sixers began to create some separation early in the third quarter as George knocked down a fadeaway jumper and a 3-pointer to put the hosts ahead 58-50. In the final four minutes of the quarter, McCain gave the Sixers a 10-point lead on three separate occasions, including a 3-pointer in the final seconds that created a 76-66 advantage.   Philadelphia's lead grew to 82-66 on Jeff Dowtin Jr.'s jumper with 9:44 remaining, but the Hornets came charging back.   Ball made a 3-pointer to get the visitors within 84-76 and then another with 5:46 left to make it a one-point game.   Miller gave Charlotte the lead twice down the stretch in regulation, including his bucket with 2:30 left that put the Hornets in front, 89-88. However, McCain answered with a 3-pointer and then Martin knocked down one of his own with 1:34 to play, making it 94-89.

Nico Sturm scored on a fortuitous bounce in the first period as the Sharks won for the fifth time in seven games following their season-opening, nine-game losing streak, and that was enough for Blackwood, who withstood a constant barrage from the Devils and constantly limited rebound opportunities. Blackwood highlighted his 11th career shutout by making numerous saves against former teammates Jack Hughes and Jesper Bratt. He made 19 saves in the third, including seven on a late power play that came after Mario Ferraro hooked Nico Hischier with 3:32 left in the game.  Facing the team he appeared in 152 games for from 2018-23, Blackwood made a left pad save on Hughes during the late power play and a diving stop on Hischier with 1:59 left during a scramble in front of the net before stopping Dougie Hamilton and Bratt in the final 90 seconds. Jake Allen made 26 saves for the Devils, who had their season high in shots on goal and were blanked for the second time in 2024-25. New Jersey fell to 5-2-0 in its past seven games and was unable to win a fourth straight contest.  The Sharks scored with 3:39 left in the first period thanks to a breakaway and a fortunate bounce. Carl Grundstrom sprung Sturm on a partial breakaway past Hamilton and Justin Dowling. Sturm's backhander missed the net but went to the right corner of the ice, and the center scored when the puck caromed off New Jersey forward Timo Meier's left skate. The Sharks saw a goal by Fabian Zetterlund disallowed with 7:15 remaining in the second when officials determined his attempt to jam his own rebound into the net resulted in him knocking off Allen's pad. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Anthony Edwards scored 24 points but made only 8 of 22 shots for Minnesota, which saw its three-game winning streak end. Julius Randle finished with 17 points, six rebounds and six assists, and Naz Reid contributed 15 points off the bench.   On the decisive play, Jovic sprinted toward the basket and caught an inbound pass in stride from Duncan Robinson. Jovic finished at the rim and drew a foul against Timberwolves defender Nickeil Alexander-Walker.   The play spoiled what could have been a game-winning basket for Jaden McDaniels, who made a putback shot with nine seconds to go to give Minnesota a 94-92 lead.

De'Anthony Melton hit five of Golden State's season-high-tying 21 3-pointers and finished with 19 points and 10 rebounds. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 24 points but was just 6-of-17 from the field, including 1-for-5 in the fourth quarter.  Oklahoma City played most of the game without star center Chet Holmgren, who injured his right hip on a hard fall after a midair collision with the Warriors' Andrew Wiggins in the first quarter. Holmgren finished scoreless for the first time in his career, going 0-for-3 from the field, and had four rebounds. The Thunder trailed 107-77 late in the third but got within 114-108 in the fourth after Alex Caruso stole an inbounds pass and streaked to the other end for a dunk. Oklahoma City immediately forced another turnover, this one by Curry, but couldn't take advantage again. Golden State scored on its next two possessions, the latter coming on Curry's sixth 3-pointer that made it 119-108 with 3:23 remaining.  Curry scored five more points the rest of the way as the Thunder never got closer than seven.

Mrazek outdueled Minnesota counterpart Filip Gustavsson (20 saves) to help Chicago end a 12-game winless streak against its Central Division rival. The Blackhawks netted the game-winner after intercepting a pass. Seth Jones sent a pass to Kurashev, who streaked down the left side before beating Gustavsson with a wrist shot. The Blackhawks fought off consistent pressure from the Wild, who outshot Chicago 19-4 in the third period. Matt Boldy evened the score at 15:29 of the third period, burying a chance when a rebound trickled to him just inside the left circle. Boldy missed an opportunity to tie the score moments earlier, sending a shot off the crossbar that glanced off Mrazek's body before Nick Foligno poked it away from the net. Chicago's Ryan Donato hit the post shortly after the goal. The Blackhawks opened the scoring at 16:44 of the first period, when Jason Dickinson tallied an unassisted goal. Swooping in to gather a loose puck along the right-wing boards, he came through the circle and moved into the slot before sending a wrist shot over Gustavsson's blocker. Chicago was awarded two power plays on separate tripping calls in the first 5:50 of the game but failed to convert. Mrazek proved especially resourceful in the closing seconds of the second period. After losing his stick in front of the crease, he accepted Taylor Hall's stick and used it to stop Jake Middleton's wrist shot from the left circle. Wild coach John Hynes shuffled lines in stretches during the game, including grouping Kirill Kaprizov, Joel Eriksson Ek and Boldy. Kaprizov saw his streak of eight consecutive multipoint road games snapped, although he did get the primary assist on Boldy's goal.

UCLA (1-1) gave up 21 points off 21 turnovers in a 72-64 loss to New Mexico on Friday in Henderson, Nev. The 21 turnovers were the most by a Mick Cronin-coached team since his first season at UCLA, 2019-20, when the Bruins had 22 turnovers vs. North Carolina.  ""I'm extremely disappointed in some of our guards,"" Cronin said. ""There are three things you've got to do: defend, rebound, and take care of the ball. We didn't take care of the ball."" Maintaining possession has been a hallmark of Cronin's UCLA teams. The Bruins averaged fewer than 11 turnovers per game in each of the previous four seasons. In 2021-22, UCLA averaged just 8.9 turnovers a contest.  Rediscovering that identity promises to be a point of emphasis for a veteran, but still new-look Bruins lineup. Four of the five starters against New Mexico are transfers: Eric Dailey Jr., Skyy Clark, Kobe Johnson and Tyler Bilodeau.  Meanwhile, the lone returning starter -- Dylan Andrews -- scored just four points while committing six turnovers on Friday.  Andrews, Sebastian Mack and Lazar Stefanovic, three of UCLA's top performers a season ago, combined for just eight points vs. New Mexico.  ""Dylan and Sebastian were throwing the ball away for layups,"" Cronin said. ""I told them, ‘Guys, we were better than that last year.'"" Just one Bruin scored in double figures on Friday -- Bilodeau with 23 points -- after four Bruins notched at least 12 points in their 85-50 season-opening win over Rider on Nov. 4. UCLA aims to regain that balance when winless Boston University comes to Pauley Pavilion.  The Terriers (0-2) come into the matchup after losing 74-60 at San Diego on Friday. Boston gave up 40 second-half points to the Toreros after surrendering 42 second-half points in its 80-72 loss to crosstown rival Northeastern on opening night.  Forward Malcolm Chimezie was a bright spot for Boston in its first two games. After scoring 14 points against Northeastern, he had nine points and nine rebounds at San Diego.  Boston guard Ben Palacios, who missed the season opener, scored 15 points in 17 minutes off the bench against San Diego. The Terriers head into UCLA missing forward Otto Landrum, who averaged 8.5 points and 5.3 rebounds a season ago; and guard Ethan Okwuosa, who averaged 7.5 points and 4.2 rebounds last season.  ""This is going to be our team for a while. We're going to be without Ethan and Otto for a good stretch, and we're going to have to figure this out,"" Terriers coach Joe Jones.

Diebler is in his first full campaign as head coach for Ohio State after replacing the fired Chris Holtmann on Feb. 14. Diebler went 8-3 as the Buckeyes' interim head coach last season. Sharp 3-point shooting was key for Ohio State (1-0) against the Longhorns. The Buckeyes shot 14-of-28 from distance, 50 percent clip they surpassed only four times last season. ""We really just want to get a good look,"" Diebler said. ""We want to play with an aggressiveness and confidence to take the first good look we can get."" Youngstown State's Ethan Faulkner won his head coaching debut for the Penguins (1-0) with an 80-60 victory at Chicago State on Saturday.  Faulkner was the associate head coach the past two seasons after three as an assistant coach at Youngstown State. It was a delayed start of the season for the Penguins because the originally scheduled opener against Westminster on Nov. 4 was postponed due to a power outage on the Youngstown State campus. The Penguins have won 20 games in consecutive seasons, but Faulkner has only three returning letterwinners and knows his team is a work in progress.  ""We are certainly making progress, but I think we need to continue to improve in all areas,"" Faulkner told the Tribune Chronicle.

After a 20-17 overtime loss in Germany at the hands of Bryce Young’s Carolina Panthers, the Giants are 2-8. Now let’s be clear on something. Nobody really expected the Giants to be much of anything this year. They pretty much waved the white flag on 2024 when they let the best running back in the game, Saquon Barkley, walk away to a division rival on a long-term deal back in March. Their 2-8 record isn’t as embarrassing when you realize that it should not be unexpected. Despite never showing the true, intangible traits of a Super Bowl-caliber quarterback, the Giants decided to extend Jones to a four-year, $160 million contract. Everyone online trolls Jones for his ineptitude, but that’s just who he is as a quarterback. It’s who he has always been. It’s who he will always be. But it’s time to move on. The contract has an out this offseason and the Giants would be flatout stupid to not exercise that clause. They likely will. Remember, they were in on several quarterbacks in the 2024 NFL Draft class, but ultimately selected wide receiver Malik Nabers with the No. 6 overall selection. Moving off of the No. 6 overall pick in 2019, Jones would cost the Giants about $22 million in dead cap space, but that’s not that much money as long as your new quarterback is still on his rookie deal. It’s practically how the Denver Broncos have their head above water after the Russell Wilson fiasco, which is comedically working out for the Pittsburgh Steelers as well. But Jones isn’t a solo actor in the crime of the 2024 Giants. Daboll shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near the next quarterback. Neither should offensive coordinator Mike Kafka.  It’s time for a fresh start with a fresh quarterback.  Jones has a 22-44-1 record as the starter for the Giants. Replacing Eli Manning was never going to be easy, but Jones probably was never going to be the guy to make that happen. Dynasties in football are rare. Not everyone can be the Green Bay Packers, who consistently spit out franchise quarterbacks. The Steelers have struggled to replace Ben Roethlisberger since his retirement. After Tom Brady's departure, the New England Patriots have already drafted two different first round QBs. These guys don't exactly grow on trees. There's no guarantee that the next guy will be a hit for the Giants, and that goes for the coach or quarterback. But it can’t really be much worse than what they have now. Copyright 2024"

It was the Magic's second straight win without injured star Paolo Banchero, who last played Oct. 30 because of a torn oblique. Eleven different players scored for the Magic, six in double figures, with Cole Anthony scoring a season-high 16 off the bench. Washington has lost four in a row, and their scoring output was their lowest of the season. The Wizards' starting lineup included three rookies (Alex Sarr, Kyshawn George and Carlton Carrington) and second-year pro Bilal Coulibaly, who scored 20.  Jordan Poole led the Wizards with 24 points on 8 of 19 from the floor, including 3 of 10 from 3-point range. Carrington was hurt when Moritz Wager fell into his leg with 4:49 left in the game. He did not return. Orlando broke open a five-point game at halftime with a big third quarter, outscoring Washington 30-16. The Magic put together a game-changing 13-2 run capped by a traditional three-point play by Kentavious Caldwell-Pope to make it 77-62 in 6:25 left in the third. The lead changed hands in the first quarter with the Wizards taking a 15-12 advantage on a three by Sarr, but Orlando closed the quarter strong. Moritz Wagner and Franz Wagner made back-to-back threes to give Orlando a 24-20 lead, and they maintained a four-point edge after one. George got hot for Washington in the second quarter, making four threes, but the Wizards' defense collapsed. The Magic went on a 10-0 run with rookie Tristan Da Silva making a corner three followed by a three by Caldwell-Pope, Fritz Wagner's layup and a two-pointer from Da Silva to go up 54-40. George answered for the Wizards with eight straight points, including two threes, but the Magic led 61-56 at half.  The third quarter was all Magic. Poole collected three quick fouls in the first three minutes, giving him four for the game, and went to the bench. The Magic capitalized. Franz Wagner converted a traditional three-point play, Jalen Suggs sank a three and the Magic led 83-66 with 3:15 left in the quarter. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Vegas is 8-0-0 at T-Mobile Arena this season, outscoring its opponents an impressive 43-19 in the process. The eight-game home unbeaten streak matches the team record set in its inaugural season in 2017-18 when the Golden Knights made a storybook run to the Stanley Cup Final. The home-ice success is the main reason the Golden Knights are just one point behind the first-place Los Angeles Kings in the Pacific Division. Vegas has won just once in six road games (1-3-2). The Golden Knights return from a two-game road trip that saw them pick up their first road win of the season, 4-2, at Edmonton on Wednesday, and then follow that up with a 4-3 overtime loss at Seattle on Friday. Vegas jumped out to a 2-0 first-period lead over the Kraken but needed a fortunate 6-on-5 goal by Alex Pietrangelo with 1:22 to go to force overtime. Pietrangelo was attempting a pass that deflected in off the skate of Seattle defenseman Adam Larsson to tie it, 3-3. Jared McCann scored on a breakaway 29 seconds into overtime to win it for the Kraken. ""We got three of a possible four (points) on the road trip, so it's definitely a step in the right direction, but we definitely have some things to clean up, too,"" forward Tanner Pearson said. ""We wanted four (points), three's pretty good,"" Golden Knights coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""If you look at the big picture that part is pretty good. I just felt we certainly had a chance to get all four. We let that get away."" The win over the Oilers was a costly one, however. Captain Mark Stone, second on the team with 21 points (six goals, 15 assists) suffered a lower-body injury that kept him out of the Seattle loss. ""Day-to-day but we don't anticipate that he'll play (Monday),"" Cassidy said of Stone's status. Carolina had an eight-game winning streak snapped with a 6-4 loss to Colorado on Saturday night. The Hurricanes had to fly to Denver on the morning of the game because of extreme winter weather on Friday and the long day of travel, combined with the mile-high altitude, seemed to take its toll on Rod Brind'Amour's squad as the contest went on. Carolina took a 3-2 lead in the second period on a power-play goal by Martin Necas, but Colorado answered with three goals over a three-minute span at the end of the period to build a 5-3 cushion. The Hurricanes cut it to 5-4 on Jordan Martinook's second goal of the game early in the third period, but Mikko Rantanen sealed the victory for the Avalanche with an empty-netter with 50 seconds remaining. Brind'Amour refused to use his team's travel problems as an excuse for their first loss since Oct. 19 at St. Louis. ""There's no excuses because we came out really well,"" Brind'Amour said. ""But once we got into it, you could see that we were just hanging on really, and you can't hang on against that team. We had a couple guys (who) just didn't have it tonight. You could see we were just out of gas."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Goaltender Tristan Jarry is also coming back.,The Penguins sent","It is not just the Pittsburgh Penguins returning home Monday to face the Dallas Stars. Goaltender Tristan Jarry is also coming back. The Penguins sent down their former top netminder, who led the league with six shutouts last season, to AHL affiliate Wilkes-Barre/Scranton on Oct. 24 after he struggled mightily on the ice. In three games with the top club, Jarry yielded 12 goals on just 73 shots. He stayed on the ice less than 12 minutes in his last game with the Penguins, giving up three goals on just five shots against the Buffalo Sabres on Oct. 16, a game that Pittsburgh rallied to win 6-5 in overtime. Jarry went 4-1 in five games in the AHL with a 2.16 goals-against average. He told reporters Sunday that he appreciated being able to play consecutive games. Whether he gets that chance immediately with Pittsburgh, which earned three points on its three-game road trip, will be up to coach Mike Sullivan. The longtime leader behind the bench now has three goalies from which to choose. While praising Jarry, he did not say whether he'd immediately come back to the No. 1 position. ""I think one of the potential benefits of it is, one of them will have an opportunity to get quality practice time if that particular goalie isn't backing up,"" Sullivan told reporters Sunday. ""For example, this week, we got four games this week. There's a lot of opportunity there."" Pittsburgh capped its road trip with a 4-2 win Friday over the rival Washington Capitals. The Stars, meanwhile, are finally getting back into the swing of things after playing two games in Finland against the defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers to start the month. They had five days off before the two-game, two-day series, and then another four days off before beating the Chicago Blackhawks 3-1 on Thursday. On Saturday, Dallas lost 4-1 at Winnipeg, which has lost only once in 15 games this season. Much like the two games in Finland, which the Stars lost to the Panthers, Dallas coach Peter DeBoer said Saturday's game was also a chance to see where his team ranks among Cup contenders. Winnipeg jumped out to a 4-0 lead with more than 12 minutes left in the second period. DeBoer pulled netminder Jake Oettinger midway through the game after giving up the four goals on just 15 shots. ""I think so,"" DeBoer told reporters after the loss. ""I think when you look at these guys and Florida, you know, they've exposed us, and we've got to be a lot better. I think we've beaten the teams we should beat, but when we've had opportunities to play the top teams in the league, we haven't risen to the occasion."" The game will also be a showcase for some of the top veteran scorers in the league. Stars center Matt Duchene, 33, leads the team with seven goals and 15 points. Right behind him in goals with six is 32-year-old Tyler Seguin. For Pittsburgh, the ageless duo of Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby continues to lead the way. Malkin, 38, leads the team with 13 assists and 18 points. Crosby, 37, is tied with Rickard Rakell to lead the team with six goals. Crosby also ranks second on the team with 16 points. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Heading into a clash with the host Calgary Flames on Monday, the Kings have not lost consecutive games since the first week of the season. ""That's character and will to win, and veteran leadership,"" Los Angeles coach Jim Hiller said. ""Those guys have to get out there and organize the team without practicing much. If you don't have veteran guys or leadership like we have, it makes it pretty tough."" The Kings are set to open a quick two-game road swing on the heels of a 5-2 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets on Saturday and have won six of their past nine outings. Los Angeles showed the ability to bounce back during its win on Saturday, which followed a 4-2 loss to the Vancouver Canucks on Thursday.  ""After a loss, you want to come out with a good response,"" Kings defenseman Mikey Anderson said. ""First period, we all thought was so/so but we liked it a lot better in the second, so everyone is happy to come away with two points."" The team's defensemen have combined for 11 goals this season, tied for tops in the league, thanks to another couple against the Blue Jackets. ""Our forwards help us, they get to the net hard,"" Anderson said. ""They've done a good job creating traffic and we're just trying to shoot, get something down there and create something for them to get grinding."" Kings forward Phillip Danault is riding an assist streak of five games, with six points (one goal, five assists) during that run. The Flames return home after a good-news, bad-news three-game road trip that ended with a 3-2 shootout loss to the Sabres on Saturday. Calgary's 1-0-2 trip started with a victory against the Montreal Canadiens before the Flames fell in consecutive extra-time meetings with the Boston Bruins and Buffalo.  ""Four of six points. Not great, not just OK, but good,"" Calgary defenseman MacKenzie Weegar assessed. ""Battled back in a few games to get points, but you know, we come back next road trip, we want to win these games, not just get one point."" The Flames trailed in the third period during all three games of the trip. The comebacks are a point of pride, but Calgary is aware that good teams don't trail time and time again. ""We know that we've got to be better going home now,"" Calgary captain Mikael Backlund said. ""We know first period's going to be a big key for us. It's great that we (came) back and showed character, resilience, staying in every game, fighting back and get points, but if you want to win games, we've got to start to have better first periods."" That said, Calgary coach Ryan Huska is not about to criticize his players too much. The Flames have gained points in four of their past five games and are hanging tough in the standings. ""There's a lot of good things,"" Huska said. ""There's areas that we have to work on, and they're the common things that we'll continue to hammer on with our players."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Colorado hung on to win, splitting its last two games because goaltender Alexandar Georgiev seems to have found his confidence. Georgiev was pulled from his first two starts and appeared to have lost his grip on the No. 1 role, but he has turned it around. He will likely be in net Monday night in Denver when the Avalanche play the Nashville Predators in the second of a four-game homestand. Georgiev was strong in a 1-0 loss at Winnipeg on Thursday night, and big saves in the first period against Carolina on Saturday night gave Colorado a chance to rally to a 6-4 win. ""I felt like that game could have got away from us in the first 10 minutes and it didn't, and that was because of Georgie,"" Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said. ""He just gave our team a chance to come around. And that's what we need from our goaltending."" If Georgiev can keep performing, it bodes well for Colorado as it starts getting other players back. Miles Wood has been out two weeks with an upper-body injury but skated with the team on Sunday. Jonathan Drouin (upper body) hasn't played since the opener but is trending towards a return and Bednar confirmed Sunday that Valeri Nichushkin, who has been suspended since last May, will be in the lineup Friday night against Washington. The Avalanche have plugged holes to get through the beginning of the season, and it helps having Nathan MacKinnon and Cale Makar in the lineup. MacKinnon had four points in the win over the Hurricanes to move atop the scoring leaders, and Makar leads NHL defensemen with 24 points. Despite their production, Colorado has a losing record. ""All you can do is have a great effort and we've been doing that. Probably Chicago, at home, was our last bad game. We've been playing really well. I think we deserve more wins than we've gotten,"" MacKinnon said. Nashville enters Monday night's game having lost five of its last seven. One of the two wins came against the Avalanche on Nov. 2 and the other was Saturday night's 4-0 win over the Utah Hockey Club. Forward Jonathan Marchessault had a goal, just his third in 15 games, but he isn't concerned about his low output. ""Sometimes it's about getting chances, and I felt tonight I had a couple chances,"" Marchessault said. ""So that's a positive. Score or don't score, I think at the end of the day I just want scoring chances. That means I'm doing something good. And create chances for my teammates as well."" The Predators have been streaky this season, just like Colorado. They lost their first five, then won three straight before this latest stretch. Forsberg, who leads the team with eight goals, scored twice Saturday night. ""To see (Forsberg) be (Forsberg) and take over a game was really important for our group,"" coach Andrew Brunette said. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""I'm glad that I managed to play this kind of level,"" said Sinner, who lost to Djokovic in the championship match last year. ""It's a great start for my side for this event, for this tournament, considering I haven't played an official match in four weeks. ""Every match, it's very difficult to play against (de Minaur).

He won 33 of his 39 first-service points (84.6 percent) and hit nine aces without a double fault. By contrast, Medvedev had eight aces but suffered eight double faults. ""(The serve) was a big part of it for sure,"" Fritz said. ""(Medvedev) is such a good returner.

Per the report, Golden sent ""photos and videos of his genitalia while traveling for UF,"" used social media to make sexual advances and request sexual favors, and stalked women. He is alleged to have taken photos of women, then send the pictures to them, and also of making visits to places where he knew he could find those same women. The Alligator interviewed two women who said they had complained about Golden, and they corroborated the Title IX documents. They said Golden had followed, then unfollowed, numerous women on social media to avoid suspicion, and one of them said his reach to women was vast. He told many women they were ""his drug"" or ""his good luck charm"" before games, she said. ""He just had this manipulation tactic over everyone,"" the woman told The Alligator. ""And he sent us all the same (messages). It was copy-paste to every girl."" Golden, 39, was hired March 18, 2022, as the 20th head coach in Gators history. He came from San Francisco, where he led the Dons to a 57-36 record over three seasons, including a pair of 20-win seasons and their first NCAA Tournament bid in more than two decades. Last season, in his second campaign with the Gators, Golden led the team to 24 wins, a No. 7 seed in the NCAA Tournament, and the SEC tournament championship game for the first time since 2014. After the season, Golden signed an extension that runs through the 2029-30 season. The No. 21 Gators are 2-0 on the season. Golden is married and the father of a young son and daughter. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Country Club. Langer, 67, shot his age or better for the third day in a row with his final-round, 5-under-par 66 to get to 18-under 266 for the week at the PGA Tour Champions' season finale. He hadn't won a tournament this season until Sunday, meaning at the last possible minute he extended his streak to 18 straight seasons winning at least one title. Langer also extended his record to 47 wins on the PGA Tour Champions. ""Was that exciting or what?"" Langer said on the Golf Channel broadcast. Alker, 53, won his second Schwab Cup in three seasons on the 50-and-older circuit. He entered the week No. 2 in the points race and passed leader Ernie Els of South Africa by tying for second in the 72-hole finale. Langer hit a poor tee shot and second shot at the 17th hole, leading to a bogey and a three-way tie at 17 under with Alker and Richard Green of Australia. Green was in the clubhouse with a 6-under 65 and preparing for a possible playoff at 17-under 267. He entered the week No. 6 in points and needed to win the tournament to win the Schwab Cup. Langer landed his approach shot at the par-5 18th much further than Alker, but his putt turned from left to right at the last second and dropped for a massive birdie. Langer dropped his putter and tossed his visor in celebration. Langer said his caddie, Terry Holt, had told him, ""It's one more putt."" ""He's a prophet, I guess,"" Langer said. Alker then left his birdie try short, failing to force a playoff. But with Green also coming up short, Alker had the Schwab Cup in the bag. ""It's been a heck of a journey,"" Alker said at the trophy presentation before thanking his team. ""... Obviously, I would have liked to win today, but Bernhard, we're gonna give a hand for Bernhard because he's incredible. He really is."" Alker shot a 66 with six birdies and one bogey, following Saturday's hugely important round of 63. He collected the Schwab Cup despite winning just one tournament this season, the season opener in Hawaii. But he had four runners-up and 15 top-10s entering the week. ""It's a season-long race, right, and so consistency, you want to try to get some wins in there as well,"" Alker said. ""I'm proud of the fact that I kept that consistency over the last few years."" Langer arrived at the course with a one-shot lead over Alker through 54 holes. He birdied his first four in a row and six of his first nine for a 6-under 30 before bogeying Nos. 10 and 11. ""I played good and then got a little unraveled there on the back nine, and Steven Alker got going,"" Langer said. Alker birdied Nos. 14, 15 and 17 to join the late tie with Langer and Green. Germany's Alex Cejka (68) was a distant fourth at 13 under. Australian Rod Pampling also shot 68 and placed fifth at 10 under. Els came in a tie for 13th at 7 under after posting a final-round 67, his best round of the week. The former World No. 1 was seeking his first Schwab Cup. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

McCullough, 44, had been with the Dodgers in a variety of roles since 2014 but has prior managing experience in the Toronto Blue Jays' minor league system from 2007-2014. He compiled a 402-357 record across various stops in the Gulf Coast League, Class-A and Advanced-A levels. While with the Dodgers, he overlapped with Gabe Kapler, the former Philadelphia and San Francisco manager who's now Miami's assistant general manager. McCullough is credited with improving Shohei Ohtani's running game -- he became the first player to have a 50-50 season in 2024, with 59 stolen bases and 54 home runs. McCullough pitched to Mookie Betts in the 2023 Home Run Derby, when Betts described him as his ""favorite coach ever."" McCullough and the Dodgers won the World Series last month. The Marlins are replacing Skip Schumaker after the sides parted ways at the end of a 62-100 season. As a player, McCullough played catcher in the minor leagues in the Cleveland organization.

Murray finished with 22 completions in 24 attempts, throwing for one touchdown and running for two more scores as Arizona (6-4) won its fourth straight and remained in first place in the NFC West. In completing his final 17 passes, Murray broke the team record of 16 straight, set by Carson Palmer. It is the best start through 10 games for Arizona since it opened the 2021 season with seven straight wins. The Cardinals were sharp against a Jets defense which entered as the fourth-best unit in the league, yielding 290.8 yards per game. Arizona scored four touchdowns and a field goal on its first five possessions. From there, New York (3-7) never seriously challenged. The Cardinals held the Jets to 207 yards. It was the third straight home game in which Arizona did not yield a touchdown. Aaron Rodgers completed 22 of 35 passes for 151 yards without a touchdown or an interception for the slumping Jets, who lost for the sixth time in their last seven games. In his fourth game with New York, Davante Adams had six catches for 31 yards on 13 targets. The Cardinals tallied a touchdown on their opening drive for the sixth time this season, needing just six plays to score as James Conner cashed in on a 1-yard run. The touchdown came two plays after Conner took a misdirection screen from Murray and tiptoed down the sideline after eluding a tackler at the Jets' 20. Conner accounted for 113 yards from scrimmage, including 80 yards on five receptions. Trey Benson added 62 yards on 10 rushes, helping fuel a Cardinals offense which produced 406 yards. When Murray scored untouched, jogging into the end zone on a 1-yard touchdown run, it put the Cardinals up 14-3 late in the first quarter. Murray began his completion streak in the second quarter, going 8-for-8 on a 70-yard touchdown drive which he capped with a 9-yard scoring pass on a fade route to Marvin Harrison, which increased the Cardinals lead to 21-6. Chad Ryland's 37-yard field goal on the final play of the first half made it 24-6. With a 12-yard touchdown run on Arizona's first possession of the second half, Murray stretched the lead to 31-6. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

It was the fifth straight win for the Eagles (7-2), who climbed into first place in the NFC East and halted a six-game skid at AT&T Stadium.   Playing without starting quarterback Dak Prescott, the Cowboys (3-6) lost their fourth consecutive game overall and fell to 0-4 at home for the first time since 2010. Dallas has been outscored 153-59 at home.   Hurts passed for 202 yards and rushed for 56. Saquon Barkley had 78 yards from scrimmage and collected his first win over the Cowboys after going 0-10 while with the New York Giants. A.J. Brown caught five passes for 109 yards.   With Prescott sidelined by a hamstring injury, backup Cooper Rush struggled in his first start since 2022. Rush had only 45 yards on 13-of-23 passing before being replaced in the fourth quarter by Trey Lance, who completed 4 of 6 throws for 21 yards. Dallas turned it over five times and finished with just 146 yards of offense.   The Eagles turned Dallas's first giveaway into the first points of the game after Rush fumbled a snap and Milton Williams recovered at the Cowboys' 17-yard line.   Four plays later, Hurts' 1-yard run made him the third quarterback in NFL history with 50 rushing touchdowns (Cam Newton, Josh Allen) and put Philadelphia up 7-0 with 7:05 left in the first quarter.   Hurts turned it over twice in the second quarter, an interception by Trevon Diggs in the end zone and a fumble that was recovered at the Eagles' 6-yard line, but Dallas only converted those miscues into three points.   Brandon Aubrey's second field goal made it 7-6 with 1:48 left in the half, but Hurts marched the Eagles 84 yards in 85 seconds and tossed a 14-yard touchdown to Dallas Goedert for a 14-6 lead at intermission.

After passing William Byron by going from fifth to first in one lap following a restart with 54 laps to go, Logano kept his No. 22 Team Penske Ford out front and went on to win by 0.33 seconds over defending champion Blaney, giving owner Roger Penske his third straight title. Logano made it into the championship playoffs after Alex Bowman was disqualified after the Southern 500 at Darlington. He parlayed that into his third title -- also doing it in 2018 and 2022 -- and became the 10th racer all-time to win at least three Cup titles. Byron, Kyle Larson and Christopher Bell completed the top five in the race that featured four cautions. Title contender Tyler Reddick was sixth. Carson Hocevar finished 18th and earned Rookie of the Year honors. Two-time champion Kyle Busch was 21st and failed to win over the 36 races, ending his NASCAR-record streak of 19 consecutive seasons with at least one win. In his final start as a full-time driver, 2017 Cup winner Martin Truex Jr. brought them to green from the pole position at the Arizona desert's 1-mile track, but teammate Ty Gibbs created the first caution when he scrubbed the wall in Turn 4 in his No. 54 then smacked the Turn 2 wall hard on Lap 2 in a single-car incident. Logano powered past Truex on the restart and set the pace in the 312-lap event to close 2024. Soon, all four of the title contenders were running inside the top 10 before the halfway point of 60-lap Stage 1, which Logano won after leading 54 laps. However, Logano's pit crew had difficulties on the right side during the pit stop, gridding him fifth when the group led by Chase Elliott left pit road with Byron and Blaney running in third and fourth. In the race's oddest moment as the field was about to restart, the Toyota pace car turned late onto pit road and made hard contact with the sand-filled yellow barrels abutting the beginning of the pit road outer wall. That wreck created a red-flag period. A week after being penalized for wall-riding on the final turns at Martinsville and eliminated from title contention, Bell had the look of a champion on the rare Champ 4 weekend when Joe Gibbs Racing did not have an entry among the quartet of Cup seekers. A day after saying he felt wronged by NASCAR and ""cheated"" out of a title chance, Bell had a strong No. 20 JGR Toyota for most of Stage 2. However, Blaney showed his strength by moving past Bell in the final laps as Penske Fords pulled off the segment sweep in the first 185 circuits around the slightly banked layout. With Bell leading following Stage 2's conclusion, Blaney, Byron and Logano occupied the next three spots, while Reddick slotted ninth with 117 laps left. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

A third-year pro out of Oklahoma State, Eckroat joined the tour in 2023 and previously won at the Cognizant Classic in The Palm Beaches in March. Eckroat began the day a stroke behind leaders Justin Lower, Carson Young and Colombia's Nico Echavarria while he was also tied with two other players, Max Greyserman and Joe Highsmith.  That group, with the exception of Echavarria, was tightly aligned through nine holes Sunday, but Eckroat caught fire to begin the back nine of El Cardonal at Diamante, creating some needed separation with four birdies across the first five holes (Nos. 10-12, 14). That hot stretch, paired with his six birdies over his first eight holes, was ultimately necessary, as Eckroat fired his second bogey of the day on the par-5 18th, putting him at 24-under 264 for the tournament. That opened the door ever so slightly for Young (7-under 65), who could have forced a playoff with an eagle on 18. But Young, who carded seven other birdies on the day, settled for another to finish 23 under for the tourney, giving Eckroat a one-stroke victory. Lower (65), who was three strokes back after 17 holes, made up two of them with an eagle on 18 to finish in a tie for second with Young. Eckroat finished with 11 birdies against two bogeys to complete his remarkable day. Greyserman, meanwhile, was steady throughout but could never quite get into position to apply pressure. His eight-birdie, one-bogey day left him at 7 under for the round and 22 under for the tournament. Highsmith finished in fifth place at 19 under with his 4-under 68 final round, while Echavarria landed in a six-way tie for sixth place at 17 under after his 1-under 71. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Lavelle took a pass from Delanie Sheehan near the spot and fired it quickly into the back of the net in the 97th minute. Gotham advance to the semifinals on Nov. 16 or 17 to face the Washington Spirit, which edged Bay FC 2-1 in a quarterfinal game on Sunday. After a fairly quiet first half, the action picked up in the second, and the two sides finally converted. Tierna Davidson broke the scoreless draw to give Gotham a 1-0 lead in the 67th minute off a set piece. Lavelle served the ball into the center of the box and it landed by Davidson, who was amid a crowd of Thorns but got her foot on the ball to send a shot past the arm of goalkeeper Shelby Hogan. It was Davidson's first NWSL goal since 2019, then with the Chicago Red Stars. The Thorns capitalized on a free kick of their own to pull level in the 75th minute. Olivia Moultrie served a cross from the left, and Reilyn Turner jumped for header on the far side, directing just inside the right post. Gotham controlled much of the play in the first half, working more time in the attacking third while managing four shot attempts, one on target. Portland had only one shot attempt, not on target, in the opening 45 minutes. Gotham goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger nearly served up a golden opportunity for Christine Sinclair in the 40th minute when her attempt at midfield hit the star Canadian forward before Gotham recovered the ball in the defensive third. Berger coming out of the box nearly bit the hosts again in the 43rd minute when Portland's Sophia Smith got to the rolling ball first and put it into the empty net, but the goal was nullified for offside. Gotham advance to the semifinals to face the Washington Spirit, which edged Bay FC 2-1 in a quarterfinal game on Sunday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

They started their rally by making three consecutive field goals, including back-to-back 3-pointers by Carter Bjerke, while forcing the Cowboys to miss eight straight shots from the field during that stretch. The Cowboys answered with a 9-0 run that saw St. Thomas go into another lengthy scoring drought over a span of 3:50, falling behind by double digits again until a technical foul by Suemnick sent the Tommies to the line to cut the lead to 28-20. The Tommies couldn't keep the deficit to single digits before the break and went to halftime trailing 33-23.

They're also aware that a torrid start quickly has transformed their profile. ""We know how hard it is to win in this league,"" the Cavaliers' Darius Garland said. ""And now, 11 in a row, 11-0. We're the hunted. We're not the hunters no more."" Cleveland earned its most recent victory behind a furious comeback. Hosting the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday, the Cavaliers sputtered after halftime, scoring only 13 points in the third quarter. Behind a double-double from Evan Mobley (23 points, 16 rebounds) and big scoring efforts from Donovan Mitchell (22 points) and Garland (20), Cleveland steadied things. An 82-68 deficit with 1:03 left in the third became a 105-100 victory. ""Normally, this is 11 games in, you're not thinking about a streak,"" Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson said. ""But tonight, you're like, man, 'I don't want it to end that this way.' ... We're trying to win every game, but it's kind of weirdly in the back of your mind when you're out there competing, like, 'man, we got to keep this thing going.' "" Chicago is aiming to win consecutive games for the second time this season. The Bulls stopped a four-game slide with Saturday's 125-113 win in Atlanta, relying on a big fourth quarter of their own. Chicago outscored Atlanta 35-15 in the final period, benefiting from a balanced attack that produced eight scorers in double figures. Ayo Dosunmu led the way with 19 points, Nikola Vucevic posted a double-double of 18 points and 12 boards, and Zach LaVine and Coby White added 18 points apiece. LaVine returned after missing the past three games with a right adductor strain. ""It's always good to get guys back in the lineup,"" he said. Opponents have outscored the Bulls in the first quarter nine times in 10 games to begin the season. Improved pace and ball movement have been catalysts for helping the team regroup; the Bulls have recorded at least 30 assists five times. ""We just wanted to find a way to get back in the winner's column,"" Chicago guard Josh Giddey said. ""I thought we started the game not great, and that third quarter really got us back in it and that group starting the fourth did an awesome job; the energy was great. I think it was a complete team effort tonight and that's what we needed against a group like this."" Challenging the Cavaliers, the 12th team in NBA history to start a season 11-0, will require sustained sharpness. Cleveland knows that well from the other side, with Saturday's frantic finish continuing the good vibes. ""Defensively, we locked in, got stops, got rebounds, boxed out, didn't miss opportunities,"" Mitchell said. ""We did all the little things, and I think that's what you saw tonight, just the effort as a whole. And that's what made this one special."" Cleveland has won seven of the past eight meetings against Chicago, but the Bulls lead the all-time series 133-101. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

It was the first catch as a Steeler for Williams, who was acquired Tuesday in a trade with the New York Jets, and came on third-and-9 play after the Steelers had fumbled at Washington's 1-yard line on their previous drive. After Chris Boswell's extra point, Washington (7-3) drove to midfield, but Jayden Daniels' pass to tight end Zach Ertz came up a yard short on fourth-and-9. The Commanders would have gotten the ball back, but Russell Wilson drew an offside penalty on fourth-and-1 at the Washington 49 with 1:02 remaining.

Pittsburgh took the early 7-0 lead when Wilson hit Pickens, who made a twisting, diving catch in the end zone for a 16-yard touchdown. Special teams factored heavily into the next two scores. On fourth-and-15 from deep in their own territory, the Steelers faked the punt, but James Pierre dropped the wide-open pass from Miles Killebrew. Washington took over at the 15, and three plays later Ekeler scored from the 1. Early in the second quarter, Washington's Olamide Zaccheaus muffed a punt. The Steelers started again at the 14 and Wilson hit Pat Freiermuth for a 3-yard touchdown. Trailing 14-10, the Commanders took over on their own 6-yard line with 5:39 in the half.

Moody had earlier missed field goals of 49, 50 and 44, with the final one of the bunch coming with 3:09 remaining. Moody's third miss led to Chase McLaughlin's 26-yard field goal for the Buccaneers to tie the game 20-20 with 41 seconds remaining. The Bucs drove to the 49ers' 8-yard line to set up for the game-tying kick with the help of three penalties and a circus 8-yard completion by Baker Mayfield, who escaped pressure and fended off defensive end Nick Bosa long enough to get off a throw. Purdy's 13-yard pass to Jauan Jennings set up San Francisco's game-winning field goal from Moody. Jenings had seven receptions for 93 yards. 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan worked McCaffrey back into the offense mix immediately after missing the first eight games of the season with bilateral Achilles tendinitis. His presence also freed up opportunities for wide receivers Deebo Samuel and Jennings - both of whom had been dealing with injuries - and tight end George Kittle.  McCaffrey, the 2023 Offensive Player of the Year, finished with 39 yards rushing on 13 carries and 68 receiving yards on six catches for San Francisco (5-4). Purdy finished 25-for-36 for 353 yards with touchdown passes to rookie Ricky Pearsall and Kittle. Pearsall's 46-yard TD reception in the first quarter, that gave the 49ers a 7-0 lead, was the first score of the rookie's career and came after he was shot in the chest in a robbery attempt in August. He finished with four receptions for 73 yards. Tampa Bay (4-6) lost All-Pro left tackle Tristen Wirfs to a knee injury in the first half.

The eight-play, 52-yard drive was helped by an over-the-shoulder catch by McCaffrey that went for 30 yards. Tampa Bay took its first lead of the game 17-13 with 14:18 left against a defense withering in 90-degree heat. Running back Bucky Irving sliced in from 12 yards to cap a 12-play, 70-yard drive.

Patrick Mahomes threw for 266 yards and a touchdown for the Chiefs (9-0), who exhaled after a late blunder put them in a precarious position. Butker, who also connected on field goals of 36 and 28 yards, sent the kickoff after his final make of the afternoon out of bounds, giving the Broncos the ball at their own 40-yard line. Denver (5-5) capitalized on favorable field position and was set up for a chip shot to win the game, but Chenal and the special teams preserved the victory by blocking Wil Lutz's field-goal attempt. A defensive turnaround spurred the Chiefs and helped offset inconsistency in the red zone. After allowing 192 yards in the first half, Kansas City yielded just 68 yards in the second half. Denver took a 14-10 lead into halftime, moving the ball quickly and effectively during a pair of second-quarter touchdown drives. Bo Nix, who was 14-for-20 passing for 160 yards in the first half, ended both possessions with touchdown passes, connecting with Devaughn Vele for 6 yards and with Courtland Sutton for 32. Nix finished 22 of 30 for 215 yards. Audric Estime gained 53 yards on 14 yards and Sutton had six caches for 70 yards. Sutton's TD with 6:39 to go in the second quarter put the Broncos ahead 14-3, marking the largest deficit the Chiefs have faced during their 15-game winning streak that includes the postseason. KC responded with a 14-play, 65-yard touchdown drive, capped by a 2-yard scoring pass from Mahomes to Travis Kelce, who had eight catches for 64 yards. Kareem Hunt had 100 yards of total offense for the Chiefs, including 65 yards on seven catches. Attempting to match a career long with a 60-yard field goal in the closing moments of the first half, Lutz was well short. Mecole Hardman retrieved the attempt deep in the end zone and returned it 57 yards to the Chiefs 48 as time expired. Denver finished with four sacks. Chiefs left tackle Wanya Morris left the game with a knee injury in the second half but returned in the fourth quarter. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

It's the recent off-court concerns with Title IX allegations,"No. 21 Florida has been doing just fine on the court after a pair of season-opening wins. It's the recent off-court concerns with Title IX allegations against coach Todd Golden that have dominated the news. In a home battle with Grambling on Monday in Gainesville, Fla., the Gators will try to keep the focus on a promising hoops season. The Gators (2-0) come in off a 98-83 win over South Florida and an 81-60 victory over Jacksonville in the first week of the season. After 24 wins and an NCAA Tournament berth in Golden's second season, Florida is well-positioned to continue an upward trend. The Gators have been led by a powerful scoring quartet who have accounted for over 77 percent of the Florida offense. Senior guards Walter Clayton and Will Richard have averaged 19 and 18 points per game, respectively, while Aussie sophomore Alex Condon (18 ppg) and junior guard Alijah Martin (14 ppg) complete the high-scoring group. Florida has connected on 72.9 percent of its 2-point attempts through two games, which is among the nation's leaders. The Gators' biggest early weakness has been the glass, where they have a net-zero rebounding margin. Despite two early wins, Golden has room for concern with the Gators. ""Fundamentally, we're not great right now,"" he said after Florida's win over Jacksonville. ""Part of it is a combination of being too amped up and trying to run in and trace down the ball, as opposed to hitting bodies."" Golden later reiterated, ""We did not rebound well enough if we want to be the team we're capable of."" Meanwhile, Grambling (1-1) is led by veteran coach Donte Jackson and presents a legitimate challenge. Jackson led the Tigers to 21 wins and the school's first NCAA Tournament berth last season.  This year, Grambling topped NAIA-level opponent Southern-New Orleans 92-42, then dropped a close battle with No. 24 Ole Miss, 66-64. The Tigers led by eight points at halftime in that game but were eventually done in by 22 turnovers. Four Tigers are currently scoring in double figures, led by Kintavious Dozier at 15.0 ppg. Dozier earned all-SWAC honors last season. Among the other top Tigers are Mikale Stevenson (13.5 ppg), NC State transfer Ernest Ross (12.5 ppg) and Antwan Burnett (12.0 ppg, 8.5 rebounds per game). The Tigers, unlike their hosts, have been excellent on the boards, outrebounding opponents by 10.5 rebounds per game, including a plus-six margin at Ole Miss. On the downside, they are one of the worst free-throw shooting teams in the nation at just 59.4 percent. Ole Miss coach Chris Beard spoke at length in praise of Grambling after his hard-fought win. ""We didn't play our best, but the reason we didn't play our best was a lot on the other team -- Grambling,"" Beard said. He later clarified, ""They had our full attention. This isn't going to be one of those deals where Ole Miss didn't play well. That's an NCAA Tournament team. That's where we're trying to get."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

In the 96th minute, a Spirit cross in front of the Bay FC goal bounced off the shoulder of defender Caprice Dydasco and landed in the back of the net. It proved to be the difference in a defensive battle that needed extra time to decide. The second-seeded Spirit will advance to the semifinals and host the winner of Gotham FC and the Portland Thorns, while the inaugural season for expansion side Bay FC ended in disappointment for the No. 7 seed. Neither side netted a goal until deep into the second half, as the Spirit's Aubrey Kingsbury and Bay FC's Katelyn Rowland put forth some of their best goalkeeping efforts of the season. Kingsbury had a highlight-worthy stop in the 35th minute, leaping into the air to punch an attempt over the bar. Rowland denied Trinity Rodman a goal in the 24th minute. In the 82nd minute, Asisat Oshoala finally broke the scoreless draw, knocking in a right-footed shot from very close range to put Bay FC ahead 1-0 with minutes remaining. The ball came to her Penelope Hocking, who corralled a delivery from the corner and sent it to Oshoala to tap in her eighth goal of the season. The Spirit countered, scoring in the 86th minute. After a cross from Rodman was knocked out of the box, Tara McKeown charged up the middle of the field, took possession of the ball and fired a right-footed shot that took a few bounces before dribbling past Rowland into the left corner of the net. Nothing was produced between the two sides in nine minutes of stoppage time to send the elimination game into extra time.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""It was a dream come true, to be honest,"" Harper said. ""Getting a chance to play in front of this crowd, in front of the Riot Squad, it's just crazy. Honestly, a blessing."" Freshman Lathan Sommerville had 11 points and eight rebounds in his first collegiate game. PJ Hayes IV scored 12 points and Jeremiah Williams added 10.

""We practice it every day. Just being able to withstand adverse conditions, rough handlings, staying together and staying connected. Figuring out ways to win."" Although Saint Peter's is winless, both losses have come by seven points or fewer after second-half comeback efforts. On Friday, the Peacocks traveled to UMass Lowell and fell 81-74. Saint Peter's trailed by nine at halftime and by 15 early in the second half before drawing within four points five times down the stretch.

The last time Indiana football reached the top five of the poll was in 1967. Both the Ducks and the Hoosiers are 10-0 after Oregon cruised 39-18 past Maryland and Indiana defeated defending national champion Michigan 20-15. Ohio State, Texas and Penn State, each 8-1, occupy the second through fourth spots of the poll. Tennessee (8-1), BYU (9-0), Notre Dame (8-1), Alabama (7-2) and Ole Miss (8-2) round out the top 10. Indiana rose three places thanks to Georgia and Miami falling out of the top 10. The Bulldogs (7-2) dropped from second to 11th in the poll after Ole Miss beat them 28-10 in Oxford, Miss. Miami (9-1) slipped from fourth to 12th due to its first loss of the season, 28-23 at Georgia Tech. By beating its SEC rival, Ole Miss moved up six spots, the largest rise in the poll this week. There were three newcomers to the poll: South Carolina, Missouri and Tulane in Nos. 23-25, respectively. South Carolina knocked out then-No. 24 Vanderbilt 28-7 on the road at Nashville, Tenn. The other teams to drop out of the rankings were then-No. 17 Iowa State, which lost at Kansas, and then-No. 18 Pitt, which lost at home to Virginia.

Malik Reneau and Oumar Ballo each added 17 points for the Hoosiers (2-0), while Bryson Tucker came off the bench to net 12. Indiana made 61.3 percent of its field goal attempts, including 64.7 percent after halftime, and drew 26 assists off 38 made baskets. Nakyel Shelton scored 15 of his 17 points in the first half to pace the Panthers (1-2), which absorbed their second lopsided loss this week against a Big Ten opponent. They were routed in Monday night's season opener at Illinois 112-67. Zion Fruster added 13 for Eastern Illinois and Artese Stapleton scored 12 points. The Panthers made only 5 of 30 shots after halftime (16.7 percent) after they were 59.3 percent from the floor in the first half. Eastern Illinois owned a 37-36 edge at halftime and expanded it to 43-38 with 18:48 remaining when Sekou Kalle scored in transition off a turnover. Beginning with Ballo's layup on the next possession, Indiana outscored the Panthers 52-12 over the final 18:38. Reneau's layup with 16:53 left put the Hoosiers ahead for good and the margin quickly ballooned. It reached double figures at 56-45 on Tucker's layup at the 13:23 mark and got to 20 at 68-48 when Luke Goode drilled a 3-pointer with 10:08 remaining. It was a 180-degree turn from the first half, when Eastern Illinois ran the motion offense that coach Marty Simmons learned when he played for Bob Knight at Indiana 40 years ago. Shelton started the game with a 3-pointer and the Panthers not only connected on 16 of 27 attempts from the floor but nailed half their 3-pointers. Eastern Illinois used a 17-5 run late in the first half to erase a seven-point deficit and went into the break ahead 37-36. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Steven Crowl and John Tonje finished with 17 points apiece and Max Klesmit added 15 points and five steals for Wisconsin (3-0). Tonje, a transfer from Missouri, also supplied seven rebounds, five assists and two steals. CJ Huntley tallied 13 points and six rebounds, and Jackson Threadgill followed with 11 points for Appalachian State (1-2). Threadgill, however, was also responsible for five of the Mountaineers' 18 turnovers.  Tonje scored seven points during the Badgers' first-half burst, as they turned a nine-point deficit into a 16-point halftime lead.  Crowl, who entered averaging just 6.5 points per game this season, netted four points during that run and kept Wisconsin going to start the second half. He scored seven of the Badgers' first nine points coming out of the break as they extended their lead to 45-26, and the rout was on.  The bulge reached 30 points as John Blackwell's layup capped a nine-point run and pushed Wisconsin ahead 70-40. The Badgers hit 47.1 percent of their shots from the floor for the game, to 37.5 percent for Appalachian State, which also was outscored 48-24 in the paint.  The Mountaineers came out strong, hitting seven of their first nine shots as they built a 17-8 lead. Threadgill and Myles Tate each scored five points in that stretch. Wisconsin's Nolan Winter, who finished with 10 points, eight rebounds and two steals, began the comeback, scoring five points in 35 seconds.

""Doesn't feel great, but I wouldn't say it's horrible, so I think he's indefinite right now. These things can change (in) a week or 24 hours. I don't know."" On Thursday, midway through the first period of a 4-2 win against the Kings, Jeannot was assessed a match penalty for an illegal check to Boeser's head. The NHL Department of Player Safety suspended Jeannot for three games on Friday. Boeser left the game in Los Angeles and missed the Canucks' game Saturday night, a 7-3 loss to the Edmonton Oilers. ""It's a dangerous play, and hopefully Brock is going to be OK,"" Tocchet said. Boeser leads the Canucks with six goals in 12 games, and he has 11 total points. The Canucks called up 20-year-old forward Jonathan Lekkerimaki from Abbotsford of the American Hockey League on Sunday in Boeser's absence. The No. 15 overall selection of the 2022 NHL Draft, Lekkerimaki could make his NHL debut when the Calgary Flames visit Vancouver on Tuesday.

The Golden Eagles were pleased with how they put Friday's game to bed and will try to bring a similar composure into Monday's contest against visiting Central Michigan in Milwaukee. In a game played at Marquette's campus arena that only students were allowed to attend, the Golden Eagles trailed pesky George Mason multiple times in the second half. They slipped behind 51-50 with 13:36 to go after allowing a 3-pointer to Darius Maddox. Marquette (2-0) scored the next five points to flip the lead, then pulled away with a dominant 21-2 run in the closing minutes. Head coach Shaka Smart praised the poise shown by his younger players in particular. ""That's part of doing things the way we do things, is putting up a level of investment,"" Smart said in his postgame press conference. ""Intentionality with their growth in every second of every day. And knowing that on Nov. 8 you are not going to be anywhere near where you want to be at the end of the year. These are valuable, valuable experiences, these games. You just can't replicate them."" The freshmen and sophomores are coming along, but Marquette continues to be steered by a group of veteran leaders. David Joplin put up a game-high 27 points, 10 rebounds and three steals.  Kam Jones, who dropped 32 points in a season-opening win over Stony Brook, was the driving force behind the offense again. He scored 24 points on 9-of-14 shooting and dished eight assists to go with five rebounds and three steals.  ""I'm just out there with a mentality of making the right play, whatever that means,"" Jones said, per the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. ""If that means me scoring, fine. If that means me passing. If that means I'm in the corner with the correct spacing. Whatever it is, that's what I'm trying to do every possession on both ends."" Chase Ross also made key contributions, including scoring seven of his 11 points in the second half. He added five rebounds, four assists and a career-high five steals. Marquette has 23 steals through two games and has scored 46 points off opponents' turnovers. Central Michigan (1-1) hosted Stony Brook on Thursday and squandered a 12-point lead en route to a 73-72 loss. Bryan Ndjonga missed two free throws after being intentionally fouled, and the Chippewas yielded a game-winning layup to Collin O'Connor with three seconds left. Jakobi Heady leads Central Michigan with a 14.5 scoring average through two games. Damarion Bonds, a junior college transfer, made his team debut against Stony Brook and scored 10 points in 10 minutes off the bench, including back-to-back 3-pointers during the first half. ""He has the chance to be an electric scorer, and we got a small glimpse of what he has the ability to do,"" coach Tony Barbee told the Central Michigan student newspaper. ""That's why we recruited Damarion, because he's an electric scorer."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

But coach Will Wade and the reigning Southland Conference champion McNeese State have proved they aren't a team to sleep on. McNeese State became one of the mid-major darlings of college basketball last season, going 30-3 in the regular season and conference tournament. They made the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 22 years, losing to Gonzaga 86-65 in the first round. McNeese State (1-1) started this season on a down note as it fell to South Dakota State 80-73 in their season opener.  ""We've got to get better with our attention to detail, especially with the scouting report,"" Wade said after the opener. ""We've got to get better with our movement on offense and create double gaps. And we've got to get better at driving and playing through contact."" It's likely McNeese State worked through some of those issues as it rebounded with a 111-57 win over the College Of Biblical Studies, who play in the National Christian Collegiate Athletic Association. Guard Javohn Garcia is averaging 18 points for the Cowboys on 60.9 percent shooting from the field. Providence transfer Alyn Breed scored 18 points in the season opener but missed their second game for precautionary reasons. He is expected to play against Alabama. ""His knee had some swelling after our practices (Wednesday),"" Wade said Thursday. ""We had a couple practices (Wednesday), one in the afternoon and one at night, and he had a little swelling after that, so we decided not to risk it. He could have played today, but we got to be smart about that."" The Crimson Tide (2-0) entered the season ranked second in the Associated Press Top 25. They backed up their ranking with a resounding 56-point win over UNC Asheville in the season opener before beating Arkansas State 88-79 in a much tighter affair in their second game.  Mark Sears, the Southeastern Conference preseason player of the year, has been leading the charge for Alabama over the first two games with an average of 19.5 points per game. Guard Labaron Philon leads the team with an average of 6 assists per game in addition to 11 points per game. Philon was one assist shy of a double-double in his collegiate debut. ""He's a great two-way player,"" Alabama coach Nate Oats said about Philon, a freshman. ""He plays really hard on both sides of the ball. ... He's got size and athleticism and he's been playing the right way, really, since he stepped on campus."" Big man Clifford Omoruyi also has been a difference maker for the Crimson Tide. The 6-foot-11 center from Nigeria is averaging 14 points per game and 8.5 rebounds while shooting 91.7 percent (11-for-12) from the field. Only four players with at least 10 field goal attempts on the young season have a better field goal percentage than Omoruyi. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The No. 14 Boilermakers (2-0) look to please their leader when they battle Yale (1-1) on Monday night in nonconference play at West Lafayette, Ind. A showdown with No. 2 Alabama looms on Friday for the program that lost to UConn in last season's national championship game. Also, the contest against the Bulldogs definitely rates tougher than opening foes Texas A&M-Corpus Christi and Northern Kentucky. Yale was one of the darlings of March Madness last season. The 13th-seeded Bulldogs of the Ivy League stunned fourth-seeded Auburn 78-76 in the first round before getting stomped by San Diego State in the second round. So Painter wants a larger effort in Game No. 3 of the season. ""He kind of ripped us a little bit, but it's simple stuff,"" Boilermakers guard Fletcher Loyer said in the postgame press conference following Friday's 72-50 home win over Northern Kentucky. ""It's just talking to each other. We talk off the floor so we can talk on the floor. And he always says, 'If you're doing it, you're saying it.' ""Just making sure we're all being positive with each other, make or missed shots. Just keep talking to each other, and ultimately that leads to success."" Loyer certainly isn't the cause of any dismay as he leads the Boilermakers with an 18.5 scoring average and has knocked down 7 of 10 3-pointers. Trey Kaufman-Renn is averaging 14.5 points and a team-best 7.0 rebounds while top-notch point guard Braden Smith is averaging 11.5 points and a team-high 11.0 assists per game. Starting center Daniel Jacobsen unlikely will be available after sustaining a knee injury one minute into the game against Northern Kentucky on Friday. Painter said Jacobson would undergo an MRI exam Saturday. Will Berg is the likely starter against Yale. The Bulldogs split their first two games, beating Quinnipiac to open the season before losing 91-79 to Illinois-Chicago on Friday. March Madness hero John Poulakidas scored 21 points against UIC and is averaging 20.0 over the first two games. Poulakidas scored 28 points in the mammoth upset of Auburn. He made 10 of 15 shots, including 6 of 9 from 3-point range. Yale coach James Jones is in his 24th season at the school. That upset was his second NCAA Tournament victory. Jones is worried about whether last March could be the Ivy League's last hurrah as recent changes like NIL and the transfer portal work against the education-minded schools in his conference. ""I don't know how feasible it is to continue the success we have nationally in the league, given the new structure of things, where everybody is being paid except for our guys,"" Jones told reporters earlier this month. ""I don't know if we can sustain. Five years from now, is an Ivy League team going to be able to go to the NCAA Tournament and beat an Auburn team? I don't know. ""From that standpoint, it makes it hard. We're 40 minutes away from a Sweet 16 last year and we've gotten (to the second round) twice. I don't know. Different world. Absolutely different world. It's changed, and I don't know if it's changed for the better."" Yale is 0-2 against Purdue and the most recent matchup came in the 2022 NCAA Tournament. The Boilermakers prevailed 78-56. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""Yeah, we have to do a better job of playing simple basketball,"" Otzelberger said. ""I think, offensively, there are times the ball got stuck with one guy and we over-dribbled it,"" he said. ""There are plays on the defensive end that we didn't finish with two hands. We (would get) a rebound, we dribble it off of someone's foot or we have a careless turnover. Things that were just sloppy that are uncharacteristic of how we play."" Despite those imperfections, Iowa State cruised to an 83-44 win over Mississippi Valley State in its opener last Monday. Keshon Gilbert scored 17 points, Tamin Lipsey contributed 16, and Joshua Jefferson and Milan Momcilovic added 10 apiece to lead the Cyclones, who shot only 23.8 percent (5 of 21) from beyond the arc.  That's an area Otzelberger will look to improve upon against Kansas City. ""I thought we had good looks,"" he said. ""Curt (Jones) and Milan, specifically, had really good looks. Overall, we want to shoot the ball better than we did. But I didn't think it was because we didn't have good looks. It was because they weren't falling for whatever reason."" Kansas City will aim to challenge the Cyclones after opening its season with back-to-back, double-digit victories. The Roos cruised to a 124-36 win over Kansas Christian in their most recent game Friday night. The 88-point margin of victory against the NCCAA Division II program is the biggest in program history for Kansas City. The previous record was a 73-point win over Bacone (111-38) on Nov. 18, 2019. ""I felt like we put ourselves in position early to just execute and not have to worry about winning the game, so to speak,"" Roos coach Marvin Menzies said. ""That's something we didn't do in our last game (91-68 win over Hannibal-LaGrange last Monday), so I felt like we took a step in the right direction."" Anderson Kopp scored 22 points to lead Kansas City on Friday. He added five rebounds and three steals. Kasheem Grady II also will look to stay hot for the Roos. He scored 21 points on 7-of-11 shooting from the field, including 5 of 7 from beyond the arc, against Kansas Christian. Menzies said his team needs to be focused for a tough test at Iowa State. ""The train is out of the station now,"" he said. ""So it's rolling. We'll put this game behind us and put all our focus into the next possession."" Menzies and Otzelberger share a connection: Both men were head coaches at UNLV. Menzies spent three seasons there (2016-19) and was immediately succeeded by Otzelberger (2019-21).

Bryce Young completed 15 of 25 passes for 126 yards with a touchdown and Chuba Hubbard churned out a career-high 153 yards on the ground on 28 carries. Giants quarterback Daniel Jones went 22-for-37 for 190 yards with two interceptions. He ran for a touchdown.  Running back Tyrone Tracy Jr. gained 103 yards on 18 carries with a touchdown, but his fumble on the first snap of overtime set up Carolina's winning points.

With the score at 17-14, the teams traded turnovers in the final eight minutes. The Panthers lost a fumble, only to have Jones throw an interception four plays later. New York got the ball back at its own 21-yard line with 2:23 remaining and drove for the tying field goal.  The Giants opened the second half by going 65 yards in 10 plays while consuming more than six minutes off the clock. Tracy ran 32 yards for the touchdown. Carolina responded by marching 80 yards in 10 plays with Hubbard scoring on a 1-yard run. Then in the fourth quarter, the Giants covered 96 yards in 13 plays and used almost seven minutes in doing so. Jones capped the drive by running 2 yards for a score as New York closed within 17-14. Aside from one drive, there wasn't much offense in the first half. The Panthers scored first by going 90 yards in eight plays, with Young connecting with tight end Ja'Tavion Sanders for a 5-yard touchdown play.

NFL Network reported that rest and rehab appear to be the plan of the Jaguars (2-7) for Lawrence. However, surgery remains an option Lawrence and the Jaguars will consider. Mac Jones, who was acquired by Jacksonville via trade in March, will start Sunday's game versus the Vikings (6-2).  Lawrence, 25, will miss the second game of his NFL career. He sustained the injury in the second quarter of Jacksonville's 28-23 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles last Sunday. He finished the game, however, and completed 16 of 31 passes for 169 yards and two interceptions. Jones became party to a controversy when current Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores was fired by the Dolphins. According to former NFL executive Michael Lombardi, Flores told his then-starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa that Miami should've drafted Jones instead. As the starting quarterback of the Patriots, Jones lost to Flores and the Dolphins twice in 2021.

The Sabres followed impressive blowout wins over the Ottawa Senators and the New York Rangers with a 3-2 shootout victory over the Calgary Flames on Saturday. J.J. Peterka scored the game-winning shootout goal, while Tage Thompson fired home his team-leading 10th goal of the season in the victory. Thompson has goals in three straight games and could improve his totals versus a Canadiens' team that he has found success against in his career. The 27-year-old forward has seven goals and seven assists across 12 outings against Montreal. Sabres goaltender Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen has been pivotal to their recent success. Luukkonen has allowed just 2.25 goals per game while winning six of his past eight starts. Head coach Lindy Ruff gave praise to his Finnish netminder following Saturday's shootout victory.  ""He's played very well, the team play has been better and his play has been better,"" Ruff said. ""He's really made key saves. You look at that overtime save he made for us, that allowed us to get the extra point."" Another key to the Sabres' recent success has been their special teams play. After failing to score on their first 22 power-play opportunities to start the season, Buffalo is 7 for 23 on the man advantage over their past seven games. A win on Monday would give the Sabres their first four-game winning streak in 21 months. At the other end of the spectrum, the Canadiens fell to the Toronto Maple Leafs 4-1 on Saturday night, en route to their sixth consecutive loss (0-5-1). One bright spot for the Canadiens has been the play of veteran winger Brendan Gallagher. The 32-year-old scored the Canadiens' lone goal on Saturday, giving him seven on the season, and extended his goal-scoring streak to three games. The 2010 fifth-round pick now ranks 19th all-time in the Canadiens' goal-scoring ranks with 225 career tallies. Canadiens' top scorers Cole Caufield and captain Nick Suzuki have both been held off the scoresheet in each of the past four contests. ""Some of us, myself included, are struggling to produce and find the back of the net,"" Suzuki told reporters after his team's most recent loss. ""I expect better from myself, I'm sure the other guys (do) as well. We need our whole lineup to produce."" Along with their lack of goal scoring, the Canadiens have struggled to keep the puck out of their net. They have allowed 29 goals over the past six losses and scored just 12. The Canadiens recent string of losses seems to be taking a toll on the young squad.  ""It's not great right now. But we're still trying to be positive right now,"" forward Josh Anderson said of the team's feelings. ""Trying to still find our swagger and do the right things. Once we find one, we'll be fine."" The Canadiens enter the matchup in last place in the Eastern Conference and have lost the past two games against the Sabres. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Harlan blasted the officiating late Saturday after the Utes lost to rival BYU, 22-21, on Utah's home field. ""This game was absolutely stolen from us,"" Harlan said. ""We were excited about being in the Big 12, but tonight I am not. We won this game. Someone else stole it from us. Very disappointed."" The Utes, accustomed to being in the mix atop the Pac-12 standings, are struggling in their first year in the Big 12 at 4-5 overall, 1-5 in the conference. Utah clung to a 21-19 led for most of the fourth quarter after a BYU touchdown at the 12:35 mark of the final frame. And twice late in the quarter, the Utes looked as if they were headed to the win. While Harlan didn't specify a call that riled him in particular, it likely occurred in the final two minutes. With 1:56 left, BYU took possession on its 9-yard line, and quarterback Jake Retzlaff fired three straight incomplete passes. The Cougars called a timeout, and on the ensuing fourth-and-10 play, Retzlaff was sacked for a loss that put the ball on the BYU 1-yard-line with about 90 seconds to go. But a holding penalty called on Utah cornerback Zemaiah Vaughn gave BYU new life and the ball at its 19. Retzlaff took advantage, completing passes of 30 yards and 12 yards, and running back Hinckley Ropati's 14-yard run took the ball to the Utah 25 with 1:07 on the clock. A false start penalty on BYU sent the ball back to the Utah 30, and the Cougars spent the next three plays positioning the ball and running down the clock to give Will Ferrin a 44-yard field-goal attempt. which he hit with just three seconds left. ""I will talk to the commissioner. This was not fair to our team,"" Harlan said. ""I'm disgusted by the professionalism of the officiating crew tonight."" Utah coach Kyle Whittingham was angry with officials on the field but let his boss address the officiating postgame. ""Couldn't get that last stop when we needed it, unfortunately,"" Whittingham said. ""That's kind of been the story for several games."" BYU coach Kalani Sitake said refereeing comes with the territory. ""Whatever decision the refs make, I don't think they're trying to get it wrong, so that's just part of the game,"" BYU coach Kalani Sitake said. ""The refs are part of the game. We were able to capitalize on that."" With the win, which came before the largest crowd (54,383) ever at Rice-Eccles Stadium in Salt Lake City, No. 9 BYU moved to 9-0, 6-0 in the conference, to stay firmly in the mix for a College Football Playoff berth. The game marked the first time the in-state rivals have played as conference opponents since 2010 when the teams left the Mountain West Conference. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

NFL Network reported that rest and rehab appear to be the plan of the Jaguars (2-7) for Lawrence. However, surgery remains an option Lawrence and the Jaguars will consider. Mac Jones, who was acquired by Jacksonville via trade in March, will start Sunday's game versus the Vikings (6-2).  Lawrence, 25, would miss the second game of his NFL career. He sustained the injury in the second quarter of Jacksonville's 28-23 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles last Sunday. He finished the game, however, and completed 16 of 31 passes for 169 yards and two interceptions. Jones became party to a controversy when current Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores was fired by the Dolphins. According to former NFL executive Michael Lombardi, Flores told his then-starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa that Miami should've drafted Jones instead. As the starting quarterback of the Patriots, Jones lost to Flores and the Dolphins twice in 2021. The No. 1 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, Lawrence has completed 61.3 percent of his passes for 2,004 yards, 11 touchdowns and six interceptions through nine starts in 2024. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Waring, 39, maintained his one-stroke lead after the third round and shot a 6-under-par 66 on Sunday to finish 24-under at Yas Links. He birdied his final two holes to fend off Hatton and Race to Dubai leader Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland and capture his second career title. He also won the Nordea Masters in 2018. ""It was quite an easy day really, wasn't it? It just means so much,"" said Waring, who pocketed $1.53 million for winning the tournament. ""To actually keep control of myself in the way that I did today I'm really proud of myself."" Waring, who is ranked 229th in the world, will entertain playing as a dual member on the DP World Tour and PGA Tour.  ""I was quite happy living in Dubai to be honest with you,"" he said. ""It's going to be a long way to travel, a long commute over to America. But I'm looking forward to that. It's a new challenge. Absolutely made up."" Hatton collected eight birdies en route to a 64 on Sunday. He finished three strokes ahead of McIlroy (64), Danish golfer Thorbjorn Olesen (66) and Englishman Matt Wallace (63).  McIlroy said he felt like he was in a good position for The Race to Dubai.  ""Yeah, I do feel in a good position,"" he said. ""I saw (South African Thirston Lawrence) making a charge today, and I was keeping one eye on the leaderboard and looking at what he was doing. I saw he posted 20. ""Obviously I wanted to birdie the last, anyway, but I know that birdie, even if it isn't to win the tournament this week, it obviously gives me that little bit extra of a cushion going into next week.  Every shot counts at this moment in time, and I was glad to make the four at the last and at least give myself half a chance at this tournament this week but also give myself a little bit more of a cushion going into Dubai next week as well.""  Lawrence was one of four golfers tied for sixth place at 20-under. Denmark's Niklas Norgaard, who entered the final round just one stroke behind Waring, shot a 70 on Sunday to finish in a three-way tie for 10th place. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Miami’s fall from the fast-thinning ranks of the unbeaten felt like it had been coming for a while. The Hurricanes needed furious rallies in consecutive weeks to beat Virginia Tech and Cal, teams currently with 5-5 and 5-4 overall records. Outgunning Louisville in a 52-45 shootout marked Miami’s third straight game winning a one-score contest. While beating Louisville added an important Top 25 victory to the Hurricanes’ resume, their string of close calls made it clear that a loss in a one-score Atlantic Coast Conference game was probably inevitable. The 28-23 setback to Georgia Tech on Saturday was predictable enough that the playoff selection committee likely had a contingency plan for the ACC pecking order. In Tuesday’s initial reveal, SMU was the next-most highly ranked ACC team. At No. 13, despite sporting two Top 25 wins over Louisville and Pitt, the Mustangs were arguably the most egregiously underranked team in the standings. SMU will likely move into the top 12 by virtue of being the only undefeated ACC team in conference play, thus securing the conference's automatic bid. But where will it be slotted? The Mustangs were on a bye in Week 11, but in some ways, they lost as much as Miami did: Pitt’s 24-19 loss to Virginia likely removes a Top 25 win from SMU’s resume. For SMU to overtake Miami, there needs to be a nine-spot swing. With SMU idle, one of its signature wins losing value, and Boise State winning after being ranked one spot ahead of the Mustangs, the room for Rhett Lashlee’s squad to make a significant jump is limited. If anything other than Miami's loss most benefited SMU’s case, it could have been BYU’s loss to rival Utah in the nightcap. BYU defeated SMU earlier in the season, giving the Mustangs a quality loss. As long as the Cougars remained undefeated, even with the committee’s overall lack of enthusiasm for the Big 12, BYU would be a glass ceiling for SMU. Utah’s 21-19 win provided a fitting punctuation to an upset-filled Week 11 and likely relegated the Big 12 to fifth place among the five automatic qualifiers in the Playoff field. That group—which, through this week, had remained steady with Oregon in the Big Ten and Boise State—was otherwise shaken up by Saturday’s results. The SEC now has three teams with one loss in conference play, and Georgia isn’t one of them. The Bulldogs' placement in Tuesday’s rankings promises to be the most controversial insight into the committee’s strategy, regardless of where Georgia ranks. The Bulldogs beat Texas head-to-head and were rewarded last week by ranking ahead of the Longhorns. That made sense. Following that same logic, Georgia should now fall behind Alabama and Ole Miss in the SEC pecking order, which means the Bulldogs could fall out of the top 12 altogether. Texas and Tennessee remain firmly in the field, both 8-1 overall. Alabama, already in last week’s rankings, now has the same record as Georgia and the head-to-head advantage, which should place the Crimson Tide ahead of the Bulldogs. The same logic applies to Ole Miss, which was on the outside looking in on Nov. 5. Head-to-head results must mean something, which means Georgia should be out of the bracket for now. That could change when the Bulldogs face Tennessee in Week 12. In the meantime, sit with the reality that the heavy preseason favorite to steamroll its way back to the national championship could be eliminated from the field altogether by Nov. 16.

The playoff picture is starting to officially take shape with Week 10 now here, with teams like the Kansas City Chiefs, Detroit Lions and Buffalo Bills all well-positioned to make deep runs this postseason. Others, such as the New York Jets, Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers, had high expectations coming into the 2024 campaign but have vastly underperformed and are running out of time to turn things around. Here are three of our best picks for Sunday: Ever since it dropped back-to-back games bridging September and October, Buffalo has been nearly unstoppable. The Bills are riding a four-game winning streak and have averaged 29.5 points during that span, most recently hanging 30 on the Miami Dolphins in a three-point victory last Sunday. Meanwhile, turning to Joe Flacco under center didn’t pay off for Indianapolis last weekend, as the veteran signal-caller threw for only 179 yards and was picked off once in a 21-13 setback against the Minnesota Vikings. One offense is clicking, the other is in disarray, but oddsmakers seemingly have faith in the Colts’ ability to keep things close at home. Indianapolis is 3-1 at Lucas Oil Stadium this season, and it would be perfect there had it not been for a 29-27 loss to the Houston Texans in Week 1. But the Colts faithful will only be able to do so much on Sunday. With dual-threat quarterback Josh Allen and running backs James Cook and Ray Davis, a budding offensive weapon, Buffalo should have no problem barreling through an Indianapolis defense that allows the second-most rushing yards per game in the NFL (149.8).

After opening with the franchise's first 3-0 start since 2010-11, the Lakers went 1-4 on a five-game road trip. A return home on Friday to face Philadelphia -- and a 116-106 win -- helped Los Angeles ro avoid a three-game skid. Anthony Davis scored 31 points to continue his torrid start to the season.  Davis has scored at least 31 points in six of his eight appearances and grabbed at least 11 rebounds in four outings. His four blocked shots versus the 76ers marked a season high. LeBron James recorded his 114th career triple-double on Friday with 21 points, 13 assists and 12 rebounds. Austin Reaves added 20 points for the Lakers, who improved to 3-1 when he scores at least that many this season.  Another two Lakers players who factored into Friday's win were Cam Reddish and D'Angelo Russell. Los Angeles coach JJ Redick offered praise for the duo after Russell scored 18 points off the bench and Reddish fulfilled a variety of needs.  ""Both those guys starred in the roles they had tonight,"" Redick said. ""Cam took one shot in 27 minutes but had a huge impact on the game defensively in the first half. I know we had three smash-screen assists coming out of set plays; Cam had two of them.  ""That's sacrifice. That's unselfishness.""  Russell, meanwhile, is one of five Lakers scorers averaging in double figures with 12.7 points per game. He joins Davis (32.4), James (23.7), Reaves (17.8) and Rui Hachimura (13.0). Hachimura scored nine points on Friday in his return to the lineup after missing the 131-114 loss at Memphis on Wednesday.  Toronto will play the fourth contest of a five-game road trip on Sunday. This swing has not been kind to the Raptors, as Saturday's 105-103 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers dropped Toronto to 0-3 in this stretch.  On Saturday, Ochai Agbaji and Immanuel Quickley each scored 21 points, Gradey Dick had 15 and Chris Boucher added 14 points off the bench. However, Toronto fell 15 points shy of its per-game scoring average through the previous nine games.  RJ Barrett, who came into Saturday's contest averaging a team-high 25.7 points per game, finished with only 13 versus the Clippers. Getting Barrett going, and pushing the tempo as a team, figure to be top priorities for Toronto on Sunday.  Raptors coach Darko Rajakovic has emphasized a fast pace predicated on ball movement. Toronto went into Los Angeles averaging almost 31 assists per game, most in the NBA.  ""It's the right way to play basketball,"" Rajakovic said on Saturday. ""We're a very young team and it's creating habits now of unselfishness, playing together and playing for each other  ""There are so many examples of great teams that play that way,"" he added, citing Nikola Jokic and his Denver Nuggets, the recent NBA Finals-winning Golden State teams, and the San Antonio Spurs championship teams of previous decades.

The Ducks, who have scored a league-low 27 goals in 13 games (4-7-2), bring a four-game losing streak into the contest. They have dropped the first three outings of a six-game homestand, getting outscored 14-5 in the process.  Anaheim comes in off a 5-2 loss to Minnesota on Friday, falling behind 3-0 in the first period against a Wild team that was playing the second half of a back-to-back set. Trevor Zegras backhanded a penalty shot try over the net in the second period and the Ducks finished 0-for-6 on the power play, managing just two shots on goal and failing to score during a key four-minute double-minor high-sticking penalty on defenseman Zach Bogosian midway through the third period while trailing 3-1.  ""I think any team, no matter how good you are or how old you are or how young you are, when you're not scoring, it's like the balloon is getting bigger and bigger,"" Cronin said. ""We're just waiting for it to pop in a good way and get some goals.""  Said Anaheim defenseman Brian Dumoulin: ""When goals aren't going in, obviously the guys can get frustrated and your game can slip a little because you cheat a little bit to the offensive side. I think we've just got to know that if we defend hard, we'll get chances off of it.""  Robby Fabbri scored his 100th career NHL goal in the loss and Mason McTavish also tallied for the Ducks, who outshot Minnesota, 35-31.  ""When you look back at it, we could have probably scored six goals,"" Cronin said. ""(But) would-have, could-have, should-have doesn't mean anything at the end of the game.""  Columbus also brings a four-game losing streak (0-3-1) into the contest and will be playing the second game of a back-to-back that began with a 5-2 loss at the Los Angeles Kings on Saturday night.  The Blue Jackets led 1-0 after one period on Dmitri Voronkov's tip-in goal but the Kings rebounded to take a 2-1 advantage in the second on goals by defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov and Warren Foegele. Trevor Moore then scored what proved to be the game-winning goal with his team shorthanded early in the third period.  ""Honestly I thought we played a solid game but at the end of the day we want to come out with a win,"" said forward Justin Danforth, who had two assists. ""We've got to find a way to win games. That's what playoff teams do. So we have to get back on track, get a little confidence back, and a big game tomorrow.""  Columbus coach Dean Evason said his team must cut down on the mistakes that led directly to the first three goals by the Kings.  ""The first goal we turn it over,"" Evason said. ""The second goal we make a huge mistake. The third goal we turn it over. That's three goals. We've got a 1-0 lead. In key areas of the ice we have to make the right reads or clearly not turn the puck over (and) give teams momentum to come back after us.

Hughes' current hot streak has the 2019 top overall pick one shy of 300 career points. Hughes will look to add to that total as the Devils attempt to earn their fourth win in a row when they oppose top overall 2024 pick Macklin Celebrini and the San Jose Sharks in Newark, N.J. Hughes is coming off his second straight three-point showing and heads into his first encounter with Celebrini with five goals in his past six games. He scored two goals in Saturday's 4-3 overtime over the host New York Islanders. The Devils star scored a power-play goal in the second period and then converted a breakaway 2:35 into overtime. He also had the primary assist on the tying goal by Stefan Noesen with 50 seconds left in regulation. ""Those are the moments you play hockey for,"" Devils captain Nico Hischier said. ""I think it's an emotional, tight game; I think we played a well enough game to win that game, and getting rewarded for it makes it that much better."" The latest big showing by Hughes gave New Jersey three straight wins and five wins in its last six games (5-1-0). Since allowing 23 goals in a four-game skid (0-2-2) from Oct. 19-25, the Devils have outscored foes 24-11 in the past six games, a stretch that includes shutout road wins versus the Vancouver Canucks and Edmonton Oilers. Dawson Mercer also scored a goal and defenseman Dougie Hamilton notched three assists on Saturday for the Devils, who allowed two goals in a span of 1:56 before overcoming a 3-1 deficit. Celebrini will be playing in his fourth game and first on the road because of a preseason hip injury that cost him the first 12 games. The Sharks are playing better of late by going 4-2-0 in their past six contests following a season-opening nine-game skid (0-7-2). San Jose began its marginal improvement with a 5-4 overtime win at the Utah Hockey Club on Oct. 28 before getting home wins over the Los Angeles Kings and Chicago Blackhawks. After splitting one-goal games versus Vancouver and the Columbus Blue Jackets, the 18-year-old had his first career two-goal game Thursday in a 5-2 home loss to the Minnesota Wild. Celebrini scored twice on even strength as the Sharks were 0-for-3 on the power play and are 2-for-20 since their only game with multiple power-play goals on Oct. 24. The Sharks also head into their opener of a four-game trip against Metropolitan Division opponents after failing to record more than 29 shots on goal in their previous five contests. ""We play some great teams, so it'll be a really good test,"" Celebrini said Thursday. ""We've shown we can beat some really good teams, and we're a really good team ourselves when we play like it. So, this will be a great test, especially on the road."" The Sharks may revert to their alignment from Thursday when William Eklund was dropped to the fourth line by coach Ryan Warsofsky. Eklund finished with 16 goals in his first full season in 2023-24 but has two goals in his first 14 games in 2024-25. ""We're going to continue to work with him, help him, and get through this,"" Warsofsky said. One of San Jose's 19 wins last season occurred on their visit to New Jersey. Eklund scored a goal in the Sharks' 6-3 win over the Devils on Dec. 1. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

No. 25 Army 14, North Texas 3 Quarterback Bryson Daily engineered a 21-play drive and scored his second touchdown as the Black Knights pulled away in the second half to topple the Mean Green in an American Athletic Conference game in Denton, Texas.

Allison has his name littered throughout the record books, ranking fourth all time in NASCAR premier series wins (85), second in top-five finishes (336) and 14th in starts (718).  Those were among the accomplishments that landed Allison in NASCAR's second Hall of Fame Class back in 2011. He was also a three-time Daytona 500 winner, four-time Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway winner and three-time Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway winner.  During his 1988 victory at Daytona, Allison had to hold off his son, Davey, to take the checkered flag.  ""Bobby Allison personified the term ‘racer.' Though he is best known as one of the winningest drivers in NASCAR Cup Series history, his impact on the sport extends far beyond the record books,"" NASCAR chairman and CEO Jim France said in a statement. ""As a driver, he won races and championships across several NASCAR divisions. But as the leader of the famous ‘Alabama Gang,' Bobby connected with fans in a profound manner.  ""In the most significant ways, he gave his all to our sport. On behalf of the France family and all of NASCAR, I offer my deepest condolences to Bobby's family, friends and fans on the loss of a NASCAR giant."" Named one of NASCAR's 75 Greatest Drivers back in 2023, Allison put together a career that started in 1961 and ended midway through the 1988 campaign.  In addition to everything he was able to accomplish in the Cup Series, Allison won twice in what is now known as the Xfinity Series and took home an International Race of Champions title in 1980. He was named NASCAR's most popular driver on six occasions.  Allison and his younger brother Donnie teamed up with modified racer Red Farmer to take over the short-track racing scene down in the Hueytown, Ala., area during the late 1950s, leading to the inception of the original ""Alabama Gang.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

He is alleged to have taken photos of women, then send the pictures to them, and also of making visits to places where he knew he could find those same women. The Alligator interviewed two women who said they had complained about Golden, and they corroborated the Title IX documents. They said Golden had followed, then unfollowed, numerous women on social media to avoid suspicion, and one of them said his reach to women was vast. He told many women they were ""his drug"" or ""his good luck charm"" before games, she said. ""He just had this manipulation tactic over everyone,"" the woman told The Alligator. ""And he sent us all the same (messages). It was copy-paste to every girl."" Golden, 39, was hired March 18, 2022, as the 20th head coach in Gators history. He came from San Francisco, where he led the Dons to a 57-36 record over three seasons, including a pair of 20-win seasons and their first NCAA Tournament bid in more than two decades. Prior to San Francisco, he worked under coach Bruce Pearl at Auburn. Last season, in his second campaign with the Gators, Golden led the team to 24 wins, a No. 7 seed in the NCAA Tournament, and the SEC tournament championship game for the first time since 2014. The No. 21 Gators are 2-0 on the season. Golden is married and the father of a young son and daughter. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Bulldogs (1-0) beat Tennessee Tech 83-78 on Monday but that wasn't the headline from their season opener.  Newell, a 6-foot-11, five-star recruit, led the team with 26 points and 11 rebounds, tying Georgia and NBA great Dominique Wilkins' record for scoring in a freshman debut at the school. The Florida native became Georgia's third-highest-rated commit in school history, behind Anthony Edwards and Lou Williams. ""He's a winning player,"" Georgia head coach Mike White said of Newell. ""Six offensive rebounds, he's in passing lanes defensively, he's altering shots at the rim. He's mature beyond his years, he's an accountable player and Asa has high basketball character. ... It's pretty cool to see his name in the same sentence as Dominique Wilkins."" Newell wasn't the only newcomer contributing in the first game. Mount St. Mary's transfer Dakota Leffew chipped in 18 points off the bench, while Clemson transfer RJ Godfrey added 10 points and 10 rebounds.  Georgia, which is looking to build off its first 20-win season since 2015-16, hosts the Tigers for the second time ever. The Bulldogs previously topped Texas Southern 92-75 in December 2018. Texas Southern (1-1) plays its first of two games in three days, facing Georgia Tech on Tuesday. The Tigers nearly pulled off an opening-night upset, leading Xavier with 11:39 left before falling 78-69. Texas Southern earned its first win two days later, beating NAIA member Texas A&M-San Antonio 100-66. Kavion McClain leads Texas Southern with 21.5 points per game, followed by Kolby Granger's 11. ""(Kavion) is certainly a bright spot for us that our fans are really going to enjoy,"" Jones said.

Now the Tigers will look to build on that season-opening performance when they face Alabama State on Sunday in Baton Rouge, La.   ""We want to play very unselfishly,"" LSU coach Matt McMahon said. ""We want the ball moving. We feel like we have multiple weapons at every position. The goal has to be to have balance. Equal opportunity is good for us.""   Last season, the Tigers had three players who averaged in double figures, combining for 41.7 points per game. In Wednesday's 95-60 win over UL Monroe, four Tigers scored in double figures, led by Jalen Reed's career-high 24. Cam Carter scored 21, Curtis Givens III had 15 and Dji Bailey added 13.   ""I put in a lot of work this offseason, in the weight room and on the court,"" said Reed, who averaged 7.9 points last season and whose previous high point total was 16.   Alabama State's offense also started strong in its opener but couldn't sustain it in a 93-79 road loss to UNLV on Monday.   The Hornets made their first five 3-point attempts to take a 23-18 lead. But UNLV scored the next 11 points and led the rest of the way.   Alabama State, like LSU, had four players score in double figures: Amarr Knox (19), TJ Madlock (14), Micah Octave (13) and Jasteven Walker (10).   Third-year coach Tony Madlock is looking for continued improvement after the Hornets went 8-23 in his first season and finished 13-19 in his second season. The program hasn't had a winning record since 2014-15.   ""One of the things I talked about when I first got the job was trying to make improvement and get this program back to where it belongs,"" Madlock said. ""Alabama State has a rich history in basketball. It's been down for a while. When I took the job, it was a major redo."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Leon Draisaitl had a goal and an assist and Mattias Janmark had three assists for the Oilers. Brett Kulak, Viktor Arvidsson and Corey Perry also scored and Stuart Skinner stopped 17 shots for the Oilers, who broke the game open with four unanswered goals in the third period.   Elias Pettersson, Pius Suter and Filip Hronek scored for Vancouver which had its three-game winning streak halted. Goaltender Kevin Lankinen stopped 20 of 27 shots before he was replaced in the third by Arturs Silovs, who made four stops.   Draisaitl opened the scoring at 2:48 of the first period by getting a loose puck and lifting it into the top half of the net during a goal-mouth scramble.   Perry made it 2-0 at 3:30 of the second, finishing a series of quick passes that left him with an empty net.   Arvidsson extended the lead to 3-0 at 4:43, snapping a low wrist shot from the slot that beat Lankinen to the stick side.   The Canucks rallied with back-to-back goals by Pettersson and Hronek in less than two minutes of the second period to make it 3-2.   But the Oilers came out firing in the third period, scoring three goals in just under two minutes to break open the game.   Brown restored the Oilers' two-goal lead at 6:10. The puck pinballed through the crease to Brown, who got a couple of swipes at it before jamming it home from the side of the net.   McDavid then swatted a bouncing puck in on the power play to make it 5-2 at 7:16 and Kulak threaded it through the legs of Lankinen to make it 6-2 at 8:08.   Brown scored his second of the period at 11:05 to chase Lankinen from the net, and Suter rounded out the scoring for the Canucks with less than a minute to go.

Baker-Mazara hit the go-ahead basket, atoned for a turnover by making a steal, and then nailed a pair of made free throws. The game was listed as a neutral-site because it was played at the Toyota Center, home of the Houston Rockets, rather than the Cougars' campus arena. Baker-Mazara's short hook shot in the lane resulted in the 13th and final lead change of the game and a 68-67 Auburn lead. He even corralled a loose ball on the penultimate Houston possession, which forced the Cougars to foul in trying to extend the game. The Tigers' Tahaad Pettiford had a game high 21 points, Johni Broome had 20, with 16 coming in the second half, and Chaney Johnson added 11 points and 10 rebounds. Houston's LJ Cryer and Emmanuel Sharp each had 13 points, and J'Wan Roberts had 12 points and seven rebounds. Milos Uzan and Joseph Tugler added 10 points apiece. Auburn took its first lead at 11-10 on a 5-0 run, highlighted by Dylan Cardwell's steal and coast-to-coast drive for a two-hand dunk. Pettiford then capped an 8-0 run with back-to-back 3-pointers, the first from the top of the key, the second a leaning trey from the wing that banked in off the glass, to give the Tigers their biggest lead of the first half at 19-12 and prompt Houston coach Kelvin Sampson to call a timeout with 7:36 to go. A deep trey by Sharp as the shot clock expired cut the Auburn lead to 24-23. But on a sideline out-of-bounds play on their next possession, Auburn's Miles Kelly banked in another 3-pointer, this time from 30 feet. Houston then closed the first half on an 8-2 run, which was punctuated by Terrance Arceneaux's 3-pointer, to give the Cougars a 33-28 lead. Auburn fell behind by nine early in the second half, but Broome scored the first four points of another 8-0 burst. The second of those baskets was a two-hand power slam  Cryer missed a jumper on Houston's next possession, and Broome's rebound and outlet pass led to a Chris Moore reverse layup and a Cougars' time out. With the game tied at 51, Houston went on a 5-0 run. Sharp drilled his second 3-pointer of the night with 6:13 left as the Cougars went ahead 56-51. Auburn responded immediately with a 6-0 burst, capped by a trey from  Baker-Mazara to give the Tigers a 57-56 lead at 5:13.

Guseva carded a 3-under 69 on Saturday to come up just short of Kim's 18-under 270 at Hoakalei Country Club.

""I was playing within the offense and being aggressive, taking what they gave me,"" he said. ""I was going with moving the ball, finding great shots and taking them."" Mgbako and the No. 17 Hoosiers will try to make it 2-0 Sunday when they welcome Eastern Illinois for another nonconference clash in Bloomington, Ind. Mgbako nailed 13 of 17 shots from the field, including 4 of 5 from the 3-point line, and also chipped in nine rebounds. His performance stood out on a night where Indiana never trailed and wasn't pushed in the second half, but it didn't play at the level coach Mike Woodson hoped it would. ""Offensively, we came out with great intentions,"" Woodson said. ""The ball moved early, but then we got stale in terms of moving and making the extra pass. We've been having some good practices. ... I've got to get us better in that area."" Woodson wasn't happy that his team committed 16 turnovers against an opponent that probably won't bring the same level of ball pressure they'll see in the Big Ten Conference. Washington State transfer Myles Rice had 11 points in his first game but also coughed up five turnovers. Woodson said most of the turnovers were correctible, but he added that Rice must be more patient and develop into more of a true point guard. Rice played as more of a combo guard last year when he helped the Cougars reach the second round of the NCAA Tournament. One solid aspect of the Hoosiers' opener was their defense. They allowed the Cougars to make only 35.2 percent of their shots, including 5 of 26 on 3-pointers, and earned a 43-34 advantage on the boards. Meanwhile, Eastern Illinois (1-1) followed up a season-opening blowout loss at Illinois by routing Division III opponent Earlham (Ind.) 97-61 on Wednesday. Six players scored in double figures for the Panthers, led by Artese Stapleton's 17 points, as they shot 52.2 percent from the field. Eastern Illinois is coming off a 14-18 season and was picked for a middle-of-the-pack finish in the Ohio Valley Conference. Panthers coach Marty Simmons knows all about the atmosphere his team will face in Assembly Hall. He played for the late Bob Knight before transferring to Evansville and playing for former Knight assistant Jim Crews. Simmons, in his fourth season at Eastern Illinois, says this will be his best group of players since he took the helm. ""I think we're moving in the right direction,"" he said. ""We made a good step last year. We have our best returning class. I think this team has a chance to be pretty good."" Simmons said the key to his team will be the progress it makes defensively. Opponents made 44 percent of their shots against the Panthers last season. ""We have to be more consistent,"" he said. Indiana has won both meetings in the series, earning an 88-49 win nine years ago in their last matchup. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Memphis star forward put up a season-high 39 points in Friday's victory over the Washington Wizards and seeks another strong effort when the Grizzlies visit the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday night. Jackson made five 3-pointers -- also a season-best -- and controlled things in the interior as Memphis routed the visiting Wizards 128-104.  ""He had the opportunity to be the primary playmaker, diversify his game and a couple pick-and-rolls were snuck in there,"" Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said of Jackson. ""... He was able to get the rim at will and obviously shot the ball really well. ""It was great to see him get that opportunity and take advantage of it."" Jackson was in the go-to role with point guard Ja Morant out due to a right hip injury and shooting guard Desmond Bane (oblique) still sidelined.  Morant was injured in a fall during Wednesday's 131-114 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. The Grizzlies announced Saturday that he is week-to-week after suffering a posterior hip subluxation (without dislocation) and multiple Grade 1 pelvic muscle strains. As a result, Memphis will again rely on Jackson, who is averaging 22 points and shooting 55.9 percent from the field in eight games. After missing the first two games due a hamstring strain sustained during the team's first practice, the 25-year-old Jackson has played well. Friday's effort was his second 30-point outing and marked the third time in the past four games in which he scored 20 or more points. Last season, Jackson averaged 22.5 points in 66 games. Scotty Pippen Jr. also contributed on Friday with his first career triple-double. He had 11 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds while starting against Washington. ""Offensively, he's moving the ball,"" Jenkins said. ""And he's getting into the paint, which is a huge priority for us ... This kid is taking care of his body, he's doing the work, he's watching film. When he can have that two-way impact, that's huge for us."" The Grizzlies have won four of their past five games with the wins coming by 23, 17, 17 and 24 points. Memphis opens a three-game trip with a stop in Portland as the Trail Blazers begin a four-game homestand. Portland is coming off a 127-102 road loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves during a contest in which big man Robert Williams III returned to the court after missing 12-plus months due to a major knee injury. Williams scored 13 points in 17 minutes off the bench, making 4 of his 5 field-goal attempts and all four of his free throws. ""I felt good, man,"" Williams said. ""Just trying to get the defensive spirit back with the team, you know, be that leader. Obviously, we wanted to come out with a win, we didn't. But obviously it feels great to be back on the court."" Williams' return gives the Trail Blazers a deep post trio that includes veteran starter Deandre Ayton and first-round pick Donovan Clingan. Portland also has more versatility at guard with Shaedon Sharpe back from a shoulder injury. He had just six points on 2-of-8 shooting in 21 minutes against Minnesota in his second game of the season. In his first, Sharpe had 13 points on 6-of-9 shooting in 20 minutes during a 118-105 road loss against the San Antonio Spurs on Thursday. ""Just trying to get guys in there and you want to get them in and there's also minutes restrictions,"" Portland coach Chauncey Billups said. ""There's all kind of things that you have to deal with that make it tough to kind of get a rhythm."" The Trail Blazers went 3-1 against Memphis last season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Stewart-Haas Racing's Riley Herbst's No. 98 Ford passed Allgaier's No. 7 JR Motorsports Chevrolet for the NASCAR Xfinity Series Championship Race win on the last lap of double-overtime for his second win of the season and joined the new series champ Allgaier in twin celebratory burnouts on the front stretch of the mile-track.   ""I said all weekend, I don't know what the plan is, but He has a reason for everything and tonight is true of that, this is mind-blowing, it really is,"" said Allgaier, his voice already hoarse and strained from screaming in happiness, but the smile unshakable as his young daughters came in for a hug for dad.   ""This team never gave up. (Crew chief) Jim Pohlman and his leadership skills are second to none. He told me all weekend that we were going to have a chance and we tried to give it away every way we could.""   It was an emotional outcome for the 38-year old Allgaier, who joked that he was just trying to make the race exciting for the fans. He has qualified for the Championship 4 seven times, finishing runner-up twice, including last year.   The obstacles Allgaier faced happened well before the race's green flag.  His primary car was destroyed in a crash four laps into Friday's opening practice session. In a backup car Saturday night, Allgaier started last in the 38th car field but had moved into the top 10 by lap 26. He was then penalized twice - first for a re-start violation and then for speeding - dropping him to 35th on-track and a lap down on Lap 107 of the scheduled 200-lapper. Allgaier then crept into the Top 10 worked his way forward - moving from sixth place to second on the first overtime restart. He started on the front row of the second overtime restart, but was passed on the final lap by Herbst for the race win. Allgaier's second place finish was still good enough to land the championship.   It marked the third career win for the 25-year old Las Vegas native Herbst, who crossed the line .247-second ahead of Allgaier and led 167 of the 213 laps.   ""I knew we were going to have a fast race car, these guys have been working on this race car and I knew we were going to be really really fast,"" said Herbst, whose SHR team is closing at the conclusion of the season.  ""It's been a really tough week at the shop, really emotional time. I'm forever grateful to every man and woman at Stewart-Haas Racing. They gave me a really fast car today and I can't thank everyone enough."" It was actually fellow championship contender - reigning champ Cole Custer - who mounted the most consistent challenge to Herbst. He ran up front for most of the race, just off the pace of his SHR teammate and ultimately finished eighth in the No. 00 SHR Ford - his effort answered last year's title with a runner-up in this year's championship standings.   The other two championship contenders, Kaulig Racing's A.J. Allmendinger and Richard Childress Racing's Austin Hill finished ninth and 10th, respectively.

Alexandar Georgiev turned away 27 shots for the Avalanche. Jordan Martinook had two goals and an assist, Martin Necas added a goal and an assist, Jack Drury also scored, Seth Jarvis contributed two assists and Spencer Martin made 23 saves for Carolina. The Hurricanes had the first nine shots on goal and finally cashed in when Martinook sent a pass from below the goal to Drury out front, and his wrister beat Georgiev high at 9:02. It was his second of the season. MacKinnon finally got a shot on goal for the Avalanche with 9:33 left in the first period, and Colorado carried the play early in the second. However, the Hurricanes struck again when Jarvis fed Martinook at the bottom of the left circle, and he scored his third of the season with a shot to the far side at 4:37. Makar made it 2-1 on the penalty kill when he stole Shayne Gostisbehere's cross-zone pass, skated in on Martin and beat him with a slap shot at 9:15. It was his sixth of the season.

In all, 11 players recorded a point for the Kings, with Warren Foegele notching a goal and an assist and Anze Kopitar and Adrian Kempe collecting a pair of assists apiece. Columbus jumped out to a 1-0 lead on Dmitri Voronkov's goal with 6:34 left in the opening period. The second-year pro, who scored 34 points in 75 games last season, notched his first point of the season, redirecting Justin Danforth's centering pass past Kings goalie David Rittich (24 saves).   The Kings, though, would take over in the second period, scoring twice in a two-minute span.   Vladislav Gavrikov tied it against his former team with a snap shot through traffic 4:16 into the second. The defenseman's second of the season and second in as many games came off assists by Adrian Kempe and Anze Kopitar.   Foegele gave Los Angeles a 2-1 lead at 6:12 of the second as the hosts cashed in on a turnover in the neutral zone. Akil Thomas and Samuel Helenius earned their first assists of the season on the winger's sixth goal of the campaign.   Trevor Moore's short-handed goal just 30 seconds into the third, his second tally of the season, extended the Kings' lead to 3-1. Columbus responded on Ivan Provorov's first goal of the season 19 seconds later on the power play.   That was as close as the Blue Jackets would get as they lost their fourth straight (0-3-1). Alex Laferriere's ninth goal of the season came with 12:55 remaining as he deflected Joel Edmundson's shot past Columbus goalie Elvis Merzlikins (18 saves). Foegele earned the secondary assist.   Kempe and Kopitar earned their second assists on Brandt Clarke's empty-netter power-play goal with :31 left.   Helenius made his NHL debut Saturday, receiving a promotion from the Kings' AHL affiliate, the Ontario Reign, after Los Angeles placed Alex Turcotte on injured reserve.   Earlier Saturday, the NHL suspended Tanner Jeannot for three games after the forward received a match penalty in the Kings' loss to the Vancouver Canucks on Thursday.  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Minnesota Wild happily cannot relate. Minnesota enters its visit to Chicago on Sunday with five wins in six games, including consecutive 5-2 victories at San Jose and Anaheim and two other efforts of five goals. It's all helped add up to a 10-2-2 start, the best in club history over 14 contests. ""We've taken it a game at a time, honestly,"" Minnesota forward Frederick Gaudreau said. ""I think if you do that, you get results and you can get addicted to that feeling of just going at it every single day and not focusing too far ahead."" Chicago returns home before a two-game Western swing, facing questions about consistency. After seemingly turning a corner during a 3-2 road trip bridging October and November, the Blackhawks sputtered Wednesday and Thursday, losing 4-1 to visiting Detroit and then 3-1 at Dallas. Chicago recorded just five shots on goal in the first period and fell behind the Stars 2-0 before Tyler Bertuzzi put the team on the board with a power-play goal midway through the third. ""We weren't ready to start tonight,"" Bertuzzi said. ""Obviously we made a push in the third, but it was too late. We needed to be ready to go tonight and play a full 60 and we came up short. ""We need to shoot more. Everyone. Whether it's the (defense) from the top or a forward getting in the slot, we can't just keep trying to make the cute plays. We've got to shoot it and get the rebounds."" Claiming control of the puck would help. Chicago won 16 of 56 faceoffs at Dallas, with Philipp Kurashev contributing five. ""When you start out without a puck, that's a hard thing,"" Blackhawks coach Luke Richardson said. ""We're chasing the game quite a bit."" Richardson is encouraged that Chicago seemingly has flipped the script on last season, when chatter about moral victories was common in the dressing room. ""We're just going to take this and put this intensity we had in the third period and bring it to the next game,"" he said. ""I've liked our character and our pushback after a game like this all year long, so I'm expecting that again from our players."" The Blackhawks will hope to slow Minnesota's moxie away from home. The Wild boast seven road victories, most in the NHL entering Saturday. Kirill Kaprizov starred in Minnesota's most recent road triumph, contributing two goals and an assist on Friday in Anaheim. He also recorded a three-point night in San Jose and carries to Chicago a streak of eight straight multipoint road games. ""He's driving our team. That's the biggest thing,"" Marcus Foligno said. ""You need your horses going. He's our star player. When he's going, the whole bench is going."" Gaudreau, who assisted on Foligno's goal against the Ducks, has two goals and six assists during a career-best, six-game point streak. Minnesota swept Chicago in three meetings last season, outscoring the Blackhawks 10-2. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

It was the second straight loss for the Panthers (7-2, 3-2 ACC), likely eliminating their chances to reach the College Football Playoff or ACC Championship Game.   The Cavaliers (5-4, 3-3) ended a three-game skid and moved closer to gaining bowl eligibility for the first time under third-year coach Tony Elliott.   Anthony Colandrea passed for 143 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions for Virginia.   Nate Yarnell had a touchdown pass and two interceptions for Pitt after taking over for starter Eli Holstein, who left with an apparent head injury in the third quarter. Desmond Reid paced the Panthers with 123 yards from scrimmage.   Pitt had a final chance to take the lead before Yarnell's pass was intercepted by Corey Thomas Jr. with 1:40 left.   Virginia opened the scoring in the second quarter with some trickery. Cavaliers receiver Suderian Harrison got the ball on a reverse and threw a 27-yard pass to Colandrea to the 1-yard line. Brown ran it in on the next snap for a 7-0 lead.   Later in the quarter, the Panthers put together a 12-play, 80-yard drive, capped by Daniel Carter's 1-yard run to tie the score with 4:48 remaining in the half.   An interception by Kyle Louis set up a 44-yard field goal by Ben Sauls to give Pitt its first lead at 10-7 with 1:59 left.   Sauls hit a 48-yarder with eight seconds left to give the Panthers a 13-7 lead at halftime.   Momentum shifted to Virginia in the third quarter. Holstein left the game after getting hit in the helmet by Virginia linebacker Trey McDonald, who was thrown out for targeting.   After Jonas Sanker blocked a 45-yard field goal attempt by Sauls, Colandrea put the Cavaliers in front 14-13 with a 24-yard touchdown pass to Brown.   Virginia got the ball back after Sanker intercepted Yarnell's pass. Four plays later, Kobe Pace's 3-yard touchdown run made it 21-13 with 3:34 left in the third.   Yarnell's 4-yard TD pass to Gavin Bartholomew cut the deficit to 21-19 with 10:32 to play. That's where the score remained after a holding penalty wiped out Bartholomew's two-point conversion catch.

He entered the day as the national leader in both categories. Maddux Madsen completed 9 of 20 passes for 119 yards, one touchdown and one interception for the Broncos (8-1, 5-0 MW), who won their seventh straight game. Matt Lauter had a touchdown catch as Boise State beat Nevada for the 18th time in the past 20 meetings. Jeanty became the fourth Boise State running back to top the 1,700-yard mark in a single season and finished the night second on the list. Jay Ajayi set the school record of 1,823 yards in 2014, while Ian Johnson (1,713 in 2006) and Jeremy McNichols (1,709 in 2016) also topped the mark. Brendon Lewis was 17-of-26 passing for 188 yards and one touchdown for Nevada (3-8, 0-5), which lost its fourth consecutive game. Jaden Smith caught a 36-yard touchdown pass with 2:19 left that kept the Wolf Pack in the game. But Jeanty's 17-yard run on the ensuing possession gave Boise State a first down. A short time later, Jeanty scampered for 10 yards and another first down to seal it. The score was tied at 14 at the break before the Broncos moved ahead to stay behind a dominating eight-play, 95-yard drive to start the third quarter. Jeanty went the final yard for the touchdown. Boise State took a 28-14 advantage on Jeanty's 2-yard run with 10:05 left in the contest. However, Nevada bounced back and was threatening to make it a one-score game when it faced fourth-and-goal from the Boise State 1-yard line. But Lewis and Sean Dollars botched the exchange and Jeremiah Earby of the Broncos recovered in the end zone for a touchback. Boise State jumped out to a 14-0 lead before the game was 11 minutes old. Jeanty's rushes moved the ball down the field on the Broncos' first possession, which ended with Madsen's 11-yard scoring pass to Lauter. With 4:12 left in the period, Jeanty powered through a Nevada defender on a 4-yard scoring run. Lewis got the Wolf Pack on the board with a dazzling 17-yard burst with 57 seconds left in the opening quarter. Nevada tied the game on a trick play with 6:14 left in the half. The ball was handed to Marcos Bellon. The receiver tossed a short pass to Caleb Ramseur, who broke two tackles en route to finishing off a 44-yard scoring play. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Young's touchdown capped off a wild finish, with four touchdowns between the teams in the final 3:18. The Tigers (7-2, 3-2 SEC) kept their College Football Playoff hopes alive while the Sooners' bowl hopes took a major hit. Oklahoma (5-5, 1-5) needs one more win in its final two games -- against Alabama and LSU -- to extend its bowl streak to 26 seasons. Missouri tied it on Theo Wease Jr.'s 10-yard touchdown catch from Drew Pyne with 1:03 left. It didn't take long for the Tigers to come up with another big play. Triston Newson hit Sooners quarterback Jackson Arnold in the backfield, knocking the ball free, and Young picked it up and returned it for the score. Not long before Wease's touchdown, it looked like the game had turned disastrous for the Tigers. Billy Bowman returned a fumble 43 yards for a touchdown with 2:00 left to put Oklahoma in front 23-16. But Pyne quickly directed an eight-play, 75-yard touchdown drive to tie it and set up Young's late heroics. The teams combined for just 535 total yards, with Missouri outgaining the Sooners 278-257. Pyne finished 14-of-27 for 143 yards and three touchdowns. Arnold finished 15-of-24 for just 74 yards as the Sooners turned the ball over four times. Wease had four catches for 70 yards and two touchdowns. Oklahoma tied the game with 3:18 left on a bit of trickery. Running back Taylor Tatum took a handoff from Arnold on third down then turned to throw it back to Arnold, who caught it and ran in for an 18-yard touchdown. On the third play of the next drive, Sammy Omosigho hit Missouri's Jamal Roberts, popping the ball free. Bowman scooped it up and took it in for the score. Pyne threw three touchdowns in the second half, including a 5-yard touchdown to Brett Norfleet with 8:47 left. But the point-after attempt was missed, keeping Missouri's lead 16-9. That's when the Sooners finally answered, with a 12-play, 75-yard touchdown drive to tie the game. Oklahoma's Zach Schmit hit three field goals, including a career-long 56-yarder as time expired in the second quarter, to send the Sooners into halftime leading 9-3. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Langer got off to a hot start at Phoenix Country Club, picking up three birdies within his first five holes. He finished with five on the day against one bogey and sits at 13-under 200 for the tournament, one shot better than defending champion Steven Alker of New Zealand.  ""Didn't putt as well as the first two days, made a couple early on and then kind of didn't get the pace,"" Langer said. ""It was a little short at times and just didn't make as many. Played very solid, hit the ball very well, gave myself a bunch of chances and pretty happy overall."" Alker shared low-round honors with Australia's Richard Green by recording an 8-under 63.  Both Alker and Green put together a phenomenal showing on the front nine, with Alker pairing six birdies and three pars and Green collecting seven birdies and two pars.  ""It's just heated up,"" Alker said of his putter. ""I just quiet the noise a little bit and settle it down and softened up my grip a little bit. Just small things go a long way. I've been seeing my lines good and rolling it good.""  Green finished with nine birdies and a bogey at the par-3 13th to climb six spots up the leaderboard and into sole possession of third at 11-under 202. He is two strokes behind Langer and trailing Alker by one.  With such a tight race atop the leaderboard, Langer knows that he has to bring his A-game on Sunday.  ""Well, I think I've got to continue to play aggressive and hit as many fairways as I possibly can and as many greens,"" Langer said. ""The key for me is making putts.

Zavion Thomas returned the ensuing kickoff 50 yards and LSU drove to a first down at the Crimson Tide 5-yard line before settling for Damian Ramos's 23-yard field goal.   Alabama responded by marching 75 yards on 15 plays and went up 14-3 on Justice Haynes's 1-yard run. Ramos's 43-yard field goal trimmed the lead to 14-6 midway through the second quarter, but the Tigers would creep no closer.   One play after LSU stopped the Crimson Tide on a fourth-and-1, Tim Smith recovered a Nussmeier fumble at the Tigers 32. Three plays later, Milroe ran 10 yards for a touchdown and a 21-6 lead that held up through the end of the first half. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Jusuf Nurkic made a tiebreaking free throw with eight-tenths of a second remaining Friday night, giving Phoenix a 114-113 win over the host Dallas Mavericks. It not only gave the Suns, leaders of the Pacific Division, their seventh consecutive win, but also their third in a row by three or fewer points. Phoenix's eight victories this season have come by a total of 37 points. ""It feels like every night it's been one,"" Suns coach Mike Budenholzer observed after his team's seventh win by six or fewer points. ""Winning close games on the road builds confidence, builds toughness."" Phoenix has worked its close-game magic at home as well. Before heading to Dallas, the Suns went 3-0 on a homestand in which they beat the Portland Trail Blazers by six, the Philadelphia 76ers by two and the Miami Heat by three. On a team featuring Kevin Durant, who will miss about two weeks with a left calf strain, and Devin Booker, Nurkic has been the Suns' most productive fourth-quarter player with a team-best plus-21. He leads the team in fourth-quarter field goal percentage (75.0) and offensive rebounds (six), and trails Royce O'Neale 18-17 for the team lead in total rebounds. He will match up Sunday with Kings star Domantas Sabonis, who recorded his eighth consecutive double-double with 23 points and 12 rebounds in Friday's 107-98 home loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. Sabonis had three consecutive triple-doubles, missing a fourth straight by one assist, when the Kings lost three of five in a rare five-game season series with the Suns last year. Two of the triple-doubles came in losses at Phoenix in January (21 points, 12 rebounds, 11 assists) and February (35 points, 18 rebounds, 12 assists). The big man contributed to one of the Kings' biggest problems on Friday -- 3-point shooting. Sacramento missed 23 of its 26 attempts from deep (11.5 percent), the fifth time in the last six games in which the Kings have made 33.3 percent or less. Sabonis was 0-for-2. Other than De'Aaron Fox (2-for-5), Sacramento starters went 0-for-13, including Keegan Murray's six straight misses. Unfazed by his club's early-season slump, Kings coach Mike Brown expressed confidence that his guys would come right back firing against the Suns. ""It doesn't matter who we play. We want to let it fly,"" he said. ""We feel like we're a good 3-point shooting team. Although the numbers might not point that direction right now, we have guys who can knock that shot down. ""Any time you touch the paint, especially in today's NBA, everybody converges. So we want to touch the paint, let that thing fly and hopefully knock down shots."" At 30.7 percent, the Kings sit near the bottom of the NBA rankings in 3-point field goal percentage this season. The Suns, with O'Neale having made 52.6 percent and Durant 42.9, have been among the best at 38.3 percent. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Drew Allar completed 20 of 28 passes for 220 yards and a touchdown for Penn State (8-1 overall, 5-1 Big Ten), which could move up in the College Football Playoff rankings after losses by No. 3 Georgia and No. 4 Miami. Teammate Kaytron Allen rushed 20 times for 98 yards and a score. The Nittany Lions had a 486-193 edge in total offense. The normally staid Penn State offense came up with some intriguing plays in taking a 28-0 halftime lead. Backup quarterback Beau Pribula came off the bench and scored on an 8-yard run around the left end to open the scoring with 3:48 left in the first quarter. That capped a nine-play, 72-yard drive after Washington's Grady Gross hit the upright on a 45-yard field goal attempt. Facing third-and-goal from the UW 2-yard line with 9:23 remaining in the second, Warren -- a finalist for the Paul Hornung Award as college football's most versatile player -- lined up as the quarterback in a Wildcat formation. Warren took the snap and vaulted into the end zone to make it 14-0. With 3:23 left in the quarter, Penn State faced the same situation -- third-and-goal from the 2 -- and again used Warren in the Wildcat formation. This time he muscled his way over the goal line behind the left tackle. Allar then threw an 8-yard scoring strike to Julian Fleming with 23 seconds left in the half. Penn State's Nicholas Singleton returned the second-half kickoff 97 yards, but the touchdown was called back because of a holding penalty. The Huskies (5-5, 3-4) finally got on the scoreboard on Gross' 24-yard field goal with 9:47 left in the third. He added a 35-yarder early in the fourth to make it 28-6. Allen scored on a 1-yard run with 4:50 to go to cap the scoring. UW quarterback Will Rogers III was 10-of-13 passing for 59 yards and one interception in the first half before being replaced by Demond Williams Jr., who was 6-of-10 passing for 60 yards and rushed for a team-high 38 yards on 10 attempts. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The driver of the No. 19 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota will start on the front row alongside Team Penske's Joey Logano, the top qualifying 2024 championship contender. Logano's No. 22 Ford was .010 seconds slower than Truex's Camry in the qualifying session Saturday around the desert one-miler.   ""It's very cool, honestly, you always want to be a guy known for going fast at any track, any situation,"" said Truex, who claimed the pole with a lap of 134.741 mph and is racing for his first victory of the season. ""It feels good, very cool. The big prize is tomorrow though and hopefully we can get that one.""   Logano, who is racing for his third series title, was equally as happy with his effort and the championship implications.   ""We've got them where we want ‘em right now, just got to keep them there,"" Logano said, smiling.   Three of the four championship-eligible drivers advanced to the final round of qualifying for the season finale. Hendrick Motorsports' William Byron will start his No. 24 Chevrolet from eighth position and 23XI Racing's Tyler Reddick will start his No. 45 Toyota 10th.   Reigning series champion Ryan Blaney was the only driver among the four title contenders not to advance out of the opening round, his No. 12 Team Penske Ford got loose between Turns 1 and 2 on his hot lap and he will start 17th in the 40-car field.   Because Logano's car had to go through inspection two extra times before passing, he lost the benefit of getting to select his pit stop, and his car chief was ejected for the race. Logano did not appear to be overly concerned, however.   ""We feel confident,"" Logano said. ""I feel like our car is strong.   ""We feel strong about our team and these type of pressure situations, we feel very solid as far as our team and these moments. We're just executing our plan.""   His Penske teammate Blaney also remained confident despite the qualifying setback.   ""Our lap obviously didn't go well, I just got kind of free going into (Turn) 1 and ruined it all and couldn't really make it back up,"" Blaney said. ""I'm surprised honestly it ran as well as it did for as loose as I got. I think our car is pretty good and still nice to have a decent pit stall.   ""We'll just kind of take it how we can get it tomorrow, just work through the first handful of laps and kinda start marching forward. Pretty similar to last year. Hopefully, it ends the same. If we can charge through the field, I think our race car is good enough we can make that happen.""   Byron was pleased to get that first pit stall pick with his qualifying effort, but had hoped to turn in a faster lap. He was quickest in the opening round.   ""Sucks, didn't just quite get the lap I wanted in the second lap but feel really good about our race car and get first pit pick and that's huge. Really excited about those things and just want to put together a good start to the race. It's such a long race, it's really about getting to the finish and having what you need there.""   Trackhouse Racing's Ross Chastain and Hendrick Motorsports' Kyle Larson will start third and fourth, respectively. Hendrick's Chase Elliott and Joe Gibbs Racing's Ty Gibbs make up the third row.   Joe Gibbs Racing's Christopher Bell and Byron will line up alongside one another on the fourth row with Wood Brothers Racing's Harrison Burton and Reddick completing row five. --By Holly Cain, NASCAR Wire Service.

Gabriel was 23 for 34 for 183 yards passing with three touchdowns and no interceptions for the Ducks (10-0, 7-0 Big Ten), who led 14-10 before scoring 25 of the game's final 33 points. His record-setting touchdown came on a 3-yard toss to left tackle Gernorris Wilson that put Oregon up 29-10 midway through the third quarter.  Gabriel surpassed former Houston quarterback Case Keenum, who accounted for 155 passing touchdowns and 23 rushing scores for the Cougars from 2007-11. Billy Edwards Jr. completed 22 for 44 passes for 206 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions for the Terrapins (4-5, 1-5), who have lost two straight games. Jordan James ran up the middle for a 3-yard touchdown to give Oregon the lead for good, 7-3, with 2:21 to play in the first quarter. The score was set up by a 26-yard pass from Gabriel to James one play after the Ducks converted a fourth-and-1. Oregon made it 14-3 early in the second quarter with a defensive touchdown. Defensive lineman Jordan Burch stripped the ball from Edwards and Brandon Johnson returned the fumble 62 yards. Maryland made it 14-10 on Roman Hemby's 1-yard touchdown run, which capped off a nine-play drive with 3:17 left in the first half. That left enough time for Gabriel to engineer a 12-play, 75-yard drive that culminated with a 9-yard scoring pass to tight end Terrance Ferguson 20 seconds before halftime. Oregon used a fake punt to extend its lead in the third quarter. Facing fourth-and-3 at its own 22-yard line, Burch took the direct snap on a fake punt and rumbled 36 yards.  Five plays later, Gabriel tossed his record-setting touchdown and Josh Conerly Jr. ran in the two-point conversion to make it 29-10. The Terrapins took advantage of several Ducks defensive penalties to sustain drives. They pulled within 29-18 on Octavian Smith's 3-yard touchdown reception and Edwards' run on a two-point conversion with 11:27 left in the fourth quarter, but got no closer.

After a Florida State field goal, Notre Dame struck again with a 65-yard rushing touchdown by Price. He found a hole and won a footrace down the left sideline.

Leavitt's 13-yard completion to Tyson provided the final score with 4:55 left in the game. UCF was stopped on a loss of downs on its 33 with 3:24 left when Harvey was taken down one yard short of a first down. Arizona State was able to wind the clock down to just 5 seconds before turning the ball over on downs at the UCF 22. The game ended on an 11-yard pass from Rizk to Jarrad Baker.

However, the Volunteers (8-1, 5-1 Southeastern Conference) led 20-7 at the half and weren't truly threatened by the Bulldogs (2-8, 0-6). Sampson collected 149 yards on 30 carries, going over the 1,000-yard mark for the first time in his career. Tennessee rolled up 452 total yards, split almost equally between rushing (240) and passing (212).

Despite Magny entering the fight as the 15th-ranked welterweight, Prates was the sizeable betting favorite. After a few wrestling exchanges, Prates caught Magny with a short left hook, plus a follow-up shot that kept Magny off-balance, leading to the referee stopping the fight at the 4:50 mark of the round. ""Man, I can't explain how happy I am right now,"" Prates said in his post-fight interview.

Forsberg and Marchessault each had a power-play goal and Roman Josi recorded two assists for the Predators, who won for just the fifth time in 15 games this season. Four of those victories have come at home for Nashville, which equaled its goal total from the previous three games.  Saros, meanwhile, wasn't tested often, but his most notable save of the night came while almost on his back. He made a desperation catch on Nick Schmaltz's net-front backhander within the game's first three minutes en route to his second shutout of the season.  Connor Ingram stopped 17 of 20 shots for Utah, which was shut out for the second time in three games. Utah is 3-6-3 since winning the opening three games of the franchise's history.  Nashville got a break just 1:11 into the game, when Utah's Alexander Kerfoot was whistled for a trip on Gustav Nyquist. Then less than 1:30 later, Forsberg glided into the circle and snapped the puck past Ingram to open the scoring at 2:37 of the first period.   The power play again came through for the Predators with 8:02 left in the opening period. After Utah killed a five-on-three Nashville advantage, the Predators still had two more minutes left on Olli Maatta's high-sticking penalty. That's when Josi sent a shot toward the net, where Marchessault redirected the puck by Ingram to give Nashville a 2-0 lead.  Utah was outshot 12-4 in the first period, but recorded the first six shots on goal in the second. However, the Predators went up 3-0 when Forsberg got the puck on the near boards, then raced into the Utah zone and eventually beat Ingram with 8:55 remaining in the middle period.  Forsberg failed to score in the previous three games but now has a team-leading eight goals this season.

For the last few games, the Nuggets' reserves have played well, but that hasn't been the case for the Dallas Mavericks. Coach Jason Kidd was critical of his bench after Friday's last-second loss to the Suns, and it's an issue of concern heading into Sunday night's game in Denver. Only two Dallas reserves played significant minutes Friday night -- Spencer Dinwiddie (28) and Dwight Powell (26) -- and the bench combined for just nine points. It has forced Kidd to play stars Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving more than 40 minutes. ""The fatigue of running Luka and Kyrie 40-something minutes because our bench stinks right now. ... As deep as we are, we've got to get someone to participate off the bench,"" Kidd said. ""Somebody has to join the party to help Kyrie and Luka. That's just not happening right now."" Doncic and Irving are averaging 37.2 and 35.7 minutes, respectively, and are the top two scorers on the team. Injuries have hurt the rotation, as P.J. Washington (knee), Maxi Kleber (hamstring) and Dereck Lively II (shoulder) were all out against the Suns. The injuries and bench aren't the only thing concerning Kidd -- it's his team's slow starts. The Mavericks trailed by 13 at halftime Friday night before rallying to tie it late. ""For whatever reason, we get off to a slow start,"" Kidd said after the game. ""It's got to be addressed. We've talked about it; there's got to be action. Somebody's got to come with some energy. We're flat."" Denver has started slow several times but has rallied to win three of those games. The Nuggets, after an 0-2 start, have won four straight and six of the last seven with strong play from the reserves. The bench didn't score much in the 135-122 win over the Heat on Friday night, but Russell Westbrook had 10 assists and Julian Strawther and Hunter Tyson played solid minutes. Westbrook started the previous three games for Jamal Murray (concussion), but Murray returned Friday to score a season-high 28 points. ""Felt good. Head feels OK. Just happy to be out there and playing with the team again,"" Murray said. Denver is also without starting power forward Aaron Gordon (right calf strain) for multiple weeks, though Peyton Watson has played well in his spot. It helps having Nikola Jokic in the lineup, too. The three-time MVP is making a case for a fourth with his play in the first nine games. Jokic entered Saturday fifth in scoring (28.9 points a game) and first in rebounds (13.2) and assists (11.3), and had his fifth triple-double of the season Friday night. He is the focus of every opponent's defense and finds an open teammate when he is double-teamed. ""Playing with Nikola helps everybody.

Slisz's goal came while Miami defender Tomas Aviles was down on the ground in his own penalty area and his teammates implored referee Lukasz Szpala to stop play. But the laws of the game require referees halt play only if a head injury is suspected, and Aviles clearly grabbed at his leg. As Miami appealed, Atlanta played on, with Pedro Amador providing an outswinging cross from the left and Slisz meeting it to head emphatically past goalkeeper Drake Callender. Jamal Thiare scored a first-half brace for ninth-seeded Atlanta, which needed to win its last two regular season matches just to reach the Eastern Conference wild-card match. From there it triumphed on penalties at CF Montreal, then split the first two games against top-seeded Miami, with each home team winning 2-1, before pulling off Saturday's shocking away victory. Brad Guzan made seven saves to complete a heroic effort across the best-of-three series and help Atlanta advance in an East bracket where all top three seeds were eliminated. Atlanta will visit fourth-seeded Orlando City in an Eastern Conference semifinal after the November international window. Messi and Miami are eliminated after earning an MLS-record 74 points in the regular season to capture the Supporters' Shield and top overall playoff seed. Messi scored a second-half equalizer for Miami, his first goal of the postseason and a rare one through the air after contributing an assist in the series-opening win two weekends ago. Matias Rojas opened the scoring for the Herons in the 17th minute on a rebound after Guzan saved an earlier Messi attempt. But Thiare turned an early deficit into an early lead for Atlanta in the next four minutes. In the 19th minute, he reached Dax McCarty's deflected through ball and hammered a finish past Callender into the top right corner. Two minutes later, Thiare dispatched the finish of Aleksey Miranchuk's clever square pass after McCarty's ball from midfield freed Miranchuk down the right side. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Dougie Hamilton collected the rebound and passed through the neutral zone to Hughes, who descended upon Ilya Sorokin and beat him stick side.  Hughes opened the scoring in the second for the Devils. Dawson Mercer and Stefan Noesen scored in the final five minutes of the third to tie the score. Goalie Jacob Markstrom made 19 saves as New Jersey won its third straight and improved to 5-1-0 in its past six games.

Holmstrom put the Islanders ahead with 6:51 left in the first. Kyle MacLean picked off a clearing pass by Hamilton and dished to Holmstrom, who shuffled the puck and sent a shot under Markstrom's stick. Hughes tied the score with a power-play goal 5:57 into the second. His shot from the upper left faceoff circle sailed past Sorokin's glove as he was screened by teammate Scott Mayfield as well as Devils center Nico Hischier. Cholowski and Nelson appeared to put the Islanders in control by scoring within a span of 1:56 shortly beyond the midway point of the third. Devils defenseman Luke Hughes nearly caught up to Pierre Engvall's clearing pass, but Holmstrom fended him off and passed to Cholowski, whose shot got past Markstrom's glove with 9:30 left. Nelson then capped an end-to-end rush by taking a pass from Kyle Palmieri in stride and scoring with 7:34 remaining. The Devils began their comeback 3:07 later. Center Paul Cotter, hounded by MacLean and Isaiah George, passed to Mercer, whose shot sailed over Sorokin's stick shoulder. Markstrom was pulled with about 1:20 left and Noesen was credited with the game-tying goal with 50 seconds remaining when his pass into the crease glanced off the stick and skate of Grant Hutton and trickled underneath Sorokin's legs. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

However, the hosts got another opportunity not long thereafter as Gordon fumbled and Abe Camara recovered at the TCU 37. Seven plays later, Cook slipped through defenders on his way to an 18-yard touchdown run.   The next Cowboys possession also ended with a turnover -- this one an interception by Bud Clark -- and TCU was back in the end zone 11 plays later.

The Sixers are desperate for a victory Sunday when they host the Charlotte Hornets, who are seeking their third straight win. Philadelphia (1-7) was expected to contend for a championship behind the dynamic trio of Joel Embiid, Paul George and Tyrese Maxey. However, an array of injuries has upended the 76ers. Embiid has yet to play this season due to a knee injury and, most recently, he was given a three-game suspension for shoving a columnist. The former NBA MVP is expected to make his season debut Tuesday when the New York Knicks come to town. George (knee) missed the first five games and is shooting just 41.7 percent overall (and 3 of 16 on 3-pointers) since returning. Then there is Maxey, who injured his hamstring in a loss to the host Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday and will likely miss multiple weeks. At this point, the Sixers are just trying to stay afloat until they get healthy. ""The ship hasn't sunk,"" George said. ""We know that we have to remain positive. We know that big fella is coming back, and he's one of the best. We're going to get Tyrese healthy and we'll get him back. Then we can finally be a complete team and start to build, and then we can finally begin to find out who we are."" In their most recent contest, the Sixers absorbed a 116-106 loss to LeBron James and the host Los Angeles Lakers on Friday. Rookie Jared McCain came off the bench to lead Philadelphia in scoring with 18 points on 6-of-17 shooting, while George and Kelly Oubre Jr. shot a combined 8 of 29 (0 of 10 from deep) and finished with nine points apiece. ""We have some plays there, and it just seems like we don't make them, or we go through a drought shooting the ball,"" 76ers coach Nick Nurse said. ""We have to collectively figure out a way to play better."" The defensive end might be a good place to start. Philadelphia has allowed at least 105 points in all eight of its games -- a trend that might spell bad news against the Hornets' impressive duo of LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller. Ball is averaging 28.4 points and is coming off a 31-point performance in Charlotte's 103-83 win over the visiting Indiana Pacers. He had 17 points in the fourth quarter, matching Indiana's team total, and leads the NBA in fourth-quarter points this season. ""I just think that his overall confidence in himself and his confidence in his teammates just exudes in the fourth quarter,"" Charlotte coach Charles Lee said. ""And I think it just becomes contagious for all of us where we know we've got that guy and he's going to help us all be better."" Miller, who hit a putback at the buzzer Wednesday to be the Detroit Pistons, then scored 29 points on 7-of-11 shooting from long range against Indiana. ""Scary sight,"" Miller said of the Hornets' talented tandem. ""It's definitely going to be scary. LaMelo is that two-way (player) that Coach Charles has been preaching to everybody, and also myself. I think that's a dangerous game to play. His ability to pass the ball on the offensive side and my ability to knock down shots, I think that's a great duo to have in this league."" The Sixers have won 23 of the past 25 meetings with the Hornets, including all four matchups last season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

With Simon Edvinsson in the penalty box for tripping, Fox took a slap shot from the right point that Kreider deflected past Husso. Panarin was credited with the second assist. Detroit had a 19-8 advantage in shots on goal in the second period, yet the Rangers stretched their lead to 3-0. Early in the period, Detroit's Patrick Kane had a shot clang off the post. With about 14 minutes left in the period, Quick made a save against Vladimir Tarasenko from point-blank range. During the Red Wings' first power play, Dylan Larkin hit the post with a shot from the right side. The Rangers capitalized on two of their chances in the period. Vesey beat Husso on the glove side off a behind-the-net feed from Sam Carrick with 3:08 left in the period. Zac Jones also picked up an assist. Panarin scored his 10th goal of the season 48 seconds later from the right side off another behind-the-net feed, this one from Mika Zibanejad. Alexis Lafreniere had the second assist. Smith added an empty-netter at 16:17 of the third. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

But now that the core of the team is gaining experience, Daigneault said it has become easier to prepare for players like Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors. The Thunder and Warriors square off Sunday in Oklahoma City in a battle of two of the top teams in the Western Conference. ""The good news is with our continuity and our growing experience, we're now at the point where we've played against him a lot,"" Daigneault said of Curry. ""There's a cumulative effect to learning the league and learning the game plan over time."" Defending Curry will still be plenty challenging, though. Curry has averaged 19.7 points and 6.2 assists per game while shooting 40.8 percent from 3-point range. He has scored 21.0 points per game in his last three games after missing the previous three contests due to a left ankle injury. ""If you blink, he's going to be open and he's going to shoot and make a shot,"" Daigneault said. ""It doesn't make it easier to execute it, but I think our familiarity has increased over time."" For Golden State, Sunday's game is the final in a five-game road trip. The Warriors are 3-1 so far on the trip but are coming off a 136-117 blowout loss on Friday in Cleveland. Golden State trailed that game by 41 points at halftime. ""We gotta respond,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""... We gotta execute better. We had 13 turnovers in the first half. We were completely disorganized. That's where I feel like we need the most work."" It was a rare slip for the Warriors, who entered Saturday ranked second in the NBA in defensive rating, at 106.5 points allowed per 100 possessions. The Thunder are the only team better, at 97.3 points per 100 possessions. Both defenses are also near the top of the league in steals per game, with Oklahoma City averaging an NBA-best 12.9 and Golden State third at 9.8. The Thunder also lead the league with 7.3 blocks per game, while the Warriors average 6.0. Golden State is leading the league with 22.0 points off turnovers per game while the Thunder are tied for fourth at 20.3. Oklahoma City is coming off a 126-107 win over Houston on Friday in the opener of a six-game homestand. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, 26, led the Thunder with 29 points. The seventh-year guard paces Oklahoma City with 26.3 points and 6.4 assists per game. The Thunder are 4-0 at home this season, winning by an average of 17.8 points per game. The biggest difference between the teams is their offensive style. Oklahoma City leads the league in drives per game with 62.1. The Thunder have topped the league in that category in each of the last four seasons.  But though Oklahoma City has attacked the basket regularly, it has drawn just 19.1 free throw attempts per game, the third-fewest in the league. Golden State, meanwhile, averages just 37.3 drives per game, more than just two other teams. The Warriors try 41.1 3-pointers per game, slightly more than the Thunder's 39.2 attempts.  Sunday's game is the first of three between the teams this season. The Thunder won three of four last season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Dayton (2-0) shot 69.6 percent in the second half en route to stretching its home winning streak to 18 games. Nick Martinelli contributed 32 points and 14 rebounds for Northwestern (1-1), both career highs. Angelo Ciaravino added 12 points and K.J. Windham had nine for the undermanned Wildcats.

Malachi Smith (14 points, game-high six assists) and Zed Key (11) also scored in double figures for Dayton. Dayton trimmed the deficit to three early in the second half but committed three straight turnovers to help the Wildcats create distance again. Ciaravino's layup with 10:50 to play stretched the Northwestern lead to 10, but the Flyers capitalized on the Wildcats' own shaky ball security to score the next nine points.

Malique Ewin had 11 points and seven rebounds for the Seminoles, who outscored the Owls 30-20 in the paint.

He shot 7-for-14 from the field and went 14-for-22 from the free-throw line as he effectively attacked the rim. Watkins helped seal the game down the stretch by making five consecutive free throws in the final 1:47.

Florida State answered with four points for a 37-32 lead, and Rice never got closer than three points the rest of the way. The Seminoles kept the Owls from taking the lead with pesky defense, which turned 17 Rice turnovers into 23 points. Meanwhile, Rice managed just seven points off of Florida State's 13 giveaways. Florida State outshot the Owls 42.6 percent (23-of-54) to 35.8 percent (19-of-53) and held a 15-8 advantage in transition points.

Banchero is out for several more weeks after suffering a torn oblique muscle at the end of October. The Magic ended a five-game losing streak, beating the New Orleans Pelicans 115-88 on Friday night at home. Fourth-year Magic forward Franz Wagner has averaged 21.4 points in the past five games to help make up for Banchero's absence. ""I think he's just such a competitor,"" Magic coach Jamahl Mosley said about Wagner. ""He's going to do whatever it takes to put this team on his back and figure out a way to win. We've asked him to be aggressive and make the right plays and I think that's what we have to continue to ask from him every night."" Even with Banchero in the lineup, the Magic were having issues on offense. They rank 28th in the NBA in scoring at 106.7 points and are shooting just 44.1 percent from the floor. Jalen Suggs has become the Magic's No. 2 offensive option, averaging 16.3 points this season. But for now, it's all about Wagner shouldering the load. ""Our coaches have done a great job of watching film with him,"" Mosely said. ""Last year, multiple times, he was getting double-teamed and he made the right read, saw the right opening. I think the more he sees it, the more he will recognize it and make the right plays."" The young Wizards have struggled defensively and lost their past three games. They are allowing 123.9 points per game, which ranks second to last in the league. The fewest points the Wizards have allowed this season is 118. The most points Orlando has scored this season is 119. No. 2 overall pick Alex Sarr is averaging just 9.6 points and 6.7 boards and hasn't quite found his groove. Washington has gotten a boost in the past two games from rookie Kyshawn George, who has scored a combined 37 points and made nine threes in that span. ""We've talked about how sometimes you make or miss shots and now he's making the ones he missed,"" Wizards coach Brian Keefe said. ""He's got a good rhythm. He's able to read the game."" ""I know not a lot of rookies have this opportunity to be on the court, number one, and two, have a coaching staff that pushes you to be aggressive,"" George said. ""I think my teammates and my coaches have helped me keep my confidence up."" Jordan Poole is leading the Wizards with 20.7 points per game. One bright spot for Washington has been the play of second-year forward Bilal Coulibaly, who has nearly doubled his scoring output from last season and has raised his shooting percentage from 43.5 to 53.9 percent this season, all while continuing to draw tough defensive assignments. ""That's one of the things we really expect from Bilal,"" Keefe said. ""He has the defensive versatility to guard multiple guys.

Edwards will look to stay hot when the Timberwolves host the Miami Heat on Sunday in Minneapolis. The Timberwolves will try to increase their winning streak to four after victories over the Charlotte Hornets, Chicago Bulls and Portland Trail Blazers. ""I really can't explain it,"" Edwards said of his long-distance prowess. ""I'm not shocked or anything because I work so hard on my trey ball. It's like, ‘Here we go, this is what was supposed to happen.' Hopefully it will keep going that way."" Edwards has been a major part of Minnesota's recent success. He scored 37 points and made 9 of 15 shots from beyond the 3-point arc against Portland, posting those numbers despite resting in the fourth quarter with the Wolves up big.   In nine games this season, Edwards has 50 3-pointers while shooting a career-best 48.1 percent from beyond the arc.   Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said Edwards' shooting has helped the offense hum.   ""It makes the floor huge,"" Finch said. ""He's got great range. He's taking them in the flow of the offense. He's reading the coverages in pick-and-rolls really well right now. He's playing at a high level.""   Meanwhile, Miami is looking for a spark. The Heat have lost three straight against the Sacramento Kings, Phoenix Suns and Denver Nuggets.   Miami is coming off a 135-122 defeat in Denver on Friday night. Tyler Herro led the Heat with 24 points, but Jimmy Butler scored only two points and played only seven minutes before spraining his right ankle. He won't play Sunday.

It was also career victory No. 404, moving him past Grant Fuhr for 12th place on the NHL's all-time list. Florida leads the Eastern Conference with 23 points. Sam Bennett, Nate Schmidt and Dmitry Kulikov scored in regulation for the Panthers, who got two assists from Rodrigues. Bobrovsky, who played his first two NHL seasons for the Flyers (2010-2012), made 34 saves through overtime. The Flyers got goals from Joel Farabee, Anthony Richard and Garnet Hathaway. Scott Laughton added two assists, and goalie Samuel Ersson made 28 saves. Owen Tippett scored in the shootout for Philadelphia. Philadelphia got the first period's only goal. With 4:57 elapsed, Laughton skated from behind the net and won a puck battle with Florida's Uvis Balinskis. Laughton pushed the puck forward to Farabee, who scored on a one-timer from point-blank range. The Panthers came alive in the second period, scoring three of the four goals. First, Rodrigues dished back to the trailer, defenseman Nate Schmidt, who scored on a blistering shot from beyond the top of the left circle. Ersson misplayed that shot as the puck tucked in under his left underarm. The Panthers took a 2-1 lead as Rodrigues worked a give-and-go with Kulikov. For the finish, Rodrigues' lateral cross-ice pass to the slot found Kulikov, who scored off the left post. Philadelphia challenged that goal, believing the puck had gone out of play earlier in the sequence. But that challenge was denied. However, with seven minutes left in the second, Philadelphia pulled its goalie temporarily for an extra attacker on a delayed penalty. That resulted in Richard's goal from the high slot, tying the score 2-2. Bobrovsky, beaten high stick-side, appeared to have been screened on that shot as two Panthers and two Flyers were out in front. Florida regained the lead with 5:04 left in the second as Bennett scored from close range on a one-timer pass from Carter Verhaeghe. Hathaway tied the score 3-3 with 10:13 left in the third as he tried to center the puck. Instead, the puck bounced off of Panthers defenseman Balinskis before squirting in between Bobrovsky's pads. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

ASU also got a boost from freshmen Amier Ali (13 points), Joson Sanon (11 points) and Jayden Quaintance (13 rebounds). ""There are a number of guys who can be playmakers and we trust to make the right play,"" Hurley said. ""If we share the ball the right way, good things will happen. Joson got off to a fast start, JQ came through with his rebounding, and Amier made some big shots down the stretch. The freshmen stepped up for us."" The Sun Devils played much better than in their home opener, a 55-48 victory against Idaho State on Tuesday. ""It came down to executing and moving the ball,"" Miller said. ""We have great players, so when we are kicking out and hitting 3s, that's what our team is built off of. We have to continue making the extra pass and getting into the paint."" That will be essential against the Bulldogs, who are coming off a season-opening 101-63 victory against No. 8 Baylor in Spokane on Monday. Nolan Hickman scored 17 points and Graham Ike had 15 points and eight rebounds to lead a balanced Gonzaga attack. The Bulldogs had seven players score nine or more points. ""They just came in and played with great confidence and were very, very assertive,"" Gonzaga coach Mark Few said. ""That's the beauty of this team. We have some nice depth."" The Zags are opening the season with two games against major conference opponents for just the second time in Few's 26 seasons.

He had subbed in in the 61st and put Charlotte FC ahead 1-0 by putting a left-footed strike off a cross from Liel Abada past Gallese.

A minute later, Torres' left-footed strike in the area got past Kahlina but hit the post.

Wesley Cardet added 12 points and eight boards.   Fifteen players saw the floor for Providence, and 11 of them scored.   Amir Nesbitt paced the Skyhawks (1-2) with 12 points and five assists but was slowed down by six turnovers.

With a bogey-free, 9-under-par round, Lower equaled the best 18-hole score of his career, and is joined at 16-under 200 by Carson Young (67 on Saturday) and second-round co-leader Colombia's Nico Echavarria (68). Lower, 35, was in 14th place entering Saturday at El Cardonal at Diamante, but posted the round of the day with seven birdies and capped it with an eagle on the par-5 18th hole. ""The big thing about 18 is I think just getting it in play off the tee,"" said Lower, making his 94th career start on the PGA Tour. ""If you can avoid both the bunkers, you'll have a chance. ... I don't know where it landed, but it ended up maybe 10, 11 feet from it. I luckily got a read on the putt from (Kevin) Streelman, so worked out."" Ranked 95th in the FedEx Cup Fall standings entering the event, Lower is projected to rise to No. 59, which is significant since players ranked No. 51-60 at the end of the fall qualify for the first two signature events of 2025. ""I mean, there's 18 holes tomorrow on a very score-able golf course,"" he said. ""I think the wind's going to stay down again, so I have to go out and basically shoot probably somewhere between 5 and 9 under again. ... If the wind's down, scores are going to be low. Yeah, a win would mean everything. I still have a job to do."" Meanwhile, Young is also in pursuit of his first PGA Tour win and moved up two spots with six birdies, including one on No. 18, to offset a bogey on the par-4 7th hole.  ""It seemed like a whole different golf course today,"" said the 29-year-old Young, playing in his 64th PGA Tour event. ""The wind blowing in a little bit different direction so it was a challenge, but I still played really solid, hit a lot of good iron shots and made some random long putts which helped keep the momentum going for the round. Just happy I had a good finish there."" Echavarria, 30, posted another bogey-free round, notching four birdies along the way, to maintain a share of the lead as he eyes his third PGA Tour victory and second in back-to-back starts as he captured the ZOZO Championship on Oct. 27. The win would be huge for the Colombian as he would move from No. 65 in the FedEx Cup Fall standings to No. 51, which if it stands would qualify him for the first two signature events of 2025. ""Living the right life,"" he said. ""It's been -- yeah, it's been good golf, it's been solid. Played very smart today. ...

Per the report, Prescott and the Cowboys are holding off until one more specialist offers an opinion on whether he should undergo surgery. The veteran signal-caller is expected to meet with the specialist early next week in New York. Dallas' medical staff are on board with the surgery, which would keep him off the field for four months. If the specialist agrees with the Cowboys' assessment, Prescott will go under the knife on Wednesday, per the report.   Owner and general manager Jerry Jones told 105.3 The Fan in Dallas on Friday that Prescott would prefer to let the hamstring heal on its own have undergoing multiple surgeries (left shoulder, right thumb, right ankle) over the last few years. Prescott has not been placed on injured reserve, but he will be inactive Sunday when the Cowboys (3-5) try to snap a three-game losing streak against the visiting Philadelphia Eagles (6-2) because of a partial avulsion of his hamstring. ESPN reported that even without surgery, Prescott will need six to eight weeks to recover. Prescott, 31, got hurt while scrambling during the third quarter of Dallas' 27-21 road loss to the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday. Cooper Rush took over at quarterback, and he will be the starter during Prescott's absence, backed up by Trey Lance. Players are required to miss at least the next four games when placed on injured reserve. After hosting the Eagles on Sunday and the Houston Texans on Monday, Nov. 18, Dallas plays games at the Washington Commanders on Nov. 24 and at home against the New York Giants on Thursday, Nov. 28. Prescott, had he been placed on IR by Saturday, would have been eligible to be added back to the active roster for the home game against the Cincinnati Bengals on Monday, Dec. 9. The Cowboys did make moves on Saturday, elevating cornerback Josh Butler and wide receiver Jalen Cropper from the practice squad to the active roster. Prescott owns the NFL's richest contract, with a guarantee of $230 million in a deal that runs through 2030. In nine years as the Cowboys' starting quarterback, he has a 76-46 regular-season record but a 2-5 postseason record, having never guided Dallas to a conference final. This season, Prescott has completed 64.7 percent of his passes for 1,978 yards and 11 touchdowns with eight interceptions. For his career, the three-time Pro Bowl performer has a 66.8 percent completion rate for 31,437 yards and 213 TD passes with 82 interceptions. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Following his first touchdown to take a 7-3 lead in the first half, Daily created separation with a TD after leading a 94-yard drive that took 13:54 off the clock. In winning for the 13th straight time, the Black Knights (9-0, 7-0 AAC) used multiple long drives to extend the nation's longest winning streak and frustrate the Air Raid attack of the Mean Green (5-4, 2-3). Daily rushed for a game-high 153 yards on 36 carries and finished 2-for-4 passing for 15 yards and an interception. Kanye Udoh had 65 yards on 13 carries, while Noah Short added 41 yards on six rushes. Army rushed for 293 yards on 64 attempts and held the opposition to a field goal for the second consecutive game. North Texas quarterback Chandler Morris was 24 of 37 for 214 yards with two interceptions. The Black Knights' impressive 12-game streak of not trailing came to an end when North Texas got a 31-yard field goal from Kali Nguma after a massive 18-play, 62-yard drive over the first 6:50 on its first possession. Army responded by using a short field to go 48 yards in nine plays for the lead. Daily called his own number on second down and went untouched for 10 yards and a 7-3 advantage. The visitors' defense stood strong in the second quarter as the front forced a turnover on downs, stuffing Makenzie Gill II at the 2 for a perfectly executed goal-line stand. On the final snap of the half as Army lined up for a 31-yard field-goal attempt, the Black Knights tried a fake, but the Mean Green stopped holder Matthew Rhodes on the run to trail by four at the break. In the second half, Daily was picked off by Brian Nelson II, but the quarterback cashed in on the second possession. Army held the ball for 10:38 of the third quarter, and the series carried over into the fourth when Daily plunged in on the 21st play from two yards at 11:44.

With the win in the best-of-three series, NYCFC takes on the rival New York Red Bulls in the Eastern Conference semifinals. After three rounds of penalty kicks where each side converted their shots, the goalkeepers went save for save to keep the shootout going. New York's Matt Freese and Cincinnati's Roman Celentano took turns making saves, with Freese making one more. Chidozie Awaziem of Cincinnati and Andres Perea of NYCFC stepped up in the eighth round but each sent their attempts over the crossbar before Freese made his third and final save on Teenage Habede. Teammate Mitja Ilenic ended the shootout directly after the save by converting his attempt. It looked like the two teams that already faced each other five previous times this year in all competitions understood all the other team had planned. Defensively, both teams halted any creativity from the other side, leading to no surprises during the match leading to goals. Luca Orellano had the best chances on goal as the match stayed goalless where the forward had two shots on the goal in the first half. The first came in the 31st minute, when Orellano sent a left-footed shot across the face of goal but Freese dove to make the save. Then, in first-half stoppage time, Orellano dribbled through three defenders, holding possession, and sending a shot towards goal but it went wide right of the post. Orellano was busy offensively, sending in six shots and three on target, more than all of New York City FC who had one shot on target. However, head coach Pat Noonan took Orellano out of the match before penalty kicks after he pulled up and limped late in the match, leading to the visitor's best chance of the night. In the 81st minute, New York City thought they had the go-ahead goal when Alonso Martinez received a pass on the end of that turnover off Orellano's apparent injury. Martinez slotted the ball to the left of Roman Celentano but the offside flag went up with VAR confirming no goal. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Knicks and Pacers each will look to establish consistency Sunday afternoon, when they meet in Indianapolis in the second game of the season between the longtime Eastern Conference rivals. Both teams were off Saturday following their eventful games Friday, when the host Knicks rolled to a 116-94 win over the Milwaukee Bucks and the visiting Pacers collapsed in the second half of a 103-83 loss to the Charlotte Hornets. The win was the fourth of the season for the new-look Knicks, who overhauled their starting lineup with the offseason additions of Mikal Bridges and Karl-Anthony Towns. It was their third victory by at least 20 points. New York's four losses were by a total of 46 points. Half that collective margin was registered in a season-opening 132-109 loss to the defending NBA champion Boston Celtics. The new and old pieces clicked again in impressive fashion Friday, when the Knicks led the Bucks wire-to-wire. New York pulled off the same achievement in routing the Detroit Pistons 128-98 on Nov. 1. Six Knicks players scored in double figures Friday, when Towns led the Knicks with 32 points and 11 rebounds while Bridges had 17 points. Holdover Josh Hart (11 points, nine rebounds, seven assists) flirted with a triple-double while Jalen Brunson (15 points, nine assists) just missed a double-double.  ""It's going to take time to be cohesive, like we were at the end of the year last year,"" Brunson said of the Knicks, who fell to the Pacers in seven games of last season's Eastern Conference semifinals. ""It's kind of a different team. So for us, we have to continue to gel every single day and keep learning."" The Pacers learned some difficult lessons Friday, when they played a game decided by more than seven points for just the second time this season. Indiana appeared on its way to a decisive victory when it overcame a 10-point first-half deficit and took a 13-point lead by opening the third quarter on a 20-7 run. But the Hornets closed the quarter on a 23-2 run and outscored the Pacers 29-17 in the fourth quarter. Charlotte shot just 37.8 percent from the floor in the first half. The Hornets ended the third by making eight of 11 shots -- including a 5-of-6 performance from beyond the arc -- and shot 56.3 percent (18 of 32) over the final 18 minutes. The Pacers, who opened the third quarter by draining eight of their first nine shots, finished the quarter in a 1-for-10 slump. Indiana missed 11 of its final 12 shots from 3-point range during the Hornets' comeback. Overall, Indiana set season lows in field-goal percentage (39.8 percent) and free-throw percentage (57.1 percent). The 83 points were the fewest for the Pacers since Dec. 12, 2022, when they fell to the Miami Heat 87-82. ""We had a rough shot-taking night on top of everything else and that doesn't help,"" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said.

McCaffrey missed the first eight games due to Achilles tendinitis in both legs. He was listed as questionable on Friday's injury report. McCaffrey, 28, initially hurt his calf on Aug. 6 and was placed on injured reserve prior to Week 2. But now he's ready to go and 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan is ready to give him the ball. McCaffrey was NFL Offensive Player of the Year last season when he led the NFL with 2,023 yards from scrimmage: a league-leading 1,459 rushing yards and 14 touchdowns plus 67 catches for 564 yards and seven touchdowns. McCaffrey hasn't played since the 49ers lost to the Chiefs 25-22 in overtime in the Super Bowl nearly nine months ago. McCaffrey had 22 carries for 80 yards and eight receptions for 80 yards and a touchdown in that contest. The 49ers opened a roster spot for McCaffrey by waiving running back Patrick Taylor Jr. on Friday. San Francisco also elevated safety Tashaun Gipson Sr. from the practice squad on Saturday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

When Fairleigh Dickinson visits the Bluejays on Sunday afternoon in Omaha, Neb., Kalkbrenner will try to follow his career high 49-point outburst where he set a school record with 20 made field goals in 22 attempts in a 99-86 win Wednesday against Texas Rio Grande Valley. It was a shooting performance that rivals all time NCAA records and the fact that it came from a three-time Big East Defensive Player of the Year winner shows just how well-rounded Kalkbrenner's game has become. The last time a player converted 20 field goals and shot over 90 percent was in 1973, when the late Bill Walton did it at UCLA. The 49 points also broke Doug McDermott's CHI Health Center Omaha arena record of 45 points set in 2014. Kalkbrenner's previous scoring high was 31 points set in the first round of the 2023 NCAA Tournament against North Carolina State. ""We wanted to make a concerted effort to get me established in the post,"" Kalkbrenner said. ""I saw a few go in and kept it going from there. I didn't even realize how much I had. We were in a close game and not executing what we wanted to on defense. I was thinking more about that than what I was doing on offense."" A tight first half led to a two-possession game in the second half as Rio Grande Valley connected on 14 of 35 shots from 3-point range and had 15 offensive rebounds. Creighton coach Greg McDermott said the effort from the scrappy Vaqueros provided plenty of teaching moments the Bluejays will review in a film session and at practice.  ""We'll have a spirited practice to try and get ourselves some better habits on the defensive end,"" McDermott said. ""I'm happy to get the win, but disappointed in what we are doing defensively."" Steven Ashworth added 25 points, on 17-of-17 shooting from the free-throw line, with seven rebounds and seven assists. He was just 3 of 10 from the floor. ""It was incredible,"" McDermott said of Kalkbrenner's performance. ""His teammates did a great job of finding him, of realizing what he had going. He's one of the best players to ever play here and there have been some really good players that have played here."" Last season, Fairleigh Dickinson led the Northeast Conference with 92.0 points per game. The Knights are in search of an offense that is more motion oriented this season and after they dropped their season opener 113-72 at Miami (Fla.) on Monday, they nearly flipped the score with a 112-72 win against Division III Purchase in their home opener Thursday.  Terrence Brown scored a game high 24 points for FDU and Jo'el Emanuel added 16 points.  ""We want to be up tempo and play free,"" FDU coach Jack Castleberry said. ""Basketball is about making shots at the end of the day.  We try to make this (game) all about execution and process."" -Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Mountaineers (1-1), fresh off blowing out an NAIA opponent this week, face Wisconsin on the road at Madison, Wisc. The Badgers (2-0) also have victories over lesser opponents to open the season.   Appalachian State coach Dustin Kerns wasn't as impressed about the score in his team's 108-54 win over St. Andrews of North Carolina on Wednesday as he was with the degree of effort.   ""It doesn't matter your opponent,"" Kerns said. ""You've got to play the right way, have the habits of being unselfish, making tough plays, like Myles Tate diving on a loose ball four times in the first half. That has nothing to do with your opponent.""   In nine minutes on Wednesday, Tate made the only shot he took, a 3-pointer, after netting 21 points in the Mountaineers' season-opening 77-63 loss to Miami (Ohio) on Monday, but he made four steals.   Appalachian State freshman Michael Marcus Jr. racked up 18 points, 10 rebounds and four blocks to lead the win over St. Andrews.   ""I really wanted to see our habits improve -- 23 assists, six turnovers, I thought was really good,"" Kerns said, after his team had 19 giveaways vs. 11 assists in Monday's defeat.   Appalachian State defeated visiting Auburn of the Southeastern Conference 69-64 last season, and edged host Louisville of the Atlantic Coast Conference 61-60 early in the 2022-23 season. The Badgers are the only power conference school on Appalachian State's regular-season schedule.   Wisconsin overpowered visiting Holy Cross 85-61 in its season opener, but not before falling behind by 16 points nearly midway through the first half.   The Badgers were also big favorites at home against Montana State on Thursday and prevailed 79-67, but the Bobcats were within four points for most of the first half before Max Klesmit carried Wisconsin the rest of the way.   Klesmit, who hit 39.8 percent of his 3-pointers last season, went just 1-for-7 from long range and finished with seven points against Holy Cross before nailing 6 of 11 from deep and scoring 26 against Montana State. He netted 15 points in the second half.   ""Yeah, you know he's not gonna be going 1-for-7 very often, or for very long,"" Wisconsin coach Greg Gard said. ""He's been putting a lot of time in working with our coaching staff. Cleaning up some things with his shot, and getting more reps. And, shooters shoot, and obviously he was feeling it tonight.   Klesmit is averaging 16.5 points through two games, second on the team to Missouri transfer John Tonje's 18.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

He also had 13 rebounds in his third double-double for the Red Storm and his first since he had 16 points and 14 rebounds in a 75-72 loss to Providence on Feb. 13.  Dunlap scored 14 of his career-high 20 points after halftime while Wilcher collected 13 of his 14 points in the final 20 minutes as the Red Storm outscored Quinnipiac 61-34. Deivon Smith added 13 points and 10 assists for St. John's, which is 2-0 for the 10th time in the last 11 seasons. Ryan Mabrey scored a team-high 17 points for Quinnipiac (1-2), the preseason favorite to win the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference. Paul Otieno had 12 points while Jaden Zimmerman finished with 11 points for the Bobcats. Quinnipiac led for the final 14:10 of the first half and opened its biggest lead at 36-28 on a pair of free throws by Amarri Monroe with 2:40 left. St. John's began its comeback by scoring seven of the final 10 points of the half, including a 3-pointer by Dunlap that narrowed the Bobcats' lead to 39-35. The Red Storm scored the first five points of the second half and took the lead on Wilcher's layup with 18:32 left. Quinnipiac took the lead once more and generated one more tie as the teams traded baskets on four consecutive trips before Wilcher's dunk gave St. John's the lead for good at 45-43 and started a 14-4 run. Quinnipiac mounted its final comeback bid when Zimmerman hit a 3-pointer and Otieno drained a pair of free throws to cut the deficit to 57-52 with 12:09 left before Dunlap scored eight straight points to spark a game-ending 39-21 run.

It will be the school's fifth game against a power conference opponent since they made the move to Division I for the 2021-22 season, and it might just be their best chance to win. Oklahoma State had to fight tooth and nail to beat coach Doug Gottlieb's Green Bay squad in the Cowboys' season opener on Monday, needing a decisive second half after entering the break only up by a point. They ended up outscoring Green Bay by 12 in the second half for a 13-point victory, but it wasn't exactly the night first-year coach Steve Lutz and the Cowboys were looking for. ""I know that we were great in rebounding, we were great at shooting free throws, we took care of the ball for the most part, but you're not going to be able to play that kind of defense and win in the Big 12,"" Lutz said. ""You're just not. You're kidding yourself if you think that's going to happen."" Senior guard Bryce Thompson led the Cowboys in their win over Green Bay with 22 points on 9-of-13 shooting along with five rebounds. Senior forward Abou Ousmane added 16 points and eight rebounds, while Davonte Davis and Marchelus Avery added 10 points apiece.  Oklahoma State had a 19-3 edge on offensive rebounds and shot 21 of 24 from the charity stripe. The Cowboys had a bit more trouble defensively, allowing Green Bay to shoot 49.0 percent (25 of 41) from the field. St. Thomas' last game also came against Green Bay and surprisingly, they had a more convincing crack at them on Friday. The Tommies got out to a 20-point lead before halftime but took their foot of the gas in the second half, still walking away with a 14-point victory, one point better than Oklahoma State did four days before. Junior guard Miles Barnstable led the charge for the Tommies over Green Bay with a 23-point performance while his backcourt partner Kendall Blue added 17 points. Senior guard Ryan Dufault added 14 points off the bench on 6 of 8 from the field.  The Tommies' win over Green Bay was their second game of the season, as they beat Division III foe North Central (Minn.) by 25 in the season opener. Barnstable led the team in scoring in that game as well with 16 points, bringing his average across the first two games to 19.5. Gottlieb came away impressed with the program St. Thomas coach Johnny Tauer is building. ""We knew how well-coached this team was,"" Gottlieb said. ""(Tauer's) been doing this to people for a long time, and I think our guys respected St. Thomas but we didn't have the disposition. ""They're expertly coached in spacing. They play off two feet beautifully. They're tough. They're smart. They play together. That's what a basketball team looks like."" If Tauer and the Tommies can overcome Oklahoma State on Sunday, they'll already be off to the best start in their time as a DI program. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Kaliakmanis completed 17 of 33 passes for 240 yards against the Golden Gophers, for whom he played two seasons, including in 2023 when he threw 14 touchdowns in 12 games. Rutgers improved to 5-4, 2-4 in the Big Ten in snapping a four-game losing streak. Kaliakmanis threw a pair of first-half TDs to Dymere Miller before Rutgers' defense set up the go-ahead score that gave the Scarlet Knights a 23-16 lead. On first-and-16 from the Minnesota 6-yard line, tight end Jameson Geers fumbled when he was hit by Tyreem Powell at the 10 and Shaquan Loyal recovered. Two plays after the fumble, Rutgers' Strong cut up the middle and was left open for an easy TD pass when Minnesota defensive back Ethan Robinson backed off. Following Strong's go-ahead score, the Scarlet Knights increased their lead when Jordan Walker sacked Max Brosmer in the end zone for a safety with 6:53 left, and Jay Patel kicked a 22-yard field goal with 2:45 remaining. Brosmer finished 27 of 45 for 262 yards and Geers had eight catches for 73 yards, but Darius Taylor was held to 28 rushing yards on 10 carries as the Golden Gophers (6-4, 4-3) saw their four-game winning streak stopped. Rutgers earned the win despite missing star running back Kyle Monangai due to undisclosed injury that hampered him in its loss at Southern California two weeks ago. Antwan Raymond replaced Monangai and finished with 73 yards on 22 carries. The Scarlet Knights held a 14-9 lead by halftime thanks to two TDs to Miller. Miller made a diving 1-yard catch with 3:31 left in the first quarter on fourth down for a 7-6 lead. After Minnesota ended the first period with a 9-7 lead on a 51-yard field goal by Dragan Kesich, Miller hauled in a 17-yard TD with 9:54 left in the second quarter. Minnesota regained the lead on its first series of the second half when Brosmer rolled out for a 17-yard pass to Marcus Major with 9:07 left in the third quarter. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Matt Coronato and Mikael Backlund scored goals, MacKenzie Weegar had two assists and Dan Vladar made 17 saves for the Flames, who have lost seven of nine (2-5-2).

Benson was there to backhand the puck into the net for a 1-0 lead at 1:11, his second straight game with a goal. Buffalo went on the first power play of the game when Martin Pospisil flipped the puck over the glass for a delay-of-game penalty.

It was the 10th goal of the season for Thompson and the 139th of his Buffalo career, tying him with Jack Eichel for 20th on the all-time list. Rasmus Dahlin earned his 235th career assist on the play to pass Alexei Zhitnik for the third-most assists by a defenseman in Sabres history. The Flames, who have been outscored 17-8 in the first period this season, cut it to 2-1 at 17:44 of the second period. Blake Coleman intercepted an outlet pass in the neutral zone, skated into the Buffalo zone and dropped the puck for Weegar, who carried it into the high slot before taking a shot that was redirected into the net by Coronato for his fifth goal of the season.

A 16-point third quarter lifted the Eagles (5-4, 2-3 ACC), who broke a three-game skid in a game of vastly contrasting styles. Anchored by Robichaux (28 carries, 198 yards, two touchdowns) and McDonald (15 carries, 133 yards, one touchdown), Boston College logged 313 of its 378 total yards on 51 rushing attempts. Quarterbacks Thomas Castellanos and Grayson James combined for just 65 yards through the air, but both threw touchdowns. Kyle McCord threw for 392 of Syracuse's 431 total yards during a 31-for-48, two-touchdown performance. Jackson Meeks (105 yards) and Oronde Gadsden II (102) were 100-yard receivers for the Orange (6-3, 3-3). LeQuint Allen scored on a 4-yard run to finish an eight-play drive turning Syracuse's 14-0 deficit into a 21-14 lead with 8:36 left in the third quarter. With James quarterbacking, Robichaux's third run in a 49-second span -- aided by an unnecessary roughness penalty -- tied the score at 21. The go-ahead points came on the next play from scrimmage when Donovan Ezeirauku strip-sacked McCord and knocked the ball through the end zone for the first Boston College safety since 2012. The ensuing drive spanned 12 plays and 67 yards in 6:55, ending with McDonald bouncing to the left for a 13-yard touchdown in the final minute. Syracuse covered 75 yards on its own 10-play drive to start the fourth, moving within 30-28 on McCord's 12-yard pass to Darrell Gill Jr. The Eagles ensured their lead with 6:51 remaining in regulation as James faked a handoff and found a wide-open Jeremiah Franklin for an 18-yard touchdown on fourth-and-1. After Liam Connor missed a 29-yard field-goal attempt on Boston College's opening drive of the game, Quintavious Hutchins recovered Allen's fumble on the following series.

Five straight McDonald rushes set up Castellanos for his first completed pass of the game -- a 9-yard touchdown to Lewis Bond. McCord led back-to-back touchdown drives to make it 14-14 at halftime. The Ohio State transfer hit Gadsden for big bookending plays, scoring on a 17-yard pass to the right. After the Eagles went three-and-out, McCord's 25-yard run and a connection with Meeks helped Allen find the end zone on a 3-yard run with 2:10 left before intermission. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Marchiol connected on a 28-yard pass to Jahiem White to the Cincinnati 9, but West Virginia settled for a field goal and a 10-7 lead. The game swung back in Cincinnati's direction when Logan Wilson intercepted a pass for Rodney Gallagher III in the end zone. On the next play from scrimmage, Sorsby found Pryor all alone in the left flat and Pryor raced up the left sideline 80 yards for the score that drew Cincinnati within 10, 24-14. Sorsby cut West Virginia's lead to 24-21 with a 12-yard spinning touchdown run with 9:42 left in the fourth.

Smith had a 17-yard touchdown catch late in the first half to up the lead to 21-0 for the Buckeyes (8-1, 5-1 Big Ten). The score was Smith's ninth to pass Chris Carter's Ohio State freshman record for TD catches set in 1984. Smith needed three receptions to break Carter's first-year mark of 41 and he surpassed that in the first half with six catches for 87 yards. He did not have a catch in the second half. Howard was 21 of 26 for 260 yards and TreVeyon Henderson ran for 85 yards on six carries. Purdue (1-8, 0-5) has lost eight straight games for its longest single-season streak since losing 10 in a row in 2013. The Boilermakers also lost eight consecutive games spanning the 2016-17 seasons. Purdue quarterback Hudson Card was 9-of-19 passing for 108 yards and an interception and Devin Mockabee rushed for 73 yards on 13 carries for the Boilermakers. The Buckeyes used a special teams play and a goal-line stand for a 14-0 lead in the second quarter.

It was 24-0 late in the third quarter when Ohio State scored twice in 8 seconds on a 19-yard TD run by Henderson and defensive end Jack Sawyer's 15-yard scoop and score off a Reggie Love III fumble to make it 38-0. -- Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Current advanced to the semifinals where they will face the No. 1 seed Orlando Pride, who earned a 4-1 victory over the Chicago Red Stars in a quarterfinal match Friday. Chawinga, the NWSL's record-breaking goal scorer, returned from a knee injury to score the lone goal of the quarterfinal match. Casey Murphy saved the initial shot by Chawinga and the ball settled at the feet of Vanessa DiBernardo. The midfielder's follow-up shot went off the post and back to the feet of Chawinga, whose first shot was blocked by Kaleigh Kurtz but left a wide-open net on the second attempt. That gives Chawinga 21 goals in NWSL action, adding to an already impressive freshman campaign from the newcomer. North Carolina nearly tied the match in the 32nd minute, when Almuth Schult made a diving save and pinned the ball down with her glove. Manaka Matsukubo ran up and kicked the ball into the net from under the goalkeeper's palm, but the referee blew the whistle because Schult had possession of the ball by holding it against the grass. Kansas City's win featured its offensive firepower, despite the low final score with the Current taking 14 shots in the win and five on target. North Carolina had three saves in goal and three blocks to keep the match close.  In the seventh minute of stoppage time, Chawinga tackled the ball away from Bianca St. Georges and went to the ground. St. Georges responded by standing over the forward.

That's because the Saudi Arabian-backed rival to the PGA Tour never made a formal contract offer to the former world No. 1. Day acknowledged that he made a ""business move"" in having his agent explore what a potential move to LIV would entail back in 2022, but that the upstart league was too concerned about Day's injury history. ""I said (to my agent), 'No worries, I'm happy with where I'm at, but it's always nice to know.'"" Day told Code Sports Australia ahead of this month's Australian PGA Championship. ""And they (LIV Golf) said, ‘We love Jason, but he's too injured; he just gets too many injuries.' I don't blame them."" Day won the 2015 PGA Championship and spent 47 consecutive weeks atop the Official World Golf Ranking from 2016-17. However, Day began to suffer from chronic lower back injuries and ultimately dropped as low as 175th in the rankings to begin 2023. The back issues even had him contemplate retirement. The lack of an offer to even consider a move to LIV turned out to be blessing in disguise for Day, who watched fellow Australian Cameron Smith make the jump in the fall of 2022. After working with noted coach Chris Como to revamp his swing, Day finally snapped a five-year winless streak with a victory at last year's Byron Nelson. He's currently ranked 34th and has five top-10s in 21 events this year. ""I'm so thankful and so happy that I stayed on the PGA Tour,"" Day, 36, said.

Tennessee (2-0), the No. 12 team in the country, came out sharp on both ends of the court, scoring the first 10 points of the game. The Cardinals (1-1) would not score until the 14:35 mark and were forced to play catch-up all day. The Volunteers made that difficult thanks to 56.6 percent shooting on their end, while holding the hosts to just 26.7 percent. While the visitors did commit 20 turnovers, they mitigated that by outrebounding the Cardinals 40-26 and enjoying a 40-10 scoring edge in the lane. The Cardinals primarily struggled from deep, connecting on just 5-of-23 3-point attempts in the half and shooting just 25.6 percent from beyond the arc for the contest. Meanwhile, Tennessee made 10 of its 19 3-point attempts. Lanier, who transferred from North Florida in the offseason, went 3-for-6, while Zeigler hit on 4-of-7. Zeigler's layup with 3:18 remaining extended the Volunteers' lead to 38-16, but Louisville cut that deficit to 40-26 by halftime. Louisville would cut the lead to 47-38 with 13:17 remaining after back-to-back 3-pointers by Reyne Smith, but that would be the last time the Cardinals got within single digits. Tennessee pulled away again and led by as much as 69-43 with 6:38 remaining.

Wonnum, 27, had 62 tackles and eight sacks in 15 games (14 starts) last season with the Vikings, who selected him in the fourth round of the 2020 NFL Draft out of South Carolina. He registered 171 tackles and 23 sacks in 62 career games (31 starts). The Panthers (2-7) face the Giants (2-7) on Sunday. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Commodores (1-0) routed Maryland Eastern Shore, 102-63, on Monday to start Byington's tenure at the school, while the Redhawks (0-1) dropped an 88-60 decision at Bradley on the same day. The Commodores committed just one turnover, shot 50.0 percent from the field and broke the 100-point barrier for the first time since a 120-85 win over Savannah State on Nov. 27, 2018. Still, Byington sees room for improvement. ""We missed a bunch of free throws. We missed a bunch of 3s,"" Byington said. ""We're going to have high-scoring nights. We play fast, and I think we've got a lot of quick guards. But there's going to be some nights that we've got to win (in) different ways."" Devin McGlockton (24 points, 13 rebounds) and Jaylen Carey (13 points, 10 rebounds) each recorded a double-double in their respective debuts with Vanderbilt. Former Michigan State point guard AJ Hoggard will make his season debut Sunday after missing the season opener due to an NCAA suspension for participating in last spring's Portsmouth Invitational. Southeast Missouri State, picked seventh in the 11-team Ohio Valley Conference, received a career-high 17 points from sophomore BJ Ward and 11 from JUCO transfer Damarion Walkup in its opener. ""I'm happy that BJ was able to bounce back,"" coach Brad Korn said. ""He didn't have a great statistical season outside of shooting a year ago. He's put a lot of work into it, so for him to see it pay off in an environment and a team like (Bradley), hopefully that continues to give him that confidence, because BJ's a very good point guard."" Of the 12 Redhawks who played Monday, nine are juniors or seniors. Rob Martin, who led the Redhawks in scoring (11.9) and assists (3.5) last year, scored just six points versus Bradley. Josh Earley, Southeast Missouri State's only other returning starter from a year ago, didn't play in the opener. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Shapovalov, a tournament qualifier, won in 77 minutes on the strength of 13 aces and a winning percentage of 82 on first-serve points. The 25-year-old missed the second half of 2023 because of injury and spent this season working back into form. For Medjedovic, 21, it was his first ATP Tour final.

This matchup with the Demon Deacons will be Michigan's only trip outside of Ann Arbor across its first five games. The Wolverines (1-0) whipped visiting Cleveland State 101-53 in Monday night's opener behind Danny Wolf's 19-point, 13-rebound outing. Wake Forest (2-0) has won two home games, including Thursday night's 80-64 victory over North Carolina A&T. ""Obviously the biggest problem on offense is 19 turnovers,"" Demon Deacons coach Steve Forbes said. ""That's not acceptable and there were nine of them by two people. We have to get that fixed by Sunday or it will be tough. We had 15 assists on 27 baskets, so we were moving the ball pretty well, and we could probably move the ball even more and we'll continue to do that as we grow as a team."" Michigan's season-opening outing was highlighted by 68.4-percent shooting from the field. ""We think smart basketball teams take what (the) game gives them,"" May said. ""Our transition game was on. We scored well off turnovers. We had putbacks."" May said Wolf's numbers were impressive, in part, based on the Wolverines' ability to spread out the production. ""Because we're so potent offensively, he doesn't have the same volume of touches,"" May said. Wake Forest will want to be stingy at the defensive end in the lane. That plan went well in the first two games, giving up only 16 points in the paint to North Carolina A&T based on how Forbes' staff charted those numbers. ""That's where our defense is being built, so I was very encouraged once again how hard our guys played defensively,"" Forbes said. Wake Forest won the only previous meeting with Michigan by a score of 70-61 in the 2000 ACC/Big Ten Challenge in Ann Arbor.

Host Chelsea will be the happier of the two sides with their recent form under first-year manager Enzo Maresca after finishing 12th and sixth in the league table the past two years. The Blues (5-2-3, 18 points) enter the weekend in fourth, above the fifth-place Gunners (5-2-3, 18 points) on goal differential. Their only league losses have been against first-place Liverpool and second-place Manchester City. They face a quick turnaround following a UEFA Europa Conference league fixture on Thursday, an 8-0 win over Armenia's FC Noah that required minimal effort. ""I don't know the last two years, what the feeling was,"" Maresca said. ""In this moment, the feeling from us is that we can compete, and we can win against any team. If you don't take it serious and if you don't do the right things, also, you can lose against any team. But for sure, we have the right feeling that we are going in the right direction. Hopefully on Sunday, we can give our fans a good day."" But Chelsea could be without virtuoso attacker Cole Palmer, who has seven goals and five assists but hasn't trained since he was on the receiving end of Lisandro Martinez's crunching tackle in last weekend's draw with Manchester United. Meanwhile, Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard could play for the first time since early September after returning to manager Mikel Arteta's training sessions this week. He has been sidelined by an ankle injury. All of the Gunners' defeats have come since losing the influential Norwegian, including back-to-back losses in their last matches -- 1-0 at Newcastle in the league on Nov. 2 and 1-0 at Inter Milan in UEFA Champions League play on Wednesday. For Arteta, the performances have been strong enough -- it's just the end product that is lacking. In particular, Arsenal led 20-7 in shots in their trip to Milan. ""But you need to take that into a winning football match because, in the end, that is the only thing that anybody is going to judge,"" Arteta said. ""Not how superior you were to the opponent, that you outrun the opponent, you out-performed the opponent in every single way. It is about how they scored a goal and you didn't. We have a problem, and the problem has to be resolved by scoring more goals than the opponent -- that's it.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Bu,"Japanese right-hander Roki Sasaki is set to enter free agency after the Chiba Lotte Marines confirmed his posting process was underway on Saturday. But his posting process, because of his prowess and age, will be more nuanced than others.  Sasaki, 23, is viewed as having one of the top young arms in the world with a 100 mph fastball and deadly sinker.  But barring a change in Nippon Professional Baseball guidelines that limit Sasaki to signing a minor league deal in MLB, he could choose to remain in Japan.  Sasaki indicated in a post to X on Saturday that he's ready to be tested in Major League Baseball, thanking his Japanese team for allowing him to post. If he exits Japan, it would be on a similar timeframe Shohei Ohtani followed when he first entered MLB with the Los Angeles Angels.   ""There were many things that did not go well during my five years with the Marines, but I was able to get to this point by concentrating only on baseball, with the support of my teammates, staff, front office, and fans. I will do my best to work my way up from my minor contract to become the best player in the world, so that I will have no regrets in my one and only baseball career and live up to the expectations of everyone who has supported me."" By waiting until he's entering his age 25 season in 2026, Sasaki could've been in position to cash in with an enormous initial contract like the one Yoshinobu Yamamoto signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers for 12 years and $325 million last December. In Sasaki's case, the Chiba Lotte Marines can claim 20 percent of Sasaki's contract. International bonus pools are hard-capped near $7 million per team.  Teams are allowed to trade for bonus pool money to increase the amount they can pay international players on minor-league deals, but most enter free agency sitting on between $4 million and $6.5 million total. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Waring's 54-hole total of 18-under is good enough to take a one-shot lead into the final round at Yas Links, with Niklas Norgaard of Denmark right behind him at 17-under par following a round of 69.  Tommy Fleetwood (71) of England, Shane Lowry (66) of Ireland, Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen (71) and Sweden's Sebastian Soderberg (68) are tied for third at 15-under. Waring, an Englishman, can blame his 73 on his putter. After a birdie on the second hole, he had 8 feet remaining for a birdie on the par-3 fourth hole and wound up with a bogey. He then missed birdie chances on the next nine holes before another bogey on No. 14. ""I'm a little bit disappointed. I felt like I could have put myself out of sight but four rounds of golf, you're always going to have a bit of an iffy run of holes, an iffy round of golf,"" he said. ""If beginning of the week you had given me a one-shot lead going into tomorrow, I'd have snapped your hand off. ""I'm trying to remain positive that I'm still in the lead, looking forward to getting out there tomorrow."" Six golfers are tied for seventh place at 14-under, including Belgium's Thomas Detry, who shot a career-low 62 on the DP World Tour on a 10-birdie round. His primary goal for the week is to climb into the top 50 to move on in The Race to Dubai; he entered the week No. 63 in the standings. He shot 72 and 68 in the first two rounds. ""It's been a tale of three different days; I finished horrendously on Thursday, played much better yesterday and today was just kind of everything clicked together. ""I just played really well. Didn't really miss any drivers. Pretty wide fairways out here, but I kept myself in position the whole round and obviously made a couple of great putts on my first few holes to get the momentum going and I kept going."" Northern Ireland's Rory McIlory, the Race to Dubai leader, sits at 13-under in a four-way tie for 13th place. He finished with a 69, but a bogey at No. 1 and a double bogey at No. 18, spoiled what could have been a stellar round. Waring likely will need another terrific round to win Sunday, and he acknowledged he will need to control his emotions. ""I wasn't at my best today, felt a little bit jittery in total honesty, I felt the greens were a foot-and-a-half quicker, they were breaking a bit more than what I was reading. I just struggled on them a little bit today."" He continued: ""It's a game of golf tomorrow in the sunshine -- I'm looking forward to the challenge of it now.

One million dollars? In college sports? It feels downright quaint when revisited in this era. Top-strength coaches are now joining the seven-figure club. Referencing USA Today’s database of coaching salaries, most recently updated in October 2024, 92 FBS coaches earn at least $1 million annually. Certainly, inflation from 30 years ago is a factor, but if only all professions’ pay scales swelled at the rate of coaching salaries... With that in mind, it’s not unfair to evaluate coaching tenures relative to their sizable bank accounts. Using USA Today’s findings, the following quartet stands out for delivering results that fall short of their wages. A notable omission is Penn State’s James Franklin. Franklin’s 1-10 all-time record against Ohio State is certainly a sore spot among the Nittany Lions fan base, as is the program’s inability to break through to a College Football Playoff appearance. However, the Nittany Lions have consistently finished seasons ranked in the top 10. With Franklin’s $8.5 million salary ranked as the 13th-most lucrative among coaches, Penn State’s results typically meet or exceed its coach’s paycheck. Starting with the 77th-highest paid coach in the sport may seem like an odd choice. But then, UAB hiring Trent Dilfer was an odd choice in itself, and his brief tenure has almost immediately unraveled the remarkable work of his predecessor, Bill Clark. Clark transformed the regular cellar-dweller program, which had been literally shut down early into his tenure, into a perennial bowl participant. Dilfer took over with four years of high school coaching experience at Tennessee-based Lipscomb Academy, and the Blazers immediately began to struggle. They went 4-8 last season and are 2-6 through eight games in 2024, with an average margin of defeat of 25.7 points per game. At $1.5 million per year, Dilfer is paid more than in-state counterpart Rich Rodriguez, who has won 14 games in less than two seasons at Jacksonville State. Dilfer’s UAB team also suffered a humiliating defeat this season at the hands of ULM, coached by Bryant Vincent, a former Clark assistant passed over for the Blazers job. Vincent is paid $900,000 less per year than Dilfer. As the first program ever to pay its head coach $1 million, Florida obviously takes its investment in football seriously. Those in Gainesville responsible for making such decisions also demand immediate and consistent ROI. Just ask Jim McElwain and Dan Mullen, both of whom were fired within two years of reaching an SEC Championship Game. So, with third-year Gators coach Billy Napier sporting an underwhelming 15-18 record in his tenure and headed for a possible third straight sub-.500 finish, it stands to reason that Napier was on the hot seat. His $7.37 million per year contract, ranked No. 21 in college football, is relatively modest compared to the rest of the SEC—and perhaps reflective of the massive buyout money that the program’s impatience has cost it. Mullen’s buyout came with a $12 million price tag, which Florida is paying through 2027. McElwain’s buyout totaled $7.5 million, the same rate UF initially balked at paying to Colorado State in order to hire him away from Fort Collins. One massive reason he’s back for 2025: Napier’s buyout is staggering $26.7 million. In the roughly 15 years since the end of the Pete Carroll dynasty at USC, Trojans faithful have offered no shortage of explanations as to why the program has not been able to recapture its dominance of the 2000s. NCAA sanctions in the wake of the Reggie Bush scandal—which wouldn’t even violate today’s rules—were overly punitive. The Pac-12 Conference was holding USC back. The investment in coaching salaries wasn’t competitive with the top of college football. Well, it’s been a decade since the Bush scandal sanctions lapsed. The Trojans are now members of the Big Ten, and at more than $10 million per year, Lincoln Riley is the fourth-highest paid coach in the sport and tops in the Big Ten. A promising start in 2022, with USC going 11-1 in the regular season, seemed to justify the hefty contract. Since then, however, USC has posted a combined 12-12 record, with a disappointing finish to 2022, an 8-5 record in 2023 that felt like a retread of the Clay Helton years, and a 2-5 start in 2024. The Trojans have lost to three Big Ten teams with .500 or worse league records (Washington, Michigan, and Maryland). The inclusion of Stoops, who in 2022 became Kentucky’s all-time wins leader, is tenuous. Winning with consistency at what is a firmly established basketball school is never easy—just look at the track records of Duke, Kansas, UConn, or Arizona football programs. Look, too, at Stoops’ Kentucky predecessors, most of whom have seen far more success during his tenure. Bear Bryant and his successor, Blanton Collier, are the only other Wildcats coaches post-World War II to have above-.500 records at UK. Stoops is also the ninth-highest paid head coach in the sport, making just over $9 million a year. Kentucky has finished ranked in the end-of-season Top 25 just twice during Stoops’ tenure—the most recent time, in 2021, it had its 10 wins vacated. Measured against the history of Kentucky football, Stoops is an undeniable success. However, measured against his $9 million salary, Stoops is the least accomplished among the sport’s 10 highest-paid coaches. Copyright 2024"

If you watched Florida strike fear in the Bulldogs and paid too close attention in the first half of Georgia at Alabama, we understand your trepidation in putting your toes in the water on this one. The Bulldogs (7-1, 5-1 SEC) are looking to strengthen their bid for a fourth straight conference championship game appearance and are in the top three of the initial CFP rankings for the fourth year in a row. A newer guest to the party, Ole Miss (7-2, 3-2) has appeared in four consecutive initial CFP rankings as well. But finishing in the SEC with a strong November is a steep climb. And the timing is not good for the Rebels because of injuries. Ole Miss QB Jaxson Dart knows that all too well. He was mortal in the Ole Miss loss at Georgia last season. Dart is first in the nation with 3,210 passing yards and a 192.4 passing efficiency rating. He has 21 touchdowns to just three interceptions. He’s eager to get another shot at Georgia after the 52-17 loss to the Bulldogs last season.

The Hoosiers are No. 8 in the first CFP rankings that were unveiled on Tuesday, but IU isn’t exactly known for playing in big games in November. At 9-0 for the first time in program history and seeking its first 10-win season, will also be looking for just its second victory over Michigan since 1987; the other came during the COVID-shortened 2020 season (38-21 in Bloomington).This isn’t the week Indiana fumbles.  Indiana trailed for the first time all season when the Spartans jumped out to a 10-0 lead, and they didn’t just get off the mat.  The Hoosiers responded by scoring 47 answered points. Kurtis Rourke, who missed the win over Washington the previous week with a right thumb injury but, returned to throw for 263 yards and four touchdowns last week, when Michigan was ripped for 470 total yards in a home loss to Oregon. We’re going with performance props to avoid a late score spoiler from Michigan. Bet: Anytime TD Justice Ellison (IND), Over 1.5 passing TDs Kurtis Rourke (IND), single-game parlay +159 (FanDuel) $100,000 Daily Race Sign up now to claim For help with a gambling problem, call or text the NCPG - (1-800-522-4700)  First Bet Safety Net $1000 or Bet $5 & Get $150 Sign up now and get the choice of two incredible offers.

SportsLogos.Net News,"FC Barcelona, Nike Announce New Contract Until 2038",https://news.sportslogos.net/2024/11/10/fc-barcelona-nike-announce-new-contract-until-2038/soccer/,"Sun, 10 Nov 2024 23:35:32 +0000","After reported friction between the two sides earlier this year, Barcelona and Nike announce extension of current deal that could become the most expensive soccer kit deal in the world","After months of will-they-won’t-they speculation, Spanish La Liga giants FC Barcelona and sportswear behemoth Nike have announced a new contract that will last until 2038. FC Barcelona announced the new “multi-year partnership agreement” on their website on Saturday, November 9. The club said the deal “brings a new collaborative strategic partnership model between the two organizations.” This new partnership consolidates Nike as a Main Partner of the Club and Official Technical Partner across all professional and amateur teams, bringing a unique model that strengthens the brands association and fuels the global retail and licensing business growth. Nike has a key strategic role in the Club’s Retail Operations and together with Barça Licensing & Merchandising will join forces in the development of specific plans related to product creation, supply chain and global distribution.   Nike has outfitted Barça since 1998. Since then, Barça’s men’s first team has won four Champions League titles, 12 La Liga titles, seven Copas del Rey, three World Club Cups and three European Super Cups wearing Nike uniforms, while the women’s first team has won nine league titles, three UEFA Women’s Champions League titles and nine Copas de la Reina in that time. The terms of the deal between Barça and Nike were not disclosed in Saturday’s announcement, but ESPN reports “the deal will total significantly more than €100 million ($107m) per year, but that the agreement is incremental and that the total amount is also dependent on certain add-ons.” They also report that Barça president Joan Laporte has previously claimed it would be the biggest deal of its kind in world soccer. According to Mundo Deportivo, Barça will receive €1.7 billion over 14 years, or about €121 million per year. It also includes a signing bonus of €158 million, which will also be spread over the 14 years of the contract. Mundo Deportivo also reports that Barça was allowed to field offers from other companies, and they did receive a proposal from German sportswear brand Puma, which Nike then matched. The previous contract between Nike and Barça was set to expire in 2024. There was some friction between the two sides earlier this year, with Footy Headlines reporting in July that a Spanish court had blocked Barça’s attempted to end their contract early. They also reported that retailers were having a hard time ordering Barcelona products from Nike, and Barça’s 2024-25 third kit celebrating women’s sport was released about three weeks later than similar third kits for other high-profile clubs outfitted by Nike."

This was actually the Patriots’ standard road look from 1993-99 but never made an appearance with the uniforms that are synonymous with their six Super Bowl titles or their current set until last month’s loss to the Jaguars in London.  The Dallas Cowboys will once again celebrate Veterans Day by modifying their standard silver helmets to include a red, white and blue striping pattern down the center during Sunday’s game against the Philadelphia Eagles. This design was originally worn by the Cowboys during the 1976 season as part of American’s bicentennial but has been worn the weekend prior to Veterans Day every season since 2021, with Dallas going 2-1 in those contests.

They’ll also have a matching end zone design on Sunday. Gotta look good for SNF 🔥 pic.twitter.com/LUURYSW6iG"

The Smokies, who play in the Southern League, announced this week that with their return to their once and future hometown, the team will change its geographic designation from Tennessee to Knoxville. With that announcement came an armful of updated logos—though their familiar bear character, originally created by Dan Simon of Studio Simon in 2015, remains largely unchanged. The new suite of logos, design in house, includes a series of type-based marks as well as an alternate mark featuring three stars from the Tennessee state flag. “With the upcoming move to Knoxville, it is imperative to embrace our new home, while maintaining the Smokies brand,” said Boyd Sports President Chris Allen, quoted on MiLB.com. “It is our desire that the new logo honors the city of Knoxville and the rich tradition of Smokies Baseball.” The franchise played in Knoxville from 1921 to 1999 under a handful of names, including the Pioneers (1921–1924), Sox (1972–1979), Blue Jays (1980–1992), and two stints as the Knoxville Smokies (1925–1967 and 1993–1999). After the 1999 season, the team moved 20 miles east to the town of Kodak, where they played from 2000 to 2024 as the Tennessee Smokies. The Smokies will play at a new ballpark, Covenant Health Ballpark, set to open in 2025."

New look from a familiar era. Get your City Edition Jersey 11.14.24 pic.twitter.com/svaZdznsxa The white uniforms feature a slanted “H-Town” wordmark across the chest that is inspired by the uniforms worn by Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler during those championships seasons, particularly the lowercase “t.” The red and blue striping pattern on the collar, shoulders, sides of the jerseys and – most notably – around the shorts mirrors the shape and trimming of the Rockets’ championship banners, which hang in the rafters at Toyota Center. The logo on the side of the shorts matches the center-court logo at The Summit, Houston’s home from 1975-2003. It was where the Rockets clinched their titles with a Game 7 victory over the New York Knicks in 1994 and a sweep of the Orlando Magic in 1995. The logo matches Houston’s primary logo at the time, but also includes a “Summit” wordmark at the bottom. The Summit’s logo – which is reminiscent of the Portland Trail Blazers’ logo – can also be seen in gold on the waistband of the shorts, matching the Nike swoosh on the shoulder and hip. The uniforms are complete with Olajuwon and Drexler’s signatures and a “Believe It! Again!” wordmark, which is a nod to the team’s rally cry during their second title run, above the jock tag. This marks the second straight year the Hall of Famers’ signatures are included in Houston’s City Edition design. The Rockets will wear their new City Edition uniforms 13 times this season, including against the Indiana Pacers on Nov. 20, Blazers on Nov. 23, Minnesota Timberwolves on Dec. 27, Los Angeles Lakers on Jan. 5, Phoenix Suns on Feb. 13, Golden State Warriors on Feb. 13, Milwaukee Bucks on Feb. 25, San Antonio Spurs on Feb. 26, Magic on March 10, Suns on March 12, Philadelphia 76ers on March 17, Denver Nuggets on March 23 and Oklahoma City Thunder on April 4."

The Rangers unveiled the jerseys on their website and social media accounts on Friday, November 8, making this the 19th straight season the team has produced a Remembrance Day jersey. This year’s edition commemorates the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Normandy — better known as D-Day — which took place on June 6, 1944. The base of the jersey is royal blue, with grey, red and white stripes around each sleeve and the waist. The front of the jersey features a shield “based on imagery of soldiers entering the battle on the beaches of Normandy,” according to the Rangers’ website. Above the blue soldier rushing off a landing craft is the inscription “1944-2024”, while three red maple leaves swirl around the soldier. The 1944 Battle of Normandy was one of the pivotal events of the Second World War and the scene of some of Canada’s greatest feats of arms. Canadian sailors, soldiers and airmen played a critical role in the Allied invasion of Normandy, also called Operation Overlord, beginning the bloody campaign to liberate Western Europe from Nazi occupation. Nearly 150,000 Allied troops landed or parachuted into the invasion area on D-Day, including 14,000 Canadians at Juno Beach. The Royal Canadian Navy contributed 124 vessels and 10,000 sailors and the Royal Canadian Air Force contributed 39 squadrons to the operation. Total Allied casualties on D-Day reached more than 10,000, including 1,096 Canadians, of whom 381 were killed in action. By the end of the Battle of Normandy, the Allies had suffered 209,000 casualties, including more than 18,700 Canadians. Over 5,000 Canadian soldiers died. A poppy sits on the left chest of the jersey as a symbol of remembrance honoring armed forces personnel who have died in conflict. The left shoulder has a “D-DAY 80” logo while the Rangers’ primary logo sits on the right shoulder. The jersey was pictured with blue pants, gloves and helmets in photos released with Friday’s announcement. The socks are also blue with the same striping as found on the sleeves. The Rangers will wear their Remembrance Day jerseys tonight (Friday, November 8) when they host the Soo Greyhounds at the Kitchener Memorial Auditorium. It’s their only home game this Remembrance Day weekend, as they visit the Owen Sound Attack on Saturday and the Oshawa Generals on Sunday. Rangers fans can purchase game-worn Remembrance Day jerseys through a silent auction that will run throughout Friday’s game. Five of the jerseys will also be available for auction online through DASH. Proceeds from both auctions will benefit the 78th Fraser Highlanders Fort Conestoga Garrison and the Kitchener-Waterloo Poppy Fund."

The Moose unveiled the jersey on their website and social media channels on Thursday, November 7, and they’ll wear them on the ice for the first time on Saturday, November 23, when they host the Chicago Wolves. The focal point of the jerseys is the team’s classic “Happy Moose” logo, which appears on the front of the jersey recolored in the team’s current color palette. The Moose used a green and purple version of this logo when they were members of the International Hockey League from 1996 to 2001, and then a green and black version from 2001, when they moved to the AHL, until 2005. In 2011, the Winnipeg Jets brought NHL hockey back to the city, meaning the Moose moved to St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador, where they were renamed the St. John’s IceCaps. But in 2015, the team moved back to Winnipeg and the Moose name and logo were revived, but the logo was recolored to match the Jets’ palette. The base of the 25th season celebration jersey is bright blue, with a navy blue collar and shoulder yoke. Navy blue, silver and white stripes run around each sleeve and the waist. The front of the jersey also includes a “25 SEASONS” patch with a map of Manitoba on the left chest. The Jets’ logo appears on the left shoulder, while an “MM” monogram appears on the right shoulder. “EST. 1996” is printed inside the collar. The numbers on the sleeves and back match those found on the Moose’s regular jerseys, with moose antlers built into the numerals. Along with the jerseys, the Moose also launched a line of 25th season merchandise on their online shop Thursday. This line includes hoodies, sweatshirts, caps, pucks and pins. The Moose will wear the 25th season celebration jerseys four times during the 2024-25 AHL regular season. At each of these games, the first 1,000 fans will receive one of four collector pins featuring either one of the team’s primary logos from past 25 years or the team’s 25th season logo.

The PWHL launched new jersey designs for all six of its clubs on Thursday, November 7, all manufactured by Bauer. The league’s press release from the league focused heavily on the dark jerseys that will be worn for home games, but light away jerseys — either white or off-white — were also included in some teams’ social media posts. After teams played the 2024 season using just their geographic names, the PWHL unveiled team names and logos in early September. The teams retained the primary colours they wore during the PWHL’s inaugural season, though some added additional colours. “Players and fans alike have been waiting for this moment and we couldn’t be happier with the six unique looks each team will don moving forward,” said Amy Scheer, PWHL Senior Vice President of Business Operations, on the league’s website. “These jerseys mark the latest evolution in our league’s history, and we can’t wait to see them showcased both on the ice and in the stands.”  Each team will have contrasting shoulder yokes, with the PWHL logo on the right shoulder and space for advertising patches on the left shoulder and right chest. Each team also has an insert at the front of the collar with the PWHL logo inside. Teams will all use the same block number font, but each will have small team-specific icons in the numbers. Each jersey incorporates elements that embody the spirit of the team, all while supporting athletes on the ice with advanced materials and construction. Through a series of design sessions, unique elements such as stripe size, number style, and the crest were meticulously developed to enhance their identities. Crafted from breathable and durable fabrics, these jerseys are engineered to withstand intense physical play and offer a tailored fit for maximum mobility, comfort, and aesthetic appeal. The PWHL worked closely with Creative Agency Flower Shop in creating the jersey designs as part of the overall team brand identity work.  The jersey design process was led by PWHL Vice President of Brand and Marketing Kanan Bhatt-Shah and done in collaboration with New York-based creative agency Flower Shop, which also worked on the team names and logos. Here’s a closer look at the new jerseys and what the league had to say about them in Thursday’s announcement: Anchored by the team’s signature “B” across the chest, the Fleet’s home jersey features a deep green base, complemented by oceanic blue accents on the shoulders, sleeve stripes, and waist. The classic hockey design incorporates alternating bands of color, forming a wave-like pattern that evokes a strong connection to the sea. The numbers on Boston’s jersey carry a unique wave motif inspired by the crest, further reinforcing its maritime heritage.  The Frost’s home jersey embraces the chill with a deep purple base that channels the spirit of Minnesota winters. White accents on the shoulders, arms, and waist add a crisp, icy contrast, capturing the sharpness of the frozen landscape. Light purple details introduce a modern touch, blending seamlessly to create a layered, frosted look that embodies both the intensity and elegance of the Frost on the ice. The jersey numbers feature a motif inspired by the shape of the team’s crest, bringing a distinct edge to the design.  Anchored by the burgundy base, the Victoire’s home jersey reflects Montréal’s timeless elegance and strength. The navy shoulders and dynamic sleeve design draw inspiration from the angular lines of the team’s crest, adding a sense of movement and precision. A bright blue stripe accents the overall design, providing a vivid contrast while maintaining a classic style that honors the heritage of both the city and team. The jersey numbers are adorned with a Fleur-de-lys motif, reinforcing Montréal’s cultural pride.  Inspired by the hexagonal shape of their team crest, the Sirens’ home jersey captures the spirit of New York’s multifaceted energy. Angular sleeve stripes, echoing the crest’s geometric form, combine the city’s signature navy, orange, and grey hues, creating a striking, modern motif. The lower waist reflects the same hexagonal pattern, grounding the design in New York’s intense and dynamic identity. The numbers on New York’s jersey feature linework inspired by sound vibrations, echoing the city’s constant hum and buzz.  The Charge’s home jersey energizes the ice with its vibrant red base, embodying Ottawa’s unyielding drive. Dark and light grey bands run across the sleeves and waist, adding depth and a sense of momentum, while a bold pop of electric yellow pulses through the design. The overall look captures the energy and intensity that defines the Charge’s fierce presence on the ice. Custom numbers on the jersey incorporate small electrical charges, adding a spark to the back of the jersey.  The Sceptres’ home jersey reflects a modern, confident Toronto, with a rich blue base that captures the city’s leadership and pride. Navy paneling along the sleeves and waist brings depth and contrast, while clean, precise yellow lines and a matching collar add sharp, dynamic details. The striking gold and yellow of the team crest stands out, creating a look with bold presence, embodying the energy and spirit of Toronto fans. Custom numbers nod to the Sceptres’ crest design. Last season, the PWHL ran a pilot project during which Molson Breweries paid to place its logo on the upper back of jerseys, allowing nameplates to be placed under the numbers where they wouldn’t be covered by players’ long hair. Based on the photos released with Thursday’s announcement, it appears this pilot project will not continue in the upcoming season. PWHL home jerseys are available to buy now on the league’s official online shop. They’ll be available through Bauer’s website and key retailers starting on Thursday, November 14. The 2024-25 PWHL regular season begins on Saturday, November 30, when the Boston Fleet visit the Toronto Sceptres at the Coca-Cola Coliseum at 2 p.m. ET. Later that same day is an all-Canadian matchup between the Ottawa Charge and the Victoire de Montréal at Place Bell in Laval, Quebec. The defending champion Minnesota Frost open their season on Sunday, December 1, when they host the New York Sirens at the Xcel Energy Center."
SportsLogos.Net News,Australian Football League’s Adelaide Crows Flying High With Launch of New Logo,https://news.sportslogos.net/2024/11/06/australian-football-leagues-adelaide-crows-flying-high-with-launch-of-new-logo/other/,"Wed, 06 Nov 2024 20:50:49 +0000","New logo depicts full body of swooping crow — in stark contrast to previous version, which only depicted crow's head — with red and gold streaks in wings","The Adelaide Crows of the Australian Football League are flying high with the unveiling of their new logo this week, which is part of a club-wide rebranding effort. The Crows launched the new logo on their website and social media channels on Wednesday, November 6. It depicts the full body of a navy blue swooping crow — a throwback to previous logos in the club’s history and a stark contrast to the most recent iteration of their logo, which only depicted a crow’s head — with a gold outline, red and gold streaks in the wings and a red eye. The angles of the logo are sharper than the previous version, and the color scheme returns to the club’s “original bolder colors,” including a darker shade of navy blue, a “richer” red and a “deeper” gold. The logo is a celebration of the Club being born from the state’s thriving football landscape in 1990, with the wing of the Crow emanating from the actual shape of South Australia. In a further change, the word ‘Adelaide’ now solely sits below the crow and reinforces the connection between the Club, the city and state.  The new Crows logo was developed in partnership with Fuller Brand Communication, a creative agency based in South Australia. The process involved “widespread consultation with members, supporters and focus groups, such as the Member Engagement Panel.” The Crows’ logo was last revamped in 2010. Their first crest upon joining the AFL in 1991 featured a crow with swooping red, yellow and blue lines behind it inside a white shield with a red outline; “ADELAIDE” and “CROWS” were written out above the crow in yellow on a navy background. In 1996, the writing was changed to emphasize the city name. Then, from 1999-2009, the club ditched the shield and used the crow with the swooping lines behind on its own, with the team name in navy underneath. “The logo is one of the Club’s most recognisable features and our supporters take great pride in it, and the throwback to the original swooping Crow reinforces our connection to this city and state by the way it now incorporates the actual shape of South Australia,” said Crows CEO Tim Silvers on the team’s website. “We also wanted to make sure we celebrated our heritage but with a modern look and feel, which we think will resonate with our next generation of supporters. We’ve consulted and listened to a wide range of stakeholders, including and most importantly sections of our supporter base, over the past 18 months.  “Now is the perfect time to make this change as our new headquarters at Thebarton Oval is moving closer and closer to reality, so it really is the start of a new era.”  New guernseys were not unveiled as part of Wednesday’s announcement. But merchandise with the new logo is already available on the Crows’ official website and at the team shop in the Adelaide suburb of West Lakes. The Crows are the first of three teams who were reported to be unveiling new logos this offseason to do so. The other two teams named in an article on the AFL website in August are St. Kilda Football Club and Gold Coast Suns."

Napoli unveiled the new kits on Saturday, November 2, and wore them the following day in a match at home against Atalanta. The predominantly dark grey kit is inspired by Japanese culture and the twinning of Naples and Kagoshima, Japan, which have been sister cities since 1960. The tonal pattern on the kit is a mixture of Japanese and Italian artistic styles. It includes several Samurai objects — including the kabuto (helmet), the menpo (mask) and the katana sword — while melding a Japanese wave motif with a Neopolitan baroque style. Down the right side of the shirt are Japanese characters representing the seven Bushido virtues that are the principles of the Samurai: righteousness, respect, courage, honor, compassion, honesty and loyalty. Despite being so far away from each other, the twinning of the two ports is a symbol of their affinity and the unique characteristics that they share, from the gulfs to the volcanos that dominate the landscape: Vesuvius in Naples and Sakurajima in Kagoshima. The friendship between the two cities has led both of them to dedicate street names to each other: “Napoli-dori” (Naples street) in Kagoshima and “Via Kagoshima” in Naples. The collar, side panels and sleeve cuffs feature black trim, while the Napoli crest and sponsor logos on the chest are light blue. The kit was designed in collaboration with the Ten Shin – Cuore di Cielo Puro Soto Zen Temple in Naples and the Samurai Academy Naples. “The third kit perfectly places itself at the heart of our project ‘From Napoli to the World,’” said Tommaso Bianchini, the club’s chief revenue officer. “Starting in Naples, we arrive at the Japanese city of Kagoshima to tell the story of the relationship between these two distant cultures that are linked by a warrior’s spirit. With this shirt, we celebrate strength, respect and loyalty, which are values that we proudly bring onto the pitch.” Napoli’s next Serie A match is on Sunday, November 10, when they travel to the San Siro to face defending champions Inter Milan."

The wordmark and number font on the off-white uniforms matches the signage seen around the United Center, including gate and seat numbers, while the overall color scheme was based on the exterior of the building, with shades of brown, gray and white.  Details steeped in history.@MotorolaUS | https://t.co/PqhESWUXtq pic.twitter.com/ZyZc75upU7 The design across the shoulders and down the sides of the shorts are supposed to mimic in-arena lights during the Bulls’ starting lineup introductions, while the logo on the waistband pulls inspiration from the windows near the top of the United Center’s walls. The uniforms are complete with the Bulls’ iconic diamond-shaped shorts design and a uniquely shaped logo above the jock tag on the jersey, which pays homage to the original marquee that stood outside of the arena and read “Home of The Bulls.” Chicago will wear its new City Edition uniforms eight times this season, including games against the Memphis Grizzlies on Nov. 23, Boston Celtics n Dec. 21, Milwaukee Bucks on Dec. 28, New York Knicks on Jan. 4, Philadelphia 76ers on Jan. 25, Golden State Warriors on Feb. 8, Phoenix Suns on Feb. 22 and Dallas Mavericks on March 29. The Bulls’ 2023-24 City Edition uniforms, meanwhile, were inspired by the old Chicago Stadium, which stood on the Near West Side for nearly 60 years before it was replaced by the United Center in 1994 and was affectionally referred to as the “Madhouse on Madison.”"

The club officially announced today that they are now known simply as Athletics. The new location-less name will stick for as long as the team plays in Sacramento, which looks like it will be for the next three seasons before they move to Las Vegas, where *I assume* they’ll be known as the Las Vegas Athletics. Once they take the field, this will be the first time in North America’s “Big Four” major sports leagues that a team has officially played a game without a location name in 80 years. The closest we saw to this in recent times was when the Anaheim Angels became the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and spent the next decade referring to themselves only as the Angels in just about everything aside from their preferred abbreviation, “LAA.” There’s really no obvious reason for the Athletics to go this route. The team already owns the trademarks for both Sacramento Athletics and Sacramento A’s. They could’ve proceeded just as the Angels did previously and reserved the use of Sacramento for standings and scoreboards while sticking to “Athletics” on their uniforms and all official releases. Along with the official name change came the official primary logo the Athletics will use while playing in Sacramento. There’s no surprise here; they’ll use just the “A’s” portion of Oakland’s logo, removing the green circle and the team name. Club officials had previously revealed the team’s uniforms would remain largely the same when they shifted to Sacramento, with all the “Oakland” logos replaced with “Athletics.” This would mean changes only to their road greys and Kelly green alternate jerseys. According to a post from @EvanDrellich on Twitter, the Athletics request the following: The club should be referred to only as “Athletics,” with the shorthand “A’s” allowed only after they’ve already been called Athletics. The team abbreviation will now be “ATH,” so you’ll see this on the TV scoreboards instead of “OAK” going forward. The A’s also do *not* play in Sacramento (my bad); they play in *West* Sacramento (maybe this is why they didn’t go with Sacramento Athletics?). They also mentioned the change, as I discussed earlier, to their primary logo. The name change has already been reflected in the club’s online presence. The team is now listed second alphabetically between Arizona and Atlanta, appearing only as “Athletics” on MLB.com’s team selection list as well as their online shop at MLBShop.com. The team’s official Twitter and Instagram accounts also have removed all references to Oakland."

The Women’s Pro Baseball League (WPBL) announced last week that they are aiming to throw out their first pitch in less than two years’ time. The league is co-founded by Justine Siegal, also the founder of Baseball for All and the first woman to coach a professional men’s baseball team and to pitch batting practice against a Major League Baseball team. The logo on the league’s website depicts the letters in “WPBL” connected to each other, set in white on a black background. A baseball is depicted to the left of the W, aligned with the bottom of the letters. The league name is spelled to the right. The WPBL is also using a secondary logo as their social media profile picture. This logo consists of the W from the league logo, along with the baseball. Unlike the website, though, the background on this logo is navy blue. The WPBL will re-write history by creating an elite league that provides the world’s best female players with the platform they deserve and serve as a catalyst for the creation of a women’s baseball culture in America. “I am so excited that there will finally be a professional women’s baseball league – it is a dream come true for all the girls and women who play America’s Pastime,” Siegal said in a press release. “The Women’s Pro Baseball League is here for all the girls and women who dream of a place to showcase their talents and play the game they love. We have been waiting over 70 years for a professional baseball league we can call our own. Our time is now.” The WPBL’s other co-founder is Keith Stein, a Toronto-based lawyer and businessman who also serves as CEO of the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Intercounty Baseball League. IBL players are college players and former professionals, and all nine teams are based in Southern Ontario. “We believe that the success of other women’s professional leagues such as the WNBA and NWSL demonstrates the incredible interest and support for women’s sport,” Stein said. Legendary Japanese pitcher Ayami Sato has joined the league as a special advisor, as has former Toronto Blue Jays manager Cito Gaston. The WPBL said in its press release that it will launch in summer 2026 with six teams based largely in the northeastern United States. Team names and logos were not included in last week’s announcement. The league also hopes to have a national broadcasting deal in place by the time the first pitch is thrown. More details about the league — including information for prospective team owners and players — is available on the WPBL website.  No related stories."

The uniforms feature a navy blue helmet with an underlined and italicized “Giants” wordmark on both sides, a royal blue jersey with a classic striping pattern on the collar and cuffs and white pants with red and blue stripes.  New York is 3-0-1 in the throwback uniforms since they debuted two years ago, including victories over the Chicago Bears in 2022 and the Commanders and Green Bay Packers in 2023. They also tied with Washington in 2022. TURN US UP.

Philadelphia went 2-0 in the throwback uniforms after unveiling them prior to last season, including wins over the Miami Dolphins and Buffalo Bills. They’ll also be worn later this season against the Dallas Cowboys on Dec. 29.  A classic look for a classic matchup#DETvsGB pic.twitter.com/NdhHY37ayw Keeping with the theme, the Green Bay Packers will wear their 1950s throwback uniforms during Sunday’s game against the Detroit Lions, marking their first appearance against an NFC North divisional opponent. The uniforms are reminiscent of what the Packers wore from 1950-53, with green jerseys featuring gold numbers and two gold stripes on the sleeves, green pants with a single gold stripe down the sides and green socks with stripes that match the sleeves.  The Packers are 2-1 in the throwback threads since they were unveiled, including wins over the Washington Football Team in 2021 and Los Angeles Chargers last season. Their lone loss came at the hands of the New York Jets in 2022.

The Quebec Maritime Junior Hockey League team based in the provincial capital held a special “Les Boys” night on Friday, November 1, paying tribute to the 1997 comedy film that remains one of the most successful Quebecois movies ever. The Remparts’ jerseys for the game against the Sherbrooke Phoenix closely mirrored those worn by Les Boys, the team at the heart of the movie. The base of the jersey was yellow, with red shoulders and red, black and white stripes on the sleeves and waist. The front of the jersey featured a black puck with red streaks behind it and “Les REMPS” written overtop, taking cues from the logo used on the movie’s poster. Nos joueurs ADORENT le chandail des Remps…et on les comprend!Billets de c̷i̷n̷é̷m̷a̷ hockey » https://t.co/801IAPzOYP pic.twitter.com/1DaKuyCNEF The Remparts’ usual primary logo appeared on both shoulders. The names and numbers were red with yellow and black outlines. “LES REMPARTS DE QUÉBEC” was spelled out in black between the waist stripes to mimic where the name of the team’s sponsor appeared in the movie. The jerseys were paired with black helmets, pants and gloves. The socks were yellow with the same black, red and white striping pattern found on the sleeves. “Les Boys” was released in 1997 and directed by Louis Saïa. It follows a low-level amateur hockey team made up of a ragtag group of players, including a mechanic, a police officer, a doctor and a lawyer. In order to settle a gambling debt, the owner of the pub that sponsors the team puts up against a team assembled by a local crime boss. If Les Boys win, the debt is erased; if the mobster’s team wins, though, he gets the pub. “Les Boys” earned $3.3 million at the box office in Quebec, which, given the small market size, was considered a big success. It earned a total of $6 million at the box office across Canada and another $4 million in the United States. It also spawned three sequels — one of which featured appearances by several French-Canadian members of the Canadian Olympic women’s hockey team — one prequel and a television show that lasted five seasons."

The Final Generation O Combo: Warp Speed.#GoDucks pic.twitter.com/CZZLb9vY8E The “Warp Speed” set is effectively the road version of the Ducks’ all-black “Fly Era” uniforms, which combine various elements from their previous uniform designs and debuted in their 32-31 win over Ohio State on Oct. 12.  That includes the wing pattern with a carbon fiber infill on the shoulders of the white jerseys, the diamond plate pattern that fits into the V-shaped seam of Nike’s Vapor F.U.S.E. template and the iridescent numbers, along other smaller details. The diamond plate pattern, specifically, was pulled from Oregon’s 2005-08 uniforms, and the decision to debut them in Ann Arbor isn’t a coincidence, either, as the Ducks notably beat the Wolverines, 39-7, in 2007. While our sources previously indicated the Ducks would wear dark green helmets on Saturday, just like they did in 2007, we’ve been told their equipment staff decided to switch up some combinations based on our reporting. Blinding speed. The story behind the threads.#GoDucks pic.twitter.com/tgecpLlqcO That’s why Oregon’s new “Warp Speed” uniforms are now complete with silver chrome helmets that feature silver wings and a green “O” on the back, creating a combination that was most recently worn in last season’s 38-30 win at Texas Tech. Interestingly, this won’t be the first time the Ducks wear the white pants from their “Warp Speed” set this season, as they also appeared in their 37-34 win over Boise State on Sept. 7 and 35-0 win at Purdue on Oct. 18. The other iiterations of Oregon’s new “Generation O” uniforms include the aforementioned “Fly Era” set, the “Gang Green” and “Mighty Oregon” throwback-inspired designs and their yellow and black “Heroes” uniforms, which are dedicated to those who have battled cancer."

This stat is according to Fanatics, who confirmed this was the highest initial sales figure across all sports throughout the online sports merch giant’s history. Within the first twelve hours of the victory, Dodgers merchandise sales were also 20% higher than during the same timeframe after their win four years ago back during the pandemic in 2020. Why is this? Well, they certainly got some help from the team’s sudden influx of fans in Japan.
