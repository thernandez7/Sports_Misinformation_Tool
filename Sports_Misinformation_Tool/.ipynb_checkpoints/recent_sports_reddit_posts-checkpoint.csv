Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

KC | BYE | SF upcoming for Bills - James Cook peak-sell moment?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gou24b/kc_bye_sf_upcoming_for_bills_james_cook_peaksell/,1gou24b,Stevenwithph,"Given the brutal schedule that the Bills have coming up, especially against RBs: is this **the moment to sell high on Cook?**

*What do we know today?*

* 4.5 Y/A, which is .4 lower than last year and 1.2 lower than two years ago.
* Success rate of his attempts is increasing over the years from 50 to 55%.
* Bills played some really suspect Run Defenses (Seattle | Jets | Jacksonville) and only faced off 1 **really** good one (Ravens)
* The upcoming schedule of Kansas City | BYE | 49'ers does **not spark trust**.

The Playoff schedule for Bills looks pretty hot-and-cold, but there is one callout that I am truly afraid of: the Bills are locking their Division really early this year: really really early. If the Chiefs come away with the win against the Bills in Week 11 there is no chance Bills get the top seed for a bye, but will lock in the Playoff. To me that screams 'resting' players, which will give Ray Davis infinite value throughout Playoffs, but severely diminishes the odds that Cook will see the field a lot.

Would you consider this to be the peak-time to let go of Cook?",2024-11-11 14:56:52,15,fantasyfootball

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful

I Built a Hands-Free Auction Draft Calculator That Quantifies Opportunity Cost Using VORP,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gohz9s/i_built_a_handsfree_auction_draft_calculator_that/,1gohz9s,CommissionerLee,"Hey fellow fantasy football enthusiasts,

I wanted to share a project I've been working on the past couple months. As someone who's spent countless hours navigating the intricacies of **auction drafts**, I realized there had to be a better way to manage player valuations and budget strategy in real-time. So, I decided to build my own auction draft calculator that not only incorporates Value Over Replacement Player (VORP) but also quantifies the opportunity cost of drafting any player at a given price.

[LetMeBet.com - Auction Draft Calculator](https://preview.redd.it/6b7egbmwp60e1.png?width=2422&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e05a7598007f4762d96a76136448f4a7300803b)

# Why I Built This Tool

The open bidding format of auction drafts offers flexibility but also requires quick decision-making and constant recalculations of player values. I found myself wanting a tool that could adapt to the dynamic nature of the draft without requiring me to input data manually every few seconds.

That's why I started developing this hands-free, FULLY AUTOMATED auction draft calculator. My goal was to create something that could integrate with your league's specific settings and provide real-time insights, allowing you to focus on drafting your guy rather than getting bogged down in numbers.

# How It Works

One of the biggest hurdles in existing draft tools is the manual data entry‚Äîthey often require you to input player bids, track drafted players, and adjust for your league's unique settings. I wanted to eliminate that hassle. With this tool all you need to do is enter your **Sleeper username** (for now... hoping to expand in the future to other platforms). The tool then automatically:

* **Detects Your League Settings:** It identifies the number of teams, roster configurations (like how many QB, RB, FLEX slots you have), and any custom scoring rules.
* **Calculates Projected Points:** It pulls in projected stats for every player and calculates their projected points based on your league's scoring settings.
* **Tracks Draft Progress:** It keeps an eye on which players have been drafted, who is currently nominated, and what the current bid price is‚Äîall in real-time.
* **Manages Budgets:** It calculates your remaining budget and max bid, as well as the remaining league-wide discretionary budget and the current price per fantasy point.

# VORP and Quantifying Opportunity Cost

Incorporating VORP was crucial because it provides a more accurate valuation of a player by comparing them to a replacement-level player at the same position (I'm sure many of you are already familiar w VORP). This helps you understand not just how good a player is, but how much better they are than what's readily available.

But I wanted to take it a step further. The calculator quantifies the opportunity cost of drafting a nominated player at the current bid price by simulating two scenarios:

1. **Drafting the Nominated Player:** It calculates the optimal team you could build, including the nominated player at their current bid price.
2. **Passing on the Nominated Player:** It calculates the optimal team you could assemble by allocating your budget elsewhere.

By comparing these two scenarios, you can see the potential impact on your team's total projected points, helping you make an informed decision about whether to bid on a player or let them go.

# Behind the Scenes

I thought it might be interesting to share some of the technical challenges and solutions that went into making the tool both powerful and efficient.

* **Dynamic Calculations:** Auction drafts are fluid. Every time a player is drafted, it changes the landscape. The calculator continuously updates the total discretionary budget and recalculates the price per fantasy point after each pick or bid, ensuring that player valuations are always current.
* **Efficient Algorithms:** To determine the optimal team compositions, the calculator analyzes various permutations of roster construction. Given the vast number of possible combinations, I optimized the algorithm to focus on the most relevant permutations. For example, it assumes bench players are $1 picks and focuses on starting lineup positions to reduce computational load.
* **Greedy Approach with Flexibility:** The tool uses a greedy algorithm to select the highest-projected players that fit within your budget and roster needs. However, it also explores different positional picks to see how altering the order of positions drafted could affect your team's overall potential.

# Ease of Use

One of my main objectives was to make the tool as user-friendly as possible. I know how overwhelming it can be to juggle multiple spreadsheets or tabs during a live draft. Here's what sets this calculator apart:

* **No Manual Data Entry:** Forget about typing in current bid prices or updating drafted players. The tool does it all for you.
* **Tailored to Your League:** It automatically adjusts to your league's specific settings, so the valuations and recommendations are as accurate as possible.
* **Real-Time Insights:** Since it updates continuously, you get the most current information to make split-second decisions during the draft.
* **Focus on Strategy:** With the numbers handled, you can concentrate on what you are already naturally doing: drafting.

# Putting It All Together

Let's say you're considering bidding on a top-tier running back like Christian McCaffrey. The calculator will:

* **Assess His VORP:** Calculate his value over the next best available replacement-level player.
* **Analyze Opportunity Cost:** Show you the optimal team you could build with McCaffrey at his current bid price versus the team you could assemble without him.
* **Provide Real-Time Recommendations:** Help you decide if he's worth the investment or if your budget could be better spent elsewhere.

# Your Feedback Matters

I'm excited about the potential of this tool, but I also know there's always room for improvement. If you decide to give it a try, I'd greatly appreciate any feedback‚Äîpositive or constructive. Any additional features you'd like to see, any bugs you encounter, or general thoughts on its usability, I'm all ears. My hope is that it not only makes auction drafts less stressful but also gives you a competitive edge.

What Makes DST the Worst Thing About FF - And How to Fix it,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gob8aq/what_makes_dst_the_worst_thing_about_ff_and_how/,1gob8aq,TheLameSauce,"TLDR: DST scoring should be based on the amount of time a DST keeps points off the board, rather than an arbitrary inverse of total points/yards allowed for the full game that standard scoring currently reflects 



No matter how your league chooses to score DST - unless you‚Äôve just straight up removed it - there‚Äôs a very good chance it regularly pisses you off for one reason or another.

1. Most DST scoring changes that happen during a game are *negative*.

If there‚Äôs one thing that the managers in the league I commission have complained about the most, it‚Äôs when league scoring results in a player‚Äôs score going down. People just don‚Äôt like the experience of their fantasy team‚Äôs numbers going down. It‚Äôs not something that happens in the game of football (aside from officiating mistakes), and it not only leads to more ‚Äúfeel-bad‚Äù situations in a game that‚Äôs already rife with them, but encourages managers in certain circumstances to go so far as to bench a player/DST if they otherwise already have a matchup locked in.

2. High variance in scoring.

Unlike Kicker scoring which benefited from the introduction of fractional scoring for Kickers a few years ago, DST does not have a way to fractionalize this kind of scoring - the vast majority of score changes will always be in increments of 3 and 7, so a significant jump for DST scoring from one threshold to another is basically inevitable.

3. Garbage time ruins *everything*.

In the actual game of football, a team could be playing absolutely lights out on defense for 3 quarters, completely shutting out their opponent, but you‚Äôll get fucked playing them in Fantasy because in that last quarter they gave up 3 TDs that had no impact on the outcome of a game that was already over.

# But what if it didn‚Äôt have to be this way?

What if fantasy apps could leverage the data that‚Äôs already available to get rid of all of these problems?

I propose DST scoring based on **Time to Score** \- the more gametime that passes before an opponent puts up X real points, the more points the DST scores.

This scoring has massive benefits over current scoring:

1. It will always provide a positive score.

You can‚Äôt allow an opponent to score in negative time (*yet‚Ä¶?*), so this will always result in a positive score for your DST, even if they allow a TD on the first play of the game.

2. The resulting score always scales incrementally.

No more 7-point swing when the DST allows an arbitrary point and yardage threshold in a single play.

3. There is a built in ‚Äúcap‚Äù to the score.

This prevents DST from absolutely destroying someone in their fantasy matchup - no one enjoys having their matchup decided for the week because their opponent‚Äôs DST put up 30+.

4. You can scale the scoring exponentially to reward/‚Äùpunish‚Äù Defensive outliers.

If this scoring was implemented, there would be nothing stopping that app from doing multiple thresholds. For example, you could simultaneously give a DST 0.1 point per minute that the opponent hasn‚Äôt scored any points, another 0.1 ppm the opponent hasn‚Äôt scored 7-13, and another 0.1 ppm the opponent hasn‚Äôt scored 14+.

Let‚Äôs use the proposed scale above and go through some high/low examples:

Say a team holds their opponent scoreless until the last 7 minutes of the game, but then their opponent rallies while they‚Äôre running soft, prevent defense allowing a TD, then another 3 minutes later, and a final TD with a minute left of the game. The resulting score from this would be **17.8** (5.3 + 5.6 + 5.9) - a fantastic score for a DST and perfectly reflective of the amazing effort you would expect it would take to keep an NFL offense from scoring for 53 minutes.

How about a more typical game - the opponent scores their first TD about 10 minutes in, another near the beginning of the second half, and a final TD with about 5 minutes left of the game. That would result in a score of **9.6** (1 + 3.1 + 5.5), or a slightly above average DST score compared to current scoring.

Let‚Äôs take a real-life example of a terrible DST performance using standard scoring, the Carolina Panthers DST against Chicago in week 5. 5:44 left in the 1st, TD. 10:44 left in the 2nd, TD. 2:14 left in the 2nd, a 3rd TD. Discounting the several other scores CHI got against them, this would result in a score of about **5.6** ( 0.9 + 1.9 + 2.8). Not terrible, but significantly worse than the previous two scores.

Maybe instead of inputting how many points a minute is worth, the settings could let you pick how many points it‚Äôs worth for a team to go all 60 minutes without allowing that many points, and then it does the fractional scoring based on how much of those 60 minutes the DST prevented that score. If it was say, 9 points for allowing less than 7, +6 points for allowing 7-13, +3 points for allowing 14-20, then the scores above adjust to

**16.45** (7.95 + 5.6 + 2.9)

**7.35** (1.5 + 3.1 + 2.75)

**4.65** (1.35 + 1.9 + 1.4)

This scale obviously isn‚Äôt perfect, but that‚Äôs not the point - you could get someone actually intelligent to come up with a new standard that sets the scale right, and with the right scale using this method, suddenly DST doesn‚Äôt have all this shitty baggage!

ETA: Dang. I tried being empathetic to what I thought was a common plight for y'all and put genuine effort into offering a possible solution, and I get a bunch of ""get gud"" responses... If y'all are perfectly happy with standard scoring, I'm not trying to yuck in your yum - but tearing me down for proposing a change feels a little disproportionate.",2024-11-10 21:19:15,53,fantasyfootball

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here.

FGB's Week 10 Flex Projections - Sunday Update,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1go0eho/fgbs_week_10_flex_projections_sunday_update/,1go0eho,FantasyGoldenBoy,"# Week 10 Flex Projections

**Weather**

NE vs CHI looks to be the only game with real weather issues.  High sustained winds with some big gusts, high aDOT receivers in this game will be impacted the most.  PIT vs WAS could get wet but nothing too impactful.

**Injuries**

Injuries should all be up to date based on current Projected Lineups.  Doubtful is considered Out and Questionable with no flagged phrases is considered in.  I do not have any inside information, inactives/actives are all based on Rotogrinders expected lineups and ESPN injury reports. I will try to update the rankings below when the game time decisions are made but the¬†[website](http://www.fantasygoldenboy.com/)¬†will be quicker to update, as well as having a Range Plot view showing upside/downside, Full PPR/STD rankings, positional rankings and deeper rankings.  Any changes between Thursday and today will most likely be due to Offensive/Defensive injury updates, weather or betting lines changing, I rarely do major changes to the model mid-week. Feel free to ask any questions or leave any criticisms. Thanks for reading and good luck.

A quick breakdown of some of the more important variables that go into the projections.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

---------------------

**PLEASE TRY TO ANSWER SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS BEFORE POSTING YOUR OWN**

* When answering questions, please make sure to **sort by NEW!**

----------------

**WHEN ANSWERING QUESTIONS**

* Do **NOT** reply with only a yes or no. This just removes the other person from the index without them getting information. You are not helping.
* Explain why you came to the conclusion you did
* **Please respond directly to the OP or the Bot will not pick up your comment**

Brandon Aubrey Without Dak,159,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gnqqry/brandon_aubrey_without_dak/,1gnqqry,fearboners,"Aubrey sits at 95pts for the year and that's equal to the WR15 & RB23 in 0.5ppr. That's to say, he's been rather important to a team's roster, at least so far. How do you think Aubrey fares after losing Dak? 

  
Since I started this topic, I would like to believe that he will fare similar, if not better, in terms of opportunities but this is, candidly, a biased take. He can be counted upon from as far out as the 45 yard line (ie. \~60yd kick) especially when they're in a dome. I think Cooper Rush can manage to put him at that range 3 times a game, assuming 7 possessions a game. Anyways, look forward to hearing your thoughts and thanks for entertaining this armchair perspective! hagw",2024-11-10 02:43:45,116,fantasyfootball

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Update: RotoBot Now Has a FREE Sit/Start Analyzer produced by our AI Chatbot. (Plus Major Improvements Based on Your Feedback!),10,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gnlqqm/update_rotobot_now_has_a_free_sitstart_analyzer/,1gnlqqm,Aishik-Lala,"Hey¬†everyone,

First off, huge thanks to everyone who tried out RotoBot AI last week and gave us feedback! The response was incredible, and our team has been working around the clock to implement your suggestions. For those who missed the original post, we built a free AI trade analyzer that explains trades in plain English instead of just giving you numbers.

**What's New (In Just One Week!):**

* **New Sit/Start Analyzer**: Similar to our trade analyzer, but for lineup decisions. Input any number of players, specify how many you can start, and get detailed analysis explaining the best choices with reasoning.
* **Missing Players Fixed**: Many of you pointed out some missing players - we've significantly expanded our player database.
* **Performance Improvements**: Faster response times and more reliable analysis.

(Advanced matchup/coverage stats plus league sync capabilities are coming soon and we can't wait)

The sit/start analyzer works just like our trade tool - just plug in your players, tell it how many you can start, and get a detailed breakdown of who to play and why. 

We also have an **advanced AI chatbot** that can field a variety of questions such as:  
""Do you think Tracy Jr will take the starting role?""  
""Is George Pickens a bad start this week and why?""  
""Who are some WRs I should look to trade for, I have 3 injured WRs""

[Try RotoBot AI here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rotobot-ai/id6502530085). Only on iOS at the moment. Here's our¬†[website](https://rotobot.ai/)..

As always, we'd love your feedback! Our team moves fast and we're constantly improving based on user suggestions. Let us know what you think of the new features and what else you'd like to see.",2024-11-09 22:28:19,43,fantasyfootball

Defensive Back Weight: Does It Matter? A Comprehensive Analysis,5,https://brainyballers.com/defensive-back-weight-does-it-matter-a-comprehensive-analysis/,1gnhq5c,Zachr08,"The ‚ÄúDoes It Matter?‚Äù Series is back! Last week we looked at [DB Height](https://www.reddit.com/r/DynastyFF/s/9zwGMBz58N) to find whether that affects performance. For part 31 of ‚ÄúDoes It Matter?‚Äù we looked at Defensive Back weight.

Next week‚Äôs topic: DB 40 yard dashes

TL;DR: 197 pounds and above is a threshold that occurs at a 15.6% higher frequency in the top 10 versus the bottom 10 since 2003. Also, there is no correlation between DB Weight and success in regards to Fantasy Football production using standard statistical methods.

Ultimate Athlete Blueprints: [our Analytics page](https://brainyballers.com/does-it-matter-advanced-analytics-for-fantasy-football-stats/).

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Jamaal is doubtful having aggravated his groin injury (some reports claiming he has already been ruled out). Olave is most definitely out week 10. And now Cedrick Wilson has been ruled out.

Saints WRs are Mason Tipton, MVS and Jermaine Jackson. Honestly it will be more like Kamara WR1 and Taysom WR2.

Taysom will also be QB2, RB2 and TE1. Juwan Johnson is healthy but he‚Äôs no threat. The Saints offense will literally be Carr, Kamara and Hill. He‚Äôs going to see a lot of snaps and touches.

And he has historically performed really well against Atlanta. Back in week 4 he had 2 rushing TDs and 14.4 points before exiting due to injury having only played 20% of the snaps.

A lot of TE rankings I seen have Taysom way too low. Don‚Äôt want to get too hyped but this could easily be a 20+ point Taysom Hill explosion game incoming. It wouldn‚Äôt shock me in the least if Taysom ends up being the highest scoring TE on the week.

I could see him throwing, catching and rushing in a TD. Or 2 rushing TDs and 60+ receiving yards. That kind of upside is there for Hill in week 10.",2024-11-09 11:39:00,309,fantasyfootball
Mark Cavendish confirms that he really is retiring this year,130,https://escapecollective.com/mark-cavendish-confirms-that-he-really-is-retiring-this-year/,1gn7zmj,Typical-Plantain256,,2024-11-09 11:20:07,8,sports
Could Trey Lance be Utilized as a Taysom Hill Type?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gn56rk/could_trey_lance_be_utilized_as_a_taysom_hill_type/,1gn56rk,Safe_Cold800,"Seems like he could make a great gadget player if used right. He was actually originally recruited in college as a WR but held out for a school that would play him at QB (though he did ball out in college).
At 6‚Äô4‚Äù 226lbs and with solid speed (ignore his 40 time as he never actually ran - he was clocked at 21+ mph in a game), he could definitely be an asset in that gadget role.

"With the current uptick of great TE performances in an otherwise underwhelming season for TEs, who are your top 3 TEs ROS?",161,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gn2ome/with_the_current_uptick_of_great_te_performances/,1gn2ome,Street-Dare-3402,"After what seemed like a TE wasteland through the first four weeks of the season, we're finally in a position where TEs can explode at any given week. Guys like Cade Otton, David Njoku, Hunter Henry, and even Mike Gesicki have gone out and had amazing performances, with many TEs even salvaging some managers' games.

With that said, Kittle is still TE1 despite missing a game and having a Bye Week (dependent on your scoring system!), and Bowers and Kelce have still been relatively consistent with high end TE production.

I think my top 3 TEs ROS are

1. Kittle
2. Otton
3. Bowers

I could very obviously be way off the mark, but was wondering how people's perception on the TE spot looks like for ROS. 

Will someone else, like Mark Andrews keep getting hot? Will Hock take one of the spots? Will Kmet finally get looks? Will TEs look to have higher trade value moving forward? 

Did you somehow luck out and get two great TEs this season? Plenty stuff to talk about with TEs!

Justin Herbert whirlwind this season. ,88,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gn16yq/justin_herbert_whirlwind_this_season/,1gn16yq,Impressive-Vast-8789,"First 2 seasons we got from Herbert were elite. A Top 5 finish his rookie season followed up by a top 2 finish his sophomore year. We knew we had a top 3 QB in our hands for years to come. 

Next 2 seasons were tough for Herbert, in 2022, he dealt with a nagging broken rib injury that he had suffered in Week 2 vs the Chiefs, it clearly affected his play for the remainder of the season resulting in a QB11 finish. The 2023 season was interesting for Justin Herbert, through the first 4 weeks he had 3 QB1 finishes. He lost Mike Williams, the offense took a hit and his floor regressed resulting 3 finishes outside the top 12 after his BYE week. Justin Herbert then fractured his index finger and missed the remainder of the 2023 season. 

Now fast forward to the 2024 offseason. Fantasy discourse around Herbert was that he now had a run-heavy scheme built around him with the departures of Keenan and Mike Williams and the arrival of Jim Harbaugh and Greg Roman who are known for establishing run-heavy approaches. So now, a guy who was being drafted in consensus as a top 5 QB for the first 3-4 years of his career, is now being drafted outside the top 15‚Ä¶ Was his ADP correct? Well, first 4 weeks defintely showed that. JK Dobbins was a monster unleashed, racking up various RB1 finishes and being a waiver wire darling or late round steal for people. This resulted in 4 QB22 or worse finishes for Herbert, gross‚Ä¶ 

Now coming out of the BYE, things changed, drastically, Chargers are now top 10 in the NFL in neutral pass rate since Week 6, Herbert has 3 games with over 275+ passing yards (had zero before the BYE), 2 Top 12 finishes and 0 turnovers. The situation around him is the best it‚Äôs ever been. Elite offensive line that lets him process the field. Elite defense thet gets him on the field frequently to dictate games. Herbert, in a real life aspect, is playing the best football of his career. 

Now this is where it gets interesting, Herbert actually has.. weapons? Ladd McConkey has been sound for the Chargers as a chain mover after the BYE. Joshua Palmer has shown chemistry with Herbert in the past when Mike Williams or Keenan Allen went down and has a knack for making difficult catches. Dobbins is one of the best pure runners in football averaging 4.9 YPC on 126 attempts. Quentin Johnston believe it or not is actually making catches and scoring TDs. 

The Chargers remaining schedule‚Ä¶ Titans (9th), Bengals (29th), Ravens (32nd), Falcons (27th), Chiefs (14th), Buccaneers (31st), Denver (8th), NE (17th). I see 5 games that will have a 44-46 point total in Vegas Books leading up to the week that puts Herbert in a position to be throwing the ball. 

We‚Äôve always known the talent Justin Herbert possesses, he‚Äôs a top 5 talent in the NFL when things around him are clicking. With the context surrounding Herbert in both offensive situation and a soft remaining schedule. Could he back into QB1 status? ",2024-11-09 03:38:46,67,fantasyfootball

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

---------------------

**PLEASE TRY TO ANSWER SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS BEFORE POSTING YOUR OWN**

* When answering questions, please make sure to **sort by NEW!**

Player Projections Powered by Vegas Player Props - Week 10,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gmw30q/player_projections_powered_by_vegas_player_props/,1gmw30q,MundaneNumber,"Intention and misdirection.¬† Perception subconsciously influencing your decision making.¬† Your heart says to start one player, yet your head is flailing over all the public rankings disagreeing with your decision.¬† Which voice is right?¬†¬†

Voices in your head, the materialization of your brain's response mechanisms to stimuli.¬† Our major five senses (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch) send powerful signals throughout your nervous system, yet our brains interpret them in various ways.¬† I doubt NFL players feel pain the same way we do.¬† Which leads me into wondering, how valid are our interpretations of stimuli?¬† Arguably feelings are fake, a reality your brain conjures into existence.¬† Do you really control how the sodium and potassium¬†ions move¬†in your brain?¬†¬†Imagine a life independent of feelings.¬† 

Reach fantasy prowess through taking advantage of [VegasProjections.com](https://www.VegasProjections.com), the unbiased, statistically driven fantasy tool above all others.¬† We are on a constant improvement arc, with constant feature releases.¬† We have a new major feature, which I detail later in this post.¬† When you inevitably start to question if your heart is lying to you on a roster decision, why not check if the market agrees with you.¬† All figures here are driven by market data, where players have a financial incentive to protect their utility/money.¬† Hence leading to arguably the best predictor of reality you can find.¬†

Top 15\* rated skill players this week include:¬†

1. Alvin Kamara 20.73
2. Ja'Marr Chase 18.03
3. Kyren Williams 17.73
4. Joe Mixon 16.94
5. Bijan Robinson 16.81
6. Puka Nacua 16.69
7. Tyreek Hill 16.67
8. De'Von Achane 16.48
9. Saquon Barkley 16.12
10. Jonathan Taylor 15.98
11. Justin Jefferson 15.89
12. Tyrone Tracy 15.58
13. Jahmyr Gibbs 15.38
14. James Conner 15.32
15. Breece Hall 15.04

\*These figures are using the new mean projection feature, and¬†Christian McCaffrey should probably be somewhere in this list but he's missing his reception o/u prop atm.

This week we see that Jayden has solidified his position as the best quarterback behind Lamar.¬† Let's go Maryland.¬† Never thought I'd live to see the day that the Redskins are good again.¬† Brock Purdy is on waivers in my league, yet highly respected by Vegas.¬† You might want to pick him up.¬† Achane is rightfully exploding up the rankings, with Saquon surprisingly slightly lagging behind.¬† Tyrone Tracy may be that rare midseason acquisition shooting you into championship relevance.¬† Forget about Puka throwing hands, as Vegas has him above Tyreek.¬† And stop doubting James Conner.¬† Kittle still has the highest projection, as Cade has vaulted into red tier status with him and Travis.

We have a major update for this week, namely mean projections extrapolated from the median projections.¬† Using some statistics through assuming a gamma distribution due to fantasy scoring being right-skewed, I have extrapolated two mean projections through shifting each median projection rightward based on a skewness calculation determined using this season's data, or recent data.¬† I also performed an accuracy analysis, to compare my projections to ESPN's projections.¬† Remarkably, for top 10-15 players¬†with high ceilings¬†within a position, my figures outperformed ESPN's figures.¬† In general across all players, the mean projections with all season data performed nearly identically to ESPN's projections, while the mean projections using recent data were less accurate.¬† Granted, I calculated this ""accuracy"" through mean absolute error, but I am experimenting with other techniques as I am concerned that players with lower projections may not have truly right-skewed distributions.¬† Note, recent data entails all data within the past six weeks, with a maximum of four data points and a minimum of three.¬† So players who have played all of the last six weeks are using only their most recent four performances, while players who have been injured for more than half of these six weeks are omitted.¬† Additionally, we have some styling updates to improve the user experience.¬†

Thanks for all the love, GL this week everyone!",2024-11-08 23:18:37,36,fantasyfootball

Week 10 Bold Predictions,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gmnf6o/week_10_bold_predictions/,1gmnf6o,Colin_McT,"The point of these bold predictions is to give managers a few players that *could* put up big numbers and swing your matchup.

I wouldn‚Äôt recommend substituting an obvious stud for these players, but if you‚Äôre looking for some juice with bye weeks or injuries to others, then consider these players in Week 10.

After solid picks in back-to-back weeks in 8 and 9, looking to keep things going in Week 10.

Please note: WR Amari Cooper is listed as questionable for Sunday. This was written before today.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Bypassing the Name Value: Which Players are Under or Over Rated Due to Reputation,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gmlruv/bypassing_the_name_value_which_players_are_under/,1gmlruv,19683dw,"My intent with this post is to discuss our name-based biases and evaluate players that are over and under rated based on expectations related to reputation. (All of my examples will be based on PPR scoring).

Trading deadlines are coming soon, and if you can identify who might be under rated, you might find an asset to pursue. (As a reminder, the best way to trade is figure out what you have that could make another team better, then see if you can build a deal which also makes you better from that position).

* As an example, Baker Mayfield is currently scoring the 2nd most points per game in 4PT passing TDs. His reputation likely places him in the 8-12 QB range for most people, but his performance is vastly exceeding that.

* Tee Higgins is currently 10th overall at WR (borderline WR1) on a per game basis.

* Patrick Mahomes, meanwhile, is averaging an 18th place in PPG, despite frequently starting. CJ Stroud, meanwhile, is 21st.

* Breece Hall is averaging 16th place in PPG, despite getting RB8ish value from many.

* Joe Mixon, meanwhile, is averaging 3rd best PPG performances when active.

My intent here is not to recap waiver wire or buy sell articles. Instead, where are players being underappreciated for their performance? What's notably missing from my examples are players that have picked up their performance recently. An example might be Cedric Tillman, who is getting talked about fairly often, but is also doing incredibly well. Is Tyrone Tracy another example? He's been more of a boom bust since taking the backfield from Singletary.

As we get closer to playoffs, this is the best time to attempt to consolidate talent. You don't need depth as much in the playoffs, not to say it's meaningless, but it's less valuable than high performing starters. At this point in the year, it's a reasonably good idea to overpay if you can increase your expected points in any given game.",2024-11-08 15:55:52,164,fantasyfootball

What is your current record?

Just curious.

Let's chat and analyze!

Edit: Bonus, if you feel like it, who are the players you drafted that are still on your roster???

Extra bonus if you tell us 1) who are some notable players you traded away and/or 2) who are some notable players you acquired via trades/waivers...

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

**PLEASE TRY TO ANSWER SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS BEFORE POSTING YOUR OWN**

* When answering questions, please make sure to **sort by NEW!**

**WHEN ANSWERING QUESTIONS**

* Do **NOT** reply with only a yes or no. This just removes the other person from the index without them getting information. You are not helping.
* Explain why you came to the conclusion you did
* **Please respond directly to the OP or the Bot will not pick up your comment**

8 Players to Buy/Sell/Hold + Injury Report,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gm4ivb/8_players_to_buysellhold_injury_report/,1gm4ivb,movesfantasy,"**Injury Report**

* **WR Tee Higgins** (quad) - doubtful for Thursday night.
* **WR Nico Collins** (hamstring) - eligible to return in Week 10, but is yet to practice. Per the Houston Chronicle‚Äôs Jonathan Alexander, only two Texans players have missed practice on a Thursday and played on a Sunday this season.
* **RB Christian McCaffrey** (achilles) - per Richard Sherman, who spoke to CMC himself: all signs point to CMC playing in Week 10, and probably playing a significant role.
* **QB Trevor Lawrence** (shoulder) - unlikely to play in Week 10, ‚Äúweighing options‚Äù for treatment and could be out a while.
* **WR Drake London** (hip) - limited in practice Thursday, day-to-day.
* **WR AJ Brown** (knee) - full participant in practice Thursday, good sign for Week 10.
* **WR CeeDee Lamb** (shoulder) - Lamb himself says he‚Äôs good to go for Week 10.
* **WR Darius Slayton** (concussion) - unlikely to play in Week 10, per Daboll.
* **WR Keon Coleman** (wrist) - didn‚Äôt practice Thursday, hasn‚Äôt been ruled out for Week 10 yet, but recovery could take ‚Äúmore than just this week‚Äù per Sean McDermott.
* **WR Amari Cooper** (wrist) - limited in Thursday‚Äôs practice, seems to be trending the right way for Week 10.
* **RB Jonathon Brooks** (knee) - activated on Wednesday, full practice participant all week, trending towards a Week 10 debut.
* **WR Chris Olave** (concussion) - per Saints interim head coach Darren Rizzi, Olave and his family want to be thorough with the recovery process given his history of concussions. Likely out multiple weeks.
* **QB Dak Prescott** (hamstring) - partial avulsion of right hamstring, best case recovery timetable is 4-6 weeks per NFL Network‚Äôs Jane Slater.

**Buy RB Aaron Jones**

While doing my research for this post, this was the screaming buy that stood out to me the most - I had to put Jones at the top of this list. Since returning from injury in Week 7, Aaron Jones‚Äô role has been amazing. From Weeks 7-9, Jones has the 3rd-highest snap share among all running backs (76.1%), the 5th-highest route share (58.1%), and the 5th-highest percentage of his team‚Äôs High Value Touches (86%). With this kind of usage, you would think that Jones has performed as a clear-cut RB1 in fantasy. However, over the last three weeks, he‚Äôs been the RB23 overall, with just 14.8 fantasy points per game. And it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs been bad, either - he‚Äôs PFF‚Äôs 6th-highest graded running back on the season. What‚Äôs the problem, then? Touchdowns. Jones has just 1 touchdown in the last three weeks and 3 total on the season. Based on his usage this season, Jones‚Äô expected touchdown total is 6.9 TDs per PFF, 5th-highest among all running backs. Here‚Äôs the kicker - his expected vs. actual touchdown differential of -3.9 TDs is the highest among all running backs on the season, making Jones a massive positive regression candidate and the best buy-low opportunity at the position. If that wasn‚Äôt enough, the Vikings have the 3rd-best schedule for running backs the rest of the season by fantasy points allowed over expectation to the position. Act fast - the Vikings play the Jaguars in Week 10, the 3rd-best matchup for running backs by the same metric. After this week, the secret may be out on Jones, and your buy-low window could be slammed shut. Take a break from reading this post and text/call/e-mail/fax the Jones manager in your league with an offer immediately.

**Sell RB Derrick Henry**

Look, I know. I didn‚Äôt want to write this either. But I think right now, as fantasy‚Äôs overall RB1, is the time to‚Ä¶clears throat‚Ä¶sell Derrick Henry. His value will never be higher than it is right now, and here‚Äôs why. Remember that expected vs. actual TDs metric I mentioned in the Aaron Jones section above? Derrick Henry sits at the top of the list with the most touchdowns over expected among all running backs this season. His expected total of 7.72 TDs is awesome by itself and is the 2nd-highest among all running backs. However, his actual total of 13 touchdowns gives him a differential of 5.28 TDs over expected. Not only is that the highest differential at the running back position, but the next-highest figure is 3.14 touchdowns over expected (James Cook, for those curious). That‚Äôs a whopping 2-touchdown difference between Henry and the next highest TD over-performer. Ok, so we have established that Derrick Henry is due for some regression in the TD category, but he does still have the 2nd-highest expected TD total among all running backs. So, why sell? Well, I think that expected TD figure could drop significantly given the Ravens‚Äô upcoming schedule. The Ravens have the 2nd-worst schedule for running backs the rest of the season by fantasy points allowed over expectation to the position. Additionally, if Henry struggles to get there on the ground, he‚Äôs not going to make up for it in the receiving game - he has just 10 targets on the season. With a primetime matchup on deck against a Bengals defense that is the 10th-worst matchup for fantasy RBs, now is the time to cash in and sell fantasy‚Äôs overall RB1.

**Hold WR DeAndre Hopkins**

In case you were considering cashing in on Hopkins‚Äô 2-TD performance on MNF - don‚Äôt. Hopkins played on 60.2% of snaps in Week 9 and ran a route on 62.0% of dropbacks, up from 32.4% of snaps and a 33.3% route share in his first game as a Chief in Week 8. He was able to earn 9 targets (a 20.5% target share) and finished the week as the overall WR4 in both expected fantasy points and actual fantasy points. Admittedly, Hopkins‚Äô schedule isn‚Äôt great, as the Chiefs‚Äô next four games are all against bottom-7 matchups for wide receivers by fantasy points allowed over expectation. However, their schedule for the fantasy playoffs is nothing to shy away from. To be honest, I‚Äôm just not super concerned about the Chiefs‚Äô ability to produce in bad matchups, and I‚Äôm not remotely worried about Juju Smith-Schuster‚Äôs eventual return to the lineup. Hopkins is the most talented wide receiver on a team quarterbacked by Patrick Mahomes - HOLD!

**Buy RB Breece Hall**

Look, I don‚Äôt need to sell anyone who‚Äôs reading this on Breece Hall‚Äôs talent level. However, it‚Äôs been kind of a weird season for Hall, and you may be able to pry him from a concerned manager. After ceding significant work to Braelon Allen early in the season, Breece Hall has regained his workhorse role since Robert Saleh was fired following the Jets‚Äô Week 5 loss to the Vikings. In the 4 weeks since, Hall has the 4th-highest snap share (79.6%) among all running backs, the 4th-highest target share (15.7%), and the 6th-highest expected fantasy points per game (19.0). However, over the last two weeks, Hall is averaging just 10.2 fantasy points per game (overall RB32), presenting a nice buying opportunity if there is a short-sighted manager in your league looking to sell. The Jets have the best remaining schedule for running backs by fantasy points allowed over expectation, and they get the Cardinals in Week 10, the 2nd-best matchup for running backs by the same metric. Go get Breece now before the price of the brick goes up.

**Sell WR Jayden Reed**

Jayden Reed leads all wide receivers in fantasy points over expectation this season with 47.7, per PFF. While Reed is currently the WR19 in fantasy points per game (14.8), his expected fantasy points per game (9.5) would have him as the WR54! Reed has gotten there with explosive plays, but has earned more than 6 targets in just one game this season. That game was Week 4 vs. the Vikings, where Christian Watson was lost for the game in the first quarter to an ankle injury. Reed saw a season-high 8 targets in that one, good for just a 14.8% target share given Love‚Äôs 54 pass attempts. With the Packers‚Äô WR corps healthy and the emergence of TE Tucker Kraft as a weapon, there are simply too many mouths to feed on this offense. Reed is explosive and will have his share of big plays, but I‚Äôd be looking to sell coming off his Week 9 16.3-fantasy point performance. Wait too long and you may just miss your sell window - the Packers play the Bears in Week 11, the 3rd-worst matchup for wide receivers by fantasy points allowed over expectation.

**Buy WR Malik Nabers**

Excluding the two games he missed with a concussion, Malik Nabers trails only Cooper Kupp and Nico Collins among all wide receivers in expected fantasy points per game this season (19.6). His usage has been awesome, leading all wide receivers in targets (83), target share (34.9%), air yards (883), air yards share (50.6%), and first read percentage (45.6%) in the 7 games he‚Äôs played. Despite such monster usage, Nabers has just two weekly fantasy finishes inside the top 5 at the position and four finishes outside of the top 20, meaning his fantasy managers might not realize what they‚Äôre sitting on. The Giants‚Äô offense is largely to blame, as Daniel Jones is averaging just 208.9 passing yards per game, 22nd among all quarterbacks. The good news, however, is that the Giants have a favorable upcoming schedule for fantasy WRs - the 10th-best rest-of-season schedule and the 7th-best fantasy playoff schedule by fantasy points allowed over expected to the position. Coming off a Week 9 game in which Nabers was targeted just once in the first half (yet still went 9-59), I‚Äôd be eager to buy the single best role at the wide receiver position.

**Sell RB Jahmyr Gibbs**

Despite his current status as the overall RB7 in fantasy points per game with 18.8, Gibbs is just the RB22 in expected fantasy points per game with 13.8. He has massively outperformed his utilization with explosive play after explosive play, resulting in his 2.38 touchdowns over expected this season, the 4th-highest TD overperformance among all running backs. Additionally his usage in the Lions‚Äô split backfield has grown increasingly concerning. Gibbs is averaging 12.75 carries per game but, more concerningly, just 3.13 targets per game. In Week 9, Gibbs recorded season-lows in snap share (36.4%), rush attempt share (34%), and route share (21.7%), yet scored a touchdown to salvage his day with 14.6 fantasy points. Additionally, he hasn‚Äôt topped a 10% target share in either of the last two games. The usage simply isn‚Äôt appealing or reliable, as the Lions love to pound the rock with David Montgomery, and Gibbs‚Äô production is coming on insane efficiency rather than elite usage. Gibbs is an explosive, talented player who will continue to create big plays on a high-scoring offense, but I‚Äôd be looking to sell at the RB7 price tag based on his utilization profile. The Lions get the Texans in Week 11, the 4th-toughest matchup for running backs by fantasy points allowed over expectation. I‚Äôd be looking to move him before the game.

**Buy TE Dalton Kincaid**

Kincaid is the overall TE15 on the year, averaging just 8.6 fantasy points per game. However, his underlying usage tells a much different story. On the season, Kincaid has the 6th-highest target share (19.2%), the 4th-highest air yards share (21.6%), and the 5th-highest targets per route run (0.26) among starting tight ends. For some reason, Kincaid‚Äôs awesome utilization just hasn‚Äôt yet converted to fantasy production. In Week 9, Kincaid led all tight ends in underperformance, scoring just 7.2 fantasy points versus an expected 16.2 points based on his usage. Consequently, a buy-low window has opened at the perfect time. The Bills play the Colts in Week 10, the 3rd-best matchup for tight ends based on fantasy points allowed over expectation. Buy Kincaid‚Äôs strong utilization now before it starts converting to production as early as this week.",2024-11-07 23:33:28,66,fantasyfootball
FGB's Week 10 Flex Projections,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gm3ydk/fgbs_week_10_flex_projections/,1gm3ydk,FantasyGoldenBoy,"# Week 9 Recap

Mean Absolute Error(MAE) is the average absolute gap between my projections and the final score of each player.  Decision Success Rate(DSR) is how often a decision made based on these projections, between any two players, would be correct(.9 point buffer).

**Mean Absolute Error**

* Overall = 4.6
* Flex Range(36-100) = 5.0
* RB = 4.3
* WR = 5.2
* TE = 4.0

**Decision Success Rate**

* Top 175 = 76.93%
* Flex Range = 76.71%

Week 9 was another solid week.  Wide Receivers dragged the overall average down as they were the highest MAE position and had the single largest miss(Jaxon Smith-Njigba - proj. 9.4, actual 33.5, diff. 24.1). It was also Deandre Hopkins that I felt like I got the most questions on and was way off, I obviously did not expect this large of an increase in work so quickly.

# Week 10 Half PPR Projections

Projections focused on predicting touchdowns using high value plays adjusted for match-ups, weather, game script and implied team totals among many other factors.

|Position|High Value Plays for projecting TDs|Weather|Spread|Implied Team Total|Matchup|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Wide Receiver|1st Read Targets inside the 20 and 1st Read Targets with 20+ AY|High Wind effects performance adjusted for each receivers individual aDOT|Adjusts usage for expected blowouts|Adjusts touchdown chance|CB/WR Matchup rating and Coverage Grades from ([www.fantasypoints.com](http://www.fantasypoints.com)) as well as adjusted points allowed to alignment(Wide/Slot).|
|Running Back|Designed Carries inside the 20 and Routes run inside the 20|NA|Adjusts usage for expected blowouts|Adjusts touchdown chance|OL/DL grade, adjusted rec pts allowed to backfield and adjusted neutral game script YPC|
|Tight End|1st Read targets inside the 20|NA|Adjusts usage for expected blowouts|Adjusts touchdown chance|Adjusted pts allowed to Wide/Slot/Inline|

**Weather** : NE vs CHI has some high winds, currently projected as a minor knock to the passing game, especially higher aDOT players.  PIT vs WAS has some scattered showers but nothing major yet, a slight decrease to passing efficiency is projected.

**Injuries** : All injuries are based off of projected lineups and injury reports, many of the Questionables will be projected here until Friday practice reports, any non projected players either have flagged phrases like ""not expected to play"" in their injury report or are not in expected lineups.  I do not have inside information, I go off of Rotogrinders projected lineups and ESPN injury reports.

My [website](http://www.fantasygoldenboy.com) has deeper rankings, positional rankings and Full PPR/Standard as well as a Range Plot view that illustrates upside/downside based on TD% and explosive plays vs explosive plays allowed.   Please feel free to ask any questions/leave criticisms about roster decisions or the projections themselves, good luck!

The Rookie Report: Week 10 Starts & Sits,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gm3lya/the_rookie_report_week_10_starts_sits/,1gm3lya,xylopolist,"Welcome back to the Rookie Report! We‚Äôre now halfway through the NFL season, and that means we‚Äôre entering the closing stretch of the fantasy regular season. In most fantasy leagues, you‚Äôve got 5 weeks left to improve your positioning and make a push for the playoffs. Make sure you know where you stand at this point, and act accordingly going forward. If you‚Äôre on the outside of the playoff picture looking in, maybe explore some trades to improve the roster. If you‚Äôre in good position, keep doing the things that got you here, but don‚Äôt be afraid to look at ways to upgrade your roster as we inch closer to the playoffs. The next 5 weeks should be a lot of fun.

¬†

Week 10 features 4 teams on byes, but lucky for us, Brock Bowers is the only notable rookie that has the week off, so we‚Äôve got plenty to talk about. This week‚Äôs article is being dropped a little earlier than usual due to a pre-planned personal engagement, so keep a close eye on the reporting as the week goes on before locking in any lineup decisions based on the info below. There are a lot of injury updates to monitor and make sure you‚Äôre making final decisions with the most complete information.

¬†

A couple of housekeeping notes for the players listed below ‚Äì All players listed under the same header at the same position are listed in the order that I would play them this week. All usage rates (snap share, target rate, air yardage share, etc.) are from the MB Fantasy Life Utilization Tool from Dwain McFarland, and all references to fantasy points and points allowed rankings are based on half-PPR scoring unless otherwise noted.

¬†

Let‚Äôs dive into week 10‚Ä¶

¬†

**Rookies You Already Know You Should Start:**

**QB Jayden Daniels, WAS (Wk. 10: vs. Pit.):**¬†Daniels faces one of the toughest matchups he‚Äôs faced this season against the Steelers, but Daniels is the QB4 in PPG for the season, and he finished as a QB1 the only other time he faced a top QB defense. If you have another top-10 QB and really don‚Äôt like the matchup here, I wouldn‚Äôt fault you for being worried, but in my opinion, the upside of Daniels is too great to sit, even in a tough spot like this. The Steelers have allowed the 3^(rd)\-fewest QB points per game, and the 2^(nd)\-fewest QB rushing yards per game.

¬†

**WR Malik Nabers, NYG (Wk. 10: @ Car.):**¬†Nabers has now finished as worse than the PPR WR20 in three straight games, but he‚Äôs still finished in the top-36 every single game he‚Äôs played and he‚Äôs still dominating the looks in this offense. Carolina ranks 31^(st)¬†in FTN‚Äôs pass defense DVOA, and Nabers is a virtual lock to see a 30% or higher target share against that defense. I like him to get back on track this week, but even if he doesn‚Äôt, a WR3 floor is a nice starting point.

¬†

**Borderline Rookies I‚Äôd Lean Toward Starting:**

**QB Caleb Williams, CHI (Wk. 10: vs. NE):**¬†I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd want to plug in Caleb as my starting QB in a 12-team league, but I list him in this section to signify that I like him more this week than I do his fellow rookie signal callers Bo Nix and Drake Maye. Caleb has struggled mightily in the passing game the last couple weeks, but I have a feeling a matchup with the Patriots is just what the doctor ordered to get him back on track throwing the ball. New England ranks 30^(th)¬†in pass defense DVOA. They‚Äôve allowed 7 of the last 8 QBs they‚Äôve faced to score 15+ fantasy points, and they‚Äôve allowed 3 of the last 4 to throw for multiple TDs, including 2 scores by Mason Rudolph last weekend. We did see a 4-game stretch of Caleb playing well against bad pass defense prior to the last two down games, and 3 of those strong games were in Chicago, where they‚Äôll be playing this week. I like his chances to get back on track. I‚Äôd view Caleb as a high-end QB2 this week in spite of his recent poor play.

¬†

**RB Tyrone Tracy, NYG (Wk. 10: @ Car.):**¬†In 3 games since Devin Singletary returned from his groin injury, Tracy has averaged 16 touches per game and played at least a 60% snap share in each contest. Against the abysmal Panthers‚Äô defense, that makes him a top-20 RB option this week. The Panthers rank dead last in run defense DVOA and have allowed the most RB points per game.

¬†

**RB Bucky Irving, TB (Wk. 10: vs. SF):**¬†Irving played his lowest snap share since week 3 on Monday night and barely finished inside the top-40 RBs for the week, but it was just his first finish outside the top-20 RBs in the last month. This week‚Äôs matchup with SF looks tough at first glance, but the 49ers rank just 19^(th)¬†in run defense DVOA, and the Bucs‚Äô passing game should continue to heavily feature the running backs due to injuries to WRs. With 4 teams on byes in week 10, that‚Äôs just enough to get Irving to the right side of the cut line for me as a flex option.

¬†

**WR Brian Thomas, Jr., JAX (Wk. 10: vs. Min.):**¬†Thomas is coming off his worst fantasy performance in weeks, finishing with just 2 catches for 22 yards and adding a 2-point conversion. The issue seems to be that he earned just a 10% target share despite being in a route on 97% of the team passing dropbacks. That won‚Äôt be the norm going forward, and I expect him to get some squeaky wheel treatment this week and be peppered with more targets than usual. The Vikings have a good pass defense, but still allow the 2^(nd)\-most WR points per game. BTJ should return to the WR2 ranks this week. This outlook changes if Trevor Lawrence is unable to play this week. Doug Pederson hinted on Wednesday that there‚Äôs a chance that he might sit due to an ‚Äòupper body injury‚Äô. If T-Law sits, Thomas becomes more of a WR4 option with Mac Jones under center. Luckily the Jaguars play at noon Sunday, so most replacement options should be on the table still at that point.

¬†

**WR Keon Coleman, BUF (Wk. 10: @ Ind.):**¬†This is going to sound counter-intuitive, but it seems like Keon Coleman is a better fantasy play if Amari Cooper is active this week, rather than out. Coleman has earned 7+ targets exactly twice this season. He‚Äôs finished as a top-20 PPR WR exactly twice. Those performances happened in the two games that Amari Cooper was on the field for Buffalo. With Cooper out last week, Coleman was targeted just twice and pulled in 1 catch for 21 yards. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs more coincidence than correlation, but I‚Äôm willing to lean into the coincidence this week if Cooper returns as the Colts rank 28^(th)¬†in pass defense DVOA and have allowed the 2^(nd)\-most completions of 40+ yards this season. Coleman will be boom or bust as usual, but I like his chances to bounce back and boom this week against a bad Indy secondary.

¬†

**WR Ladd McConkey, LAC (Wk. 10: vs. Ten.):**¬†McConkey has finished as a PPR WR3 or better in 4 of his last 5 games, and while this week‚Äôs matchup is a tough one ‚Äì the Titans allow the 4^(th)\-fewest WR points per game ‚Äì I still like McConkey‚Äôs chances of compiling his way to another solid PPR performance. In their last 4 games, the Titans have allowed 3 different slot WRs to reach 7 receptions against them (Khalil Shakir, Demario Douglas and Josh Downs). I‚Äôve talked in this space about how good McConkey has been vs. man coverage before, and the Titans‚Äô man coverage rate is in the top-10 in the league.

¬†

**WR Xavier Legette, CAR (Wk. 10: vs. NYG):**¬†With Diontae Johnson out of his way, Legette has served as the Panthers‚Äô WR1 over the last two weeks, and he‚Äôs logged back-to-back top-30 PPR finishes as a result. Bryce Young being back under center hasn‚Äôt been a problem for him, and this week Legette figures to see a lot of Giants‚Äô corner Deonte Banks, who is allowing nearly a half a PPR point per route run into his coverage despite being targeted on just 22% of those coverage routes. The return of Adam Thielen could complicate things for Legette when it comes to target share, but Thielen should have zero impact on Xavier‚Äôs snap share. The opposing WR1 facing the Giants has gone for 70+ yards and/or a TD in 6 of their last 7 games. Legette is an upside WR3 this week, with even bigger upside if Thielen somehow sits again.

¬†

**WR Marvin Harrison, Jr., ARI (Wk. 10: vs. NYJ):**¬†I know, Harrison is getting harder to trust each week that he underperforms, but the biggest issue last week was low passing volume due to a blowout win. Harrison‚Äôs 5 targets still accounted for a 26% target share and a 66% air yardage share, but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that in his last 4 healthy games, Harrison has finished outside the top-45 PPR WRs 3 times. A matchup this week with the Jets, who allow the 2^(nd)\-fewest WR points per game doesn‚Äôt exactly make you feel better about playing him, but at least a couple WR1s have had success against the Jets in recent weeks. Tank Dell posted 6-126 last week, and George Pickens posted 5-111-1 in week 7. There‚Äôs obvious downside here, but few WRs offer the top-12 ceiling that Harrison does. I‚Äôd probably be willing to roll him out there as a WR3/flex option this week despite the tough matchup and recent struggles.

¬†

**Borderline Rookies I‚Äôd Lean Toward Sitting:**

**QB Bo Nix, DEN (Wk. 10: @ KC):**¬†Nix will likely be a passable mid-range QB2 this week, but I wouldn‚Äôt count on a ceiling week against a KC defense that ranks 7^(th)¬†in pass defense DVOA and has allowed just 193 passing yards per game in their last 5 contests. They‚Äôre not completely invulnerable though, as KC has allowed 2 total TDs to each of the last 4 QBs they‚Äôve faced, and hasn‚Äôt held a single QB below 11 points this season. There‚Äôs a floor here, even if not much ceiling. I‚Äôd expect Nix‚Äôs passing volume to be on the higher side with KC favored by 8 points, and he‚Äôll still have his regular rushing upside, but this probably isn‚Äôt a week where he‚Äôll wind up in the top-10 QBs.

¬†

**QB Drake Maye, NE (Wk. 10: @ Chi.):**¬†In the 3 full games Maye has played this season, he‚Äôs scored at least 17.7 fantasy points in each and finished as QB17 or better in all 3 games, but he faces a Chicago defense that allows the fewest QB points per game and has allowed just 2 QBs all season to reach 15+ fantasy points. I would expect Drake to post his worst performance to-date, and would treat him like a lower-end QB2 option.

¬†

**RB Isaac Guerendo, SF (Wk. 10: @ TB):**¬†Guerendo made the most of his opportunities ahead of the 49ers‚Äô bye last week, but all signs point to Christian McCaffrey returning this week, and Jordan Mason will likely be back as well (Kyle Shanahan hinted that he could‚Äôve probably gone back into their week 8 game if Guerendo wasn‚Äôt playing well). If CMC is back as expected, I wouldn‚Äôt give strong consideration to Guerendo, even if Mason is out. If only Mason returns, there‚Äôd be a little more hope that Isaac can peel off enough work to be useful against a Tampa defense that allows the 7^(th)\-most RB points per game, but he‚Äôd still be a dicey option. If both CMC and Mason remain out, then I‚Äôd treat Guerendo as a strong RB2 option in a plus matchup.

¬†

**WR Jalen McMillan, TB (Wk. 10: vs. SF):**¬†McMillan missed last Monday‚Äôs contest with a hamstring injury, and it remains to be seen if he‚Äôll be able to get cleared to play this week against the 49ers. In McMillan‚Äôs absence on Monday, no receiver really took the reins of the WR1 role as 4 different wideouts combined for 13 total targets (Sterling Shepard led the way with 5). If McMillan returns, there‚Äôs a good chance that he‚Äôll step into the WR1 role if Mike Evans remains sidelined. That lead role led to 15 total targets for McMillan in his last 2 games, but he fell short of double-digit PPR points in both games despite facing bottom-10 WR defenses. If McMillan is active, he should have a big enough role for fantasy consideration, but the combination of the injury, the limited production with the full-time role, and the fact the 49ers rank 2^(nd)¬†in pass defense DVOA all adds up to me leaning against playing Jalen this week.

¬†

**WR Xavier Worthy, KC (Wk. 10: vs. Den.):**¬†Now that DeAndre Hopkins is fully integrated into the KC offense, it looks like he could be a problem for Worthy. Xavier was limited to just 2 targets on Monday night on 40 routes run, and he pulled in zero catches and added negative-10 rushing yards to boot. I‚Äôd expect the Chiefs to still look to take deep shots to Worthy to keep defenses on their toes, but his 32% and 24% target shares from weeks 7 & 8 are likely a thing of the past. There‚Äôs still upside here if you need a boom-or-bust WR4, but the Broncos rank 9^(th)¬†in the league on pass defense DVOA on deep throws, so I‚Äôd lean against plugging the rookie into lineups this week.

¬†

**WR Jalen Coker, CAR (Wk. 10: vs. NYG):**¬†Coker‚Äôs role is very much in flux moving forward now that the Panthers have officially not traded away Adam Thielen ahead of the trade deadline. Coker was limited to a 59% route participation rate last weekend while both David Moore and Xavier Legette logged rates above 90%. Some of those lost snaps went to Jonathan Mingo, who is no longer a Panther, but Thielen‚Äôs return will replace Mingo with an even bigger threat to Coker. Both Coker and Thielen have been primarily used in the slot by Carolina, but the hope for Coker is that Thielen will replace David Moore on the perimeter rather than Coker. But even if that happens, the Giants are more vulnerable on the perimeter than in the slot. Pay attention to the reporting here. If Thielen sits another week, Coker is probably a passable WR4 against a New York defense that ranks 24^(th)¬†in pass defense DVOA. If Thielen plays, He‚Äôs probably a risky WR5.

¬†

**WR Mason Tipton, NO (Wk. 10: vs. Atl.):**¬†It doesn‚Äôt seem to matter how many wide receivers are out for the Saints, Tipton just keeps failing to produce. He‚Äôs logged an 85% or higher route participation rate in each of the last 3 games but has just one finish all year higher than the WR60 to show for it. Atlanta does allow the 9^(th)\-most WR points per game, but I‚Äôm not counting on Tipton cashing in on this good matchup. The Saints will likely lean heavily on the run game and Taysom Hill to get by until Chris Olave returns. I‚Äôd view Tipton as a dicey WR4/5 option.

¬†

**TE Ja‚ÄôTavion Sanders, CAR (Wk. 10: vs. NYG):**¬†I mention Sanders here with the caveat that I like him less if Tommy Tremble is active this week, but if Tremble is out as he was last week, Ja‚ÄôTavion has some modest appeal as a fill in TE1 this week. We‚Äôve seen him post lines of 5-49, 6-61, and 4-87 in the last 3 games that Tremble missed, but the matchup this week isn‚Äôt a great one. The Giants have allowed the 3^(rd)\-fewest TE points per game, and only Jake Ferguson and Zach Ertz have posted double-digit PPR points against them. Some of their success has been due to facing mostly weak TE competition, but they haven‚Äôt allowed a tight end touchdown all season long.

¬†

**TE Theo Johnson, NYG (Wk. 10: @ Car.):**¬†Johnson has finally started to produce some fantasy points in the last two weeks, totaling 6-86-1 on 10 targets in the last two contests. A 35-yard TD last Sunday helped him to a PPR TE7 finish for the week. The concern is that most of his production has come during furious efforts by the Giants to come from behind at the end of those games. Of that production listed above, 4-78-1 of it has come in the final 4 minutes of those games with the Giants down at least a touchdown. The Panthers have been the worst defense in the league at limiting TE fantasy points, but I‚Äôm not sure there will be garbage time production in a game the Giants are favored to win by 5 points. I think Theo would be fine to use as a TE2 this week, but would be uncomfortable plugging him in as a fill-in TE1, even in this very good matchup.

¬†

**Rookies You Already Know You Should Sit:**

**RB Trey Benson, ARI (Wk. 10: vs. NYJ):**¬†Benson posted his best fantasy game of the season last week, finishing with 55 yards and a TD on 9 touches. I‚Äôm not convinced it‚Äôs a sign of things to come. He scored his touchdown with James Conner on the sideline after taking a hard hit near the goal line, and most of Benson‚Äôs touches came in the 4^(th)¬†quarter when the game was essentially over. The Cardinals have won 4 of their past 5 games, but 3 of those 4 wins were decided by less than a field goal. Benson totaled just 1 touch in those 3 games. Arizona is favored by just a single point this week. The Jets rank just 24^(th)¬†in run defense DVOA, but you can‚Äôt count on Benson to play enough to take advantage.

¬†

**RB Braelon Allen, NYJ (Wk. 10: @ Ari.):**¬†While Allen‚Äôs playing time has ticked back up in the last couple weeks, he‚Äôs still finished as a top-40 fantasy RB just once in the last 6 games. I wouldn‚Äôt roll the dice on a breakout here, even against an Arizona defense that allows the 9^(th)\-most RB points per game. Allen is still playing less than 35% of the offensive snaps.

¬†

**RB Jonathan Brooks, CAR (Wk. 10: vs. NYG):**¬†Brooks will likely finally be active this week. If the Panthers don‚Äôt activate him, his practice window closes, and he sits for the full year. With that said, he‚Äôs still going to have work to do if he wants to put any dent in Chuba Hubbard‚Äôs RB1 workload. Hubbard has played 75% or more of the snaps in each of the last 4 games.

¬†

**RB Jaylen Wright, MIA (Wk. 10: @ LAR):**¬†Over the last 3 weeks with both Raheem Mostert and De‚ÄôVon Achane healthy, Wright have averaged just 6 snaps and 2.6 PPR points per game. I don‚Äôt see a good reason to expect a spike in those numbers this week in a game that should be close (Dolphins are 2.5-point underdogs).

¬†

**RB Kimani Vidal, LAC (Wk. 10¬†: vs. Ten.):**¬†Over the past 3 games, Vidal has totaled 42 yards on 15 touches. The Titans rank 5^(th)¬†in run defense DVOA. 5 touches against that Titans‚Äô defense probably won‚Äôt result in significantly better efficiency than we‚Äôve seen from Vidal in recent weeks.

¬†

**RB Carson Steele, KC (Wk. 10: vs. Den.):**¬†Steele has not reached a 20% snap share or reached 3 PPR points in a game since week 3.

¬†

**RB Blake Corum, LAR (Wk. 10: vs. Mia.):**¬†Corum hasn‚Äôt played more than 15% of the offensive snaps in any game this season, and he‚Äôs totaled just 28 scrimmage yards on 9 touches in the last 3 games. The Dolphins can be run on, but Kyren Williams will be the one doing the running.

¬†

**RB Audric Estime, DEN (Wk. 10: @ KC):**¬†It‚Äôs up to you if you want to believe Sean Payton when he says Estime is going to see an increased workload going forward. It‚Äôs not the first time Payton has said it this season, but Estime hasn‚Äôt played more than a 10% snap share in any game this season and has topped out at 3.5 PPR points. Those season highs were hit just last weekend, but most of the opportunities came in the 4^(th)¬†quarter of a blowout loss. They could get blown out again this week by the Chiefs, but KC ranks 2^(nd)¬†in run defense DVOA and allows the fewest RB fantasy points per game. It‚Äôll take a substantial increase in playing time for Estime to be a viable fantasy option.

¬†

**WRs Troy Franklin & Devaughn Vele, DEN (Wk. 10: @ KC):**¬†Franklin and Vele both failed to come through last week against a Baltimore defense that allows the most WR points per game. I wouldn‚Äôt count on a bounce back against the Chiefs, who rank 7^(th)¬†in pass defense DVOA and have allowed the 9^(th)\-fewest WR points per game. If you were desperate to pick one of these WRs to play, I‚Äôd lean towards Franklin since he fares better than Vele against man coverage and KC ranks in the top-10 in the NFL in man coverage rate, but neither player is a good option this week.

¬†

**WR Adonai Mitchell, IND (Wk. 10: vs. Buf.):**¬†Mitchell was limited to just 4 routes run in week 9 as he logged his lowest route participation rate since week 3. He was targeted just once and turned that target into a 22-yard catch. The switch to Flacco should be better for Mitchell when he‚Äôs on the field, but he‚Äôs not playing enough that you can count on him even as a deep ball dart throw.

¬†

**WR Ja‚ÄôLynn Polk, NE (Wk. 10: @ Chi.):**¬†Polk was down to just an 11% route participation rate in week 9, his lowest mark of the season. Even if that number bounces back a bit this week, the Bears allow the fewest WR points per game.

¬†

**WR Luke McCaffrey, WAS (Wk. 10: vs. Pit.):**¬†McCaffrey has been targeted just 3 times in the last 4 games. He‚Äôs just not involved enough to consider. ¬†

¬†

**WR Jermaine Burton, CIN (Wk. 10: @ Bal.):**¬†Burton missed the team walkthrough last Saturday and was a healthy scratch on Sunday as a result, just days after Joe Burrow talked about him playing a bigger role. I‚Äôd expect him to be in Zac Taylor‚Äôs doghouse for at least a couple weeks. This is a week where Burton would have some sleeper appeal if we knew he would play a meaningful role. Tee Higgins is expected to sit again, and the Ravens allow the most WR points per game. Instead, I‚Äôd expect to see a lot of Andrei Iosivas and Trenton Irwin in 3-wide sets if Tee Higgins sits again.

¬†

**WR Malachi Corley, NYJ (Wk. 10: @ Ari.):**¬†Corley recorded his first touch since week two last Thursday, and it looked like that touch was going to result in a rushing TD, but the rookie dropped the ball short of the goal line and wasn‚Äôt heard from again for the rest of the night. The Jets did trade Mike Williams ahead of the deadline this week, and Allen Lazard remains on injured reserve, so the Jets might not have a choice but to start using Corley more, but for now he remains at best the team WR4 behind Garrett Wilson, Davante Adams, and Xavier Gipson. Monitor his usage this week. If there‚Äôs a big spike, he may be worth a pickup in the deepest of leagues.

¬†

**Deep League Sleepers and Stashes:**

**RB Ray Davis, BUF (Wk. 10: @ Ind.):**¬†Davis in week 9 played his lowest snap share in about a month (14%), but he posted his second-best fantasy day in the process. He turned just 6 touches on 8 snaps into 90 yards and a TD. I wouldn‚Äôt expect that kind of performance to repeat itself if he plays such limited snaps again in week 10, but I think he‚Äôs earned more playing time this week against a middling Colts‚Äô run defense that has allowed 120+ rushing yards in 7 of their 9 games this year. James Cook is still going to be on the field for more than 50% of the offensive plays, but this strikes me as a week where we‚Äôll see a lot more Davis than Ty Johnson behind Cook. Don‚Äôt be surprised if Davis ends up with double-digit touches, and finds his way to an RB3 performance against a beatable Indy defense.

¬†

**WR Rome Odunze, CHI (Wk. 10: vs. NE):**¬†Odunze has mostly had a disappointing rookie season, but he showed signs of life last weekend in Arizona as the Bears finally treated him like an important part of the passing game as he finished with 5-104 on 7 targets. I‚Äôve been fooled by Odunze after a big game once before (6-112-1 in week 3), so I‚Äôm not going to go all-in on him this week, but if his usage last week carries over, he‚Äôs got WR3 upside in a matchup against the Patriots, who rank 30^(th)¬†in pass defense DVOA. It feels like Caleb is due for a bounce back passing effort after a couple down weeks, and if that happens, Odunze will hopefully get some of the benefit. There‚Äôs risk here given Odunze‚Äôs up and down production this season, but I wouldn‚Äôt be afraid to try Rome if you‚Äôre in a tight lineup spot due to byes.¬†

¬†

**WR Ricky Pearsall, SF (Wk. 10: @ TB):**¬†The 49ers could be close to full strength this week with Christian McCaffrey, Jordan Mason and Jauan Jennings all possibly returning, but don‚Äôt forget about Pearsall in this offense. The rookie should still be a starter in 3-WR sets with Jennings back, and while the touches could be consolidated to the stars, I expect Pearsall‚Äôs role to continue to grow as he gets more NFL reps under his belt. Juan Jennings isn‚Äôt supposed to be a focal point of this passing game, and the 49ers are hoping Pearsall can be the Aiyuk replacement they need. We‚Äôve already seen his big play ability on a 39-yard run against Dallas. There‚Äôs risk that Pearsall could be limited to just a handful of targets this week, but the Bucs allow the 7^(th)\-most WR points per game, and due to injuries will be starting CBs that opened the season on the 2^(nd)¬†and 3^(rd)\-string of the depth chart. Pearsall is probably no more than an upside WR4/5, but the 49ers have one of the higher team totals of the week, and Pearsall should face favorable individual matchups.

¬†

That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got for this week. Hopefully it helps you sort through your lineup decisions and find your way to a win this weekend. Feel free to hit me up on Twitter/X (@Shawn\_Foss) if you have any questions or want to yell at me about anything written above, and always make sure to apply what‚Äôs written in the context of your own league rules and roster. Keep a close eye on the injury report throughout the week if you have any guys who are questionable and do a final pre-game check to make sure you don‚Äôt start any inactive players. As always: Good luck, trust your gut and have fun. It‚Äôs just a game.

Pollard ROS Outlook?,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gm23eu/pollard_ros_outlook/,1gm23eu,CrustyEyeBalls,"We've seen them say they want creatively manage his workload, whatever that means, and spears will be coming back probably this week. But Pollards numbers have looked good both with and without spears.

Through weeks 1-4 (with Spears, Spears played in week 6 but was injured during that game)

* 15.4 Weighted Opportunities per Game - Tied for 13th Among RBs
* 13% Tgt Share - 9th Among RBs
* 14.6 FP/G - 21st among RBs
* 14.8 xFP/G - 18th Among RBs
* 62.7% Snap Share
* 58.1% of Rush Attempts

He had 3 carries inside the 5, 100% of his teams attempts, 60% inside the 10, and 56.3% inside the 20

Now Lets take a look at the weeks without Spears (7-9)

* 19.2 WO/G - 6th Among RBs
* 11.7% TGT Share - 11th Among RBs
* 13.9 FP/G - 24th Among RBs
* 17.8 xFP/G - 7th Among RBs
* 89% Snap Share
* 66.7% of Rush Attempts

Pollard obviously saw an increased workload without spears, but a decrease in tgt share. He also scored less PPG during that time, although was pretty significantly below his expected Fantasy Points per game. Titans have the 7th easiest playoff schedule for RBs by adjusted fantasy points allowed, but a pretty mid ROS schedule in total. FantasyPros has him as RB21 ROS, but I think im a bit higher, which is right in line with his weeks 1-4 production.

Personally, I'm a bit higher on him, RB21 seems to be his floor with Spears, unless they are planning to get him more involved then he was before. Hamstrings tend to linger and reaggravate, so I wouldn't be super surprised if Spears ends up missing more time. I think he can potentially be a solid buy for a RB needy team.",2024-11-07 21:46:27,59,fantasyfootball

I'm building a free tool to help you set your line up based on player props. Looking for feedback!,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gm0ljy/im_building_a_free_tool_to_help_you_set_your_line/,1gm0ljy,HohnJogan,"I've been working on this tool over the last several weekends in my spare time. It started as a way for me to learn webdev (come from an mobile background), but quickly grew into something I thought others would find useful. I'm sure there's many similar or identical tools out there like it but I plan to continually add on to this. Anyways, here are some of the main features (with many more planned):

* **Vegas insights**: See betting odds (updated daily) for all current NFL week games and players. I have average odds from several bookmakers but you can select individual if you'd like.
* **Player performance ratings**: See custom ratings for players based on prop odds, projected yardage, game context (spread, over/under, moneyline), ppr adjustments, position specific metrics, and your own risk factor. This was a bit of a fun one for me, I used historical data to try to come up with a algorithm that could give a somewhat decent estimate. This has performed well for me but mileage may vary, definitely need feedback from others!
* **Weekly rankings**: See weekly rankings of players based on projections. Can be useful in finding interesting prop values.

I'm still actively building and improving it (mobile support ironically isnt great), so any feedback would be super helpful! Whether it's feature suggestions, bug reports, or general thoughts, I appreciate all input.

There are *plenty* of players I *could* include in this piece each week, but these I feel are important to mention with an emphasis on *remaining schedules* in this week‚Äôs piece.

As always, feel free to discuss risers and fallers of your own, and whatever else, in the comments!

For Week 10:

**RISERS** include a rookie running back who has a lead back role and league-winning schedule. 

**FALLERS** include a rookie wide receiver who‚Äôs seemingly taking a backseat to a veteran.

**THE HOT SEAT** has Christian McCaffrey on it. I‚Äôm not going to allude to who it could be. It‚Äôs time for the 1.01 pick (in many leagues) to play like it immediately upon his return. LFG!

Which top 10 WR in PPG is most likely to fall out of the 10? Who is most likely to replace them?,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1glz6jn/which_top_10_wr_in_ppg_is_most_likely_to_fall_out/,1glz6jn,YungRobbin,"The RB version I asked had some great discussion, so figured why not gauge where people are at with WR. Using half PPR points per game to keep things simple, here are the current top 10 WRs in fantasy points per game.

1. Nico Collins¬†**(18.1)**
2. Justin Jefferson¬†**(16.7)**
3. Ja'Marr Chase¬†**(15.8)**
4. CeeDee Lamb¬†**(15.2)**
5. Cooper Kupp¬†**(15.1)**
6. A.J Brown¬†**(14.8)**
7. Malik Nabers¬†**(14.5)**
8. Garrett Wilson¬†**(14.1)**
9. Amon-Ra St. Brown¬†**(13.8)**
10. Tee Higgins **(15.6)**

\--------------------------------  
NEXT FIVE

* Drake London **(12.9)**
* Jayden Reed¬†**(12.8)**
* Terry McLaurin¬†**(12.8)**
* DeVonta Smith¬†**(12.7)**
* DK Metkalf¬†**(12.6)**

Sneakily I think Amon-Ra is the most likely to fall out of the top 10, not just because he's already at 9 but because his hot run on TDs and has been masking that his volume and YAC are both down. I think he's going to have a few weeks coming up that look more like 5 catches for 45 yards and without a TD that's a tough week for your WR1.

I think the most likely to replace him going forward will be Tyreek and Puka, who have their QB and O-lines getting healthy and are healthy themselves. I think we start to see a shift more towards their usage last year and they become focal points of their offenses.",2024-11-07 19:44:16,108,fantasyfootball

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

**PLEASE TRY TO ANSWER SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS BEFORE POSTING YOUR OWN**

* Do **NOT** reply with only a yes or no. This just removes the other person from the index without them getting information. You are not helping.
* Explain why you came to the conclusion you did

Kareem Hunt Fantasy Playoffs Outlook,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1glstqt/kareem_hunt_fantasy_playoffs_outlook/,1glstqt,Clashur,"Disclaimer - I am not an expert by any stretch, and I'm hoping for some healthy discussion and insight here.

With Pacheco set to make his return soon, and the Chiefs with a healthy hold on their division, it feels to me that there may be a couple potential upsides to holding on Hunt.

1) the Chiefs decide to stick with the hot hand. This feels unlikely (20-40%) given how dynamic Pacheco is, but it's non-zero in my opinion.

2) the Chiefs continue to roll along with Pacheco at the helm, and they are in a position to rest their starters in the final week or 2 of the season. This could bring a large upside in a deep playoff run.

Do you all agree with these? Do you think he is worth holding onto as Pacheco gears up to make a return this month?",2024-11-07 15:18:33,47,fantasyfootball

Best Unrostered Team Guesses - Week 10 2024,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gls3y0/best_unrostered_team_guesses_week_10_2024/,1gls3y0,fritothedog,"This is my guess for the best lineup using players rostered in 5% of leagues or less according to Yahoo. I will do it with 0.5ppr scoring rules.

|POS|PLAYER - TEAM|ROSTERED%|OPPONENT
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|QB|Bryce Young - CAR|4%|vs NYG|
|RB|Samaje Perine - KC|5%|vs DEN|
|RB|Cordarrelle Patterson - PIT|1%|at WAS|
|WR|Parker Washington - JAX|4%|vs MIN|
|WR|Mason Tipton - NO|1%|vs ATL|
|TE|Theo Johnson - NYG|1%|at CAR|
|FLEX|Andrei Iosivas - CIN|4%|at BAL|
|D/ST|Arizona Cardinals|4%|vs NYJ|
|K|Chad Ryland - ARI|4%|vs NYJ|

This team is available in between 75.16% and 95% of leagues.

**Bryce Young** has played better recently and plays at home against the Giants this week. The Giants defense has been better than expected but they do give up the 10th most points to opposing QBs. With Legette and Coker emerging, Young could return another decent performance.

I am staying in on **Samaje Perine.** He made the squad the last two weeks and has another chance this week. Perine could be used as a pass catcher again, against a good Broncos defense. Hunt was also limited yesterday, though that was probably a Wednesday rest day as he was also limited last week with the same quadriceps injury.

Pittsburgh is a great defense but they will be tested by the Commanders offense. Pitt may find themselves needing to throw more and Arthur Smith loves him some **CPatt.** Patterson is a full participant after missing the last 4 weeks plus their bye. 

The Jags are banged up at receiver and **Parker Washington** should be in line for more work with BTJ and Gabe Davis limited. Minnesota should be able to handle the Jaguars and are a pass funnel.

Similarly, the Saints are banged up and the Falcons are vulnerable to the passing attack. **Mason Tipton** will be competing with veteran Cedrick Wilson (who I very much considered for this team) and the newly arrived Marquez Valdes-Scantling (who I did not consider for this team). I like Tipton to capitalize on the opportunity as the Saints will ride the bump teams get from firing their head coach.

Rookie tight end **Theo Johnson** made the squad last week and now gets to face the Panthers who bleed points to everyone. I expect him to keep that momentum going as his usage starts to reflect his high snap share.

Tee Higgins is out again. Mike Gesicki has been the major beneficiary of Tee‚Äôs absences lately but Gesicki only played 36% of snaps. I expect that number to increase but I also expect **Andrei Iosivas** to flash like he did in weeks 2 and 3 in what could be a high scoring affair.

The Jets are finding their offense at the same time the **Cardinals** are starting to play some good complimentary football. I like the Cardinals at home to beat the Jets. Along with that, **Chad Ryland** should get several kicking opportunities in this one, hopefully they close the roof if it hails this week‚Ä¶

Who is your desperation start this week?

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

"Speaking purely from opportunity and efficiency, what exactly is the difference between Pollard and Walker, Hall, Jacobs, Jones, or Swift?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1glfssu/speaking_purely_from_opportunity_and_efficiency/,1glfssu,Flrg808,"Confusing to me why every week Pollard is ranked as a low end RB2 despite elite usage and being top 10 in pretty much every metric (besides the all mighty TDs). Right now pollard is RB20 in half PPR despite having a bye week, if you give him an extra week of his 13.2 yearly average and just one extra TD he is suddenly a mid range RB1.

Despite all of this, ROS and weekly rankings constantly have him much lower and projections easily have him a tier lower (closer to players like Javonte, rachaad white, healthy Zach moss) compared to the names I mentioned despite them not really showing to be in a higher tier production-wise. Yahoo has him projected for 9.8 pts next week ffs lol.

I know some will point to the return of Spears as a concern but I think after 10 weeks it‚Äôs clear the coaches may want to split the backfield but there is just no chance of that actually happening. Pollard has been by far the best player on the Titans team all year and teams tend to focus on getting their money‚Äôs worth of these off season RB acquisitions while they can.",2024-11-07 02:11:05,46,fantasyfootball

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Week 10-17 Player Specific Strength of Schedules,155,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1glct0i/week_1017_player_specific_strength_of_schedules/,1glct0i,FantasyGoldenBoy,"Last week I posted the first version of my player specific dynamic strength of schedules and did not do a great job of explaining what they are. So here is another attempt at explaining it and charts for the rest of the season.

**Player Specific Strength of Schedule**

Every player scores fantasy points in different ways, every defense gives up points in different areas.  Each position is broken down into parts and those parts are matched against how a defense defends against each.  This means two WRs on the same team may have different ratings, that will be because they play in Wide/Slot at different rates or a larger/smaller % of their points come from YAC and when matched against how a defense defends against each of those, they will end up with different matchup ratings.  Here is a chart breaking down each position.  All defensive values are adjusted to opponents faced.

|Running Back|% Fantasy Points from rushing vs Adj. Rushing Fantasy Points allowed|% Fantasy Points from Receiving vs Adj. RB Receiving Fantasy Points Allowed|% Total Fantasy Points from Explosive Plays vs. Adj. Explosive runs allowed|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Wide Receiver|% Routes from Wide vs Adj. Fantasy Points Allowed to Wide|% Routes from Slot vs Adj. Fantasy Poiints Allowed to Slot|% Total Fantasy Points from YAC vs Adj. YAC/Rec allowed|
|Tight End|% Routes from Slot vs Adj. Fantasy Poiints Allowed to Slot|% Routes from Inline vs Adj. Fantasy Poiints Allowed to Inline|% Total Fantasy Points from YAC vs Adj. YAC/Rec allowed|
|Quarterback|% Fantasy Points from Passing vs Adj. Passing Fantasy Points Allowed|% Fantasy Points from Rushing vs Adj. QB Rushing Fantasy Points Allowed||
|Defense|% Fantasy Points from Turnovers vs Adj. Turnovers by offense|% Fantasy Points from Sacks vs Adj. Sacks allowed by offense|% Fantasy Points from Yardage/Points vs Adj. Fantasy Points from Yardage/Points allowed by offense|

All charts are sorted by average Rest of Season ratings, the column labeled ""1-9"" is the average rating of the matchups faced so far this season and the final two columns are Regular Season and Playoff matchup averages.  These can all also be seen at [my website](http://www.fantasygoldenboy.com) where it may be easier to see than these images and, if something were to change, they would be updated.  Thanks for reading and let me know if you have any questions.

I've been seeing a lot of chatter about Corum and how Kyren might not hold up all the way and the Rams want to give some workload to not exhaust Kyren.

Other RBs that are a standard ""injury away from starter"" are Kimani Vidal, Allgier, Charbs, Braelon Allen, Ray Davis, etc.

Russ comes in and he has 22.1 and then the next game has ""only"" 11.4 but 2 NEAR TDs didn't get to count for him

So new QB comes in, he gets much higher quality targets on a better offense, clearly a RZ threat, clearly super talented..

And on top of all that, he's either playing really terrible defense for WR FPts (CLE twice, BAL twice) or he's got the Bengals, Eagles and Commanders all games that should be superbly competitive and its not like those defenses are elite either....

Just think he's primed to dominate the LA stretch here, Go GP!",2024-11-06 23:16:15,80,fantasyfootball

With Olave out for the immediate future and Shaheed on IR, I was wondering if anyone has any idea who (if any) of the Saints WR's is the new number 1 option? There has to be at least 1 rosterable WR on this team right?

If not, does anyone know whether Johnson or Taysom benefit more from the lack of receiving options?

Not all sites include the same players, some specifically list players at 0. Any player unrated by a particular site has been left empty. STD values for FP/RSJ will be 10% lower than PPR value. RSJ 2QB values are 2x 1QB value.

This does not include PeakedinHighSkool or FantasyCalc values as these guys are doing much more behind the scenes with a lot more data than just the five sites included here. This sheet is mainly to avoid having to look at a bunch of separate pages for other trade values. It also helps see if a certain site is higher/lower on particular players.

I first looked at moving Chase Brown and Hock for Tyreek and Pickens and it gave scores of 82 and 78 respectively. 
When you add Pacheco to the deal from the second team it now becomes 77 to 82 in favor of the team trading away Tyreek, Pickens, and Pacheco.

Messed around after and kept the same deal of Chase Brown and Hock for Henry. The outcome was 85 to 73 in my favor (Obviously) but when Pacheco was added it swapped to 79 to 81 in his favor.

I somehow deleted the text I had in here so I'll rewrite it hopefully the same. The Table above shows the Top 50 players in Rushing or Receiving first down plays. I believe this data is useful because more first downs mean more drives are sustained, which in turn can lead to more fantasy opportunities/points. The table includes:

* Number of Rushing and Receiving First downs broken down by week. ""Total FD"" is the sum of all of the FDs achieved by that player this season.
* The Total number of Receptions and Rushes this season by the player. This is summed up in the column ""Total Touches""
* The % of touches that result in a FD. Quite simply this is **Total FD** / **Total Touches**.
* Touchdown plays are counted as First down plays as well.
* RIP Godwin and Diggs

I would love feedback and if you think this is viable information to know.

Thanks!

\* I had a filter in there I forgot about. Should now show all players correctly. Thank you u/dhs98 for pointing it out for me!",2024-11-06 20:23:15,23,fantasyfootball

Cincinnati Bengals vs Baltimore Ravens - Not So Brief Armchair Analysis (Bold Player Names and Even Longer!) ,168,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gl41zi/cincinnati_bengals_vs_baltimore_ravens_not_so/,1gl41zi,1standFantasyPodcast,"Cincinnati Bengals (+6.5 - 23 Implied Point Total) vs Baltimore Ravens (-6.5 - 29.5 Implied Point Total)
52.5 point total over/under¬†

Joe Burrow
QB #5 on the year - 20.16 fantasy points per game
268.5 passing yards over/under (-114)/1.5 Passing TDs over/under (-146)/8.5 rushing yards over/under (-114)

Joe Burrow has quietly been having the best season of his career so far this year. Halfway through the season, he is on pace for 4400 yards with 40TDs and 8INTs along with 234 rushing yards with 2TDs. Not nearly as good as his 35TD season in terms of yards per game, however, he is coming off an injury plagued 2023 along with turmoil regarding his top 2 WRs.¬†

With all of that said, Burrow is averaging 249.33 yards (273 yards at home vs. 219.75 yards on the road) on 33.55 attempts and 23.55 completions with 2.22TDs and .44INTs per game while completing 70% of his passes. Remember Week 1 where he threw for 164 yards and 0TDs? Well that has been a thing of the past (outside of Week 6) as he has thrown for 1+ TD in every game since. The downside (or upside depending on how you look at it) is the connection between him and Chase has been inconsistent all year (see more below), as well as the injury problems of Tee Higgins. That absolutely restricts Burrow‚Äôs production and shows the potential of what he could be next year when the Bengals let Higgins walk and potentially draft a highly touted WR (Burden maybe?).

Right now, Burrow is the QB #5 on the year averaging 20.16 fantasy points per game. Not bad for where you took him in drafts especially compared to other highly drafted QBs (Maholmes?). Compare that to his 2022 season where he averaged 21.70 fantasy points per game or his 2021 season where he averaged 20.52 fantasy points per game. He very well may have his highest QB finish fantasy-wise this season.¬†

Vegas has set his passing line at 268.5 passing yards (19.17 yards higher than his season average) along with a 1.5 passing TD line (-146 over) and an 8.5 rushing yard line (-114 over). It appears that Vegas believes this game will be a shootout and for good reason. Remember Week 5 when Burrow threw for 392 yards and 5TDs against‚Ä¶..the Ravens? Well Vegas sure does. History is also on their side as Burrow has a 3-5 all time record against the Ravens in his career. However, he has always produced when playing them, averaging 283.9 passing yards on 36 attempts and 24.5 completions with 2.1TDs and .6INTs per game. The Bengals are 5-4 against the spread this season, hitting the over in 6 of their 9 games (Week 5 the over/under was 48.5 and they scored a total of 79 points). The Ravens are giving up the most passing yards per game in the NFL (280.9 yards) and are ranked 22nd in scoring defense allowing 24.3 points per game.¬†


Projection: 27/39 290 yards 3TDs 1INT


Chase Brown
RB #19 on the year in Half PPR Scoring - 11.8 fantasy points per game
-130 Anytime TD Scorer Odds (2nd highest in the game)¬†
57.5 rushing yards over/under (-114)

Chase Brown truthers get in here! I called it in one of my previous posts but by mid-season Chase Brown will be the RB1 of the Bengals. Obviously, Zack Moss got hurt but regardless of how it happened it still happened.¬†

Honestly, I‚Äôm shocked it didn‚Äôt happen sooner. We all watched the games showing Moss being slow, indecisive and lacking the vision to hit the holes when they opened up. Brown on the other hand looked like he had the ‚Äújuice‚Äù and the Bengals obviously recognized that. This season, Brown is averaging 53.22 rushing yards (54.2 yards at home vs. 52 yards on the road) on 11.67 attempts with .44TDs per game along with 10.88 receiving yards (13.2 yards at home vs. 8 yards on the road) on 2.88 targets and 2.33 receptions with .22TDs per game as well. Those stats put him solidly at the RB #19 on the year in Half PPR Scoring where he averages 11.8 fantasy points per game.¬†

Now, let‚Äôs take a deeper look into the trends. Since Week 6, Brown has averaged 62.5% of the snaps and 19 opportunities per game averaging 62.25 rushing yards, 14.75 receiving yards and .75TDs per game (.5 rushing TDs and .25 receiving TDs). He has averaged 13.58 fantasy points per game over that 4 week span which would put him as the RB #12 on the year.¬†

Vegas has set his line for 57.5 rushing yards (4.28 yards more than his season average) and have given him -130 odds to score an anytime TD (2nd highest in the game). The Ravens have a porous defense this season, ranking 21st overall in total defense (yards allowed + TDs allowed). However, they rank 1st in rushing yards allowed per game averaging just 75.7 yards on the ground to opposing teams. Vegas believes the volume will win out for Brown and I would have to agree as well with Moss landing on the IR.¬†

Projection: 17 attempts 55 yards 1TD/5 targets 3 receptions 37 yards¬†

Ja‚ÄôMarr Chase
WR # 1 on the year in Half PPR Scoring - 15.81 fantasy points per game¬†
78.5 receiving yards over/under (-113)/6.5 total receptions over/under (-148)/-125 Anytime TD Scorer Odds (3rd highest in the game)¬†

Ja‚ÄôMarr has not been consistent this year but is still having a great season. It just goes to show the potential that Chase has to be the overall WR1 when things click in their offense.¬†

So far this season, Chase is averaging 79.67 receiving yards (94 yards at home vs. 61.75 yards on the road) on 7.77 targets and 6.11 receptions with .77TDs per game. This puts him at the WR #1 on the season in Half PPR Scoring where he averages 15.81 fantasy points per game (Justin Jefferson has averaged 16.69 fantasy points per game on 8 games played putting him as the WR #1 in scoring average but not overall points). All of that just to mention that Chase only has eclipsed the 100 yard receiving mark 2 times this season (he did it 5 times his rookie season, 4 times his injury shortened 2nd season and 5 times last season - mainly without Joe Burrow).¬†

Vegas set his receiving line at 78.5 yards (1.17 yards less than his season average) on 6.5 receptions (.39 receptions more than his season average) and gave him -125 odds to score an anytime TD (3rd highest in the game). Over his career, he has averaged 99.7 receiving yards on 10.3 targets and 6.7 receptions with .7TDs against the Ravens. With Tee Higgins most likely missing this game, he is in line for a monster performance against a poor pass defense that allows 22.56 targets and 14.44 receptions with 187.56 receiving yards and 1.44TDs per game this season against opposing WRs.¬†

Projection: 14 targets 8 receptions 140 yards 1TD


Tee Higgins
WR #45 on the year in Half PPR Scoring - 13.32 fantasy points per game (5 games played)
-125 Anytime TD Scorer Odds (3rd highest in the game)

Not really a lot to say. When he is on the field Higgins is great. Some would argue he is more consistent than Ja‚ÄôMarr Chase when they are both on the field. The problem is that he very rarely on the field. It is hard to gauge a player and whether or not they are ‚Äúinjury prone‚Äù, however, Higgins definitely seems like he falls within that category if it exists.¬†

He has only played 5 games this season where he has averaged 68.2 receiving yards (61 yards at home vs. 73 yards on the road) on 9 targets and 5.8 receptions with .6TDs per game. That puts him at the WR #45 on the season in Half PPR Scoring where he averages 13.32 fantasy points per game.¬†

Higgins is 3-5 against the Ravens in his career (2-2 at home vs. 1-3 on the road) and averages 62.1 receiving yards on 8.8 targets and 5.1 receptions with .8TDS per game.¬†

Vegas has given him -125 odds to score an anytime TD (3rd highest in the game), however, they have not set lines for receiving or receptions leading me to believe they assume he will miss this week (which is the direction he is trending).¬†

Projection: DNP

Andreis Iosivas
WR #68 on the year in Half PPR Scoring - 5.71 fantasy points per game¬†
21.5 receiving yards over/under (-113)/2.5 total receptions over/under (+102)/+270 Anytime TD Scorer Odds (9th highest in the game)¬†

Iosivas is an interesting player. It seems like the Bengals have a lot of faith in him, especially in the red zone, but it seems like that is where the trust ends. He does not see a lot of targets between the 20s even though he is on the field a lot (80.5% snap share). It‚Äôs perplexing since the Bengals were so high on him this off-season and gave him 100% of the snaps in Week 1 when Higgins was mysteriously ruled out. In Week 3 he had the highest number of targets on the season at 7 and still did not eclipse the 60 yard mark.¬†

Overall, Iosivas is averaging 22.11 receiving yards (25.4 yards at home vs. 18 yards on the road) on 3.44 targets and 1.66 receptions with .44TDs per game. That puts him at the WR #68 on the year in Half PPR Scoring where he averages 5.71 fantasy points per game. The ironic thing is, out of his 15 total receptions on the season 4 of them have gone for TDs. He has the same red zone catch percentage as Ja‚ÄôMarr Chase and Tee Higgins but has been targeted considerably less than both of them. Just goes to show you that they trust him in the short area of the field but he might not have the speed or separation to get consistent targets elsewhere (the stats don‚Äôt back it up though as he is 30th out of 144 qualifying WRs in separation score this season so even more confusing).¬†

Vegas has set his receiving line at 21.5 yards (.61 yards less than his season average) on 2.5 receptions (.84 more than his season average) and has given him +270 odds to score an anytime TD (9th highest in the game). With Higgins trending to be out I would imagine that Iosivas and Gesicki will be the main benefactors in this game with Irwin and other ancillary pieces getting a small bump up as well. In his career, Iosivas is 0-2 against the Ravens averaging 39 receiving yards on 1 target and .5 receptions with 0TDs per game.¬†

Projection: 5 targets 3 receptions 43 yards 1TD

Mike Gesicki
TE #11 on the year in Half PPR Scoring - 6.7 fantasy points per game¬†
48.5 receiving yards over/under (-113)/4.5 total receptions over/under (+106)/+240 Anytime TD Scorer Odds (8th highest in the game)¬†

Gesicki is now in a prime position for this week and the rest of the season as well. With Eric All going on the season ending IR and Higgins missing this week, Gesicki should see a high number of opportunities against the Ravens who are better against opposing TEs but still give up 7.67 targets and 5.78 receptions with 67.56 receiving yards with .11TDs per game on the year.¬†

So far, Gesicki is averaging 39.22 receiving yards (53.8 yards at home vs. 28 yards on the road) on 4 targets and 3.33 receptions with .22TDs per game. It has definitely been an inconsistent season so far for him as he has ranged from the TE52 to the TE1 this past week. Hopefully, moving forward you will see a more consistent role in the offense with a handful of more targets per game. Even with his inconsistency, Gesicki is the TE #11 on the year in Half PPR Scoring where he averages 6.7 fantasy points per game. This is more of an indictment on the TE landscape than it is on Gesicki.¬†

Vegas has set his receiving line at 48.5 yards (9.28 yards more than his season average) on 4.5 receptions (1.17 receptions more than his season average) and have given him +240 odds to score an anytime TD (8th highest in the game). I‚Äôm a little bit surprised that he is so low on the TD scorer odds with the high implied point total for the Bengals and the lack of options due to injuries.¬†

Gesicki has a 2-2 record all time against the Ravens in his career (1-2 at home vs. 1-0 on the road) where he averages 25.8 receiving yards on 4.8 targets and 2.0 receptions with .3TDs per game. Those games came when he was on the Miami Dolphins and had a completely different offensive scheme and usage though so it is hard to take away anything from his historical statistics.¬†

Projection: 8 targets 6 receptions 54 yards 1TD

21st in total defense (yards allowed/TDs)/32nd in passing yards allowed (280.9)/1st in rushing yards allowed (75.7)/22nd in scoring defense (24.3 pts per game)/12th in Red Zone Defense - 53.3%)/29th in 3rd down defense (46.2%)

____________________________________________________________________________

Lamar Jackson
QB #1 on the year - 25.30 fantasy points per game
237.5 passing yards over/under (-114)/1.5 Passing TDs over/under (-130)
+165 Anytime TD Scorer Odds (6th highest in the game)¬†
51.5 rushing yards over/under (-114)

Lamar has been playing out of his mind this season. I remember going into last season everyone was talking about the Todd Monken offense and the changes that were going to be made. Obviously, last season did not work out the way that they had hoped but it showed us glimpses of what was to come. With a second year in the same system, the Ravens are looking unstoppable on the offensive side of the ball.¬†

Lamar is averaging 264.33 passing yards (251.5 yards at home vs. 274.6 yards on the road) on 28.33 attempts and 19.33 completions with 2.22TDs and .22INTs per game while completing 68% of his passes (highest completion percentage of his career). If that isn‚Äôt enough, he is also averaging 56.11 rushing yards (34.75 yards at home vs. 72.4 yards on the road) on 9.33 attempts with .22TDs per game as well. In Lamar‚Äôs first MVP season (2019) he ended the year with 3127 passing yards with 36TDs along with 1206 rushing yards and 7TDs. At the pace he has now, he will end the year with 4,758 passing yards and 40TDs along with 1,010 rushing yards and 4TDs. That is absolutely ridiculous when you think about it as he should have his third MVP on lock as long as he is able to finish the season.¬†

Obviously, Jackson is the QB #1 on the season averaging 25.30 fantasy points per game (Baker is 2nd averaging 23.5 fantasy points per game). He is also doing this when his #1 target going into this season has had a very inconsistent, bordering on poor first 9 weeks. Maybe this is just all good timing with Rashod Bateman finally being healthy and Zay Flowers looking like a legit WR1. The addition of Derrick Henry doesn‚Äôt hurt either as now there is a consistent threat in the backfield alongside Lamar that defenses have to account for (remember Week 1 when they ran the option a bunch leading to Lamar having 120+ rushing yards?).¬†

Vegas has set his passing line at 237.5 yards (26.83 yards less than his season average) along with 1.5 passing TDs over/under (-130). He has a 51.5 yard rushing line (4.61 yards less than his season average) and has been given +165 odds to score an anytime TD (6th highest in the game). This might be based more on historical averages as he is 9-2 all time (5-1 at home vs. 4-1 on the road) against the Bengals in his career and has only averaged 198.4 passing yards on 26.2 attempts and 16.2 completions with 1.6TDs and .4INTs. With the Bengals ranking 19th in overall defense (yards allowed + TDs allowed) and in the bottom half for rushing yards allowed per game(18th), passing yards allowed per game (17th), scoring defense (25th), red zone defense (27th) and third down defense (26th); it should be a high scoring affair where Jackson will continue his MVP case.

Projection: 24/33 245 yards 2TDs/11 attempts 100 yards 1TD

Derrick Henry
RB #1 on the year in Half PPR Scoring - 21.89 fantasy points per game
-290 Anytime TD Scorer Odds (highest in the game)¬†
90.5 rushing yards over/under (-114)

I bet the Titans are kicking themselves now for letting Henry walk. Even if it is just to put him behind center instead of running out the gross combination of Will Levis and Mason Rudolph. I guess the NFL should take notice regarding the ‚ÄúRB Age Cliff‚Äù as it seems like that might be a thing of the past. Henry has looked phenomenal and honestly, what else were we expecting?¬†

This season, Henry is averaging 116.88! Rushing yards (130.25 yards at home vs. 106.2 yards on the road) on 18.67 attempts with 1TD per game. Without question, he is the RB #1 on the year in Half PPR Scoring averaging 21.89 fantasy points per game (Kamara is #2 averaging 18.63 fantasy points per game). He has almost as many rushing yards this season (1,052) as he did all of last season through 17 games (1,167). If he continues this pace, he will end the year with right around 2,000 rushing yards and 20+ TDs. Crazy to consider that the Ravens have two of the top 5 players in the MVP race halfway through the season.¬†

Henry has a rushing line of 90.5 yards (26.38 yards less than his season average) by Vegas who has also given him -290! Odds to score an anytime TD (highest in the game by far). This might be based on historical data as Henry is 3-2 against the Bengals in his career (2-1 at home vs. 1-1 on the road) where he averages 83.2 rushing yards on 16.6 attempts and .6TDs per game. Also, it is worth noting that this season when Lamar has exceeded 38 passing attempts, Henry has had his worst finishes of the year (RB30, RB7 and RB18). Now he is matched up against the 18th ranked rushing defense and the 27th ranked red zone defense. I believe this game the Ravens will try to get Henry involved early and often leading him to another 100 yard rushing game.¬†

Projection: 19 attempts 110 yards 1TD

Zay Flowers
WR #10 on the year in Half PPR Scoring - 12.34 fantasy points per game
+135 Anytime TD Scorer Odds (5th highest overall)¬†
58.5 receiving yards over/under (-114)/4.5 total receptions over/under (-146)

It‚Äôs official, Zay Flowers has broken out. We saw flashes last season but with the Monken offense not clicking, it was hard to see what was to come. Now with everything firing on all cylinders, Flowers looks to be a lock for a WR1 finish this season. They are using him differently than in the past as he is averaging 14.2 yards per reception compared to 11.1 yards per reception from last season. He has also been more efficient in the Red Zone this year (5 targets so far with 2TDs) compared to last season (15 targets and 3TDs).¬†

This season, Flowers is averaging 72.67 receiving yards (90 yards at home vs. 58.8 yards on the road) on 7.44 targets and 5.11 receptions with .33TDs per game (last year he averaged 52.44 receiving yards on 6.88 targets and 5 receptions with .11TDs per game through the first 9 games). He has definitely become a more complete player and the Ravens are using him more at the detriment of Mark Andrews. Right now, Flowers is the WR #10 on the year in Half PPR Scoring where he averages 12.34 fantasy points per game. Flowers has been open on 55.9% of his targets this season (3 or more yards of separation) according to Next Gen Stats. I‚Äôll admit, I was on the fence regarding Flowers in the beginning but he has definitely proven he belongs in the conversation when it comes to top 12 WRs in the league.¬†

Vegas has set Flowers‚Äô receiving line at 58.5 yards (14.17 yards less than his season average) on 4.5 total receptions (.61 receptions less than his season average) and have given him +135 odds to score an anytime TD (5th highest in the game). I think these lines might come at a surprise to some people, however, the Bengals are in the top 10 when it comes to fantasy points given up to the WR position this season. The Bengals only give up 12.11 completions on 19.67 targets for 143.33 total receiving yards and .67TDs per game to opposing WRs. This makes things a little more difficult as well with the addition of Diontae Johnson and his further integration into the offense.¬†

Flowers is 3-0 against the Bengals in his career and has averaged 72 receiving yards on 7 targets and 4.7 receptions with 0TDs per game. I am expecting a more modest game for Flowers with the various WRs used in this offense and the fact that Henry will take over this game unlike the last time the Bengals and Ravens faced off.

Projection: 8 targets 5 receptions 55 yards 1TD

Rashod Bateman
WR #29 on the year in Half PPR Scoring - 8.35 fantasy points per game¬†
+310 Anytime TD Scorer Odds (11th highest in the game)¬†
28.5 receiving yards over/under (-114)/2.5 total receptions over/under (+116)

Bateman has been fantastic this season especially compared to where he has been in the past. I am sure I am not the only one who has been scorned by Bateman over the past few years hoping that it‚Äôll finally be his breakout. Lo and behold, 2024 was the year.¬†

Bateman is currently averaging 49.67 receiving yards (39.75 yards at home vs. 57.6 yards on the road) on 4.33 targets and 2.77 receptions with .33TDs per game. Definitely a big improvement from his previous best seasons‚Äô stats (2021 where he averaged 42.91 receiving yards and only had 1TD in 12 games played). He definitely falls into the ‚Äúinjury prone‚Äù category along with Higgins as I mentioned above. It is the perfect storm for him as Lamar‚Äôs completion percentage is the highest it has ever been and he is averaging the most passing attempts in his career. The Monken offense has been great to Bateman, however, there is reason to be concerned moving forward.¬†

As much as Harbaugh says that Johnson will not take Bateman‚Äôs role away, I find that particularly hard to believe for two reasons. First, I am not sure that Bateman will stay healthy for the entire season, meaning that Johnson will take over his spot due to injury if he misses time. Secondly, Johnson is a proven elite WR and has been for some time. The Ravens did not do a mid-season trade to acquire a WR just to allow him to return punts and have a limited role in the actual offense.¬†

Vegas is also uncertain about the roles of Bateman and Johnson moving forward as they set his receiving line at 28.5 yards (21.17 yards less than his season average) on 2.5 total receptions (.27 receptions less than his season average) and have given him +310 odds to score any anytime TD (11th highest in the game). To me, this is showing they are hedging their bets as one of the two aforementioned WRs will exceed 30 yards and 2.5 receptions but no one is sure which one (I‚Äôm leaning Johnson). Again, with the Bengals allowing very few points per game to the WR position, it might be a tough game in terms of fantasy production for the three WRs.¬†

Projection: 5 targets 3 receptions 49 yards¬†


Diontae Johnson
WR #41 on the year in Half PPR Scoring - 8.67 fantasy points per game (1 played with Ravens - Scored 0pts and had 4% of snaps) - 9.9 fantasy points not including Week 9
+270 Anytime TD Scorer Odds (9th highest in the game)¬†
21.5 receiving yards over/under (-114)/2.5 total receptions over/under (+130)

Last week was a blip when it comes to Diontae Johnson and his performance. He was just traded to the Ravens and played 4% of snaps, had 0 targets and scored 0 fantasy points. I would imagine all of that is going to change on Thursday night.¬†

This season, Johnson is averaging 44.63 receiving yards (44 yards at home vs. 45.25 yards on the road) on 7.25 targets and 3.75 receptions with .38TDs per game. All of those stats were with the struggling Carolina Panthers and two different starting QBs along with his poor Week 9 performance. If you exclude the last game with the Ravens, he is actually averaging 51 yards per game on 8.29 targets and 4.28 receptions with .43TDs per game. Again, it is hard to gauge where he will fit into this offense and whether or not Harbaugh was telling the truth about his utilization.¬†

The historical data I can use as an example is that Johnson is 6-4 against the Bengals all time in his career (3-2 at home vs. 3-2 on the road) where he averages 60 receiving yards on 9.3 targets and 5.6 receptions with .4TDs per game. Vegas is again in the dark as they have set his receiving line to 21.5 yards (23.13 yards less than his season average) on 2.5 total receptions (1.25 receptions less than his season average) and have given him +270 odds to score an anytime TD (9th highest in the game). Even the fact that they have given Johnson higher TD odds than Bateman should be somewhat telling.¬†

It should be interesting to see what his involvement is like this week as well as what it does to the other WRs and their opportunities. I can see a world where Johnson receives the 2nd highest target share this week as he should prove that he is a better WR talent-wise than Bateman.¬†

Projection: 7 targets 5 receptions 55 yards¬†


Mark Andrews
TE #9 on the year in Half PPR Scoring! - 7.21 fantasy points per game¬†
+210 Anytime TD Scorer Odds (7th highest in the game)¬†

It has been a weird year for Mark Andrews. He was injured coming into this offseason. Then he had a mysterious car accident where there was little to no information for the Fantasy Football community. Then Week 1 he only received 2 targets and ran less routes than Isiah Likely as the Ravens were still holding strong that nothing was wrong with Andrews healthwise. Well obviously I think that was a lie since as the season has progressed he has improved week to week.¬†

Right now, Andrews is averaging 32.11 receiving yards (35.75 yards at home vs. 29.2 yards on the road) on 3.22 targets and 2.67 receptions with .44TDs per game. That is a far cry from his previous seasons when he has been the go to target for Lamar everywhere on the field and especially in the red zone.¬† Even with his 2 target game in week 1 and back to back goose eggs in weeks 3 & 4, he is still the TE #9 on the year in Half PPR Scoring where he averages 7.21 fantasy points per game. That is extremely crazy to think about as he was the TE29, TE11 and unranked in weeks 3 and 4 of this season. Just another indictment on how the TE position is not utilized by teams which could be a product of the NFL‚Äôs offensive schemes or the lack of high end talent at the TE position (looking at you Brock Bowers).¬†

When we look at Andrews' production over his previous seasons, there is an alarming trend. Since 2019, he has averaged around 56 receiving yards per game and capped at 80 yards per game in 2021. Since that season, he has progressive decreased in his receiving yards per game and has not had over 6 TDs either (2019 he had 10TDs, 2020 he had 7 and 2021 he had 9). Let‚Äôs take a look at that same time period for Red Zone targets where he received 21 in 2021, 18 in 2022, 14 in 2023 and only has 7 this season (and is out targeted by Likely in the Red Zone 10 to 7). That is a concerning decrease in opportunity and targets over the past few years, especially for a TE that is not considered ‚Äúold‚Äù for the position. Maybe the car accident affected him more physically than the team wanted to let on?¬†

Andrews is 9-3 against the Bengals in his career (5-1 at home vs. 4-2 on the road) where he averages 54.7 receiving yards on 6.6 targets and 4.7 receptions with .6TDs per game. After his back to back goose eggs, he has averaged 44.8 receiving yards a game along with 4 targets and 3.6 receptions and has had 4 total TDs in that 5 game span.¬†

Vegas has set his line at 42.5 receiving yards (10.39 yards more than his season average) on 3.5 total receptions (.83 receptions more than his season average) and have given him +210 odds to score an anytime TD (7th highest in the game). The Bengals are 26th when it comes to fantasy points allowed to the TE position this season where they average 58.44 yards on 7.33 targets and 5.67 completions with .56TDs per game. Coupled with the Bengals awful Red Zone defense and the likelihood that Henry will face stacked boxes leading to open areas in the middle of the field, Andrews should be in line for another top 10 TE finish this week (unless Likely takes his TDs).¬†

Projection: 6 targets 4 receptions 41 yards 1TD

FINAL SCORE: Cincinnati Bengals 27 - Baltimore Ravens 31 

Cincinnati Bengals 19th in overall yards (17th in pass yards allowed/18th in rushing yards allowed/25th in scoring defense giving up 25.2 pts per game/27th in Red Zone Defense - 67.9%/26th in 3rd down defense - 44.5%)",2024-11-06 17:34:14,199,fantasyfootball

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

#Background

For years, I‚Äôve searched for a tool with the combination of data I wanted to help me make tough start-or-sit decisions. For instance:

* Do I need a safe, floor play or a risky, high-upside play?
* How consistently has this player performed in the last few weeks?
* How involved is this player on a play-by-play basis?
* How have similar players performed against this opponent?
* How is this player‚Äôs team expected to perform?

When knowing these variables, I find that my confidence in making a decision is significantly higher than blindly relying on site projections or a rankings-based sit-or-start tool.

#Overview
When comparing players with the Head-to-Head Player Comparison Tool, the following sections are available to explore:

* [**High-level Details**](https://fantasyondraft.com/assets/images/screenshots/head-to-head_2024-10-16/Details-Odds-Props-Projections.PNG) - displays player information and high-level comparison labels (for quick decisions)
* **Matchup Odds** - displays the opponent, over/under, spread, and implied team total. Odds are from DraftKings via [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/).
* **Player Props** - displays passing, rushing, receiving, and other props (subscription required).  Props can be selected from DraftKings, Fanduel, Underdog Fantasy, and PricePicks via [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/).
* **Projections** - displays raw projections (from [SportsData.io](https://sportsdata.io/)), matchup bonuses/penalties, matchup adjusted projections.
* [**Performance Trends**](https://fantasyondraft.com/assets/images/screenshots/head-to-head_2024-10-16/Performances-Opportunities.PNG) - contains graphical views of performance trends:
 * Overall view of weekly points scored
 * Low-variance view of weekly points scored, excluding high-variance stats like touchdowns and turnovers
 * View of weekly projections vs performances
 * Points breakdown that shows how points were scored.
* **Opportunities** - contains graphical views of opportunity trends:
 * Weekly snap counts
 * Weekly snap percentages
 * Passing Attempts
 * Rushing Attempts
 * Targets
 * Snaps breakdown that shows snap outcomes.
* [**Similar Performances**](https://fantasyondraft.com/assets/images/screenshots/head-to-head_2024-10-16/SimilarPerformances.PNG) - a list of ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù players who have performances against the opponent of the player you are comparing. Each past performance displays projected fantasy points against actual fantasy points, with a difference that is highlighted to easily show underperformances and overperformances.


The combination of these sections should help you outline and weigh the risks associated with each player you are comparing. Ideally, one player will stand out as the ‚Äúbest‚Äù choice, but sometimes, it really can come down to a coin flip. In these cases, at least you have some data to back up the decision to flip a coin.

#Confidence Metrics
The Metrics page has been updated to include data from week 9. [You can check out the full breakdown here.](https://fantasyondraft.com/head-to-head-metrics) Below are some highlights:



* Over 20,000 comparisons since the tool went live for 2024 in week 4, with ~1k-2k unique comparisons a week - so plenty of data to work with. There were 2,292 unique comparisons last week!
* The High-level comparison labels are leading players in the right direction a majority of the time:
 * Consistent: 73%
 * Best on Average: 73%
 * Safe: 70%
 * Risky: 72%
 * Upside: 81%
* When looking for the best possible play, look for these label combinations:
 * Best on Average/Upside/Consistent (73% success rate)
 * Best on Average/Upside/Safe (72% success rate)
 * Best on Average/Upside/Risky (67% success rate)
* When looking for guaranteed points when you are favored to win a matchup, look for these label combinations:
 * Safe/Consistent/Best on Average (92% success rate)
 * Best on Average/Upside/Safe (91% success rate)
 * Safe/Consistent/Upside (88% success rate)
* The ""magical"" label combination **Best of Average/Upside/Safe** has both a very high chance of being the better play (72%) and one of the best ways to guarantee points by outperforming the projected floor (91%)
* Finally, while these are great metrics for utilizing the high-level labels, there are still many more sections of the tool that you can pair with these labels to make a start-or-sit decision you are comfortable with.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

FAAB Cheatsheet for Week 10 Waiver Wire: Quentin Johnston (LAC WR) is the Top Target of the Week,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gkpu0h/faab_cheatsheet_for_week_10_waiver_wire_quentin/,1gkpu0h,faabtastic,"**Quentin Johnston (LAC WR)** is the top player to spend our FAAB dollars on for Week 10.  The suggested expert average bid amount is $8.

How much will you be spending? [Quentin Johnston (LAC WR) FAAB X/Twitter Poll](https://x.com/faabtastic/status/1851382449860702390)

**Other Popular Players Average Bids**

1. Xavier Legette (CAR WR): $10
2. Mike Gesicki (CIN TE): $7
3. Drake Maye (NE QB): $6
4. Taysom Hill (NO QB, TE): $6

See the rest on [www.faabtastic.com](https://www.faabtastic.com)

**Note:** I wasn't able to post Week 7 due to work constraints. I'd like for that to not happen again, so I'm asking for a volunteer to help me input expert bids each week. As I don't currently charge for any part of my website, this volunteer position will be unpaid. However, you will get insight into how I put this together each week and also an early peek into bids before they're published. Please DM me if you're interested, with a quick blurb about your availability each Mon/Tue and why you think you'd be a good fit. Thanks!

**How to Use**

Each week I collect suggested FAAB waiver wire bids from fantasy football experts and publish them to [www.faabtastic.com](https://www.faabtastic.com). The Expert Count column is how many experts mentioned that player. All bids are a based on a starting budget of $100. I then average the bids for each player. The trimmed mean is the average, but without the highest and lowest values.

**Tips & Tricks**

At the bottom of each table, I linked all the articles in the footer row so you can get all the details about why bids are what they are.

You can click any column header to sort it low-to-high (ascending). Click the same header again to sort it high-to-low (descending).

Keep in mind that these are just suggested bids. It's what the experts are suggesting to spend up to, but also maintain enough money for the rest of the season. If you really, really want a player then by all means break the bank if you need to.",2024-11-06 04:06:15,22,fantasyfootball

Week 10 - Survivor Pool Picks - Riding High",19,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gkmi6w/week_10_survivor_pool_picks_riding_high/,1gkmi6w,stvnknwy,"Hey, NFL fans! We‚Äôre back with the Week 10 breakdown. Last week was another perfect week, and we‚Äôre riding that momentum into this one! It wasn‚Äôt without some drama, though, as the Bills narrowly edged out the Dolphins in a nail-biter.

Here‚Äôs hoping this week‚Äôs insights give you the edge you need for your survivor pools, bets, or simply enjoying the matchups. We‚Äôll dive into some of the most intriguing games, with a focus on key stats like offensive efficiency, defensive resilience, and turnovers.

**I highly recommend checking out the data.** Each matchup is reviewed in the SportWise DataSpace below‚Äîyou might even find a few other favourites worth considering!

**Check out the data!**

**Home Team Favourites to Watch**

**Los Angeles Chargers** vs. Tennessee Titans

The Chargers enter Week 10 with a slight edge over the Titans, boasting a 5-3 record and averaging 5.3 yards per play on offense. With 159 points scored and only 4 offensive turnovers, their offense has been efficient. The Titans, on the other hand, have struggled this season with a 2-6 record and 20 offensive turnovers, which is a major vulnerability. Expect the Chargers‚Äô playmakers to capitalize on the Titans‚Äô turnover issues and maintain control at home.

**Chicago Bears** vs. New England Patriots

The Bears have shown more stability than the Patriots this season, sporting a 4-4 record compared to New England‚Äôs 2-7. Chicago‚Äôs offense has been able to put up 172 points with a modest 4.6 yards per play, and their defense has held opponents in check. New England has had a rough season, managing only 141 points while allowing 211 points on defense. The Bears‚Äô balanced approach on both sides of the ball makes them the safer pick in this one.

**Kansas City Chiefs** vs. Denver Broncos

Kansas City is having a stellar season at 8-0, with 203 points scored and an efficient offense averaging 5.2 yards per play. Denver, despite a respectable 5-4 record, has struggled with turnovers which plays into the hands of Mahomes.  Kansas City‚Äôs combination of defensive resilience and scoring efficiency gives them a clear edge over Denver, making them a strong survivor pick for Week 10.

**Away Team Favourites to Consider**

I generally avoid road teams, but there are some tempting matchups this week.

**Minnesota Vikings** vs. Jacksonville Jaguars

Minnesota is heading into Jacksonville with a solid 6-2 record and a balanced offense averaging 5.7 yards per play. Jacksonville, at 2-7, has allowed 250 points and has one of the league‚Äôs highest points-against totals. With Minnesota‚Äôs ability to sustain drives and capitalize on scoring opportunities, they‚Äôre likely to take advantage of Jacksonville‚Äôs defensive weaknesses and come away with a win.

**Buffalo Bills** vs. Indianapolis Colts

The Bills, with a strong 7-2 record, are favourites in this matchup against the 4-5 Colts. Buffalo has been prolific on offense with 260 points scored and a steady 5.8 yards per play. The Colts‚Äô defense will have a tough time keeping up, given Buffalo‚Äôs consistency in scoring and Indianapolis‚Äô occasional turnover issues. Look for Buffalo‚Äôs offensive firepower to overwhelm the Colts on the road.

**Detroit Lions** vs. Houston Texans

The Lions head to Houston with a formidable 7-1 record, and they‚Äôve averaged a strong 6.1 yards per play on offense. Detroit‚Äôs ability to pile up points (258 so far) gives them a clear edge over Houston, who has been solid but not as dominant at 6-3. Detroit‚Äôs explosive playmakers and the Texans‚Äô recent defensive lapses make this a promising pick for the Lions to secure a road win.

What do you think of this week‚Äôs picks? Do you agree with the analysis, or do you see potential upsets? Let‚Äôs hear your thoughts and predictions for Week 10!

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

"Week 10 Kicker Rankings - Metric Based Projections
",41,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gkknqx/week_10_kicker_rankings_metric_based_projections/,1gkknqx,juicyKW,"\*I UPDATED the kicker for the Vikings to be John Parker Romo based on reports of Reichard heading to IR\*

*Siebert is out this week. Zane Gonzalez is kicking in his place. He‚Äôs a 91/113 career fg (80.5%) and 127/134 career xp (94.7%). He‚Äôs 29/41 from 40-49 and 11/18 from 50+ in his career.



This is my 5th week of kicker projections, and it's been fun so far (for a stats nerd). I hope you're finding it useful as well and this is a thread you can discuss kickers.

See my Kicker Rest of Season and Power Rankings [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gkknfd/kicker_ros_rankings_and_power_rankings_week_10/)

**HOW IT WORKS**

The projections are done by multiplying the kickers fantasy points per game by a weighted average of stats for the defense the kicker is going against. *You'll find that these projections have a wider range of points than the big sites.*

**WEATHER IS NOT**¬†factored into the projections. Just remember wind over 15 mph, extreme cold, rain, or a combo of wind and rain, can affect kicking totals negatively. ***\*I've added a column to show if the kicker is playing in a dome or not.\****

Metrics used for the opponent defense are:

* Points Allowed Per Game
* Kicker Fantasy Points Allowed Per Game
* Extra Points Attempts Per Game
* Field Goals Attempts Per Game
* Red Zone TD % (LOW=more FG attempts)

***NOTES:***

**Week 10 Byes**: Brandon McManus, GB; Daniel Carlson, LV; Dustin Hopkins, CLE; Jason Myers, SEA

**Younghoe Koo, ATL** \- I found it hard to believe he averaged out to #2 this week. I did a double check of my numbers, as well as checked projections on other sites like ESPN (8th) and FantasyPros (3rd). He scored 20 points last time against the Saints. This could be the last week worth hanging onto him though. I'd have a hard time trusting him due to his recent performance.

**Jake Moody, SF** \- If he doesn't end up playing this week, I'll update the projections.

**Chris Boswell, PIT** \- Washington's defense has been a tougher matchup for kickers. While his appeal is great long term, this might be a 'down' week for him.

**Brandon Aubrey, DAL** \- While Dak is out for the time being, the Cowboys may have trouble scoring. But they could just have trouble scoring touchdowns. If they get into range for Aubrey, he may be their best bet at putting points on the board.

**Vikings** \- John Parker Romo is kicking for them. He's a rookie with a college career of 51/52 XP and 20/27 FG made.

Kicker ROS Rankings and Power Rankings - Week 10 Update - Metric Based,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gkknfd/kicker_ros_rankings_and_power_rankings_week_10/,1gkknfd,juicyKW,"\*I updated the Vikings kicker now that I saw that Reichard will be out\*

Having fun with these, so I'm going to continue them. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me or the community. Hoping this continues to provide a landing spot for anyone wanting to discuss kickers!

Find Week 10 Projections [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gkknqx/week_10_kicker_rankings_metric_based_projections/)

***Notes***

**Siebert, WAS**¬†\- The opportunities for Seibert just keep coming. The Washington offense is here to stay and will continue to give ample opportunity to score. His lowest points in a game so far this season is 9.

**Boswell, PIT**¬†\- While this seems obvious, he should be rostered (only 40% rostered currently). Boswell is now past his bye and may be available in some leagues if the owner decided to drop him last week.

**Moody, SF**¬†\- I'm using Moody for ROS rankings. If he misses this week, I'll only be updating the weekly projections. The 49ers produce top 5 opportunities for their kickers, it's just a matter of capitalizing.

**Aubery, DAL**¬†\- With the injury to Dak Prescott there is uncertainty to how the team will move the ball. Luckily, Aubrey has the best leg in football and is accurate from any range, so he's in range more often than other kickers.

**Fairbairn, HOU**¬†\- With a great seasonal and playoff SOS, his consistency should continue and be an asset to have on your team. Only downside is his bye is Week 14. If you're fighting for a playoff spot you may have a decision to make that week.

**Tucker, BAL** \- Don't look now, but Tucker has been skyrocketing up the board. Ranking 6th in PPG among active kickers, he should continue to produce top 10 numbers ROS. His schedule is on the harder side, but with the way Baltimore is moving the ball, he should still see great opportunities. The Ravens rank 1st in RZ TD%, so that limits his short distance FGs a bit.

# ROS Rankings

I use the same stats I use for weekly projections to create these ranks. I create an adjustment % based on rankings of the remaining defenses the kicker is facing and do a weighted average to project their ROS Rank.

* Kicker Individual Fantasy Points Per Game
* Opposing Defense Points Allowed Per Game
* Opposing Defense Kicker Fantasy Points Against Per Game
* Opposing Defense Extra Points Attempts Per Game
* Opposing Defense Field Goals Attempts Per Game
* Opposing Defense Red Zone TD % (LOW=more FG attempts)

***Notes***

**Byes:**¬†Players with \* have had their bye weeks.

**Week 10 byes:**¬†Brandon McManus, GB; Daniel Carlson, LV; Dustin Hopkins, CLE; Jason Myers, SEA

**Drop:**¬†Younghoe Koo, ATL. His last 3 weekly finishes are 27th, 22nd, and 26th. Outside of two blowup weeks (weeks 4 and 5) he hasn't finished higher than 9th in weekly scoring, with 6/7 of those weeks 14 or lower. He did have a huge week against New Orleans last time with 20 points, so this may be the last week to hang onto him.

**Add:**¬†Jake Moody, SF. Coming off bye/injury, he looks to be available in 53% of leagues. I'd take a look as SF has a top 3 opportunity rank so far this season.

**Keep An Eye On:**¬†Will Reichard, MIN. He's on IR and John Parker Romo has replaced him. He's a rookie with college stats of 51/52 xp  and 20/27 on Field Goals. Tough to project it, but I'd expect a dip in points.

**SOS ranking**: 1=best, 32=worst

**Playoff SOS**: Weeks 15-17; 1=best, 32=worst

# Kicker POWER RANKINGS

These are the stats that go into these rankings. I've added in player specific XP% and FG% this week (typically just used team versions of this). With some kickers being injured and players losing their jobs, I had to find a way to include this. It also balances out the rank a bit more as we don't want a previous kicker's stats to dramatically affect the new kickers ranks.

* Fantasy PPG
* Player 50+ Field Goal Makes
* Player FG%
* Player XP%
* Team FG Attempts
* Team XP Attempts
* Team Kicking Points
* Team Points Per Field Goal Attempt
* Team Points Per Game
* RZ TD% (looking for low % to increase FG attempts)
* RZ Attempts

***Notes:***

**Biggest Riser:**¬†Tyler Bass, BUF (+9)

**Biggest Faller:** Cameron Dicker, LAC (-8)

**Notable Riser:** Justin Tucker, BAL (+5)

**How to read the chart:** This data is showing the number of points allowed, so if you‚Äôre looking at QBs, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are allowing a lot of PPG in the last 3 weeks (good matchup for Brock Purdy) while the Pittsburgh Steelers are not (bad matchup for Jayden Daniels).

* Blue = good matchup, White = average matchup, Red = bad matchup.
* The team in the Opponent column is who plays the team on the left this week.
* The teams in the Prev 3 Opponents column are the teams that the team on the left has played in the last 3 weeks.
* The team in the Opponent column is who plays the team on the left this week.
* The team in the Next Opponent column is who plays the team on the left next week.
* Teams with a bye in the last 3 weeks will look back a 4th week to capture 3 games worth of data.

Please keep in mind that D/ST Data will likely be different due to varied league settings.

Also, some have asked for the ability to sort by position, so [here's a link to the data in a Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uYjQkCLPh-AufIkJyvd7EYrad_2LWkebyLEHHZIle2k/edit?usp=sharing).

Best Unrostered Team - Week 9 2024,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gkd0os/best_unrostered_team_week_9_2024/,1gkd0os,fritothedog,"This is the best lineup using players rostered in 5% of leagues or less according to Yahoo. I will do it with 0.5ppr scoring rules.

|POS|PLAYER - TEAM|ROSTERED%|OPPONENT|SCORE
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|QB|Mason Rudolph - TEN|1%|vs NE|18.5
|RB|Emari Demercado - ARI|0%|vs CHI|15

|TE|Josh Oliver - MIN|0%|vs IND|14.3
|FLEX|Theo Johnson - NYG|1%|vs WAS|12.6
|D/ST|Arizona Cardinals|3%|vs CHI|12
|K|Chad Ryland - ARI|2%|vs CHI|11

This team is available in between 88.55% and 96% of leagues and would've scored 119.9 points. The team doesn‚Äôt change if you increase the threshold to 10% this week.

I thought Levis would be back this week but it was another week of **Mason Rudolph,** who continues the holiday festivities by staying on top of the unrostered team. Rudolph led the Titans to an OT win over the Patriots.The Titans face the Chargers next week so whoever starts will likely have a rough go.

The Cardinals handled the Bears pretty easily. **Emari Demercado** and Trey Benson both got in on the fun. Both scored and Benson actually out-snapped Demercado (28% to 24%), but Demercado gained more yards and an extra target. I saw many people pick up Benson in case Conner goes down. While that is a good idea, I think Demercado could have value in that case as well. 

**Samaje Perine** joins Rudolph in going back-to-back. He returned a much better performance than his 4 points last week as well. The Chiefs are using Perine as a pass catcher, he only ran once but he caught 4 of 5 targets compared to Hunt‚Äôs 1 catch on 1 target. Perine hit paydirt on one of those catches and could retain that role even when Pacheco returns. 

**Nick Westbrook-Ikhine** played 97% of snaps and turned 6 targets into 5 catches for 50 yards and a touchdown. Ikhine has flashed at times but he is now getting more consistent work than he has in his career. With Hopkins catching TDs from Mahomes, NWI has more target opportunities. Again, probably best left on waivers ahead of the Chargers game but his usage is encouraging. 

The Bills are a good offense so anyone can flash any week. **Mack Hollins** has a history of making the unrostered team once and disappearing the rest of the year. Hollins will likely be more viable in any games Cooper misses but I suspect we will see more and more of Cooper and Hollins will remain behind Shakir and Coleman as well. 

A week after National Tight End Day two TEs make the unrostered team. **Josh Oliver** took advantage of Hockenson still ramping up. Oliver played 56% of snaps compared to Hock‚Äôs 45%. Hockenson did take a shot and I think that may have changed the plan for his work load but I have not heard any reports confirming that. 

Tight end **Theo Johnson** joins the squad in the flex spot. The Giants rookie has been garnering a lot of playing time all year, never slipping below 71% and averaging 84%. This week he had the most targets he‚Äôs seen in a game, that trend could continue against the Panthers next week. 

As stated before, the **Cardinals** handled the Bears easily, winning 29-9. Not only did their RB3 make the unrostered squad, the defense and kicker also join the squad. As an aside, all three outscored the Cards QB. **Chad Ryland** hit a 55 yarder as well as a short field goal and a few extra points on his way to the 4th best kicking performance this week. The Cardinals seem to be finding their groove and could be a solid team down the stretch. They are currently sitting atop the NFC West.

This team was available in between 86.75% and 96% of leagues and would've scored 61.66 points.

u/HotDonkus took the top spot in their first attempt. As soon as I saw the **Emari Demercado** I knew that was a good call. It turned out even better than I expected.  **Westbrook-Ikhine** was another great call. He could be viable going forward. The **Cardinals** defense was the last correct guess. 

Parker Washington is still an interesting name. He saw 6 targets and 85% of snaps. He should be involved the rest of the way with Kirk out. Coker is intriguing as well, unfortunately his snap share dropped to 45%, even more odd considering the Diontae Johnson trade.

u/Kezzup got **Demercado,** , **NWI**, and **Chad Ryland** correct. 

Gardner Minshew let us all down, he was the most guessed QB this week. No one guessed Rudolph.

u/OhKayGetAwayFromMe finds themselves at the bottom again. I guess they join Mason Rudolph and Samaje Perine in going back to back, silver linings you know? The **Cardinals** D was once again a correct guess, they were the most guessed defense this week.

Boutte will likely make this squad again. AJ Barner has a shot too. I think the Metchie hype is officially over, unfortunately. 

Who are you targeting on waivers? Samaje Perine, Theo Johnson, and Westbrook-Ikhine seem like they could be decent pickups. I would love to have you join me in guessing on Thursday.",2024-11-05 18:04:54,5,fantasyfootball
Add These 13 Players In Week 10 + Injury Report,739,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gkcv9j/add_these_13_players_in_week_10_injury_report/,1gkcv9j,movesfantasy,"Hey everyone, I wrote up the following as my first piece of fantasy football content. Let me know what you think, and I hope it helps!

**Injury Report**

*New Injuries*

**WR Chris Olave** (concussion) - Olave suffered the fourth concussion of his NFL career and his second this season. I‚Äôd expect him to miss Week 10 at a minimum with a potential multi-week absence. Note that the Saints have a Week 12 bye - Olave could be held out until Week 13 or longer.

**QB Dak Prescott** (hamstring) - Likely to be placed on IR, will miss at least four weeks.

**WR Drake London** (hip) - London suffered a hip pointer and an oblique strain. It isn‚Äôt believed to be serious and he could suit up as early as Week 10.

**WR AJ Brown** (knee) - No structural issues, more of a contusion - he could play as early as Week 10.

**WR CeeDee Lamb** (shoulder) - Sprained AC joint, not considered serious, could play in Week 10.

**WR Darius Slayton** (concussion) - In concussion protocol, typically miss one game or so.

**WR Keon Coleman** (wrist) - Waiting for news.

**QB Caleb Williams** (lower body) - Will likely be fine for Week 10.

*Existing Injury Updates*

**RB Zack Moss** (neck) - expected to miss rest of regular season.

**WR Nico Collins** (hamstring) - eligible to return this week, no update yet.

**RB Christian McCaffrey** (achilles) - back at practice and trending towards playing this week .

**Waiver Wire Week 10**

**Quarterbacks**

1. **Drake Maye** \- In the three full games Drake Maye has played, he has finished as the QB8, QB7, and QB 11, averaging 21.4 fantasy points per start. That would make him the overall QB6 across weeks 6, 7, and 9. With a season/career-high 95 rushing yards against the Titans in Week 9, Maye provides both a strong floor and enticing upside as a dual-threat quarterback.

**Running Backs**

1. **Ray Davis** \- We know that James Cook isn‚Äôt going anywhere. However, it‚Äôs that time of year where we want to roster high-upside handcuffs as the fantasy playoffs approach. Davis looked explosive this week, taking a checkdown pass 63 yards to the house, and we know what he is capable of (18.2 fantasy points in Week 6) were James Cook to go down.
2. **Trey Benson** \- Similar to fellow rookie RB Ray Davis‚Äô situation, Benson is unlikely to be startable in fantasy without an injury to James Conner. However, Benson is coming off the highest fantasy output of his young career (12.5 fantasy points), including scoring his first NFL TD from the one-yard line. It doesn‚Äôt hurt that the Cardinals have the most favorable fantasy playoff schedule for running backs. Stash him!
3. **Blake Corum** \- Kyren Williams leads all running backs in snap share with an outrageous 88% through 9 weeks. The next highest player at the position is Breece Hall with 76% - a 12% difference. Sean McVay loves to utilize a workhorse RB, and rookie third-round pick Corum is next in line were Kyren to miss time.
4. **Khalil Herbert** \- Herbert was traded to the Bengals this morning, and with Zack Moss expected to miss the remainder of the regular season, Herbert‚Äôs upside case is filling in as the 1B in Cincinnati‚Äôs backfield. Additionally, he would be the biggest beneficiary if Chase Brown were to miss any time.

**Wide Receivers**

1. **Elijah Moore** \- While his 5.8 point performance in Week 9 was disappointing, Moore still saw 8 targets (19% target share) this week after seeing 11 targets (30%) in Week 8. In the wake of Amari Cooper‚Äôs departure, Moore will continue to be valuable as long as Jameis Winston remains at quarterback. Cleveland has the 6th-highest pass rate over expectation in the league since Jameis took over.
2. **DeMario Douglas** \- In three full games played with Drake Maye, Douglas is averaging 7 targets - tied with Hunter Henry for the team lead. Based on how Douglas was utilized in Week 9, he had the 16th-most expected fantasy points among wide receivers. A bet on Douglas is a bet on his ascending rookie quarterback elevating the entire offense, and DeMario doesn‚Äôt have much to compete with at the WR position.
3. **Noah Brown** \- In Week 9, Brown led the Commanders in targets with 6 in a game where Jayden Daniels only attempted 22 passes, good for a 27.3% target share. Additionally, Brown posted a 76+% route share for the second straight week, an indication that he has cemented himself as the second option in Washington‚Äôs WR corps. While Terry McLaurin will typically see more than his 3 Week 9 targets, Brown offers access to a Washington offense scoring the 4th-most fantasy points per game.

**Tight Ends**

1. **Taysom Hill** \- Simply put, the Saints are low on weapons. Rasheed Shaheed is out for the year. Chris Olave will likely miss time with a concussion. Jamaal Williams is nursing a groin injury. And last but not least, running back Kendre Miller is on IR. In Week 9, Hill finished as the overall TE5, setting season-highs across the board in targets (5), receptions (4), and reception yards (41), with a rushing touchdown to boot. Expect his increased usage both on the ground and through the air to continue, especially while Olave remains out.
2. **Hunter Henry** \- In three full games played with Drake Maye, Henry is averaging 7 targets per game, tied for the team-high with DeMario Douglas. Additionally, based on how he has been utilized in those three games, Henry has the 4th-most expected fantasy points per game among tight ends, according to PFF. On an offense starving for production from their wide receivers, Henry‚Äôs strong usage should continue.
3. **Mike Gesicki** \- Gesicki set season-highs in route share (61%), air yards share (38%), and of course, fantasy points (27.0) in Week 9, and has shown the ability to capitalize on additional volume when given the opportunity. An important note, however, is that Tee Higgins‚Äô (quad) absence was the main factor in Gesicki‚Äôs expanded role - I wouldn‚Äôt expect him to be featured once Higgins returns. That being said, the Bengals just lost TE Erick All for the season, and next week, Gesicki faces a Ravens defense giving up the 7th-most fantasy points over expectation to tight ends. He would be a fine start in that spot were Higgins to miss another week.
4. **A.J. Barner** \- Based on his Week 9 usage, Seattle‚Äôs rookie tight end had the 7th-most expected fantasy points among tight ends, according to PFF. While he turned his 7 targets into just 4 catches for 27 yards, he posted the highest route share (86%) of any Seahawks TE this season. He may not be a special talent (his pro comp was Durham Smythe, per Player Profiler), but his role is worth stashing on your bench until we get a better idea of how long Noah Fant will be out.
5. **Theo Johnson** \- Johnson had his best performance of the season on Sunday, turning a season-high 6 targets into 3 catches for 51 yards and a touchdown. He trailed only Malik Nabers in target share with 23.1%, and had a 72.4% route share. Johnson has the 7th-highest athleticism score among 479 all-time tight ends analyzed by PlayerProfiler, and the Giants have the most favorable remaining schedule for tight ends rest of season.

**Notable Snubs**

* WR **Quentin Johnston** \- More than half of Johnston‚Äôs Week 9 receiving yards came on a 66-yard touchdown, and he‚Äôs had more than 5 targets in just one game this season. Johnston also had the second-most fantasy points over expected (+14.3) among WRs in Week 9. Additionally, per Ryan Heath of FantasyPoints, busted coverage plays account for 44% of Johnston‚Äôs 2024 fantasy output. QJ has flashed at times in Year 2, but his production has been too dependent on splash plays.
* WR **Demarcus Robinson** \- Robinson benefitted from Puka Nacua‚Äôs ejection on Sunday, but his four touchdowns over the past two games are fool‚Äôs gold. With Nacua and Kupp back and healthy, Robinson can not be trusted in fantasy lineups.
* TE **Jonnu Smith** \- Smith set a season-high in route share (83%) in Week 9 and turned 6 targets into a respectable 5 catches for 46 yards. However, I don‚Äôt see the upside for his role given where he stands behind Tyreek Hill, Jaylen Waddle, and De‚ÄôVon Achane in the target pecking order.
* WR **Jalen Coker** \- Coker took a step back in Week 9 as his route share dropped from 80% to 59% and he earned just 3 targets. Assuming Adam Thielen doesn‚Äôt get traded, his return is imminent, which is bad news for Coker‚Äôs role expanding. While Jonathan Mingo (targeted once in Week 9) was traded to the Cowboys, it‚Äôs hard for me to see Bryce Young supporting Coker in addition to Thielen and Legette on a weekly basis.
* TE **Ja‚ÄôTavion Sanders** \- In Week 9, Sanders generated the most receiving yards over expected in a game by a rookie tight end this season (+50) ,per Next Gen Stats. He also led the Panthers in receiving, catching 4 balls for 87 yards. However, he‚Äôs still contending with Tommy Tremble (when healthy) at the tight end position on a team quarterbacked by Bryce Young.
* RB **Jaylen Wright** \- While Wright has shown promise as a rookie, he is one Mostert or Achane injury away from a 1B role in Miami‚Äôs backfield. That role is valuable in an explosive offense like the Dolphins‚Äô, but I prefer the upside of guys like Davis, Corum, and Benson, who are one injury away from potential workhorse roles. If you have the bench space, however, he‚Äôs worth the stash.
* RB **Isaac Guerendo** \- With CMC trending towards a Week 10 return and Jordan Mason back at practice, it remains to be seen who the CMC backup to roster is. Until we have an answer, I prefer to roster guys like Davis, Corum, and Benson who have clear paths to workhorse roles.",2024-11-05 17:58:53,128,fantasyfootball

How it works: parent comment the name of a player you want feedback on. People respond to your comment with either Buy/Sell/Hold. Try to Ctrl/Cmd + F to find a player before posting a player name.

‚Ä¢ Buy- you think a players value will go up compared to trade market price currently

‚Ä¢ Hold- you think a players value will hold steady

‚Ä¢ Sell- you think a players value will go down but is worth trading away right now

‚Ä¢ Drop- you think this player is no longer worth owning

Reminder many people use buy and hold interchangeably. If you think a player is generally undervalued then he‚Äôs a buy not a hold. If a players value looks steady and valued correctly then he‚Äôs a hold not a buy/sell. Looking forward to helping each other out in this thread!

Week 10 Buy Low Candidates: Trade Deadline Edition,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gkbzau/week_10_buy_low_candidates_trade_deadline_edition/,1gkbzau,jalendepew,"**Buy Low Candidates for Week 10:**

Last week, I suggested Evan Engram, BTJ, Tank Dell, Nico Collins, DeAndre Hopkins and Travis Etienne Jr. as possible buy low/at cost candidates. I will explain how these options fared and an updated Buy, Hold, Sell or TBD rating depending on how last week looked under this week‚Äôs list.

1. **Drake London (ATL):** London only played 19% of snaps before being ruled out with a hip pointer on Sunday, following a poor performance against Tampa in Week 8. His status for week 10 is up in the air, but his schedule for the fantasy playoffs is absolutely beautiful and this is not expected to be a long-term injury.¬†

**OFFER:** Would absolutely throw an offer of someone like JSN, Terry McLaurin, or possibly Chase Brown if somebody is really high on him following his dominant performance, plus a WR3 or WR4.¬†

1. **Marvin Harrison Jr (ARI):** Marvin Harrison Jr is one of the more frustrating players of anyone drafted in the first two rounds without including injury. I would not be comfortable trading for him at a WR1 or even WR2 price tag. However, after he puts up 3.4 I would absolutely trade for him from an owner who is fed up with probably starting him when he‚Äôs been bad and benching him when he‚Äôs been excellent. Beyond the expectation of rookies improving as the season goes on, we also have amazing matchups against NE, CAR and LAR on the schedule in the fantasy playoffs. Not a start every week but when it‚Äôs time to win your league, this could easily change.¬†

**OFFER:** Try to send a higher floor, lower upside piece like Tony Pollard who has looked nice all year but will probably see Tyjae take some work when he returns.

1. **Tyreek Hill (MIA):** Tyreek has underwhelmed all year, but surprisingly he has also been uninspiring in the games Tua has played since returning from his concussion. The offense has still looked good, scoring 27 in both contests and Tyreek is a proven talent where we can expect positive regression. Get him now before his inevitable blowup against the Rams. Could easily finish Top 3 in PPG ROS at WR.

**OFFER:** I‚Äôm offering low-end WR1s or two WR2s for Hill.¬†

1. **Brian Thomas Jr (again, JAX):** Last week I said to buy Brian Thomas Jr. at a high-end WR2 price tag, which I felt was lower than his ceiling and worth it. Now I would advise to buy even more aggressively after he sees 91% of snaps and still only puts up 2 receptions for 22 yards. This was a bit of an odd contest where Jax only possessed the ball for 21:48, last in the entire NFL by over a minute, and Thomas didn‚Äôt practice fully all week with his injury.¬†

**OFFER:** I would bid aggressively now. Offer a middle-tier WR2, or an RB2 and a WR3-4. However, be willing to seemingly ‚Äúoverpay,‚Äù and you will likely come out ahead by season‚Äôs end.

1. **Breece Hall (NYJ):** Similar to London and Hill with having back-to-back disappointing weeks, Breece Hall has now had 4 contests under 10.6 PPR points. Some people may also be concerned about Braelon Allen‚Äôs usage, which I think is overblown given Breece still gets 19 opportunities to Allen‚Äôs 5 and still a 76% snap share. Also, he has been efficient this season in his usage against good matchups and I expect the Jets offense to improve to around average as Adams continues to get comfortable, raising his touchdown upside. Finally, Breece also has possibly the best RB playoff schedule of JAX, LAR, and BUF. Buy.¬†

**OFFER:** If someone really likes David Montgomery or Chase Brown I would send them with some depth options for Breece. Or possibly trade a player like Amon-Ra for Breece and another piece on this list if your team is struggling with injuries/depth.¬†

1. **Ceedee Lamb (DAL):** There is a wave of anxiety around Ceedee Lamb that is entirely understandable. Not bad enough that he has a sprained AC joint - although reports are optimistic that he will play - his pro bowl quarterback is likely to be placed on IR with a hamstring. Additionally, the Cowboys offense has looked dysfunctional pretty much all year and won‚Äôt look to have a sudden jolt with Cooper Rush at the helm. People are trying to get off of Ceedee now before he plays again just in case he stinks it up with Rush. I would absolutely be buying. In the 3 4th quarter drives that featured Rush, Ceedee was targeted 7 times including the 2-point conversion attempt. Ceedee has also seen some rushing usage in key situations, they clearly plan to lean on him especially with a backup QB. While he might not be a top 3 options every week with Rush, I still expect him to be a PPR hog like we‚Äôve seen with Nabers in NY despite another awful QB in Jones. Additionally, Dak will possibly be back for the fantasy playoffs when the Cowboys will have an amazing schedule of CAR, TB, and PHI. Buy now.¬†

**OFFER:** Sending my low-end RB1s or WR1s for him.¬†

Honorable Mentions: Kenneth Walker III, Mike Evans, Pacheco and Amari Cooper



**LAST WEEK‚ÄôS RECAP:**

1. **Engram (JAX):** BUY/HOLD Evan Engram gets you 10 targets and 11.5 PPR points, which you will absolutely take given how gross the tight end market, albeit improving, has looked this year. Would still try to acquire if able.
2. **Brian Thomas Jr (JAX):** **BUY IN HUGE BLINKING MASSIVE RED LETTERS** Even a BETTER buy low this week, given he played 91% of snaps and put up one of his worst performances of the year. Expect positive regression going forward as he gets to 100% health.
3. **Tank Dell (HOU): HOLD** Puts up a good, albeit not unbelievable PPR performance as the WR1 this week. Encouraging 9 targets though and 126 yards, matching and surpassing his season high respectively. Probably will not be able to get him for any significant discount as his value rest of season is a high-upside WR2 instead of the possible high-end WR3 he was valued at last week.
4. **Nico Collins (HOU): HOLD/TBD** I‚Äôd expect positive news about Collins‚Äô potential return this week so the window to acquire him is likely shut. However, there‚Äôs a small chance the Collins owner may be concerned about how CJ Stroud has looked this season, and may want to part for an asset like Nabers in which case I would still pull the trigger.¬†
5. **DeAndre Hopkins (KC): HOLD/SELL** Absolutely smashes on MNF, the window to buy low is slammed close.¬†
6. **Travis Etienne Jr. (JAX): BUY** Etienne was a longer-term buy low, I would still throw out a feeler after his lackluster performance. De‚ÄôErnest Johnson still had a 24% snap share which I‚Äôd expect Etienne to fully replace once he‚Äôs healthy. He will also have the more valuable 3rd down and redzone role.

I saw a post on here talking about week to week games some leagues play and was really leaning towards a blackjack game where each team picks a player ahead of time and try to get as close to 21 as possible.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Here's the Kicker -- Week 10 -- New Visualization Announced!,147,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gk8kud/heres_the_kicker_week_10_new_visualization/,1gk8kud,subvertadown,"\[Kicker Rankings below, and [DST post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gk669j/defensive_maneuvers_2024_week_10_subvertadown/)\]  Hi everyone! I don't remember when I last made an early-week version of Kickers.  Mostly I've done Thursday aggregate rankings in 2024.

But today I wanted to draw your attention to a new Kicker tool:

# Background

I've had this creation in the works for a long time.  In a way, it's the culmination of many various developments:

* **Last week**, I posted my most complete (and hopefully clearest) explanation of all the [considerations that go into the predictive modeling](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gge0c7/heres_the_kicker_midseason_explanation_of/).  Read it if you want to know the whole philosophy.
* **And back in week 3**, I'd made a post [explaining what variables determine likely field position for kicking](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1fjryti/heres_the_kicker_a_new_view_on_field_goal/).  Answering ""*which variables determine long kicks versus short kicks*?""

I think BOTH of these posts\^\^ provide some of the most super-interesting stuff to explore.  So I hope you didn't miss them.  (If you like the nerdier side of this stuff.)

# Situational Kicker Curves

And \^\^these two pieces of background bring us to this new visualization:  The whole purpose is to better communicate ""*What kind of situation the kicker is likely to see-- relative to the average kicker circumstance?*""

If you go to the [website front page now](https://subvertadown.com/), you can **freely browse images like the following for all kickers** (The top 8 are free on the front page):

[These new charts appear on the tool-tip, for all kickers.  It shows how much more likely a kicker is to be at each field position.](https://preview.redd.it/fo13mxc9b3zd1.jpg?width=4623&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6ee0b5d544b9b7c06859ebb9445d7bab6994d0ac)

I programmed the text explanations in the bullet-points, so they are auto-generated, to help you interpret the graph.

The example shown above is curvier than some others.  Here's how to read it, starting from left to right:

1. **Punts.** At the far left, the curve goes negative, which means this team is expected to punt less often than other teams.  All these are *for the current match.  Not necessarily for all games in the future.*
2. **Fourth downs.**  Next-- at about 55 yards-- there is a region labeled ""4th"", which means the models believe that this kicker's team will go-for-it-on-the-4th (not punt, and not take a long FG), at this section of the field.  The width of 4th down region is different for each kicker-- and for each matchup.
3. **Long Field Goals.** Then we come to FG range, and you can see that the curve bends to the positive.  The models think this kicker will have slightly *more chances* to take long kicks.  (Compared to the average kicker.)
4. **Short field goals.** Interestingly, for this example, the curve goes negative again.  That means the team is less likely to stop in the region of a 10-29 yard field goal, compared to the average kicker.  (That doesn't mean it won't happen-- in fact there's still a good chance of ending up there-- it just means it's more likely to happen for other kickers than this one.)
5. **RZ.** In this case it's weakly relevant due to point #4.  But again, the ""4th"" label means this team is expected more likely to go-for-it-on-the-4th (not take the FG), in cases when they end up a few yards shy of the end-zone.
6. **TDs and PATs.**  Finally, to the far right, the curve bends up in the end-zone, meaning this kicker should see slightly more PATs than the average.  (The occurrence of two point conversions is considered here too, by the way.)

# Background: Input data

At risk of repeating myself... Very many pieces go into all this, even though it comes out like a simplified picture.  **So a reminder, here are examples of some variables that I test for statistical significance (**[**original post here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gge0c7/heres_the_kicker_midseason_explanation_of/)**):**

* **TD- related**: Extra points, Missed XPs, Two-pt conversions.
* **FG-related**: Missed FGs, Overall volume, and by distances: 20yd FG, 30yd, 40yd, 50+.
* **Vegas lines**: Own team implied score, and opponent implied score.
* **Conditions**: Wind, Grass/turf, Dome/outdoors, Rain, Snow, Home/away, Mondays, Thursdays.
* **Team defense**: rushing yards allowed, interceptions, early game points allowed, forced fumbles
* **Team offense**: Pace of game, Passing efficiency, QB rushing, 1st-quarter scoring, RZ
* **Opponent**: Division, Playoff chances, Drive success rate, allowed rushing yards, RZ%-allowed scoring.
* **A lot of other**: rushing or receiving volumes and efficiencies, sacks, turnovers, etc.
* **And yes**: Fourth downs.

# What about ""Why so high / why so low?""

The new Situational Kicker Curve tool above is something ***calculated*** *from primary inputs*.  In contrast, the ""Why so high / why so low"" tool usually identifies those primary ***inputs***.  The inputs feed into making that the curve.  (And, of course, the resulting curve helps to describe the expected fantasy points).  So the two tools are not redundant-- they work together.

# Kickers for Week 10

To celebrate this milestone-- meaning a tool that I will personally enjoy even if nobody else does!-- I will break from tradition of not ordering kickers here on Reddit.  So for this week, here is a list of the current (Tuesday)  rankings:

|Kickers in week 10|
|:-|
|Koo (frustrating)|
|Elliott (also frustrating)|
|Bass|
|~~Reichard~~ (O)|
|Tucker|
|Bates|
|SF kicker (Carlson or Moody)|
|Butker|
|Seibert|

I hope you can tell, I've always really like sharing things, so I'm happy to be able to share this before we add some restrictions to the site next week  (some content to be locked-- [Reasons due to my situation, which I posted at my private channel here](https://www.reddit.com/user/subvertadown/comments/1ginker/the_subvertadown_site_a_couple_additions_and_also/)).    So hopefully you'll enjoy this as much as I will.  I'll be interested in your feedback-- There are kinks to iron out, but overall I hope it helps your decision-making process.  For me, that's what it's all about!

Good luck.

What to do with Nick Chubb,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gk6rxp/what_to_do_with_nick_chubb/,1gk6rxp,Sea_Fun4726,"After holding Nick Chubb through the first six weeks, Chubb has went

-11 for 22 yards & a TD vs the bengals

-16 for 52 yards vs the ravens

-15 for 39 yards vs the chargers

Most people probably have expected a slow start coming back from an injury, but with his upcoming schedule is he someone you would consider dropping if you needed to pick someone up? The browns offense has been terrible this year and is currently the 31st ranked offense and his upcoming schedule is BYE, NO, PIT, DEN, PIT, KC, CIN, MIA. During that time only the NO and MIA games are arguably good matchups. What are you doing with Chubb going forward?",2024-11-05 13:34:20,56,fantasyfootball

Defensive Maneuvers -- 2024 Week 10 -- Subvertadown Early D/ST Picks,143,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gk669j/defensive_maneuvers_2024_week_10_subvertadown/,1gk669j,subvertadown,"\[[Post about kickers here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gk8kud/heres_the_kicker_week_10_new_visualization/)\]

Let's continue the debate and deliberations of our D/ST options!

.

# Last week¬†

Frankly, week 9 felt like the letdown that many of us sensed:  3 busts near the top!

Saints had already fallen naturally in the rankings (CB injuries), but the biggest surprise was the Chiefs not coming through in MNF.  Well done if you chose the Chargers.  We should have heeded the comment that one of you left on the website: ""Hard to believe they're \[Chargers\] so low... Winston is going to come back to earth this week"".  Prescient.

.

# Pick6x6¬†

We had¬†**69**¬†votes last week. ¬†[Don't forget to cast your week 10 picks here!](https://subvertadown.com/pick-six-by-six/2024/10)

# Defensive Maneuvers -- Week 10 Tiers¬†

There seems to be a good mix this week.  We have some standout options, then some less uncertain picks that are worthy of discussion.

|Tier|Why so high?|Why so low?|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1 - Chargers vs. Titans|Pros: Vegas implied score, QB Interceptions|Cons: Yards allowed, Def. Interceptions|
|1 - Bears vs. Patriots|Pros: Vegas implied score, Yards allowed|Cons: Opposing QB, Yards allowed|
|2 - Chiefs vs. Broncos|Pros: Vegas implied score, Yards allowed|Cons: QB Interceptions|
|2 - Eagles @ Cowboys|Pros: Vegas implied score, Opposing QB change|Cons: Def. Interceptions, Yards allowed|
|2 - Giants @ Panthers|Pros: Vegas implied score, QB Interceptions|Cons: Def. Interceptions, Yards allowed|
|2 - Vikings @ Jaguars|Pros: Vegas implied score, Def. Interceptions|Cons: QB Interceptions, Yards allowed|
|2 - Falcons @ Saints|Pros: Vegas implied score, Yards allowed|Cons: Yards allowed|
|3 - 49ers @ Buccaneers|Pros: Vegas implied score, Yards allowed|Cons:  QB Interceptions|
|3 - Bills @ Colts - Lower in ESPN|Pros: Opposing QB, QB Interceptions|Cons: Opposing QB change, Yards allowed|
|3 - Patriots @ Bears|Pros: QB Interceptions, Yards allowed|Cons: Def. Interceptions, Vegas implied score|
|3 - Lions @ Texans - Lower in ESPN|Pros: Sacks, Yards allowed|Cons: QB Interceptions, Vegas implied score|

As before, D/STs are in tiers, as sorted by an algorithm-- to provide early-Tuesday rankings. The rankings are for Yahoo scoring, and any significant deviations for ESPN scoring are indicated.  The ""pros/cons"" categories are just quick and dirty simplifications of the website tool.

Remember this is just a Tuesday **preview**, serving to help discussion and thoughts for waivers tonight. Always expect the D/ST rankings to shift during week. At the moment you can still¬†[check the website](https://subvertadown.com/weekly/defense)¬†for the most up-to-date model projections.  (Sorry that might not be the case next week, [as described here](https://www.reddit.com/user/subvertadown/comments/1ginker/the_subvertadown_site_a_couple_additions_and_also/). I would much prefer to keep it up!)

.

Good luck!

We've already seen some big names moved in the last few weeks. Maybe wait to cut a fringe player that could be in a new situation by the end of the day (i.e. Nuk a couple weeks ago). 

Potentially try to sell high on players that may be getting competition soon (i.e. Otton üêê or Pickens). 

Not everyone is paying attention to the fact the deadline is today, so you may be able to take advantage. At the very least, try your best to wait until the dust settles to make any rash decisions.",2024-11-05 12:06:41,146,fantasyfootball

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Hunt has been a beast and Pacheco coming off broken leg‚Ä¶ how soon would they really turn the keys back over to Pacheco?

From a production standpoint I fear Hunt fades, even if he is still utilized in a committee. I suppose the hope is that Hunt is the one getting goal line carries.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Jayden Reed catch* at end of first half?,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gjj1j9/jayden_reed_catch_at_end_of_first_half/,1gjj1j9,henny_on_da_rocks,"Not sure if this is allowed, but it didn't seem to be against the rules so I figured I'd ask: Did the Jayden Reed catch at the end of the first half of GB/DET get confirmed to be a catch anywhere? The broadcast never showed a replay and it looked like it hit the ground? It was like a \~50 yard catch and then the clock for the half expired.

Does the NFL review stuff like that and take away the catch if they determine it wasn't or is it just a non-issue because it was inconsequential to the game? Feels like it could be a pretty major stat correction if they do take it away

  
**EDIT:** This guy found a replay that's pretty clearly ruling it a catch on the field so question has been answered, thanks u/[rvH3Ah8zFtRX](https://www.reddit.com/user/rvH3Ah8zFtRX/): 

""I'm not sure why the NFL uploaded the video in stupid 4:3, but you can clearly see the ref signal that Reed was down where he caught it:

>When the receiver of a lateral is beyond the line of scrimmage, or if there is no line of scrimmage, it is his position that determines the yardage gained by each of the individuals involved. The player who throws the lateral is credited with yards gained only to the point at which the lateral is caught, provided this point is behind the spot from which the lateral is thrown.

>Example: Second-and-20 on own 20-yard line. Player catches a forward pass at his own 40, then attempts to lateral to a teammate who is at the 38. The teammate then:

>(a) Catches the ball and is downed at the 38. Scoring: First player gets one reception for 18 yards.

>(b) Catches the ball and runs to the 45. Scoring: First player gets one reception for 18 yards; second player gets 7 yards in pass receiving category, but is not credited with a reception. Credit a first down passing.

>(c) Muffs the ball and an opponent recovers on the 33. Scoring: First player gets one reception for 13 yards and a fumble. Opponent gets a fumble recovery.


The [NFL Gamebook (.pdf) records the play thusly](https://static.www.nfl.com/gamecenter/ae9ce486-1312-11ef-afd1-646009f18b2e.pdf): ""1-10-MIA-30:  T.Tagovailoa pass short right to D.Achane to MIA 29 for -1 yards. Lateral to J.Waddle to MIA 6 for -23 yards (G.Rousseau).""

And that tracks -- even though Achane advanced to the 33, he is credited with a 1-yard loss because the 29 is where Waddle received the lateral.  His yards are receiving yards because the play started with a forward pass, and he loses what he lost.

Folks, do bookmark that¬†[Statisticians Guide.](https://www.nflgsis.com/gsis/documentation/stadiumguides/guide_for_statisticians.pdf)¬†When someone in your league is whining about a QB tackle behind the line of scrimmage which ""should have been"" a sack, the answer's right there.",2024-11-04 15:17:02,141,fantasyfootball

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Is it a risk to roster elite fantasy options on teams that likely aren't headed to the playoffs?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gixbrw/is_it_a_risk_to_roster_elite_fantasy_options_on/,1gixbrw,ponderingorangutan,"For instance, the Miami Dolphins are loaded with elite fantasy options but likely won't have a lot to play for soon. The worry is that if one of their superstars, like Hill or Achane gets hurt, they could choose to just sit them out the rest of the season regardless of if it's a season ending injury because there's no point in bringing them back. Maybe I'm still scarred from the 2020 Joe Mixon day-to-day injury that ended up being season ending, but this is a concern that pops up for me every year. Thoughts?

As such, I do a lot of reading from various websites. Having no knowledge of the players or other such instincts, when faced with a ""do I or don't I"" decision, I will more heavily weigh the opinions of the experts.  Often, I end up regretting it.  For example, this week multiple sites and experts said that Zay Flowers' production will be limited with the addition of Johnson to the roster, and that the Broncos' Suritan would shadow him and lock him down. So, mourn me fellow managers, because I benched him. At the half, he already has 30fpts.

Jauan Jennings (58% owned in ESPN leagues) and Ricky Pearsall (19% owned); both on BYE this week. Who has more value going forward with Aiyuk done for the year?,173,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gio6hm/jauan_jennings_58_owned_in_espn_leagues_and_ricky/,1gio6hm,2021darkmosssxp,"There's a good chance one or both are available in your league given the bye week.

Jennings was a 7th round pick in 2020.

Pearsall was a 1st round pick this year.

We haven't seen much of Pearsall since he missed the first 6 games of the season.

We also haven't seen a single game yet where both of them played (Jennings missed weeks 7 and 8), so it's not clear how they'll be used going forward.

I think it's most likely Deebo, Jennings and Pearsall will be the 3 starting WRs for the 49ers; just unclear which of the latter 2 will have more value going forward.

Is Jennings JAG who had one outlier game? He's been underwhelming in 5 of 6 games, and the one great game he had was with Deebo out.

What do you think?

Posting this because I am sure there are others out there who are curious and may have someone on their bench worth dumping for one of these two before their bench players get locked today.",2024-11-03 14:33:28,111,fantasyfootball

Know Your Weather - Week 9,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1ginklo/know_your_weather_week_9/,1ginklo,Mortiegama,"**Lions @ Packers:** This is going to be some decent rains, wet field, and high winds! It could cause a hit to the passing game, but this still plays to be a major battle! The Vegas over is still 47.5 so unless you have someone that is ranked directly behind any of your Lions or Packers players, I wouldn't pivot.

**Buccaneers @ Chiefs:** Another good shot at rain, though being so far out things could change a lot before then. With the winds not playing into this as much, shouldn't downgrade much here.

FGB's Week 9 Flex Projections - Sunday Update,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gin3x0/fgbs_week_9_flex_projections_sunday_update/,1gin3x0,FantasyGoldenBoy,"# Week 9 Flex Projections

**Weather**

GB vs DET is going to be nasty, high winds and a lot of rain at some points.  The passing attack for those teams has been reduced, mostly in the high aDOT area.  The only other weather issue is maybe a little wind in NE vs TEN but as of now it's not high enough to effect anything.

**Biggest Difference vs Consensus Projections**

* **T.J. Hockenson** (10.3, +2.87 vs ECP) - I choose to believe Hock will be back with no limits.  The Colts defense is a solid match up and Indy plays super fast so Minnesota should get a lot of plays in.  As long as the Colts can look decent on offense, which they have with Flacco, I think Hockenson is in for a good game.
* **Amon-Ra St. Brown** (11.3, -3.03 vs ECP) - This is mostly because of the weather but also a bit due to the Detroit offense.  His role has changed from last year and many of the High Value Plays I look for to project TDs have been taken on by other positions.  Also GB and DET are both in the lower third of pace of play, if this game is sloppy and run heavy on both ends I think ARSB's ceiling is limited.

Injuries should all be up to date based on current Projected Lineups.  Doubtful is considered Out and Questionable with no flagged phrases is considered in.  I do not have any inside information, inactives/actives are all based on Rotogrinders expected lineups and ESPN injury reports. I will try to update the rankings below when the game time decisions are made but the¬†[website](http://www.fantasygoldenboy.com/)¬†will be quicker to update, as well as having a Range Plot view showing upside/downside, Full PPR/STD rankings, positional rankings and deeper rankings.  Any changes between Thursday and today will most likely be due to Offensive/Defensive injury updates, weather or betting lines changing, I rarely do major changes to the model mid-week. Feel free to ask any questions or leave any criticisms. Thanks for reading and good luck.

A quick breakdown of some of the more important variables that go into the projections.

Questions about Collusion, How Waivers Work, Stat corrections, League Scoring, etc. all belong here. Any commissioner question on how to handle a situation in your league belongs here. 

Any simple fantasy football question, especially when you are looking for a quick answer rather than a discussion, usually does not deserve its own thread and should be posted here. Occasionally a platform's customer care department, such as u/YahooFantasyCare may be available to address your questions directly in this thread.  

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR SIMPLE QUESTIONS or LEAGUE ISSUE POSTS**

* Detailed explanation of the issue (collusion, rules question, changing settings, collecting buy-ins, etc), parties involved, waiver settings, etc. 
* Specific scoring rules (PPR, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
*  Anything else you may think is helpful        

______

**Remember**: Most answers to simple questions and league questions don't change from year to year. How much has changed in collecting dues in the 2 years? We encourage you to **use the [search](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=collect+dues&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)** function for questions like this.

Hes tied with nabers for the most catchable targets per game when Flacco is under center.

The other Recievers that rank top 10 in catchable targets per game include: 
Kupp, Godwin, Lamb, G Wilson, Nico, Chase, JJ & London.  

In his last 9 games (Cle & Ind) Flacco leads the NFL in passing touchdowns per game at 2.2.

Downs is 17th is YAC per game, has also been a great separator so far this season.

Week 10 Waiver Wire Additions *EARLY* from Kevin Tompkins,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gi7kb4/week_10_waiver_wire_additions_early_from_kevin/,1gi7kb4,NatePolvogt,"This season has been a struggle for us fantasy managers, and combing the waiver wire every week has felt depressing, if we're being honest.

***Stay ahead of your league mates with these Week 10 Waiver Wire targets a week early.***

# Elijah Moore (WR ‚Äì CLE)

***ESPN Rostership (7.1%)***

Moving to Moore, he‚Äôs been a forgotten-about slot man for the Browns this season. He has run between 60-70 percent of routes and has done it with no fanfare. Enter Winston‚Äôs aggressive arm and a renewed optimism, and Moore is back in the limelight. Not only that but being used downfield too. Moore‚Äôs 9.2-yard¬†[aDOT](https://optimusfantasy.com/fantasy-football-terms-101/)¬†is a far cry from his 5.7-yard aDOT the previous seven weeks of the season, and he took 26 percent of the air yards en route to an 8-85 game on 12 targets, a 32 percent target share.

That‚Äôs also 29 percent of the team‚Äôs first-read targets as well, a clear sign of not only Winston‚Äôs intent on targeting a player but offensive coordinator Ken Dorsey‚Äôs intent as a play-caller to call plays, with Moore being the first read for Winston.

Player Projections Powered by Vegas Player Props - Week 9,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gi6htt/player_projections_powered_by_vegas_player_props/,1gi6htt,MundaneNumber,"Angles and curves.¬† At its core, football can be broken down to physics and geometry.¬† We have Derrick Henry running through you with Bucky Irving repeatedly cutting back across the entire field.¬† What is a route other than a redirection angle.¬† Space and volume.¬† Within music, the absence of sound is arguably more important than moments saturated with sound.¬† Paralleled with the NFL as players on offense have a primary objective to fill empty space through avoiding defenders.¬† Legitimately every physical sport and virtual esport are predicated by human beings attempting to find the ""best"" angles and curves.¬† Maybe even the root of life in itself.¬†

Another fresh wave of data points from last week, obviously some more telling than others.¬† I just traded Devonta Smith for Ladd McConkey and Josh Downs, due to a firm belief in the significance of their week 8 performances,¬†and Flacco's¬†immortality.¬† Back to the main objective, we are purely focused on predicting week 9's outcome.¬† Does data from week 1 and 2 even matter anymore?¬† You need to be constantly devaluing fantasy data, as time goes on.¬† As you delve deeper into the past, each week's data becomes increasingly less significant for fantasy purposes.¬† Yet, Alvin Kamara's 43 point week 2 performance isn't even his career ceiling.¬† I'd imagine¬†*that*¬†43 has significance.¬† One above 42 the meaning of life, as the supercomputer from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy would claim.¬†

Forget about making these significance estimates on your own.¬†¬†[VegasProjections.com](http://vegasprojections.com/)¬†has weekly median projections dictated by advanced math models factoring in nearly every aspect/angle we aren't aware of.¬† In evidence of a stronger system that outperforms Vegas's models, a rapid adjustment mechanism guarantees restoration of profitability equilibrium.¬† The primary driving force behind the lucrativity of sportsbooks.¬†¬†

Top 26 rated skill players\*\* this week include:

1. Kyren Williams¬†16.24
2. Alvin Kamara¬†16.08
3. Joe Mixon 16.06

\*\*Derrick Henry is missing his reception prop but is at 13.75 without it.¬† Ja'Marr as well at 11.85.¬† All values except Aaron Jones and Kenneth Walker are from consensus projections.¬†

This week we see that Kyler has risen to elite orange status, regardless of the new Call of Duty release.¬† A potential under bet?¬† Given his history of failure post Call of Duty release.¬† Mahomes is flying up the rankings, making us question if the old Patty is back (in terms of fantasy value).¬† While the Kansas City defense rightfully has stifled Baker's value.¬† At the top of the board¬†is a¬†large grouping of elite running backs with similar monster 16 point projections, causing no running back to have¬†a red valuation (colors are determined by percentile within players on the current page).¬† You may want to prioritize efforts to acquire anyone in this grouping, an epiphany I recently reached, or else fall behind.¬† The top five running backs all outproject¬†the top WR with CeeDee at 15.71.¬† Having an elite reciever at this moment is an extreme positional advantage (in no order CeeDee, JJ, ARSB, AJB, Malik, Ja'Marr).¬†¬†If you're wondering what Vegas thinks about Diontae's value in Baltimore, they're clueless as well.¬†¬†Kelce might be his old self again, and Njoku is apparently reaching his potential.¬†¬†

As always, thank you all for the support.¬† Incredibly, out of over 300 hits to the sportsbook affiliate link, not a single person¬†has actually made an account.¬† Kudos, as I repeatedly stress to be careful betting against Vegas.¬†I just have the link there¬†so that the occasional individual refusing to acknowledge the site figure's veracity has an easy outlet to put their money where their mouth is.¬† Which I respect, as long as you have strong statistical data or historic¬†accuracy backing up your wagers.¬† Test your systems on the past 8 weeks for concept validation.¬†¬†Vegas is not perfect, and if you are determined enough, you can find profitable edges.¬† Yet be warned, sportsbooks notoriously cheat by limiting super profitable customers, so mastery of sportsbetting¬†goes hand in hand with a life of rotating¬†sportsbooks¬†worldwide, through a wide array of devious techniques.¬†

As a final reminder, remember these are median projections, not mean projections.¬† Mentally elevate values on players¬†with higher ceilings, as outliers are not captured in the median as much as the mean, which is the true score projection.",2024-11-02 21:09:09,38,fantasyfootball

As a level set, here are the features we have to date - we have a ton we want to put into the app and would appreciate any feedback on prioritizing.¬†(*I've added a* [*couple screenshots here*](https://imgur.com/a/OZRSzHg) *so you don't have to download to see what I'm referring to*)

**Current Run Pass Optics features:**

* **Normalized Predicted Player Stats** ‚Äì 18 machine learning models under the hood to create 0-100 predictions for projections, yards, touchdowns, opportunities (model per stat). This is used on all layers of the app.
* **Matchup Summary ‚Äì** *One of our favorites*, Shows the offense dimensions against the opposing team‚Äôs dimensions and DEF rating. (We‚Äôve had great luck with this showing where stacks live and predicting game outcomes with this table)
* **Swipe to Select ‚Äì** Selection ability at team, offense component, and player level:
   * **Team ‚Äì** selects QB1, RB1, WR1, WR2, WR3, TE1 puts into player pool
   * **Component ‚Äì** selects underlying players (ex: REC = WR1, WR2, WR3) into pool
   * **Player ‚Äì** select individual player (selections flow up and down the layers)
* **Slate & Position Filtering ‚Äì** Select/Deselect day or position type
* **Selection Buckets ‚Äì** The app lets users select players into the buckets RPO (default), DFS, Props, and Waiver (intended to help categorize players by use)
* **Player Detail (Click name) ‚Äì** RPO stats including consolidated YTdOT which combines a quick view of Yards, Touchdowns, Opportunities, and Touches for last three games. Also shows percentile ranking, against DEF stats, draftkings and fanduel salaries, variance, opposing def against position. *Another one of our favorites* ‚Äì production AGAINST the opposing defense last 3 games showing pass and run delineation.¬†

**What we are considering adding (added numbering for referencing):**

**#1.   Changing Stat Scoring to Stat Predictions (**[recently put output of this on tik tok](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP88EonsK/)**) ‚Äì** We‚Äôve been predicting actual stats using our models with pretty good accuracy. We feel like this reduces simplicity of analysis compared to 0-100 scoring but we know it would be useful for picks/props. (Think seeing actual TD prediction instead of 0-100 scoring potential).

**#2.**   [Production against 9-Box](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gcqmcu/nfl_receiver_9box_heatmap_week_8_r_visualizations/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) **‚Äì** see digest here, we‚Äôve leveled this up a bit since the post and it‚Äôs creating interesting views.

**#3.   Add More Player Detail Stats ‚Äì** we‚Äôve found ourselves wanting things like target share, airyards, total team scoring last three, information about players on the team, information about coverage, etc.

**#4.   Live stat/injury/news/weather data ‚Äì** we are working on the API infrastructure for this, but since it‚Äôs available in so many other apps it feels like we want deeper analytics over duplicative content. But we know it‚Äôs currently annoying for things like IR players showing up because they were on the roster when we ran the models.

**#5.   Player Pick Recommendations ‚Äì** this one is a decent amount of work, but we know the analysis without clear ""who to pick"" can still be dense, even with the 0 to 100 scoring. Think a swipe up menu where it shows you top 3 RPO plays relative to the format you are looking at.

**#6.   Team Detail Pop-up (Click team) ‚Äì** a view to see players underlying a team and associated stats. Would show rolling team production, and potentially which players in that team you have selected. We think this could facilitate team level pick‚Äôems/bets.

**#7.    DFS/Props/Waiver Helper Swipe Ups ‚Äì** supplemental swipe up tools to help execute picks. Think prop builder for constructing props or a DFS lineup workbench in the app.

We are two guys + a developer doing this as a hobby project, so any thoughts are welcome on how to spread our capacity. Feel free to give current app input as well if you are a user!

Defensive Backs Height: Does It Matter? A Comprehensive Analysis,0,https://brainyballers.com/defensive-back-height-does-it-matter-a-comprehensive-analysis/,1gi3fcj,Zachr08,"The ‚ÄúDoes It Matter?‚Äù Series is back! Last week we looked at [RB‚Äôs Draft Capital](https://www.reddit.com/r/DynastyFF/s/nOY80Tx5Q9) to find whether that affects performance. For part 29 of ‚ÄúDoes It Matter?‚Äù we looked at Defensive Back height.

Next week‚Äôs topic: Defensive Backs Weight

TL;DR: 5‚Äô10-3/8‚Äù and above is a threshold that occurs at a 14.2% higher frequency in the top 10 versus the bottom 10 since 2003. Further, there is no correlation between DB Height and success in regards to Fantasy Football production using standard statistical methods.

"Hi, I'm Chris Dell. I was the fantasy football industry's #1 most accurate ranker in 2023 (FantasyPros). I'm also #1 for QB, #1 for DST and #4 for RB in 2024. AMA!",1312,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gi2ovc/hi_im_chris_dell_i_was_the_fantasy_football/,1gi2ovc,ChrisDellFantasy,"Hi everyone! Chris Dell here. I won first place out of 235 an¬≠a¬≠lysts in the Fan¬≠ta¬≠syPros‚Äô 2023 Fan¬≠tasy Foot¬≠ball NFL Draft Ac¬≠cu¬≠racy rank¬≠ings com¬≠pe¬≠ti¬≠tion. I'm also currently the #1 ranker for QB, #1 for DST, #4 for RB and #6 overall out of 175+ analysts in the FantasyPros' 2024 in-season NFL accuracy rankings. I'm here to help answer any and all questions you have: Week 9 starts, sits, streamers and stashes, as well as rest of season rankings and trade advice, or anything else you want to know about the sports media/fantasy football industry, etc etc. I currently own and operate [BettingPredators.com](http://BettingPredators.com) (BASED ON THE MOVIE, NOT THE HANSEN SHOW LOL), where I focus on fantasy football content and NFL player props, as well as prop betting for NBA and golf. I'm also the sports editor at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and have worked in the sports media industry now for 20+ years. I'm currently based in Pittsburgh, PA.

My journey into the fantasy football space is a bit more unconventional than most. I started in 2003 as a sophomore in high school/15-year-old kid covering sports for the Sarasota Herald-Tribune in Southwest, FL. My father, now retired, helped me start early in the newspaper business. He covered the NFL and all levels of sports reporting for decades since the 1970s, and over the years, I wrote for various outlets such as the New York Times, NY Daily News, ESPN .com, Yahoo!'s Rivals .com and many many others before pivoting to more of an editor/managerial role and eventually launching my own media platforms soon after.

I spent 10 years at the Herald-Tribune, a former New York Times-owned media outlet, before moving to NYC in 2012 to pursue my master's degree in entrepreneurial journalism. From 2012 to 2022, my life took many twists and turns. I built and launched a sports app with funding from Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert, as well as built and launched a sports website for famous sports bettor and philanthropist 'Mattress Mack.' During that time, I also worked in marketing, consulting and web/app design, collaborating with some really cool clients like NYC mayor Eric Adams and others in the music/hip-hop industry space as well.

In 2020, during COVID, I had some downtime and built the Betting Predators platform with some professional handicappers in Las Vegas. It's been a passion/side project of mine over the years. Over the past year, I've poured much more time into honing my specialties of fantasy football analysis and player prop betting/**producing the following weekly content**:

Outside of the sports/fantasy world, it's me and wifey up here in Pittsburgh. Most of family is either in Florida or Colombia (my mom is from Bogota). Her family is mainly from Belize/Guatemala, where we're taking a trip for Christmas this year. No kids (yet) and we're taking our time there (too much fantasy to analyze lol). My favorite teams to root for (unfortunately) are the University of South Florida Bulls (my alma mater), Colombian national soccer team (my first love), the Orlando Magic and the Cincinnati Bengals. Needless to say, I do not have much to brag about as a sports fan. I'm also a HUGE old-school/golden-era hip-hop fan. If you ever want to talk more of that or any of the above, just hit me on Twitter/X.

We'll get this AMA started around 2:30 p.m. EST today (Saturday 11/2) so I'll touch base back here shortly. Get your questions in ASAP. I'll be here for at least an hour or so to help out!

Launched a Free AI Trade Analyzer That Actually Explains Trades (Instead of Just Spitting Out Numbers),18,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1gi2jqm/launched_a_free_ai_trade_analyzer_that_actually/,1gi2jqm,Aishik-Lala,"Hey r/fantasyfootball!

Ever notice how most trade analyzers just give you some vague numbers and charts, but never actually explain why a trade is good or bad? After getting frustrated with this myself, I built [**RotoBot AI**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rotobot-ai/id6502530085), a trade analyzer powered by advanced language AI that breaks down trades in plain English‚Äîand it's completely free to use.

**What makes RotoBot AI‚Äôs trade analyzer different:**

* Uses large language models to explain trades like a real analyst would
* Actually breaks down the logic in clear, conversational language
* No more generic ""Player A is worth 25.3 points"" responses
* Run as many trades as you want, completely free
* Analyzes trades from multiple angles (upside, floor, schedule, etc.)

Just plug in your players and get detailed explanations for why a trade makes sense (or doesn‚Äôt). No limits on usage.

Our team has been developing this tool for nearly two years, fine-tuning it to make sure it truly adds value for fantasy football players. For those who want to dive even deeper, we've also built a full AI chatbot assistant that can answer questions like:

* ‚ÄúMooney, Dell, Moore, Coleman start 2‚Äù
* ""What's the downside risk of trading for Breece Hall?""
* ""Compare Waddle vs Higgins factoring in their QB situations and upcoming matchups""

But first and foremost‚Äîthe trade analyzer is completely free and always will be. We built RotoBot AI because we were tired of trade tools that didn't actually explain their reasoning, and we knew modern AI could do better.

[**Try RotoBot AI here**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rotobot-ai/id6502530085). Only on iOS at the moment. Here's our [website](https://rotobot.ai/).

Would love your feedback as we keep building this out! Let me know if you have any questions about how it works.

Edit: Thanks for all the responses! Working through feedback and making improvements based on your suggestions. This product is literally just 3 weeks old so there is a long way to go, Looks like missing players is currently the frontrunner for errors - going to get that all patched up by the end of the week. Thanks again and hopefully our tool can help you.",2024-11-02 18:10:06,57,fantasyfootball
