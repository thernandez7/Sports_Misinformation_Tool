The university announced Saturday that Luck has been named the general manager of Stanford football, effective immediately. He will oversee all aspects of the program at his alma mater. ""I am a product of this University, of Nerd Nation; I love this place,"" Luck, 35, said in a team news release. ""I believe deeply in Stanford's unique approach to athletics and academics and the opportunity to help drive our program back to the top. Coach (Troy) Taylor has the team pointed in the right direction, and I cannot wait to work with him, the staff, and the best, brightest, and toughest football players in the world."" Luck was with the Cardinal from 2008-11, leading the team to a 31-7 record as its starting quarterback after taking a redshirt in his first season. Before becoming the No. 1 overall pick of the 2012 NFL Draft by the Colts, Luck finished second in Heisman Trophy voting twice (2010-11) and won the Maxwell Award, Walter Camp Foundation Player of the Year Award and Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award following the 2011 season. Indianapolis pushed future Hall of Fame member Peyton Manning aside to make room for Luck, who was a four-time Pro Bowl selection in six seasons before shocking the Colts and retiring just before the 2019 season. Luck earned his bachelor's degree in architectural design in 2012 and 11 years later, his master's in education., from Stanford. ""Andrew Luck exemplifies the Stanford student-athlete,"" said Jonathan Levin, Stanford's president. ""I'm excited he's returning to campus to help lead our football program and ensure that our student-athletes achieve excellence in the changing collegiate athletics environment."" Luck be counted to work with Taylor, who will enter his third year as head coach in 2025, on recruiting and roster management. In addition, he'll run much of the business side of things, including fundraising, sponsorships, alumni relations and student-ahtlete support. ""He also brings a deep understanding of the college football landscape and community, and an unparalleled passion for Stanford Football,"" athletic director Bernard Muir said. ""I could not think of a person better qualified to guide our football program through a continuously evolving landscape, and I am thrilled that Andrew has agreed to join our team. This change represents a very different way of operating our program and competing in an evolving college football landscape."" Stanford finished the 2024 season on Friday with a 34-31 loss to San Jose State. The Cardinal were 3-9 overall and 2-8 as a first-year member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"
"Deadspin > Sports News Without Fear, Favor or Compromise","Kansas City Chiefs Clutch Up, Las Vegas Raiders Collapse: A Tale as Old as Time",https://deadspin.com/kansas-city-chiefs-clutch-up-las-vegas-raiders-collapse-a-tale-as-old-as-time/,2024-11-30T16:09:36.513Z,"The Kansas City Chiefs came up clutch in their victory against the Las Vegas Raiders, who completely collapsed late in the game, and that's the story","The Kansas City Chiefs would seem to have already used five years of good luck this season, but the football gods just keep delivering more. The Chiefs didn't wait until the last play to get their good fortune this time, but a botched snap by the Los Angeles Raiders on Friday and a recovery by the Chiefs with 11 seconds left qualifies as another stunning dose. The Raiders were at the Kansas City 32-yard line and in position to attempt a go-ahead field goal when the Chiefs again received late-game magic. That 19-17 escape marked Kansas City's ninth victory by single digits this season—a new NFL record. Five of Kansas City's victories have been determined on the final play of the game: two made field goals, one rushing touchdown in overtime, one blocked field goal and one opponent touchdown overturned. Now they get this latest win where Raiders center Jackson Powers-Johnson unexpectedly snapped the ball. It caromed off the upper right arm of quarterback Aidan O'Connell, and the Chiefs' Nick Bolton recovered it to leave Las Vegas stunned and make Kansas City (10-1) the first team to clinch a playoff spot. Kansas City blew a 16-3 lead against the lowly Raiders (2-10), who scored two touchdowns to move ahead before the Chiefs got a go-ahead field goal from Matthew Wright. Five days earlier, the Chiefs blew a 14-point lead against the horrid Carolina Panthers before needing a field goal as time expired to win. So we're seeing that Kansas City isn't a formidable team. Star quarterback Patrick Mahomes said the Chiefs need to get better. I think we all agree with him. Not to be forgotten is that Kansas City wobbled a lot last season. After their Week 10 bye, the Chiefs lost four of their next six games to fall to 9-6, and people were wondering what was wrong. Kansas City finished 11-6 and beat the Miami Dolphins in the wild-card round when the temperature was minus-4 (feels like minus-27) at kickoff. Then it won road games against the Buffalo Bills and Baltimore Ravens before notching an overtime victory over the San Francisco 49ers. So after 'what's wrong with the Chiefs?' was the big late December question, these guys rallied to win the whole darn thing. That makes it difficult to assess the current Chiefs. They are playing a lot of close games and also playing down to the competition. But only the powerful Buffalo Bills have beaten them. As for the Raiders (2-10), they lost their eighth straight game since beating the Cleveland Browns on Sept. 29. Las Vegas has lost five games by double digits during the stretch, and the one place where Friday's loss helps is that it improves the chances of gaining the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. Quarterback Aidan O'Connell was back after breaking his right (throwing) thumb in Week 7 against the Los Angeles Rams. He fared well by throwing for two touchdowns and a career-high 340 yards. With Gardner Minshew (collarbone) done for the season, the Raiders need to study O'Connell the rest of the campaign so they can make this decision: Is he our quarterback of the future, or do we need to find one? There are certainly things to like about O'Connell. When the Raiders were down 13 points, this game could have gotten away fast. But O'Connell picked up his play and made some big-time throws. Rookie tight end Brock Bowers caught 10 passes for 140 yards and he is a definite future star. But looking at the total picture, this is a miserable season for Las Vegas. The Raiders even lost at home by 14 points to the Panthers. You have to wonder if coach Antonio Pierce will keep his job. He did a good job last season by going 5-4 after taking over, but there isn't much good to dig up this time around. Perhaps he deserves a second full season out of fairness, but you know what can happen when keeping a coach out of charity? Another double-digit loss season. On Friday, that was a game the Raiders were in position to win. Then snap—it wasn't. Copyright 2024"

Three games featuring at least one team chasing a Playoff berth offer intriguing bets for this final Saturday of a historic season. The Palmetto State rivalry returns to Death Valley for the first time since arguably the most stunning entry in modern times of this 128-year-old series. In 2022, the Gamecocks scored their first win over the Tigers since 2013 while also handing Clemson its first home loss since 2016. A key difference between the defeats that bookended Clemson’s 40 straight home wins, however, was that falling to Pitt in 2016 served as a prelude to the Tigers’ first national championship under Dabo Swinney. The loss to South Carolina two years ago, on the other hand, dashed Clemson’s Playoff hopes. The 31-30 loss also set off a stretch that wiped out Clemson’s previously held air of invincibility. Giving South Carolina a receipt in the Gamecocks’ return to Death Valley may not restore Clemson to its latter-half 2010s dominance, but it would presumably land the Tigers back in the playoffs—while denying South Carolina a possible spot in the field. The South Carolina rush defense is statistically the best Clemson will have faced. However, the Tigers' defense, with its ability to generate turnovers, promises to be an equalizer, capable of giving Clemson favorable field position. In losses, South Carolina has committed multiple turnovers, averaging three in those games. With 20 total takeaways, Clemson ranks among the best turnover-generating defenses in the nation—including generating seven over the Tigers’ ongoing, three-game winning streak. Look for a few key takeaways to play a central role in Clemson avenging its 2022 defeat and positioning itself for a Playoff berth. $100,000 Daily Race Sign up now to claim For help with a gambling problem, call or text the NCPG - (1-800-522-4700)  First Bet Safety Net $1000 or Bet $5 & Get $150 Sign up now and get the choice of two incredible offers.

The vibe shift that accompanied the change in quarterbacks saved USC’s bowl aspirations. But it may not be enough to put the Trojans into yet another one-score game with rival Notre Dame visiting Los Angeles, aiming to put an exclamation point on its Playoff resume. Since a staggering loss to Northern Illinois in Week 2, the Fighting Irish have won 8 of 9 games by 18 points or more, thanks to a combination of stifling defense and methodical offense. The one-two punch of Jeremiyah Love and Riley Leonard carrying the ball complements a defense that’s strong against the run (3.5 yards allowed per carry) and downright incredible against the pass. The Fighting Irish have 15 interceptions and have allowed just six touchdown passes this season, capitalizing on a multifaceted and steady pass rush. Maiava, who started slow in both of his previous two starts—including throwing a pick-six against Nebraska before settling in for three passing scores—cannot afford another slow start against the opportunistic Irish. While USC is just a handful of scores away from playing for the Playoff itself, Notre Dame is an especially difficult matchup for a Trojans team with an inconsistent offense. $100,000 Daily Race Sign up now to claim For help with a gambling problem, call or text the NCPG - (1-800-522-4700)  First Bet Safety Net $1000 or Bet $5 & Get $150 Sign up now and get the choice of two incredible offers.

However, for those who have followed the sport long enough, the closest thing to a guarantee anyone can make is that the final weeks of the regular season will bring an earth-shattering result. Week 14 offers a few possibilities involving teams currently in position to land a Playoff bid, including Texas facing historic rival Texas A&M for the first time since 2011. Bettors looking to go for the gusto in the final week of the regular season might consider Syracuse hosting Miami. The former Carrier Dome has been home to plenty of shocking upsets over the years, including in recent seasons. While those results have no bearing on a 2024 matchup, the atmosphere of the Dome itself plays a part in rattling visitors. More pertinent to this ACC contest, however, is that 10-1 Miami’s defense has allowed five conference opponents to score more than their season averages. While that hasn’t cost the Hurricanes often, it has made for some too-close-for-comfort wins. Syracuse should cover the number at +11 across a variety of books. If Kyle McCord settles in and his talented corps of top-three pass catchers—Trebor Pena, Jackson Meeks, and Oronde Gadsden II—find favorable matchups against the Hurricanes' defense, the Orange can dramatically alter the Playoff forecast with an outright win. $100,000 Daily Race Sign up now to claim For help with a gambling problem, call or text the NCPG - (1-800-522-4700)  First Bet Safety Net $1000 or Bet $5 & Get $150 Sign up now and get the choice of two incredible offers.

Macklin Celebrini, the No. 1 overall pick in this past summer's NHL draft, and Will Smith, the No. 4 overall selection in 2023, each had a goal and an assist as the Sharks defeated the Seattle Kraken 8-5 in a Black Friday matinee. The Pacific Division rivals will complete their home-and-home series Saturday night in Seattle. Celebrini has four goals over the past three games and Smith put together his third straight multi-point effort (two goals, four assists), as the Sharks improved to 2-2-1 over their past five contests. Celebrini became the second 18-year-old in franchise history to score in at least three consecutive games. Jeff Friesen tallied in five in a row in 1994-95. The offensive output was San Jose's largest since an 8-2 victory against Philadelphia on Oct. 9, 2018. It came two games after a 7-2 victory against visiting Los Angeles on Monday. The Sharks' Ethan Cardwell, playing in his fourth game, added his first NHL goal. Cardwell converted a wrist shot from the top of the left faceoff circle at 7:37 of the third period to give San Jose a two-goal cushion. ""I think I blacked out there for a minute,"" Cardwell said of his goal. ""It was an awesome moment, everything I dreamed of. To have a crowd go crazy like that and see all the boys' excitement to come to the bench made it all that much worth it."" Klim Kostin, moved up in the lineup, added a Gordie Howe hat trick -- a goal, assist and fight -- for San Jose. ""I didn't expect (to play with Mikael Granlund and Smith) when I go to the rink,"" Kostin said. ""When I saw the lineup, I was like, ‘Hey man, you gotta take that opportunity to prove yourself that you can play hockey.'"" Still, Sharks coach Ryan Warsofsky didn't seem completely pleased. ""It was whoever wanted to play defense would probably win the hockey game,"" Warsofsky said. ""(There are) some things we got to look at and be better for (Saturday)."" Kraken coach Dan Bylsma paused and chose his words carefully when asked a question in a postgame news scrum. ""The finishing statement will be that we gave them a lot of opportunities to demonstrate their skill,"" Bylsma said. The Kraken received two power-play goals from Shane Wright, the No. 4 pick in the 2022 NHL Draft, and Chandler Stephenson added a goal and two assists. Oliver Bjorkstrand had one goal and one assist but netminder Philipp Grubauer stopped just 19 of 26 shots to drop to 1-7-0 this season. ""Just not the type of game we want to get into,"" said Wright, who has five points (three goals, two assists) in three games since returning to the lineup after spending three contests as a healthy scratch. ""Any time you give up eight goals, it's not going to end well for you.""  Bjorkstrand said the Kraken are intent on bouncing back Saturday. ""We have something to prove,"" Bjorkstrand said. ""It's going to be a statement game, that we're not going to have very many of these."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Pacific Division-leading Golden Knights have won both of the first two meetings with their new neighbors. Vegas won the first contest 4-3 on Nov. 2 on home ice on a Brett Howden overtime goal, then rallied from a 2-0 second-period deficit 13 days later in Salt Lake City to pull out a 4-2 victory.   Both teams will be playing the second game of a back-to-back on Saturday.   Vegas, behind two goals by Howden and Ivan Barbashev, defeated NHL points leader Winnipeg 4-3 on Friday night while Utah garnered a point against the reigning Western Conference champion Edmonton Oilers with a 4-3 overtime loss.   Howden tapped in a William Karlsson crossing pass by the left post with 4:05 remaining for the game-winner as the Golden Knights improved to 9-2-0 at home this season.  The contest came just one day after Vegas returned from a season-long five-game road trip that included stops in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Philadelphia and Wednesday in Denver against Colorado. The Golden Knights, however, didn't show any signs of jet lag in one of their best home performances of the season.   ""We've been away from home for a long time,"" Vegas coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""I think our guys are excited to get back here playing. I liked our energy. I thought we played really well coming off the road.""   ""We've been playing pretty well,"" added Karlsson, who played in his 700th career NHL game. ""Long road trip and coming home for a back-to-back. I think we looked pretty good (Friday) and hopefully can come out the same way (Saturday)."" Vegas next will host the Oilers on Tuesday, providing a brief break.   Utah, despite blowing a 2-0 first period lead, did manage to pick up a point against the Oilers on Friday night, thanks to a Lawson Crouse goal early in the third period that tied the score 3-3. Ryan Nugent-Hopkins won it at 1:18 of overtime with a breakaway goal, beating Karel Vejmelka on his blocker side.   Edmonton scored three times in the second period, including power play goals by Leon Draisaitl and captain Connor McDavid, to take a 3-2 lead before Crouse scored his first goal since Oct. 24 in a loss to Colorado to tie it.   ""Finally,"" Crouse replied when asked for his reaction to scoring his fourth goal of the season. ""I think it just speaks volumes to our character in our room, and there's no quit in our team. We went right to the end.""   It was Utah's fifth loss in the last seven games (2-4-1).   ""Take the positives from this, move on and get ready for a big matchup tomorrow,"" Crouse said. ""We've got to move on quickly here. The goal is to come away with two points, not one.""    --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Both teams played road games on Friday night, but the Oilers are the ones who experienced a pleasant flight to Colorado after their 4-3 overtime win at Utah. The Avalanche's rally fell short in a 5-3 loss at Dallas. Colorado lost more than the game in Dallas. Defenseman Josh Manson left in the second period with an upper-body injury and did not return. Coach Jared Bednar did not have an update on Manson but expressed frustration with another of his players getting injured. ""It's definitely frustrating ... it just seems like we're having a tough time getting through a game right now healthy,"" Bednar said. If Manson misses any time, he'll join a long list of Avalanche players who have been on the injured list. A few have come back -- Artturi Lehkonen missed the first 13 games after offseason shoulder surgery, and Jonathan Drouin returned after missing 16 games but is hurt again -- while Ross Colton is out with a fractured foot. Despite that, Colorado had won eight of its previous 11 games before falling to Dallas, in part because the top players have carried the team. Mikko Rantanen has 11 goals and eight assists in November, star defenseman Cale Makar is one pace to record 100 points for the season, and Nathan MacKinnon leads the team with 36 points despite failing to score a goal in the last nine games. Edmonton also is on an upswing. The Oilers are 6-2-1 in their last nine games after opening a three-game road trip at Utah. They have climbed the standings and survived a few games without star center Connor McDavid, who is back in the lineup. ""We're in a fine position,"" Edmonton's Leon Draisaitl said. ""It's not exactly where we want to be, but we're certainly within striking distance of where we want to be. It's just a matter of stringing them together a little bit, finding a couple of win streaks that last a little longer than two games. That's our plan, that's what we're looking to do."" Draisaitl leads the team in goals (17) and points (32) while McDavid, who missed three games earlier this season with an ankle injury, paces the team with 18 assists. Saturday night will be the first of three meetings between the teams that met in the Western Conference finals in 2022. The Avalanche swept that best-of-seven series on their way to winning the Stanley Cup, and both teams remain in their championship windows. The Oilers nearly captured their sixth Stanley Cup last spring but lost Game 7 to the Florida Panthers after rallying from a 3-0 series deficit. Edmonton hopes winger Zach Hyman returns during the three-game road trip. Hyman, who hasn't played since Nov. 19 with an undisclosed injury, practiced with the team on Thursday and is on the trip. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Minnesota is coming off a 3-2 win on home ice against the Chicago Blackhawks on Friday. Captain Jared Spurgeon scored twice and Marco Rossi scored once for Minnesota, which won its second game in a row.  Now, the Wild have a chance to increase their winning streak to three games.  ""Straight lines and simple hockey, that works for us,"" Spurgeon said.  Nashville will try to complicate the Wild's three-game homestand.  The Predators also will play on short rest after losing 3-2 in overtime at home against the Tampa Bay Lightning on Friday. Captain Roman Josi scored both goals for Nashville, which earned one point but has lost two games in a row in overtime.  Nashville coach Andrew Brunette said he was looking for a spark on offense.  ""Nobody's really feeling it,"" Brunette said. ""If you look up and down our roster, we're having a hard time scoring.  ""So, nobody's really feeling great about their game. And usually when you don't feel good about your game, these kind of things happen. So, we have to try to find a way to feel a little better about our game.""  Spurgeon has helped the Wild to feel good about their performance in the first few months of the season. He underwent hip and back surgeries last season and missed six games in October as he continued to recover, but he has provided leadership and production since returning to the ice.  ""Just having him around, having his leadership presence, it's a night-and-day different feel as a group of guys,"" Wild defenseman Brock Faber said. ""Obviously, he's the leader of that. His off-ice characteristics and on-ice (contributions) are just helping us a whole lot."" Nashville could turn to Scott Wedgewood in net if it decides against playing Juuse Saros on back-to-back days. Saros made 25 saves on 28 shots Friday.  Wedgewood is 1-2-1 with a 3.69 goals-against average and an .878 save percentage in five games (four starts) this season. He needs one more victory to reach 50 wins in his career.  This would be Wedgewood's sixth career game against Minnesota. In his first five matchups, he is 1-1-2 with a 2.94 GAA and a .900 save percentage.  The Wild likely will counter with Filip Gustavsson in net. He watched from the bench on Saturday as Marc-Andre Fleury started and made 20 saves on 22 shots. Gustavsson is 10-4-3 with a 2.06 GAA and a .929 save percentage in 17 starts this season. He boasts a 62-44-17 career record with a 2.63 GAA and a .914 save percentage. In five career games against Nashville, Gustavsson is 2-2-1 with a 3.39 GAA and an .882 save percentage.  Josi said he and his Predators teammates would try to break through against the Wild. Nashville has been outscored 11-6 over its past three games. ""It's hard to win in this league when you score two goals a game, and we're working on it,"" Josi said. ""We're trying to find it. I think we've got a ton of talent in here that can put the puck in the net. ...  ""The only thing we can do is press down and keep working on it and keep trying. Keep going to the net, keep shooting the puck.""  --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The New York Islanders are getting to the point where they're having a hard time imagining anything other than recent painful history repeating itself. The Sabres will look to remain entrenched within the middle of the Eastern Conference while the Islanders will again attempt to snap their third-period doldrums on Saturday night when the teams meet in Elmont, N.Y. Both clubs will be completing a back-to-back set after suffering overtime defeats on Friday. The host Sabres dropped a 4-3 decision to the Vancouver Canucks, while the visiting Islanders squandered another third-period lead in a 5-4 loss to the Washington Capitals.  A second straight loss was accompanied by plenty of optimism for the Sabres, who have gone 7-3-1 in their past 11 games and are one of five teams within two points of the two Eastern Conference wild-card spots. Buffalo hasn't made the playoffs since the 2010-11 season. The Sabres assured themselves a point Friday by overcoming a two-goal deficit in the third period against the Canucks, whom they outshot 34-22 overall. The Sabres previously outshot the Minnesota Wild -- who have the second-most points in the Western Conference -- by a 39-29 margin in a 1-0 loss Wednesday night.  ""We played with desperation and that's what this team has,"" said center Dylan Cozens, who scored the Sabres' first goal in the third period. ""We don't have any quit, we're going to battle until the last buzzer and we're going to keep fighting until the game's over."" Losers of eight of their past 10 games (2-4-4), the Islanders are growing increasingly desperate to find some answers for the third-period woes that are threatening to derail their season. New York, which led 4-2 entering the third period Friday, has lost seven games this season in which it held a lead in the final 20 minutes. The Islanders surrendered three unanswered goals in the third period of a 6-3 setback to the Boston Bruins Wednesday night. They were outshot 9-3 in the third period and overtime Friday.  New York didn't generate a shot during a power play that began with 3:50 left in regulation, when Nic Dowd was whistled for slashing. While the Islanders are only three points out of a wild-card spot, they are tied for last place in the Metropolitan Division with the Pittsburgh Penguins. They are ahead of only the Ottawa Senators and Montreal Canadiens -- both of whom have two games in hand -- in the East. ""Same story,"" Islanders left winger Matt Martin said. ""We continue to find ways to lose. It's not good enough. I think we just shoot ourselves in the foot a lot. We're just not taking advantage of big moments in games."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Senators should be plenty rested. They've been in the Los Angeles area for a few days after opening their three-game California swing with a 4-3 win against the San Jose Sharks on Wednesday. The Senators took Thursday off and went through a spirited practice on Friday. ""It's about getting the body moving again,"" Ottawa defenseman Thomas Chabot said. ""Days off are so big with the amount of games we play in such a short period of time. Everybody's in a good mood coming back (Friday)."" Several players have led Ottawa, but the most surprising has been Adam Gaudette, who scored two goals against the Sharks to give him 11 goals in 21 games this season. The most goals he's ever scored in a season during his NHL career is 12 in 59 games with the Vancouver Canucks in 2019-20 -- his second full season in the NHL. ""I'm just playing hockey, just doing my thing out there,"" Gaudette said. ""(I'm) playing with some great players out there, and I couldn't do it without the guys on the ice, so I owe a lot to them."" Gaudette has earned a spot on the top line with Brady Tkachuk and Tim Stutzle, who also have seen their offensive numbers climb of late. Tkachuk had two assists against San Jose to give him five points (two goals, three assists) in his past three games, and Stutzle is riding a five-game point streak (two goals, five assists). ""I just try to find him. I know he's a goal scorer,"" Stutzle said of Gaudette. ""He had a couple of good looks (against the Sharks), and he could have scored more than two."" The Kings are coming off a 2-1 win at the Anaheim Ducks on Friday. Erik Portillo made his NHL debut in goal for Los Angeles and made 28 saves to steal most of the headlines. The Kings finally won back-to-back games after alternating wins and losses for five games. ""We've kind of been treading water a little bit,"" Kings coach Jim Hiller said. ""We really want to start stretching some wins together."" Alex Laferriere had a goal and an assist against Anaheim to give him back-to-back multipoint games, and fellow forward Alex Turcotte scored against the Ducks to give him three points (one goal, two assists) in his past four games. Turcotte did not have a shot on goal in the previous two games, so he didn't hesitate to shoot the puck at the end of a 2-on-1 rush against Anaheim. Turcotte said the coaching staff has encouraged him to shoot the puck more. ""I'm trying to do all the little things out there and make plays, but I've still got to get the puck on net sometimes and be a little bit selfish,"" he said. ""I'm happy I got the opportunity (against the Ducks)."" Los Angeles defenseman Brandt Clarke comes in on a three-game point streak (one goal, two assists). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Since Montgomery replaced the fired Drew Bannister last weekend, the Blues have responded with two wins by a combined margin of 8-2. They blanked the New Jersey Devils 3-0 on Wednesday as Jordan Binnington stopped 31 shots for his 16th career shutout. Binnington's 152nd career victory for the Blues snapped a tie for the franchise record that he had held with Mike Liut. ""It's nice just to get it and to accomplish something like that,"" said Binnington, who needed only 298 games to break the franchise mark. ""It's just a matter of being here long enough to get those wins and to compound those wins over time. I'm proud to be here, and I'm proud to have that many wins."" Binnington's first NHL win was a shutout against the Flyers -- a 3-0 blanking back on Jan. 7, 2019. He famously helped the Blues win the Stanley Cup later that season as part of a sizzling start to his NHL career. Speaking of fast starts, Robert Thomas converted nine seconds into the game against New Jersey, and then Dylan Holloway added two goals later in the period to account for all of the scoring. ""We obviously started great, came with tons of energy,"" said Blues captain Brayden Schenn, a former Flyer. ""Tons of emotion early and got rewarded for it. We surprised them a little bit. They're a great team over there with tons of speed."" The Flyers can attack their opponent with speed, as well, and that is partially what has led to the team's 3-0-1 stretch over the last four games. Philadelphia slipped past the New York Rangers 3-1 on Friday afternoon as Travis Konecny scored a pair of goals and Tyson Foerster made a highlight-reel pass to Bobby Brink for another. ""I think we played the way we wanted to, followed the game plan perfectly,"" Brink said. ""And it led to success against a great team."" Ivan Fedotov made 22 saves for the Flyers, who continue to play well despite the absence of starting goaltender Samuel Ersson. Fedotov and Aleksei Kolosov essentially have split time in net while Ersson recovers from a lower-body injury. ""They've played good,"" coach John Tortorella said of his backup goalies. ""It was a tough game for Feds today -- not much action watching (the Rangers' Ilya Shesterkin) just stand on his head. (Fedotov) made some really key saves at key times. ... Those two guys have done the job and kept us in games when we've struggled and made important saves at important times."" The Flyers (11-10-3) are above .500 for the first time since they defeated the Vancouver Canucks in their season opener. They will play 11 of their next 16 games on the road. ""It's a huge stretch of games,"" forward Noah Cates said, ""but I feel like we got through a tough couple stretches in November with the schedule, and to come out of that and to get our record up to .500 is huge for us."" The Flyers defeated the Blues in Philadelphia on Halloween night as Brink scored on a redirection with 3:01 left to secure a 2-1 victory. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Seven days later, the tide has turned for each team before Saturday night's contest in Pittsburgh.  Last Saturday, the Flames concluded an undefeated four-game homestand with a 4-3 shootout triumph against the visiting Minnesota Wild. Two days later, the Flames embarked on a four-game trip through the Eastern Conference. Three games into their voyage, they're still in search of a win, most recently falling 5-2 to the Columbus Blue Jackets on Friday. ""The first period was awful. The second period was awful. The third a push,"" defenseman Rasmus Andersson said of the game versus the Blue Jackets. ""Just not good enough. ... We have to be better on the road."" The road hasn't been kind to Calgary, which is 3-5-4 in opposing rinks compared with a 9-3-0 record at home. The Flames lost six straight on the road (0-3-3) and nine of 10 away from home, with the lone win on Nov. 5 against the Montreal Canadiens. ""It's on each guy. ... Every guy in this room needs to be better (on Saturday),"" Flames forward Blake Coleman said. ""These are games we need to start taking care of on the road if we want to be taken seriously as a playoff team here. It's early, but it's never too early to keep trying to climb up the standings. Good teams find ways to stop the bleeding."" Offense has been hard to come by for Calgary, which ranks tied for 27th in the NHL with an average of 2.54 goals per game.  The Penguins, meanwhile, have won two games in a row after recording only one win in their previous seven games (1-4-2). They beat the Vancouver Canucks, one of the NHL's top road teams, 5-4 on Wednesday, and followed that with a 2-1 victory against the Boston Bruins on Friday. Philip Tomasino, acquired via trade from the Nashville Predators on Monday, scored the go-ahead goal against Boston to give Pittsburgh consecutive wins for the first time since Oct. 31-Nov. 2. ""There's a price to pay to win, and I thought our guys worked really hard tonight,"" Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. ""... The last couple of games, we look so much more like the team that we want to be. Just being proactive, controlling momentum. I just think there's a lot to build on."" Friday's win marked the first time since Nov. 8 that the Penguins have held their opponent to two goals or less. ""Coming down to a tight game in the last period, I guess the whole game was really good for our whole group,"" said goalie Tristan Jarry. ""From top to bottom, just blocking shots, keeping pucks down low, holding onto pucks. I think we held momentum most of the game, and I think that's what really helped us down the stretch."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Charlotte was without top scorer LaMelo Ball on Friday night. Player availability will be critical again leading up to Saturday's game but other players down the roster have played well in bigger roles. ""A lot of optimism from me in terms of potentially getting guys back, but also just optimism in this group,"" Hornets coach Charles Lee said. ""We've shown that, no matter who is available on a night-to-night basis, we continue to play the right way."" Charlotte has lost four games in a row and six of its last seven. The Hawks have won two in a row following a three-game skid. They turned in perhaps their best defensive effort of the season Friday. Atlanta rode a big third quarter and 23 points from reserve De'Andre Hunter to a 117-101 home victory against the Cleveland Cavaliers, who lost for only the third time this season but the second time in a row to the Hawks. ""I don't think he gets enough credit for the little things he does,"" Atlanta coach Quin Snyder said of Hunter. ""He has really embraced shooting the 3. He's a guy I feel lucky to coach."" Atlanta had three players reach the 20-point mark, including guard Trae Young. The support in addition to Young is a bonus for the Hawks. The Hornets suffered a 99-98 home loss to the New York Knicks on Friday. Ball was out with a sore calf, forward Miles Bridges remained sidelined with a knee bruise and key reserve Tre Mann missed the game with a back ailment. Ball's injury came in the final minute Wednesday night against the Miami Heat. Ball is averaging 31.1 points and 6.9 assists per game, so his absence in back-to-back games would loom large if he's not available Saturday. ""He just felt a little something,"" Lee said. ""With the holiday (Thursday) and early tip (Friday), we haven't had a lot of time to evaluate him. They're going to continue doing that, but it's an unfortunate situation."" Brandon Miller had 20 points for the Hornets, who led by four with six minutes to play. Charlotte received a lift from KJ Simpson, who provided 11 points in a season-high 16 minutes off the bench. ""He was really engaged, brought a physicality with him, another level of competitiveness,"" Lee said. ""Offensively, I thought he did a great job of making the Knicks have to honor him. He was playing a little bit of pick-and-roll, driving and kicking to some guys."" When these teams last met on Oct. 25 in Atlanta, Ball had 34 points behind a career-high nine 3-pointers but committed 10 turnovers as well. Atlanta countered that night with Young's 38 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds. His strong night helped offset the Hornets' 42-point second quarter and secured a 125-120 win for the Hawks. A bright side for the Hornets on Friday came with their early defense. The 15 points allowed in the first quarter marked the fewest in any quarter this season against Charlotte. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Washington has won six straight road games and three games in a row overall, while the Devils have won four of their last five and 11 of their last 15. The teams will meet for the fourth and final time this season, with the Devils owning a 2-1-0 advantage. The road team has won all three games. Both teams will play the second of back-to-back sets on Saturday. The visiting Devils beat the Detroit Red Wings 5-4 on Friday, and the Capitals rallied from a two-goal deficit in the third period to defeat the visiting New York Islanders 5-4 in overtime. Defenseman Jakob Chychrun scored at 1:20 of overtime for Washington. Tom Wilson scored two goals and Dylan Strome collected a goal and two assists for the Capitals. Connor McMichael had three assists and Logan Thompson made 20 saves. ""Just shows that we're a really good hockey team,"" McMichael said of the comeback. ""There's an old saying that good teams always find a way to win, and I think it just proves that we're a really good hockey team and we've got guys with high character that never give up on pucks, plays or games."" Washington was 2-for-4 on the power play while killing off all three opportunities by New York. The Capitals rallied after a poor second period that saw the Islanders score three times to take a 4-2 lead. ""When we have a bad period, we take a lot of pride in turning it around the next period, so (you) don't see very many back-to-back periods where we don't have it,"" Chychrun said. Strome has six points (two goals, four assists) in a three-game point streak, and Chychrun has six points (two goals, four assists) in a three-game point streak. Dougie Hamilton, Timo Meier and Jack Hughes each scored a power-play goal in New Jersey's win at Detroit. The Devils, who rallied from an early 2-0 deficit, have surrendered the first goal on the opponent's first shot in the last three games. ""Obviously we don't like the way we started here tonight; that's something we've got to get addressed, clearly,"" New Jersey coach Sheldon Keefe said. ""But loved our power play, went out and reset the game for us, and then from there, we get down again, but we fight our way back and give ourselves a lead and then build that lead so that they get one and it's not enough, and it gives us a chance to keep fighting to the end."" Captain Nico Hischier scored his 150th NHL goal -- and fourth in New Jersey's past three games. He added an assist. ""He impacts the game in so many ways,"" Keefe said. ""Those are the things you need when it isn't really your night as a team. You need individuals to step up and make a difference, and he certainly was one of those guys tonight."" Devils forward Tomas Tatar was caught in a collision along the boards and did not play after the first period because of a lower-body injury. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

In a strong November that saw coach Craig Berube's group move near the top of the division standings, the Leafs were slowed Wednesday night by the defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers.  That game had the look of a playoff matchup and brought back memories of Toronto fans famously chanting ""We want Florida!"" in the postseason two seasons ago.  On the night before Thanksgiving, the Leafs got Florida -- got the Panthers' recent best, actually -- and it was more than the visitors could handle.   After dropping six of its past seven games, Florida jumped Toronto, built a three-goal advantage and disposed of Berube's club 5-1 in their first meeting this season.  The Panthers were the better team from the drop of the puck, and they repeatedly hemmed in the Leafs and forced numerous icings that came back for faceoffs in front of starting goalie Anthony Stolarz, a member of the Panthers last season.  Berube was most upset about losing the battle of special teams.  ""We talked before the game and knew 5-on-5 would be tight, but special teams were the difference,"" he said. ""We gave up two power-play goals to them and a shorty. That was the difference in the game. ""We were trying to come back and took six minutes of penalties in the third. That makes it difficult."" The Maple Leafs could get a big boost Saturday should center Auston Matthews return from an upper-body injury that has sidelined him since Nov. 3. Matthews informed reporters Friday that he intends to return against the Lightning. The three-time NHL goals champion has 11 points (five goals, six assists) in 13 appearances this season. The 27-year-old met with reporters Friday, saying, ""In my mind, I'm back and excited to play tomorrow."" Still, the Leafs have points in eight of their past 10 matches (7-2-1) and beat the Lightning 5-2 on Oct. 21 in Toronto.   Against the Panthers, forward Bobby McMann left the game in the second period and is listed as day to day.  In Nashville on Friday, the Lightning deposited two hard-earned points in the standings with a 3-2 overtime win over the Predators to sweep the season series.  Nikita Kucherov missed the second period with an ailment, but returned in the third period to set up Brayden Point's game-winning tally early in overtime as the Lightning improved to 5-2-1 in their past eight contests. Beneath the goal line following a faceoff, Kucherov fed Point out front for his 16th goal to beat goaltender Juuse Saros. It was the center's NHL-leading ninth power-play goal.  Tampa Bay's Brandon Hagel, who scored his 100th career goal, said the team stayed focused after the Washington Capitals rallied past them 5-4 on Wednesday night.  ""I think we kept it simple,"" Hagel said. ""I think we had a good vibe the entire game, and going into the third, we just knew what we had to do. We learned from last game, and we went out there and finished the job."" Added coach Jon Cooper of the game-winning marker: ""Pointer in tight. I don't know if there's anybody better.""  Victor Hedman stands on the threshold of franchise history. The defenseman recorded his 588th career assist on Hagel's 10th goal for a 2-1 lead in the second frame. The helper tied Hedman, in his first year as the club's captain, with Martin St. Louis for the all-time assist lead for the organization.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

They won't have star center Joel Embiid for the fourth consecutive game on Saturday night when they play the Pistons. He'll miss the team's visit to Detroit due to left-knee-injury management and personal reasons. Paul George, who hasn't played since Nov. 20 due to a left knee bone bruise, is listed as questionable after participating in Friday's practice. Caleb Martin, who missed Wednesday's overtime loss to Houston due to a back injury, also is questionable. Teammate Kelly Oubre Jr. told The Philadelphia Inquirer that he was encouraged by how George looked in practice and that George could help the team emerge from the doldrums. ""Getting those reps, being able to see him feeling good, looking good,"" Oubre said. ""Obviously, just the presence alone does a lot for the morale of the team. We have to continue to just build and try to encourage guys and help guys get back to their full rhythm and strength."" Martin isn't close to 100 percent but is hopeful of playing on Saturday. ""We've got guys banged up, and if I can go, I'm going to try to go,"" Martin said. ""I used to do the same thing in Miami. I would tell guys, even when I was really banged up, ‘I can give 10 minutes tonight.' Whatever it is. I'm going to try to give whatever I can give and help the team the best I can."" Philadelphia needs all the help it can get. The Sixers entered the season with championship aspirations with the addition of George, Martin and other free agents to complement Embiid and high-scoring guard Tyrese Maxey. They enter the weekend 3-14, having lost seven of their past eight games. After four losses, Detroit collected its first win of the season at the Sixers' expense, a 105-95 triumph in Philadelphia on Oct. 30. Pistons guards Jaden Ivey and Cade Cunningham combined for 45 points and 10 assists that night. Since then, Detroit has played .500 ball. The Pistons will play the tail end of a back-to-back set on Saturday. They played arguably their best game of the season on Friday, blowing out Indiana on the road 130-106 in an NBA Cup matchup. Detroit shot 57.8 percent from the field and had three players surpass the 20-point mark -- Malik Beasley (25), Cunningham (24) and Ivey (23). Cunningham, who had missed the previous three games with a hip injury, had 11 of the Pistons' 35 assists. ""That was our emphasis on the scouting report and what coach was really preaching to us -- moving the ball,"" Cunningham said in a postgame TV interview. Beasley is one several veterans the Pistons' front office brought in to provide stability. Cunningham, Ivey, Jalen Duren and Ausar Thompson have benefited from their presence. ""It's a lot of new guys with this group,"" Cunningham said. ""The young core, we've been together, but to have time together and be able to play together, feel each other out, that's the name of the game."" The Pistons, coming off the worst season in franchise history (14-68), are 9-12 this season. They most recently finished at .500 or better in 2018-19. ""We're a group of guys who are willing to sacrifice for something more than themselves,"" first-year Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""When you put a group of guys like that together, it's a great start. We'll continue to get better with the schemes and the technical pieces of it, but when you have guys playing out there that way, you give yourself a chance to win, and that's why we're in so many games, because our guys are playing selfless, competitive basketball."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Panthers defeated the Hurricanes 6-3 on Friday in Raleigh, N.C., ending Carolina's nine-game home winning streak in the first half of a home-and-home set. Sergei Bobrovsky got the start in goal for the Panthers on Friday afternoon and stopped 29 of the 31 shots he faced en route to improving his season record to 11-5-1. With Bobrovsky playing on Friday, it is likely that Spencer Knight will get the start in net on Saturday. Knight has a 2.63 goals-against average this season, but he lost each of his past three starts. Bobrovsky owns a 3.04 GAA. Panthers defenseman Aaron Ekblad, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2014 draft, played in his 700th NHL game during the Friday win and provided two assists. ""What our hope and expectation is that Aaron is going to become that complete all-around two-way defenseman that when we get up the ice, you can score points, you can run a power play, but he'll play against the other team's best,"" Florida coach Paul Maurice said. Ekblad played a team-high 27:17 as the Panthers won their second consecutive contest after dropping four straight. Not only did the Hurricanes lose their home win streak, but top scorer Martin Necas also saw his nine-game home point streak end. Necas, who tallied six goals and 14 assists during the run, was held off the scoresheet despite playing a team-high 22:18. The Hurricanes came back from a 3-1 deficit to tie the game late in the second period, but they couldn't finish the job as the Panthers went on to score three unanswered goals in the third period. ""We have to let go of this one pretty quick and focus on the same team,"" Hurricanes captain Jordan Staal said about meeting up with the Panthers again on Saturday. ""It's a battle always against that team, they're a good team. They play hard, they play smart and they don't give you anything. So we're going to have to work for our chances and we're going to have to come up with a big road win down in Florida."" The Hurricanes have lost two consecutive road outings (0-1-1) and have had trouble with the Panthers in recent history, only coming out on top in four of the past 14 meetings (4-5-5)between the regular season and the postseason. Florida swept Carolina in four games during the 2023 Eastern Conference finals. Spencer Martin has started between the pipes for Carolina in four of its past five contests due to injuries to Pyotr Kochetkov (concussion protocol) and Frederik Andersen (knee). Martin allowed a combined 16 goals over those four starts. Kochetkov is considered a possibility for the Saturday contest, but if he is still unavailable, the Hurricanes could turn to Yaniv Perets. A part of Quinnipiac's NCAA championship team in 2023, Perets could be in line for his first career NHL start. He played 12:46 in a relief appearance last season in his lone NHL game. Both teams have been playing in high-scoring affairs of late. The Hurricanes have scored or allowed four or more goals in 18 consecutive games, while the Panthers have seen 11 of their past 15 contests feature a total of six or more goals. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Still trying to find a spark, the Rangers attempt to halt their first five-game losing streak in more than three years Saturday afternoon when they host the Montreal Canadiens. The Rangers will play their next five at home as they return from playing six of their previous seven on the road. Since a 4-3 win over the Vancouver Canucks on Nov. 19, New York has been outscored 21-10 in its first five-game losing streak when getting outscored 21-5 from April 29-May 6, 2021. The Rangers fired then-general manager Jeff Gorton and team president John Davidson three games into that skid. New York's latest loss was a 3-1 setback to the Philadelphia Flyers on Friday afternoon. The Rangers trailed by two goals 4:24 into the game and were outshot 15-4 in the opening period. After the disastrous start, Laviolette switched each of the four forward lines and two of the three defensive pairings. ""We left the game in the first period,"" Laviolette said. ""That can't happen. For a team that's sitting here looking for ways to win hockey games, just the work in the first period wasn't good."" The changes resulted in Artemi Panarin going on a line with Mika Zibanejad and Will Cuylle, rookie Brett Berard doing the same with Alexis Lafreniere and Vincent Trocheck. On defense, Laviolette moved captain Jacob Trouba to the third pairing with Zac Jones and placed Braden Schneider with K'Andre Miller. Trocheck scored the team's lone goal midway through the second period, but the Rangers were outshot 35-23. They have been outshot 198-137 during their skid. ""It's not good enough,"" Trouba said. ""I think everybody knows that. Nobody needs to announce that or scream or kick and yell. As a group, as professionals, I think you know when it's not good enough. That certainly wasn't good enough as a start."" Chris Kreider missed his third straight game due to back spasms and he could be out again as New York attempts to avoid losing six straight for the first time since going 0-2-4 from Feb. 24-March 7, 2019. New York last dropped six straight in regulation during a single season when it did not get a point in the first six of a seven-game (0-6-1) slide from Feb. 13-25, 2018. The Rangers scored a 7-2 victory at Montreal on Oct. 22 but are 7-9-0 since that encounter. The Canadiens have allowed 19 goals in three straight losses to the Rangers dating back to last season, but they are showing some improvement of late. Montreal is 4-2-1 in its past seven games since allowing 29 goals in a six-game skid from Oct. 29-Nov. 9. The Canadiens, who have scored 23 goals in their past seven, avoided a third straight loss when Nick Suzuki scored 44 seconds into overtime for a 4-3 road win against the Columbus Blue Jackets on Wednesday. Montreal is on the rise despite averaging just 21.4 shots on goal over its past seven contest. The Canadiens put 23 shots on goal Wednesday. Juraj Slafkovsky, recently being demoted to the fourth line, scored in the victory. ""You're just driving for consistency,"" Montreal forward Brendan Gallagher said. ""We drop the puck next game, we got to try and continue to put these points together and climb back up. Enjoy it for a little bit, but you move on pretty quick."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

It is not unusual for a struggling NFL team to play well for a day and keep it close against a better team. But if taking such a bet does not sound like a good idea, give one (or more) of the hundreds of player props a try. With three games on Thanksgiving and another on Black Friday, there are fewer games than usual. However, there are still hundreds of NFL player props available. To help you decide which to bet on, here is our top 10 list of player props for Sunday's Week 13 slate. NFL Week 13: Player Props Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Cincinnati Bengals Pat Freiermuth, four-plus receptions at +194 (FanDuel) Freiermuth had four last week in the loss to the Browns and at least that many in each of the first four games of the season. But against a passing team like the Bengals, the Steelers will likely need every weapon in their arsenal to keep up with the Cincinnati passing game. The Bengals' defense has taken it relatively easy on tight ends this year. So, whether the Steelers are trying to catch up or control the ball, there is a good chance Freiermuth plays a bigger part than usual and makes four-plus receptions. Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs. Carolina Panthers Bryce Young, O/U 195.5 at -114/-114 (FanDuel) Those of us who have not paid much attention to the Carolina Panthers this season might be surprised to hear that Bryce Young has been playing pretty well since returning to the starting lineup. He's thrown for 200-plus yards in two of his past four games and is completing 60-plus percent of his passes. Tampa Bay has a solid run defense. Since the Bucs will probably throw early and often, the Panthers will need Young to throw the ball to catch up and/or be competitive. With how well Young is playing right now, we'll take the OVER. Indianapolis Colts vs. New England Patriots Drake Maye, O/U 220.5 passing yards at -115/-115 (DraftKings)   Maye threw for more than 220 passing yards against the Rams and Dolphins, two solid defenses, in his past two games. The Colts' defense ranks No. 27 in pass defense and has seen opponents average 34 pass attempts and 231.7 yards per game over the past three. Maye has averaged right around 34 attempts and 230 yards over his past three. Take the OVER. Los Angeles Rams vs. New Orleans Saints Kyren Williams, O/U 19.5 rushing attempts at -102/-128 (FanDuel) O/U 82.5 rushing yards at -113/-113 (FanDuel) O/U 11.5 receiving yards (DraftKings) Williams had 16, 15, and 15 carries the past three weeks but had 20-plus in the previous four and has averaged 18.8 per game this season. But he'll be facing a New Orleans Saints team that has seen opponents run the ball 26.7 times per game and 27.8 at home. The Rams tend to run a little less on the road, but they are fighting to remain in the playoff conversation (just like the Saints). To that end, they'll put the ball in the hands of their playmaker rather than spread the touches among multiple backs. New Orleans has been giving up 134.2 yards per game on the ground but has been especially weak against the run at home (163.2 yards per game). Wiliams has gone for over 82.5 yards in three of the five games in which he had 20-plus carries. But against a Saints team giving up 160-plus at home, take the OVER. Williams has not been targeted in the passing game the past two weeks (three total). In the eight games where he had at least one catch, he finished with under 11.5 yards in three. He is not a priority in the passing game. Take the UNDER. Houston Texans vs. Jacksonville Jaguars C.J. Stroud, O/U 259.5 passing yards at -115/-115 (BetMGM) Tank Dell, O/U 51.5 receiving yards at -113/-113 (FanDuel) O/U 4.5 receptions at +130/-170 (FanDuel) Nico Collins, O/U longest reception 26.5 yards at -130/+100 (BetMGM) This should be the ‘get-right' game C.J. Stroud and the Texans have needed for weeks.  Jacksonville has overtaken the Ravens as the worst pass defense in the NFL. Stroud has gone over 259.5 passing yards just once in Houston's past seven games. But opponents are averaging 278.3 yards per game this season and close to 300 over the past three games.  If Stroud can't go off against this team with the talent at his disposal ... Tank Dell has gone over 51.5 yards in both games with Nico Collins back in the lineup. But against a Jacksonville defense that has allowed an average of 13.5 receptions for 183.5 yards, Dell should see a few more targets. Collins will be the primary receiver, of course, but Dell could still see balls thrown his way and that should be enough for him to go OVER both marks. As for Collins, he has had a reception of 28-plus yards in every game but one. Jacksonville has given up 52 pass plays of 20-plus yards and nine of 40-plus. Take the OVER. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

They could also get to the championship game if BYU and West Virginia both lose. Maealiuaki Smith was 11-of-29 for 70 yards and two interceptions for the Cowboys (3-9, 0-9). Colorado outgained Oklahoma State 471-147. In the first quarter, the Cowboys' offense managed 16 yards, threw a pick to Hunter on its first drive, went three-and-out on its second, had a fumble recovered by Shilo Sanders on its third and punted on its fourth.

The Longhorns responded with a 9-0 run to build their biggest lead of the game before a layup by Watson made it 41-22 at the break.   Johnson and Kaluma had 10 points apiece to lead all scorers before halftime as Texas outshot the Hornets 43.8 percent to 27.3 percent. The Longhorns also forced nine turnovers that they converted into 13 points over the first 20 minutes of play.   Smith's seven points paced Delaware State in the half.   The teams played about even for the first four minutes of the second half, but that wasn't getting the visitors any closer to Texas' substantial lead and it never did. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

It was the second consecutive year the Hawkeyes (8-4, 6-3 Big Ten) won the annual rivalry game on a last-second kick, both by the same score. The latest victory ensured Iowa a ninth consecutive eight-win season, excluding the COVID-shortened 2020 campaign. Nebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola was strip-sacked by Iowa's Max Llewellyn at the Cornhuskers 36-yard line with 20 seconds remaining. Three plays later, Stevens tucked the kick just inside the upright. The second-coldest game in Kinnick Stadium history -- it was 20 degrees Fahrenheit at kickoff -- saw less than 500 yards of offense, with Iowa managing just 164. The Hawkeyes made up for it with a pair of takeaways which led to six points. Iowa trailed 10-0 at halftime, punting on all six full drives and managing only 20 yards on 20 plays with one first down. The Hawkeyes got 29 yards on their first drive of the second half, a march that included another punt but also a recovery of a muff at the Nebraska 4-yard line. Stevens made a 20-yard field goal with 4:30 left in the third quarter. Kaleb Johnson scored on a 72-yard touchdown pass from Jackson Stratton on the first play of the fourth quarter, his 23rd score of the season, to tie it at 10. Iowa had only 65 yards prior to that play. Nebraska (6-6, 3-6) scored on its opening possession, getting a 31-yard field goal from John Hohl. That was the only scoring in the game until the Cornhuskers' Dante Dowdell scored on a 1-yard run with 38 seconds left before halftime. Both schools will learn which bowl game they are in and their opponent on Dec. 8. Nebraska will make its first bowl appearance since 2016, while Iowa is bowl-eligible for the 12th straight season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Gonzaga took a 28-18 lead when Nembhard found Huff in the lane for a hook shot with 7:51 left as part of an 8-0 run. Nembhard's three-point play upped the lead to 33-19 with 7:08 left, Gregg's trey made it 36-21 with 5:23 remaining and the Bulldogs held a 42-31 lead by halftime.

Then again, maybe not. It depends, Houston coach DeMeco Ryans said, if the Texans (7-5) are ""locked in"" and able to make a December push. ""I just look at it as being intensely focused on your job and being where you're supposed to be, executing the minor details of your job,"" Ryans said. ""It all comes down to minor, minute details that you get exploited if you don't do them the correct way and teams find those and they make you pay.  ""And a lot of the things, as I talked to our guys about, are things that we can control."" Jacksonville (2-9), sitting at the bottom of the AFC South, is coming off a humiliating 52-6 loss to the Detroit Lions. It marked the fourth straight setback for the Jaguars, who had dropped their previous three games by a combined 13 points. Jaguars coach Doug Pederson noted that changes are coming, although he opted not to show his cards.  ""I'm not going to get into the whole details of things, but there are things in the run game that we have to get back to,"" Pederson said. ""Even in the passing game, tweaking some things there. There are things that can, hopefully, help our production over the last six weeks."" One of those changes is the return of starting quarterback Trevor Lawrence, who has not played since Nov. 3 due to a left shoulder injury. Doug Pederson confirmed Friday that Lawrence will be the QB1 despite being listed as questionable after being limited in practice all week.  Pederson has also had his eye on Houston quarterback C.J. Stroud, who has run into some struggles during his sophomore season.  Stroud has thrown nine interceptions in 12 games (all starts) after throwing only five as a rookie. He was picked off twice in the 32-27 setback against Tennessee, also throwing for 247 yards and two touchdowns on 20-for-33 passing.  Pederson still believes the 23-year-old can hurt the Jaguars, though.  ""Playing the quarterback position is hard,"" Pederson said. ""I don't know everything that goes on down there. I'm sure there's been injury, guys have missed (time). He's missed his playmakers from time to time. And then there's the film. There's the film out there."" The Texans have lost three of their past four games and four of their past six as defenses continue to solve Stroud. For the Texans, safety Jalen Pitre is expected to miss several weeks because of a shoulder injury. Defensive tackle Foley Fatukasi (foot) will sit out Sunday's game after not practicing all week, but defensive ends Will Anderson Jr. (ankle) and Denico Autry (knee) were among those who returned to full practice Friday and will play on Sunday. Jaguars linebacker Yasir Abdullah (hamstring) did not practice all week and won't play Sunday. Cornerback Tyson Campbell (shoulder) was limited in practice all week but doesn't have an injury designation. Sunday marks the second meeting of the season between the teams. The Texans topped Jacksonville 24-20 back on Sept. 29. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Sanders will be honored next Friday in Baltimore. Later in the day, Sanders passed for 438 yards and five touchdowns during the Buffaloes' 52-0 shellacking of Oklahoma State. Sanders set school records this season of 3,926 passing yards and 35 touchdown passes. It is the second straight season in which he set the school yardage mark. Sanders has completed 74.2 percent of his passes while accumulating 35 touchdown passes and just eight interceptions. No. 25 Colorado (9-3, 7-2 Big 12) is averaging 34.5 points per game, and it's possible the Buffaloes could be in the conference title game next week. Coach Deion Sanders, father of Shedeur, said his son would play in whichever bowl game the Buffaloes are invited. Shedeur Sanders is considered a first-round pick in the 2015 NFL draft. The other finalists were Jaxson Dart of Ole Miss, Dillon Gabriel of Oregon, Kurtis Rourke of Indiana and Cam Ward of Miami. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

After missing the past five games due to an injured wrist, Doncic returned to practice with his teammates on Friday. It's uncertain whether he'll play against Utah or Sunday in Portland during the Mavericks' weekend road trip, but he will be with the team. ""He's doing his individual workouts. Everything I've heard or seen is trending in the right direction,"" Dallas coach Jason Kidd said on Wednesday. Unlike last season, when the Mavericks only won four of 12 games in Doncic's absence, Dallas has fared well without their top gun since he was injured on Nov. 19 against New Orleans. The Mavs are 4-1 in that stretch, including a 129-119 win at Atlanta on Monday and Wednesday's 129-114 victory over the New York Knicks. Remarkably, Dallas had four players score at least 20 points in each of those most recent wins, setting a team record. Against the Knicks, Naji Marshall scored 24, Kyrie Irving had 23 and Quentin Grimes and Spencer Dinwiddie scored 21 each. Marshall has been particularly effective in Doncic's absence. He's averaged 23 points on 63.3 percent shooting while hitting half of his 3-point attempts in the past four games. Dallas' depth has been critical to their 11-8 record. They've had at least six players reach double figures in each of their last six games. In the Mavericks' 123-120 win over Denver on Nov. 22, seven players scored in double figures. The Jazz haven't had similar success on the scoreboard but their players are getting experience and playing time for a variety of reasons, including injuries. In Wednesday's 122-103 home loss to the Nuggets, Utah was without Lauri Markkanen (personal reasons), John Collins (left knee contusion), Jordan Clarkson (left plantar fasciitis) and Kyle Filipowski (lower leg inflammation). ""We will play some lineups tonight that none of us in this room have seen,"" Jazz coach Will Hardy said before that game vs. Denver. ""We will play some lineups tonight that maybe none of us in this room had even thought about. But in some ways, these nights are fun because we get to lean into our creativity as a staff and as a team."" Collin Sexton led Utah with 26 points, Keyonte George had 23 points, Walker Kessler totaled 16 points and 12 rebounds, and Brice Sensabaugh tallied 13 points off the bench. Nikola Jokic scored 21 of his 30 points in the opening half, helping the Nuggets turn a 12-point deficit into a 10-point lead en route to the blowout win. ""We still have these little windows of the game that turn into kind of like a little disaster,"" Hardy said. ""That four-to-five-minute window is really where the game was decided."" The Jazz were grateful to give Congolese player Oscar Tshiebwe, the 2022 consensus national player of the year from Kentucky, his first playing experience with the team in the loss, too. He had three points and nine rebounds. ""I love everything about Oscar. He just makes you feel good,"" Hardy said. ""He's such a good human being. I wish I was more like Oscar."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

It wasn't an outing full of dazzling plays for the Blue Devils, but they did move on after the disappointment of a three-point loss to top-ranked Kansas earlier in the week. Kon Knueppel added 11 points and Cooper Flagg, Khaman Maluach and Isaiah Evans each had nine points for Duke (5-2). Flagg, considered the top prospect for next year's NBA draft, also churned out nine rebounds and seven assists. Caleb Foster scored the first four points of the second half as part of Duke's 13-0 spurt coming out of intermission. After that burst for the Blue Devils, they were outscored 23-20 the rest of the way. Paris Dawson notched 10 points off the bench for Seattle (2-5), which shot 21.3 from the field for the game. Matthew-Alexander Moncrieffe had nine points and 12 rebounds. Exactly half of the Redhawks' points came on free throws, so Duke will want to assess some of its defensive work before a showdown against undefeated Auburn on Wednesday night in Durham. Four of the Blue Devils' victories this season have come in home games. Long-range shooting made a big difference in Duke's favor. The Blue Devils made 10 shots from 3-point range, while Seattle connected just four times. Seattle's starters combined to go 0-for-11 from beyond the arc. Duke was just 39.7 percent from the field for the game, which was the first outing on its home court in nearly two weeks. Nine players scored for the Blue Devils. Duke was sluggish for much of the first half, but finally got rolling in the final 10 minutes. The Blue Devils led 37-25 at the break, with Flagg's nine points leading the scoring. Evans' 3-pointer and Flagg's dunk on consecutive possessions provided a spark. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Lamont Butler added 17 points and six assists for Kentucky (7-0), which eclipsed the 100-point total for the fourth time this year. Amari Williams had 14 points, Otega Oweh added 12, while Andrew Carr and Koby Brea scored 10 apiece for the Wildcats, who made 40 of 67 (59.7 percent) shots from the field. Cesare Edwards led Georgia State (4-4) with 21 points, followed by Zarique Nutter's 19. Malachi Brown chipped in 11 points and five assists for the Panthers, who have dropped two of three. Early in the first half, Nutter's mid-range jumper cut Kentucky's lead to 11-10, before Robinson's layup began a 9-0 Wildcat scoring run. Five straight Georgia State points trimmed its deficit to two points with 5:06 left in the first half. The Panthers were then held scoreless for three minutes, while Kentucky extended its advantage with a 13-0 run, stamped with Kerr Kriisa's 3-pointer, giving the Wildcats a 44-29 lead. Robinson's dunk pushed Kentucky's lead to 18, before Nick McMullen cut the Panthers halftime-deficit to 48-33.

With Kentucky leading 61-53, Georgia State's Clash Peters was called for a flagrant foul for shoving Williams in the back. In the ensuing scuffle, Oweh and Brea were called for technical fouls, while Nutter also picked one up for Georgia State. From there, Kentucky used a 10-3 run to take a 71-56 lead on Oweh's dunk with 11:23 left.

The second-seeded Galaxy romped to a 6-2 win over Minnesota United in a West semifinal last Sunday, with Gabriel Pec, Joseph Paintsil and Dejan Joveljic all scoring twice. That followed a Round 1 series sweep over Colorado in which Los Angeles outscored the Rapids 9-1 over two victories. The Galaxy are also unbeaten in 19 fixtures at their home stadium in all competitions. Despite all that, head coach Greg Vanney is keenly aware how much stiffer the challenge may be against a Seattle side that has won two MLS Cups and reached four finals since 2016. Vanney was the opposing manager in three of those finals, guiding Toronto FC to a 2017 MLS Cup triumph at the Sounders' expense but succumbing to Seattle in the 2016 and 2019 finals. ""I think whenever you talk about Seattle and playoffs and this time of year, you have to talk about the culture that they have at the club,"" Vanney said. ""The grittiness. The resilience. The maturity. They've played in a lot of big games and won a lot of big games."" That has been proven again this postseason, with fourth-seeded Seattle reaching this stage despite failing to win a game in regulation. The Sounders earned a 2-1 victory over Los Angeles FC in a West semifinal in extra time on Jordan Morris' 109th-minute tally, and they swept the Houston Dynamo in a Round 1 series that required a penalty kick shootout in both games. ""These are the games that show us what we got, show us what we're made of,"" Seattle midfielder Obed Vargas said. ""We don't take any team lightly. LA Galaxy and LAFC were top of the West for a reason, but we have full confidence that we have the weapons to exploit them."" However, head coach Brian Schmetzer will be without at least one of those weapons. Influential attacking midfielder Paul Rothrock is done for the season with a major quadriceps injury. And Yeimar Gomez, the team's defender of the year, is questionable after sustaining a hamstring injury in the win against LAFC. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Barnhizer sank four 3-point shots and contributed team highs of nine rebounds and six assists. Barnhizer has scored 20 or more points in three of his four games this season. Jalen Leach chipped in 15 points and Nick Martinelli had 12 for the Wildcats (6-2), who shot only 40.8 percent from the floor. Dedan Thomas Jr.'s 17 points and Jailen Bedford's 15 were tops for UNLV (4-3), which made only 6-of-18 shots from 3-point range. The Rebels also were dinged by 14 turnovers and went cold on offense at the wrong time. UNLV stayed within range despite scoring only six points in a six-minute stretch late in the game. They added seven points in the last 30 seconds after Northwestern had the game in control. Northwestern looked to be in good shape after Martinelli's 3-pointer with less than two minutes left for a 58-51 lead. But Bedford countered with a 3 for UNLV. Barnhizer answered with a three-point play with 1:12 remaining for a 61-54 Wildcats lead. UNLV missed its next two shots, including a dunk, before Northwestern's Ty Berry hit a free throw with 38 seconds to play for his only point. The Rebels were hurt by 42.1 percent shooting from the field despite eight more attempts than Northwestern. UNLV had a chance to come back late unlike a day earlier against No. 25 Mississippi State. Northwestern posted an 18-6 advantage in points at the free-throw line. The teams combined for 25 offensive rebounds, with UNLV collecting 13.

A 23-year-old former first-round pick who was acquired from the Nashville Predators in a deal on Monday, Tomasino netted the go-ahead goal with 12:34 left in regulation. He gathered Evgeni Malkin's pass out of the corner and wristed home a shot that beat Boston netminder Jeremy Swayman five-hole from the bottom of the left circle. Pittsburgh's Tristan Jarry, who entered the game with an .868 save percentage on the season, stopped 32 of Boston's 33 shots (.970). Thirteen of his saves came in the third period. Rickard Rakell scored the first goal for the Penguins en route to their second straight win. Charlie Coyle scored and Swayman made 33 saves for Boston, which is now 3-2-0 under interim head coach Joe Sacco. Minutes after Tomasino's winning goal, Kris Letang's sliding block helped Jarry regain his positioning to make a key stop on Coyle's attempt to stuff the puck inside the left post. A Jarry stop against David Pastrnak during a Boston power play with 6:36 remaining and another with Swayman pulled in the final minute helped secure the final result. Coyle needed only 1:24 of first-period time to net the game's opening goal. Tyler Johnson picked up the puck off Pittsburgh defenseman Jack St. Ivany's fanned pass, led the rush up ice and fed Trent Frederic, who dished cross-ice to set up the Coyle finish on a wrist shot from the right circle. Despite being outshot 12-9, Boston maintained its 1-0 lead entering the first intermission in large part due to Swayman making key saves less than a minute after Coyle scored. A stop on Sidney Crosby's two-on-one rush with Bryan Rust began the flurry. Facing an even busier workload in the middle frame, Swyaman made a flashing glove save on Anthony Beauvillier near the midway point, but Rakell found the tying goal with only 0.8 seconds left before intermission. After Crosby won a point shot back to Erik Karlsson for a point shot that sailed just wide, the Pittsburgh captain recovered the puck as he circled the net and slid a backhand pass to Rakell in front, where he scored Pittsburgh's first goal into a near-open net. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The game could feature a somewhat rare head-to-head between Olympic teammates Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry, both of whom have been sidelined with recent injuries. After helping the Suns open the season 8-1, Durant missed seven straight games with a strained calf. Phoenix went just 1-6 in those contests. The Suns rebounded with a 127-100 home blowout of the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday in Durant's return, in which he contributed 23 points. He then went for 30 the next night against the Nets, but they weren't enough to prevent a 127-117 defeat. Durant pointed to another stat he deemed more important after the loss. ""That's the game,"" he demanded after scanning the stat sheet. ""I can't have seven turnovers if we want to win."" Turnovers have been a bigger issue for the Warriors than the Suns. Golden State has had more than its opponent in three straight games, and has lost all three. Curry wasn't the culprit in a 105-101 home defeat at the hands of the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday as he sat out with sore knees. But he's had at least three in 10 straight games, including three apiece in losses to the San Antonio Spurs and Nets to start the losing streak that has followed a 12-3 start. Interestingly, Curry's absence gave Pat Spencer an opportunity he's rarely gotten in two years with Golden State. The former lacrosse standout, who switched over to basketball after transferring to Northwestern as a fifth-year collegian just five years ago, had Warriors coach Steve Kerr raving after a six-point, four-rebound, three-assist effort against the Thunder. ""Fantastic,"" Kerr said. ""You love to see a guy just come in and play with great force and energy, and push the ball, and find shooters ... He just plays the game. I thought Pat changed the game; as soon as he got out there, the game finally opened up for us. We started to move the ball."" Curry is expected back for the game at Phoenix, which will be the first meeting this season between the Pacific Division clubs. Curry and Durant were three-year teammates for the Warriors, a run that resulted in championships in 2017 and 2018, and a near-miss in 2019 when Durant and Klay Thompson were injured during the Finals against the Toronto Raptors. The Warriors have met Durant's teams 19 times since he left for the Nets after the 2019 Finals. Curry and Durant have been healthy enough to go head-to-head in just six of those games, with Durant's team prevailing four times -- twice with the Nets and twice with the Suns. Curry has outscored his old pal 157-135 in the six games. The Warriors and Suns have not met in the postseason over those years. In fact, the last time Golden State drew Phoenix in the playoffs was in 1994, when Curry was 6 years old and Durant 5. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Tigers (7-1) picked up their fourth consecutive victory as they broke open a close game nearly five minutes into the second half. The Rattlers (1-5) lost for the fifth time this season to a Power Four conference opponent by 24 or more points. Milton Matthews led Florida A&M with 14 points and Roderick Coffee III had 13 points, six assists and five rebounds. Jordan Chatman had 11 points and Shaqir O'Neal had 10. For a half, it appeared the Rattlers would finally be able to contend against one of those power conference opponents. Clemson led 38-32 at halftime and shot a poor 2 for 13 from 3-point range in the first half. But the Tigers opened the second half making three of their first seven triples. Eventually, Clemson put together a 20-5 run over a span of nine minutes to open a 67-41 lead with 6:16 left in the second half. Hunter was one of four Tigers to score in double figures as Clemson shot 50 percent from the field despite its struggles from long distance. The Tigers compensated for their poor 3-point shooting with excellent shooting from the foul line (17 for 20), set up by attacking the rim and taking advantage of 16 Florida A&M turnovers. Hunter led the Tigers with three steals while Viktor Lakhin, Schieffelin and Jaeden Zackery each had two. Chauncey Wiggins totaled 15 points for the Tigers while Zackery had 13 points, four assists and three rebounds. Lakhin had 12 points, five rebounds and three assists.

After losing eight of their first 10 games, the Bucks have turned things around and bring a five-game winning streak into Saturday's contest. While Milwaukee was able to find solutions for its early-season doldrums, Washington is mired in a 13-game losing streak. The Wizards are three losses away from matching their franchise-record losing streak of 16. Washington had no answers for Los Angeles star James Harden in a 121-96 loss to the Clippers on Wednesday. Harden scored 43 points in his team's victory, including 23 in the first quarter. ""It's still really, really early, but to run into this much adversity early stinks and stings,"" Washington forward Corey Kispert said. ""And it's testing the culture that we put in. There's still a lot of positivity within the room, and there's still a lot of encouragement. While things are tough, they're not toxic and not unbearable."" Wizards guard Jordan Poole returned after missing two games with a hip injury and scored eight points on 1-of-7 shooting. The Wizards shot 24.2 percent (8 of 33) from 3-point range in the loss. ""In moments like this, you can get discouraged, especially in this league,"" Washington guard Malcolm Brogdon said. ""There are no easy games. You've got to pick yourself up. It's really you against you out here. At the end of the day, it's about you performing up to the level you know you can play at."" Things are only going to get tougher for the Wizards, who are beginning a four-game stretch against Milwaukee, Cleveland, Dallas and Denver. The Bucks posted a 106-103 road win over the Miami Heat on Tuesday despite playing without both Giannis Antetokounmpo (left knee soreness) and Khris Middleton (ankle surgery). Damian Lillard led the way with 37 points and 12 assists. Antetokounmpo is expected to return on Saturday, while Middleton could make his season debut against the Wizards after completing a full 5-on-5 practice earlier this week. Middleton will join a much different team than the one that struggled to close out games in the first few weeks of the season. Lillard has four double-doubles in his last five games for Milwaukee, which led by as many as 22 points in the third quarter against Miami. ""We're beating good teams,"" Lillard said after Tuesday's game. ""We're winning at home. We're winning on the road in a game like tonight without Giannis, the way we're doing it is sustainable. And it's showing that we're doing what we wanted to be doing coming into the season, so it's definitely positive."" Veteran guard Pat Connaughton is also putting his slow start to the season behind him. He had 10 points and eight rebounds off the bench against the Heat in his first action since Nov. 16. ""He has one of the highest basketball IQs, if not the highest basketball IQ out there,"" Bucks center Brook Lopez said.

Glenn Taylor Jr. provided 12 points off the bench for Oklahoma (7-0), which was picked in the preseason to finish 15th in the 16-team Southeastern Conference. After taking a 10-point lead late in the first half, Oklahoma never trailed, though Louisville tied it on one occasion in the second half. The Cardinals had a chance to tie as they trailed 67-64, but Sam Goodwin stole an inbounds pass and Duke Miles followed with two free throws with 5.2 seconds left to sew it up.  Moore, who also scored 24 points in the Sooners' win over No. 24 Arizona on Thursday in the semifinals, made 7-of-13 shots from the floor and grabbed seven rebounds The Sooners overcame a 44-23 deficit on the boards and a 25-7 disadvantage on second-chance points. Oklahoma shot 47.7 percent from the field and made 8 of 17 3-point attempts. J'Vonne Hadley and Chucky Hepburn led Louisville (5-2) with 12 points each. Terrence Edwards Jr. and Noah Waterman added 11 and 10 points, respectively. Hadley and Waterman led the Cardinals' dominance on the boards with 13 and 11, respectively. Louisville's rebounding edge came despite the loss of top rebounder Kasean Pryor less than a minute into the second half with a leg injury. The Cardinals made 38.1 percent of their shots and were a shaky 7 of 32 from behind the arc. In the first half, neither team led by more than five points until Oklahoma went on an 11-2 run, fueled by a 3-pointer, followed by a four-point play, both by Brycen Goodine. When Moore closed the spree with a turnaround jumper in the lane, the Sooners had a 37-27 lead with 1:50 left in the half. A buzzer-beating slam-dunk by Moore gave the Sooners a 39-32 lead at the break. Early in the second half, with his teammates misfiring, Moore was the only Sooner who scored in the first 8:40 of the period. But his nine points in that span kept Oklahoma in command. Reyne Smith tied for Louisville with 5:06 left with a 3-pointer but Taylor scored the Sooners' next six points to keep them in charge. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Boilermakers had trouble finishing, but they made their last possession count in a game with several momentum swings. Colvin ended up with 20 points and Braden Smith's 18 points and 11 assists were also key for Purdue (7-1), which has won three consecutive games since a loss at Marquette. Smith missed a shot on what became the winning possession, setting up Colvin for the heroics. Fletcher Loyer added 13 points for Purdue, which shot 54.2 percent from the field with 10 baskets from 3-point range. Jaemyn Brakefield scored 18 points off the bench for Ole Miss (6-1). Matthew Murrell had 14 points, Jaylen Murray posted 13 points and Dre Davis supplied nine points and a team-best six rebounds. After leading 75-68 at the 5:19 mark on Murray's 3-pointer, the Rebels stalled. But after cobbling together a 10-0 run to take the lead, Purdue also hit a rough patch. Murrell scored after making a steal, tying the game with 15 seconds left. Purdue used a timeout to set up a final possession. Smith's fadeaway shot was way off the mark, but Colvin swooped in and made the putback all in one motion with .05 showing on the clock. Ole Miss got going in the second half, eclipsing its entire first-half point total within the opening 12:02. A three-point play and then a dunk by Brakefield pushed the Rebels to a 67-60 lead with more than nine minutes to play. Purdue's late run included five points from Colvin as the Boilermakers retook the lead at 76-75 with 3:03 to play on his fastbreak layup. Smith then scored on a drive to make it 78-75. Purdue was up by 17 points three different times in the first half. The Rebels slowly worked their way back. Kaufman-Renn shot 8-for-12 from the field, but he missed six of 15 free-throw attempts.

Alabama (6-1) advanced to Saturday's title round with a pair of close wins, outlasting No. 6 Houston in a top-tier matchup that went to overtime on Tuesday, 85-80; and Rutgers 95-90 on Wednesday. All-American guard Mark Sears powered the Crimson Tide with 24 points in both wins, rebounding from a scoreless performance in just 21 minutes played on Nov. 20 vs. Illinois. After starting 0-for-5 shooting, Sears did not play the final 11 minutes in the 100-87 win against the Illini at his own request, Alabama coach Nate Oats revealed afterward. Sears, who Oats said believed that night the Tide were performing better without him, returned to form in Las Vegas. Grant Nelson had 17 points and nine rebounds in the win over Rutgers, and a trio of reserves -- Mouhamed Dioubate, Derrion Reid and Jarin Stevenson -- scored 10 points each. Dioubate also grabbed nine rebounds. ""Kind of the second game in a row we won off of toughness and rebounding,"" Oats said in the postgame press conference. ""We'll get our offense figured out."" Although Alabama heads into Saturday's contest averaging 89.7 points per game, tied for 11th in the nation entering Friday's play, Oats was critical of the Crimson Tide's efficiency. Alabama is shooting only 32.8 percent from 3-point range, a steep drop from the 37.3 percent the 2023-24 Tide shot en route to the program's first-ever Final Four appearance. Oregon (7-0), meanwhile, has held opponents to 29.5 percent shooting from deep after limiting San Diego State to 6-of-19 on 3-point attempts in the Ducks' 78-68 semifinal win on Wednesday. TJ Bamba's 22 points led five Oregon scorers in double-figures. ""TJ is doing things right now we saw in the summer,"" Ducks assistant coach Mike Mennenga said in a postgame radio interview. ""He's finding his rhythm and his comfort level, and most importantly, his teammates have got his back. They trust TJ and want him to be aggressive, they want him to be physical."" Bamba is averaging 13.1 points per game, one of four Ducks scoring in double-figures a contest. Jackson Shelstad is posting 10.3 points per game despite a slow opening stretch of 9-of-35 from 3-point distance. Brandon Angel is averaging 11 points per game. Pacing Oregon thus far is Nate Bittle's 14 points a contest. Against San Diego State, Bittle had 11 points, two blocked shots and nine rebounds to help the Ducks to a 41-24 advantage on the glass. Oregon has been solid on the boards through its first seven games, particularly on the offensive end, where the Ducks have a 35-percent offensive rebounding rate per KenPom.com metrics. The Ducks opened the Players Era Festival on Tuesday by beating Alabama's Southeastern Conference counterpart Texas A&M, 80-70. With the two wins in Las Vegas extending a stretch that included a come-from-behind defeat of Oregon State on the road on Nov. 21, Oregon is off to its best start since the 2013-14 season when it opened the season 13-0. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""It doesn't mean that the team that wins is that much better. It doesn't mean that the team that loses is a bad team. I mean, those two teams are about as even as it gets.

San Diego State (3-2) was unable to build off a 71-53 win over No. 21 Creighton in its tournament opener, losing to Oregon 78-68 on Wednesday. ""Second half, we battled back,"" Dutcher said. ""I've got a good group of kids. And they're getting better. And we battled back and got close enough, but didn't get over the hump. So all these experiences are giving us a chance to grow as a team. And that's what we're going to look at it as, a chance to grow to start stacking games, like I've said."" BJ Davis leads the Aztecs in scoring with 15.6 points per game and has been their top scorer in Vegas with 18 in each game. Davis also averages 4.2 rebounds, one of four Aztecs averaging four-plus this season. San Diego State's other loss this season came to No. 3 Gonzaga on Nov. 18.

Despite his team's winning streak, first-year Stanford coach Kyle Smith made two changes in his starting lineup for the Grand Canyon game, inserting forward Aidan Cammann and guard Ryan Agarwal among his three standouts, Maxime Raynaud, Jaylen Blakes and Oziyah Sellers. Cammann and Agarwal combined for just eight points, but Smith said afterward he's confident they'll be more productive as the young players become more familiar with their surroundings. ""As (Raynaud and Blakes) get better, I think other guys will follow,"" Smith said, ""and we'll be in good shape."" Raynaud has recorded double-doubles in all seven Stanford games, averaging 23.7 points and 12.6 rebounds per game. Blakes, a Duke transfer, had a season-high 22 against Grand Canyon. Cal Poly (4-4), meanwhile, continues a nonconference survey of the Bay Area, having already lost at San Francisco, Cal and Saint Mary's. The Mustangs conclude the tour with a game at San Jose State in December. Cal Poly has gone just 1-4 on the road, beating Eastern Washington, to offset a 3-0 start at home. The team edged visiting Grambling 82-79 in its most recent game Tuesday. One Mustang with whom the Cardinal should be plenty familiar is graduate point guard Jarred Hyder, who played two seasons at Cal. He had 13 points in his only previous trip to Stanford in 2021, and when last seen by the Cardinal, was contributing to the rival Golden Bears' win in the Pacific-12 Conference tournament later that season. Hyder had 27 points in a loss at Arizona State last week, but says the Mustangs' need to focus more on defense than big offensive numbers.

Hurry adjusted to an underthrown back-shoulder ball in the front-left corner of the end zone, capping a three-play drive. It started at the Cardinal 37 after Isiah Revis made a diving interception of Ashton Daniels' third-down pass over the middle. Eget completed 33 of 49 passes with an interception for the Spartans (7-5), who await their bowl destination. His favorite target, as usual, was Nick Nash, who had eight catches for 91 yards and two scores. Nash, a finalist for the Biletnikoff Award given to the nation's best receiver, ended the regular season with 104 receptions and 16 touchdowns. Daniels hit 26 of 40 passes for 252 yards with a score and three interceptions for Stanford (3-9) while rushing for 91 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries. His 1-yard run with 7:39 remaining gave the Cardinal a 31-27 edge. But Stanford mistakes were the deciding factor. It not only lost the turnover battle 3-2 but committed 10 penalties for 115 yards. Stanford initiated scoring at the 5:49 mark of the first quarter when Emmet Kenney connected on a 24-yard field goal to cap a drive of just over seven minutes. The Cardinal reached the 10 earlier in the drive but false start and holding penalties kept them out of the end zone. San Jose State got its passing game going for 17 points in the second quarter. Eget connected with Nash for touchdown passes of 20 and 2 yards in less than four minutes, giving the Spartans a 14-3 lead with 5:25 left. Stanford got into the end zone for the first time with 42 seconds remaining on Daniels' 12-yard strike to Emmett Mosley V, but San Jose State took the momentum and three more points to the half.

Mississippi State (2-10, 0-8) went winless in conference play for the first time since 2002 and lost its 12th straight SEC game.  On the first series, the Rebels' Chris Paul Jr. stepped in and picked off Van Buren for his first career interception. Caden Davis soon drilled a 39-yard field for a 3-0 lead.  After converting a fake punt, the Bulldogs went for it again on fourth-and-7 at the Ole Miss 34. Van Buren hit Coleman on a shallow cross for a 7-3 Bulldogs lead at 7:54.

The Grizzlies entered the game with an 0-6 record in NBA Cup play over two seasons, but led throughout much of the game against the short-handed Pelicans. Memphis, which led nearly the entire game, pushed its advantage to 17 points late in the third quarter after two free throws by Jackson. Marcus Smart made and assisted several key baskets for the Grizzlies midway through the fourth quarter as New Orleans made its final run. The Pelicans trimmed the Memphis lead to nine points with 5:18 to go before Smart made a left-handed hook in the paint and followed with a walkup 3-pointer.

With Miami, Columbus and Cincinnati all losing in their Round 1 series, Orlando is the top remaining seed in the East. Manager Oscar Pareja has led Orlando to the MLS Cup playoffs in each of his first five seasons with the club after the Lions failed to make the postseason in any of their first five years in the league. Pareja, who has the most MLS wins without an MLS Cup Final appearance, understands how precious this opportunity is. ""This is history that needs to be written,"" Pareja said. ""It's a new game with the importance to get a championship, but also to advance to the MLS Cup Final. So we will be prepared. The boys are ready."" Orlando finished winless against the Red Bulls in the regular season, having drawn 1-1 at home on March 30 and lost 1-0 at the Red Bulls on June 1. But the Lions have been a far better team since Aug. 31, winning six of their final eight league games to improve their playoff positioning. The seventh-seeded Red Bulls won only three regular-season matches following that June 1 clash before finding better form as the playoffs began. That dip in form coincided with the absence of Emil Forsberg, who missed several months with a foot injury before recovering just in time for the postseason. Forsberg scored a goal in New York's series-clinching, penalty shootout win over Columbus on Nov. 3.

Kansas was also in Las Vegas on Tuesday to for a high-powered showdown with Duke. Kansas had a 32-20 first-half lead that was erased with a 12-0 spurt and neither team led by double digits the rest of the way. The Jayhawks were up 75-72 in the waning seconds when Kon Knueppel's 3-point attempt at the buzzer rimmed out. Dajuan Harris Jr. scored 14 points and added a season-high nine assists. Zeke Mayo added 12 points, and Hunter Dickinson and AJ Storr each scored 11. Dickinson was ejected from the game for kicking Duke's Maliq Brown in a scrum under the basket. The Jayhawks limited Duke freshman phenom Cooper Flagg to 13 points on nine attempts from the floor. ""Our ball screen defense was on point,"" head coach Bill Self said after the game. ""We flew around and we guarded well. The most impressive thing that we did was rebound the ball. We did a lot of good things and I am really happy with our guys. What KJ (Adams) did defensively on Cooper was good. We did a lot of good things but the biggest thing we did was find a way to win."" Dickinson leads Kansas at 16.7 points per game, joined by Mayo (12.5) and Harris (10.0) in double figures. But Kansas' depth is what makes the Jayhawks so hard to defend. Four more players are averaging between 9.7 and 7.8 points per game. Self didn't question the flagrant-2 foul on Dickinson that led to his ejection. In fact, Self believes the way the Jayhawks responded without their 7-foot-1 center might benefit them later in the season. ""(That could) be the best thing to happen to us (because) it'll teach (Dickinson) a good lesson and also it'll give some other kids some confidence,"" Self said. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Santa Clara culled its deficit to 63-58 with 7:19 to play via an 8-0 run that was started and capped by layups by Elijah Mahi.   Washington responded with a 3-pointer by DJ Davis and a pair of free throws from Zoom Diallo to boost the lead back to 10 with 4:13 remaining.

The Huskies went 0-3 in Hawaii. UConn opened the tournament with a 99-97 overtime loss to Memphis, then dropped a 73-72 decision to Colorado before falling to Dayton 85-67 in the seventh-place game. All three losses came against unranked opponents. UConn (4-3) has lost as many games this year as it did all of last season, when it finished 37-3 and won its second straight national championship. ""When you come to a tournament like this, and it's three games in three days, it starts to go bad, there's no way of fixing it because there's no time to,"" UConn coach Dan Hurley said. ""You just have to deal with the situation. It was a humbling trip, obviously, for the program that's accomplished what we've accomplished. ""We're relying on a lot of young players and the burden of wearing the uniform after back-to-backs right now looks like it's weighing heavy on the group. Right now we just have to focus on becoming a good team, and becoming a tougher team. ... Right now we're a shell of what we've been."" UConn forward Alex Karaban was taken to the hospital for a head injury following Wednesday's loss to Dayton. Karaban's head hit the floor after he was fouled late in the second half. He stayed in the game but was later placed in concussion protocol. Karaban made four of his team's eight 3-pointers and scored a team-high 21 points against Dayton. Through seven games, Karaban is averaging a team-high 15.9 points per contest. Guard Solo Ball is second on the team with 12.9 points per game. Dayton outrebounded UConn 41-25. ""We just looked so young compared to them,"" Hurley said. ""Minus Alex and Samson (Johnson) and Hassan (Diarra), we have a lot of younger players. The older guys that we brought in, obviously we're not going to be very successful if we can't get more out of them. So I just think we need to get back and we need to regroup both from a psyche standpoint and then come up with a different plan defensively for the most part. ""I think offensively we'll be fine. Defensively, though, it's been a disaster (in the tournament) for us."" UMES (2-8) is coming off Wednesday's 78-59 loss at Little Rock. Evan Johnson led UMES with 15 points, but the Hawks shot 35.1 percent from the field (20 of 57) and their road record dropped to 0-8 this season. Ketron Shaw, who is averaging a team-best 18.4 points per game, was 3-of-14 from the field in the loss, held to six points. The Hawks will enter Saturday's matchup on a four-game losing streak. ""I thought the offensive rebounding was a problem for us,"" UMES coach Cleo Hill Jr. said. ""We need to be better fundamentally in that area as it has been an issue for us throughout the year up to this point. ""I think some guys played well (against Little Rock), but we need to be better in our transition defense and moving the ball better offensively. We will regroup and rest.

Kansas City (11-1) has played in a slew of close games this season and wrapped up this win when Raiders center Jackson Powers-Johnson unexpectedly snapped the ball. It caromed off the upper right arm of quarterback Aidan O'Connell, and Nick Bolton of the Chiefs recovered it at the Kansas City 37-yard line with 11 seconds left. Mahomes threw one scoring pass to become the franchise leader with 238, surpassing Hall of Famer Len Dawson (237). Fill-in kicker Matthew Wright matched his career high of four field goals for the Chiefs. Brock Bowers and Tre Tucker caught touchdown passes for Las Vegas (2-10), which dropped its eighth straight game. Bowers had 10 receptions for a career-best 140 yards. O'Connell completed 23 of 35 passes for 340 yards and two touchdowns for the Raiders. It was his first appearance since he broke his right (throwing) thumb in Week 7 against the Los Angeles Rams. O'Connell was pressed into duty after Gardner Minshew sustained a season-ending broken collarbone in last Sunday's 29-19 loss to the Denver Broncos. Wright kicked a 32-yard field goal with 9:53 left in the game to give Kansas City a 19-17 lead. The Raiders had a chance to take the lead but Daniel Carlson was short on a 58-yard field goal attempt with 2:17 remaining. Carlson also missed attempts from 56 and 55 yards. Carlson looked in line for one final chance before the errant snap on a play from the Kansas City 32. The Raiders trailed by 13 before stunning the Chiefs with two touchdowns in a span of 1:48. Las Vegas moved within six when O'Connell tossed a 33-yard scoring pass to Bowers with 1:40 remaining in the third. The score was set up by a 68-yard kickoff return by Ameer Abdullah. Then on the first play of the fourth quarter, O'Donnell threw deep and connected with Tucker on a 58-yard touchdown to give the Raiders a 17-16 edge. Mahomes passed the mark of Dawson, who retired after the 1975 season, with a 6-yard scoring pass to Watson to give the Chiefs a 10-3 lead with 2:14 left in the first half. Wright kicked field goals of 42 and 35 yards in the third quarter to boost Kansas City's lead to 16-3. Wright was signed this week to handle place-kicking duties with Harrison Butker and last week's hero, Spencer Shrader, sidelined with injuries. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

It was one of a handful of blowout wins the Utes have had early on this season, which Utah coach Craig Smith believes can be beneficial in helping the team grow even if their games feel like pick-up matches at times. ""We just have to keep learning how to win,"" Smith said in an interview with the team's radio station.  ""We've got to keep growing. You've got to keep demanding ... have discipline, toughness. We're not as smooth as we need to be. We can play so much better on the offensive end."" Eastern Washington (1-6) has lost five straight games and enters Saturday with an 0-4 record on the road. Nic McClain leads the Eagles in scoring (16.6 points per game) and is second on the team with 5.1 rebounds per game.

Garland converted Brock Boeser's backdoor feed at 5:15 of the third period to extend his point streak to a career-long seven games.

After an underwhelming week bumped them from the AP Top 25, the Red Storm attempt to bounce back Saturday when they host Harvard in New York. St. John's (5-2) won its first four games and entered the rankings for the first time since January 2019 but promptly dropped out after a 1-2 showing in the Bahamas. The Red Storm blew an 18-point lead to then-No. 13 Baylor in a double-overtime loss and fell 66-63 to Georgia in a one-off game on Sunday. Those losses sandwiched an 80-55 thumping of Virginia to close the Baha Mar Championship. Sunday's loss was St. John's worst offensive showing of the young season. The Red Storm finished with their third-fewest points under second-year coach Rick Pitino and shot a season-low 31.1 percent from the floor. ""We had a difficult day offensively,"" Pitino said after his team shot 2-of-19 from 3-point range and lost despite forcing 24 turnovers. ""Our shots were not going down."" However, St. John's did get a few effective individual performances. Zuby Ejiofor scored 12 of his game-high 22 points at the free throw line, while Aaron Scott and RJ Luis Jr. chipped in 14 and 13 points, respectively. Kadary Richmond managed just three points on 1-of-8 shooting Sunday after tallying 26 points across his previous two games. ""As long as we play hard, fight, try to win games, I think we'll be OK,"" Pitino said. ""We're certainly not a great team, but we're a pretty good team."" Harvard (2-5) is averaging 66.9 points so far and is facing its second opponent from a power conference after a 22-point loss at Colorado on Nov. 17. The Crimson were held below 60 points for the third time and shot less than 40 percent for the fourth time when they took a 62-54 home loss to UMass on Wednesday. ""It was what we thought it would be -- the kind of game it usually has been with our two teams fighting, clawing and scratching for a chance to come out on top,"" Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said after Wednesday's game.

The Wild captain, who played just 16 games last season due to back and hip injuries, scored for the first time since April 2023 and notched the eighth multi-goal game in his 15-year career.   Trailing 2-0 midway through the second period, the Wild made some changes to their lines, and the shake-up led to two goals in a 17-second span.   Marco Rossi cut Chicago's lead in half after Marcus Johansson found him cutting to the net. Kirill Kaprizov, who played in his 300th NHL game, set up the goal with a spinning pass across the attacking zone to Johansson.   Seconds after the ensuing faceoff, Spurgeon tied when he knocked the puck into the crease, and it deflected into the net off Chicago defenseman Connor Murphy's skate with 9:11 left in the second.   Seven minutes later, Spurgeon gave Minnesota its first lead of the game when he skated across center ice and shot the puck after entering the attack zone. Chicago goalie Petr Mrazek got his glove on the puck, but it still trickled past him into the net.   Joel Eriksson Ek had two assists for the Wild. Kaprizov, Johansson, Matt Boldy and Marcus Foligno also recorded assists for Minnesota, which won for the second straight game.   Former Wild center Ryan Donato scored both goals for the Blackhawks, including a power-play tally in the second period. It was the second two-goal game of the season for Chicago's leading goal scorer, who has 10 in 21 games after never recording more than 16 in his previous eight seasons.   Tyler Bertuzzi, Alex Vlasic and Connor Bedard earned assists for the Blackhawks.   Marc-Andre Fleury got the start in net for the Wild, who will host Nashville on Saturday night. The veteran goalie, who turned 40 on Thursday, made 20 saves to win for the fifth time in six starts.   Mrazek made 26 saves for Chicago, which lost for the fifth time in seven games. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Saturday in Washington, D.C., Georgetown (5-1) will take on Albany (5-2) in the first-ever meeting of the teams. After three straight decisive wins, retooled Georgetown has shown promise behind freshman Thomas Sorber and transfers Micah Peavy (TCU) and Malik Mack (Harvard). While Sorber leads the team in points (14.8), rebounds (8.3) and blocks (1.8) per game, Mack has assumed a playmaking role as he leads the Hoyas in assists (4.2). Meanwhile, the 6-foot-8 Peavy, who averages 14.5 points and 3.2 steals per game, has provided a rare dimension as a disruptor on the perimeter and a 3-point threat, hitting a team-high 44 percent from deep. Georgetown is coming off perhaps its most complete performance of the season, dominating Wagner with its suffocating defense in a 66-41 victory on Tuesday. The Hoyas held the Seahawks to 28 percent shooting (14 of 50) from the floor and forced 18 turnovers, which Georgetown turned into 22 points. ""Wagner is an older team than us and they are a really well-coached and experienced team,"" Georgetown coach Ed Cooley said. ""I was really proud of our men and the way that we defended with a purpose."" Albany of the American East Conference enters with five days of rest after winning two of three games last weekend in the Puerto Rico Clasico. The Great Danes were hoping for a clean sweep of the event before sustaining an 81-77 loss to American on Sunday, which snapped their five-game winning streak, their longest since the 2017-18 season. Albany allowed American to shoot 64.4 percent (29 of 45) from the floor and make 9 of 16 (56.3 percent) from 3-point range. ""I just didn't think we were as competitive as we could be, which is inexcusable for a group that I think can be a conference champion,"" Albany coach Dwayne Killings said. In the three games in Puerto Rico, Albany was led by Amar'e Marshall (39 points, nine assists), Byron Joshua (37 points, nine assists, nine steals) and Justin Neely (36 points, 18 rebounds). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Harper put up 36 points, six rebounds and six assists in Rutgers' 85-84 opening win over Notre Dame, in which he delivered the go-ahead free throw late in overtime. He rewrote his career high the next night with 37 points in a 95-90 loss to No. 9 Alabama. Rutgers and its freshman phenom were slotted into the fifth-place game against No. 20 Texas A&M on Saturday in Las Vegas. The Scarlet Knights (5-2) were invited to the Players Era Festival in the first place because of their star-studded freshman class that features both Harper and fellow top-three prospect Ace Bailey. Harper showed off in Tuesday's win over the Fighting Irish that featured 10 ties, 16 lead changes and four gutsy 3-pointers by Notre Dame's Matt Allocco from the end of regulation through overtime. It was a crucial victory for Rutgers to pull out two days after it was stunned 79-77 by Kennesaw State. ""I feel great, not just for me but for the whole team,"" Harper said. ""Just how we bounced back, you know, fought through adversity. The one key thing that stood out to me (Tuesday), we're in the huddle, (co-captain Jeremiah Williams) talking about, ‘Let's learn how to win right now instead of waiting till later.'"" Harper has been fantastic on the dribble drive this week, making 21 of 32 2-pointers and a whopping 25 of 30 free throws in the two games combined. Alabama coach Nate Oats admitted Harper ""gets to the rim whenever he wants"" and none of his players could stay in front of him. Harper's classmate Bailey had a slower start to the week, with inefficient shooting against both Kennesaw State and Notre Dame, but he went 9-for-18 for 22 points against Alabama's elite squad. Rutgers is still trying to get more consistent on the boards and from the 3-point arc. The Scarlet Knights have a minus-1.5 rebounding margin this year and shot 2-for-13 from deep in the Alabama game. Another SEC opponent awaits in the Aggies (5-2), who lost 80-70 to Oregon on Tuesday but responded with a 77-73 win over No. 21 Creighton the next day. Texas A&M was unhappy with how it allowed Oregon to score the last 11 points of a close game. Facing Creighton and 7-foot-1 star center Ryan Kalkbrenner, the Aggies dominated in the paint 42-20 and grabbed 21 offensive rebounds. One of the best rebounding teams in the country last year, Texas A&M has maintained that physical identity this season and ranks sixth in D1 with a plus-12.4 rebounding margin. ""It starts with how we practice,"" guard Wade Taylor IV said. ""We have two refs in practice that are -- don't tell them I said this -- but are unbelievably terrible. One is a grad assistant, and one is an assistant coach. And they don't call anything. We just go about it every day being physical because that's who we want to be. We want to be the most physical team."" Zhuric Phelps (15.2 ppg) and Taylor (14.7) have been Texas A&M's leading scorers this year. Henry Coleman II (11.3 ppg) and Andersson Garcia (6.1) both average seven rebounds per game. Harper's 24.6 scoring average ranks third in Division I, and he adds 4.7 rebounds and 4.9 assists per contest. Bailey averages 17.8 points and 5.0 rebounds, and Jordan Derkack is a Swiss army knife in the backcourt with 8.0 points, 5.3 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 1.4 steals in seven games (six starts). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The two-way star wasted little time making a splash. His interception was on the third play of the game and his first score was an 11-yard catch to give the Buffaloes (9-3, 7-2 Big 12) a 21-0 first-quarter lead. Shedeur Sanders connected on 34-of-41 passes for 438 yards, five touchdowns and an interception, setting Colorado's single-season passing record. Koy Detmer had held that record since 1996.  Hunter had 116 yards on 10 grabs with three touchdowns and LaJohntay Wester had 11 catches for 175 yards and two touchdowns.  Micah Welch had a rushing touchdown for Colorado which kept its slim Big 12 Championship Game hopes alive. With Friday's win, the Buffaloes are a half-game ahead of the rest of the league, but two of the three teams breathing down their necks -- BYU, Arizona State or Iowa State -- need to lose tomorrow for Colorado to advance to Arlington next week. They could also get to the championship game if BYU and West Virginia both lose. Maealiuaki Smith was 11-of-29 for 70 yards and two interceptions for the Cowboys. Colorado outgained Oklahoma State 471-147. In the first quarter, the Cowboys (3-9, 0-9) offense managed 16 yards, threw a pick to Hunter on its first drive, went three-and-out on its second, had a fumble recovered by Shilo Sanders on its third and punted on its fourth. Oklahoma State had more penalty yards -- eight for 74 yards -- than it did offense -- 30 yards -- in the first half. The Cowboys had six three-and-outs and just one first down. Colorado opened the second half with Wester's 69-yard touchdown reception and its lead grew to 28-0. OSU fumbled on its next possession, which was recovered by Chidozie Nwankwo. The turnover led to Hunter's second touchdown of the game, an 8-yard pass from Sanders, and a 35-0 Buffaloes lead. After an Alejandro Mata field goal made the score 38-0, DJ McKinney returned an interception 13 yards for a touchdown and a 45-0 Colorado lead on the second play of the fourth quarter. The Buffaloes went up 52-0 when Sanders hit Hunter from 23 yards out as he was being pulled down for his third touchdown of the day. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Flyers defenseman Rasmus Ristolainen recorded an assist in his fourth straight game. Meanwhile, New York dropped its fifth straight contest despite 32 saves from Igor Shesterkin, who was particularly impressive in the first period. Vincent Trocheck scored the lone goal for the Rangers, who now return to Madison Square Garden for a five-game homestand. The Rangers had a chance to draw even with 2:20 remaining, but Mika Zibanejad flubbed a wide-open shot from the doorstep. Konecny's empty-netter sealed the deal with 28 seconds left. Just over three minutes into the game, Tyson Foerster blocked a shot at the blue line, won a race to the puck along the boards and made a perfect behind-the-back, no-look pass to Brink, who beat Shesterkin from point-blank range. Philadelphia doubled its advantage just 50 seconds later. From near his own net, Ristolainen's outlet pass connected at center ice with Sean Couturier, who found Konecny with speed. The Flyers' leading scorer zipped past Jacob Trouba, moved the puck to his backhand and slipped a shot through Shesterkin's 5-hole for his team-leading 12th of the season. New York got within 2-1 midway through the second period. With Scott Laughton skating toward the Philadelphia bench to get a new stick, Will Cuylle found Trocheck with plenty of space in the slot. Trocheck snapped a wrister past Fedotov for his fifth of the season. Konecny's empty-netter marked his fourth multi-goal game of the season and his third in November alone.

Wisconsin (5-7, 3-6) closed the season with five consecutive defeats and its first losing season since going 5-7 under Barry Alvarez in 2001. It was the longest active streak of winning seasons among Power 4 teams. The defeat also likely snapped Wisconsin's streak of 22 consecutive bowl games, as there is almost no chance the Badgers get a bid as a five-win team because of Academic Progress Rate (APR). Darius Taylor rushed for 143 yards on 32 carries for the Gophers, who had a 374-166 advantage in total yards. Wisconsin was held to just 36 yards rushing on 24 attempts.

The Gophers had two other chances to draw within one or tie the game, but Spillers blocked Patterson's layup and Garcia turned it over in the lane. It took Minnesota just over 3 1/2 minutes to score, but once it did, it got on a roll. A 16-6 run, capped by Garcia's free throw with 10:40 left in the half, gave the Golden Gophers a 16-10 lead. Minnesota didn't commit its first turnover until the 9:22 mark of the first half.

Karl-Anthony Towns (19 points, 12 rebounds) and Josh Hart (13 points, 12 rebounds) each posted a double-double for the Knicks, who trailed by 10 points in the first quarter and by six points in the fourth before improving to 3-0 in Group A play. Miles McBride added 14 points off the bench for New York, which is slated to complete Group A play Tuesday against the Orlando Magic. The Magic are 2-0 in Group A entering Friday's game against the Brooklyn Nets. The Hornets, who were without leading scorer LaMelo Ball due to a left calf injury Friday, fell to 0-3 in Group A action. Brandon Miller scored 20 points for Charlotte while Josh Green (15 points), Tidjane Salaun (14 points) and reserve KJ Simpson (11 points) also got into double figures. The Knicks led just four times in the first three quarters before the Hornets opened the fourth on an 11-5 run to extend their lead to 82-76 on Nick Smith Jr.'s 3-pointer with 9:15 left. But Charlotte missed its next six shots as New York began inching back. Brunson had nine points -- including the go-ahead jumper with 4:48 left -- during a 16-5 run that put the Knicks up 96-90 with 2:17 left.  Moussa Diabate was fouled by Brunson as he dunked with 48 seconds remaining but failed to convert the old-fashioned 3-point play. Brunson then fouled Cody Martin on the rebound, but the Hornets' forward split a pair of free throws. Brunson missed a floater on the Knicks' next possession, after which Martin missed a corner 3-pointer. Brunson was 3-of-4 from the line over the final 14 seconds.  The Hornets had the ball under their basket with three seconds left, but Green's 3-pointer circled the rim several times and didn't go through the basket until after time expired. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Jayden Williams added five triples and also finished with 18 points for the Big Green (3-3), who went 17-for-31 from deep as a team (54.8 percent). Ryan Cornish joined Haskins and Williams with 18 points, Brandon Mitchell-Day went for 14 and Connor Amundsen supplied 11. Haskins flirted with a double-double by pulling down a team-high eight rebounds. Joshua Beadle poured in 19 points as the Eagles (6-2) had a five-game winning streak come to an end. Elijah Strong paired 18 points with five boards, and Chad Venning recorded 17 points. Boston College was in an eight-point hole with 2:27 left in the game but used an 8-2 run to pull within 84-82 with 34 seconds remaining. However, Mitchell-Day and Cornish sank two free throws apiece to put the finishing touches on the win. The Eagles went 0-for-10 from distance following intermission. Shortly after scoring the first five points of the second half to build a 49-42 advantage, Boston College watched the Big Green score at will from beyond the arc. Dartmouth made good on five 3-pointers in a span of 5:47 to jump in front 63-55. The Eagles cut their deficit to four before Mitchell-Day drilled a 3 and Cornish converted a three-point play to make it 69-59 with 9:24 to play.

The Hurricanes (3-3) were embarrassed last week when they lost three games in four days at the Charleston Classic in South Carolina. On Saturday afternoon, the Hurricanes will look for a bounce-back game against visiting Charleston Southern (1-7). This will be Miami's first home game in nearly two full weeks. Miami has talent, including point guard Nijel Pack, who leads the team in scoring (15.2) and assists (4.7). The Hurricanes also have 6-foot-10 center Lynn Kidd, who is shooting 76.3 percent from the floor while averaging 11.3 points. But the Hurricanes were exposed -- at least in Charleston -- as a weak team defensively and on the boards. Drake beat Miami 14-5 on the offensive boards and won the game, 80-69. Oklahoma State shot 10-for-22 on 3-pointers and beat Miami 80-74, and VCU shot 50.9 percent from the floor to record a 77-70 win over the Hurricanes Miami coach Jim Larranaga is hoping that a player such as Paul Djobet can step up in his reserve role. ""He worked very hard in the weight room in the offseason,"" Larranaga said of Djobet. ""He's much stronger."" Meanwhile, Charleston Southern is 0-6 away from home. But the Buccaneers have played a tough schedule, including three power-conference teams: Clemson, LSU and Georgia Tech. The Buccaneers gave perhaps their best performance of the season in that 77-68 loss to LSU. Charleston Southern led 34-29 at halftime. For the game, the Buccaneers had advantages on second-chance points (21-10) and points off turnovers (22-13). Individually, Daylen Berry led Charleston Southern with 19 points and 12 rebounds. Charleston Southern's Saah Nimley is in his first season as a head coach. He is a former Buccaneers player and assistant coach. He was the Big South Conference Player of the Year in 2015. Nimley's top three players this season are Taje' Kelly, Berry and R.J. Johnson. Kelly leads the Buccaneers in scoring (14.9) and rebounds (7.1), Berry is averaging 12.1 points and a team-high 2.4 steals and Johnson is contributing 10.1 points and a club-best 4.8 assists. In addition, freshman guard Anthony Gause is a player to watch. He is fourth on the team in scoring (9.3). ""He's a supreme talent,"" Nimley said of Gause. ""He's got to work on some things, particularly on defense. But he's going to be a really good player."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Sometimes you can get humbled in thinking that you're a little better than you are. That's on all of us. Starting from the top all the way down the program."" A pair of heavily relied on sophomores in Baye Ndongo and Naithan George each led the team with 17 points in the win. Ndongo paces the team with 14.2 points and 7.7 rebounds per game. Lance Terry adds 13 points per contest, followed by Javian McCollum (12.8). Central Arkansas (2-4) is coming off a 92-83 double-overtime win over UNC Asheville.

The Pirates have had a week off to chart their next steps before Monmouth pays a visit Saturday to Newark, N.J. Seton Hall (4-3) narrowly beat Saint Peter's to begin the season, then lost by a point to both Fordham and Hofstra. After holding Wagner to a mere 28 points in a victory on Nov. 16, the team headed to Charleston and placed third. The Pirates beat VCU in overtime, lost 76-60 to Vanderbilt and then hung on for a 63-61 defeat of Florida Atlantic last Sunday. ""We don't play until Saturday, we got a couple days. I gotta see what lineups work best together,"" Seton Hall coach Shaheen Holloway told reporters at the time. ""But happy to come out 2-1 ... Florida Atlantic is really good, VCU is really good, so to beat those two teams, it's good for us."" The Pirates have the No. 4 scoring defense in Division I (55.7 points per game allowed) and Chaunce Jenkins leads the offense with 14.1 points per game. Question marks dot the rest of the transfer-heavy roster, and Seton Hall ranks near the bottom of Division I at 58.1 points per game. In this all-New Jersey matchup, the Pirates get to face one of seven remaining winless teams in Monmouth (0-8). The Hawks played at a multi-team event hosted by Stephen F. Austin and lost their three games by 10, five and 10 points. Jack Collins led Monmouth in scoring for the first time this season with 25 points in a 71-61 loss to Presbyterian. ""I was so happy for Jack Collins that he played like we all know he can,"" Monmouth coach King Rice said. ""We have to get tougher and there's some things that we know we can fix. We just have to keep working together to get our chemistry."" Abdi Bashir Jr. leads Monmouth with 19.5 points per game. In his last game against a power-conference foe, he dropped 38 points on Rutgers with a program-record 10 3-pointers in a 98-81 loss on Nov. 15. Bashir scored 30 against Stephen F. Austin but was held to 0-for-6 shooting and four points the next day against Presbyterian. When Seton Hall hosted Monmouth last year, the Hawks made the Pirates work for a 70-61 win.

""I thank Matt for his hard work, professionalism and dedication to our organization. We extend our gratitude for his commitment to the Chicago Bears and wish him and his family the best moving forward."" Warren said he supported the decision made by the organization on Friday.

""Our fans have stood by us and persevered through every challenge, and they deserve better results. Our organizational and operational structure is strong, focused, aligned and energized for the future."" Offensive coordinator Thomas Brown will serve as interim head coach. His dismissal came shortly after Eberflus conveyed plans to conduct business as usual during his Friday morning news conference with reporters. He was then scheduled to meet with Warren and Poles. ""The operation has been normal,"" Eberflus said of his plans for Friday in the office, with players home for the long weekend before returning to practice Monday.

""I'm confident that I'll be working on to San Francisco and getting ready for that game,"" Eberflus said, pointing to the Week 14 matchup with the 49ers.  Eberflus, 54, won his coaching debut with the Bears, 19-10 over the 49ers in 2022, but is 13-32 since.

The Lions have been devastated by injuries on defense. Rodriguez will be the fourth linebacker to hit injured reserve with a major injury in 2024 and Detroit is also without star defensive end Aidan Hutchinson. Derrick Barnes injured a knee in Week 3, when Rodriguez became a key part of the LB corps, and Alex Anzalone suffered a broken forearm in Week 11, pushing Rodriguez into a featured role in Detroit's defense. Jalen Reeves-Maybin (neck) is also on IR. Ezekiel Turner and Ben Niemann are options to join Jack Campbell in the starting lineup. Defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn said the Lions have a room full of linebackers who deserve a shot on game day. That opportunity is now for what Glenn labeled his ""next guy"" when the Lions (11-1) host the Green Bay Packers (9-3) in a critical NFC North game next Thursday. ""All those guys have played, all those guys deserve to play, and each week we try to put them in packages so they can play,"" Glenn said. Defensive ends Marcus Davenport and John Cominsky are also on IR. Anzalone could return for the playoffs or late in the regular season. Rodriguez, 25, was a sixth-round pick in 2022. He had 27 tackles and two sacks in 10 games (six starts) this season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

He told the Bluejays as much after their latest loss Wednesday, a 77-73 defeat at the hands of No. 20 Texas A&M at the Players Era Festival in Las Vegas. Creighton (4-3) looks to bounce back Saturday against Notre Dame (4-3) in the tournament's seventh-place game. ""Same thing I've told my teams for 36 years, teams who point fingers lose. And we're not going to do that,"" McDermott said. Pop Isaacs scored 25 and dished out six assists against the Aggies, connecting five times from beyond the arc. Jackson McAndrew added a season-best 16 points and Steven Ashworth scored 14 after being out with an injury earlier in the week. Ryan Kalkbrenner finished with nine points, 10 rebounds and five blocks. McDermott found positives in the defeat, including the play of McAndrew, who made three 3-pointers against the Aggies and is averaging 9.4 points on the season. ""I think his ceiling is ridiculously high,"" McDermott said of the 6-foot-10 freshman. ""He hasn't even scratched the surface yet. That's just a young man who trusts his work, that's put in the amount of repetition that you have to, to be a great shooter."" Isaacs ranks second in scoring for the Bluejays with 16.2 points per outing. Ashworth is putting up 15.7 points per game. Kalkbrenner leads the team in scoring (18.1) and rebounding (8.6) and has blocked at least one shot in 21 consecutive games, the longest streak nationally. Notre Dame also is coming off a loss to a nationally ranked opponent, falling 65-54 to No. 6 Houston on Wednesday after battling throughout the game. Tae Davis scored 22 points and grabbed eight rebounds in the loss. The Irish were playing without reigning ACC Rookie of the Year Markus Burton, who exited Tuesday's game against Rutgers with a knee injury. It appears he will be out at least a week, perhaps longer. Burton told reporters he's thankful for the support and is proud of his team for the way it continues to battle. ""As in everything I do in basketball, I will attack my rehab and give it my best to get back on the floor at full strength as soon as possible,"" Burton said. Head coach Micah Shrewsberry is glad Burton won't be out for the rest of the year. ""We are thankful that Markus will be back at full strength,"" Shrewsberry told reporters. ""I have full faith in our athletic trainer and our entire medical staff to put Markus in the best position to return to the court when it is the right time."" Notre Dame has dropped three in a row and hopes to find a way to get back on track without Burton the court. Burton is the Irish's leading scorer with 18.2 points per game. Braeden Shrewsberry ranks second at 15.1 points per contest and Davis is averaging 14.1. Matt Allocco also boasts a double-digit scoring average (10.3). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Johnson is ranked as a top 10 player overall by Field Level Media in the 2025 draft rankings,  The defensive MVP of the national championship game in January, Johnson has two interception returns for touchdowns this season. He had four picks last season for the undefeated Wolverines, including an interception of then-quarterback Kyle McCord in the rivalry game against Ohio State that featured Johnson matching up with 2023 first-rounder Marvin Harrison Jr.  Without Johnson on the field, opponents are averaging 6.6 yards per pass attempt.

Head coach Doug Pederson confirmed Friday that Lawrence will be the QB1 Sunday when Jacksonville welcomes the Houston Texans. Lawrence cleared tests this week with practice workouts that began Monday following the team's bye last week. Lawrence described his physical status as ""feeling better"" but earlier in the week said surgery remains an option at some point. The Jaguars (2-9) host the AFC South-leading Texans (7-5) at EverBank Stadium in a rematch of Jacksonville's Week 4 loss at Houston. ""That's what I want. I want to be back on the field playing with my teammates and that's the plan,"" Lawrence said Wednesday. Lawrence, 25, said a shoulder operation is ""definitely something I'm considering and not off the table at all."" ""It has been pretty a difficult thing to gauge what's the best path forward,"" he said. ""Hopefully, I'm able to get back out there this week or as soon as possible, then it's going to be just every week kind of evaluating it, seeing where it's at. Up until this point, I've been doing everything I can to avoid that. I want to be back out there with my guys and finish the season. That's my goal. That's what I want to do. Beyond that, I don't know."" Lawrence was hurt in the Jaguars' Week 9 loss at Philadelphia. Mac Jones led the offense in his absence. Jacksonville returned from a bye last week and Lawrence was able to practice on Monday, but said he felt the clear benefit of rest during the downtime. He has completed 168 of 274 passes for 2,004 yards and 11 touchdowns with six interceptions this season. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Less than 24 hours after Eberflus experienced a six straight defeat and third consecutive loss decided on the final play, the third-year coach conveyed plans to conduct business as usual before a Friday afternoon meeting with team president Kevin Warren and general manager Ryan Poles.  ""The operation has been normal,"" Eberflus said of his plans for Friday in the office with players home for the long weekend before returning to practice Monday. The Bears have never fired a coach in-season and Eberflus indicated he doesn't expect to be the first.  ""I'm confident that I'll be working on to San Francisco and getting ready for that game,"" Eberflus said, pointing to the Week 14 matchup with the 49ers. He won his coaching debut with the Bears, 19-10, in 2022 but is 13-32 since. On Thursday, Chicago lost 23-20 at Detroit, rallying from a dormant first half and had the ball in field-goal range when quarterback Caleb Williams was sacked. In a sequence that began with 32 seconds on the game clock, the Bears had options. They could have spiked the ball to stop the clock, attempting what would have been around a 60-yard field goal or going for a first down with plenty of time to ""clock"" the ball.  Another option Eberflus chose not to use was calling a timeout. Instead, the ball was snapped 28 seconds later and Williams heaved an incompletion down the right sideline as time expired.  Media members repeatedly have questioned Eberflus in press conference settings about taking personal accountability. But on Friday he said the Bears handled the final sequence appropriately and ""the operation wasn't fast enough."" Wide receiver Keenan Allen said Thursday afternoon that ""we did enough as players to win the game."" Williams said the timeout call wasn't his to make. ""We can call a timeout there or we cannot,"" he said. ""I'm not going to say I was surprised. My job is just to go out there and make plays. I let the coaches and everybody make that decision - it is their call. Maybe in the later years of my career, it will be my call."" Poles paid a personal visit to Williams in the locker room for a discussion, and Warren stood watch to take in the wide-lens scene of the locker room packing to return to Chicago with an 0-3 record in the NFC North. The Bears had chances to beat all three division opponents but the Packers blocked a game-winning FG attempt by Cairo Santos, the Vikings escaped Chicago with a 30-27 overtime win and the Lions wriggled away Thanksgiving Day with Chicago more than threatening in the final minute.  When Poles and Warren meet with Eberflus, and Bears chairman George McCaskey joins the discussion as he did in January with support for Eberflus to return, they will likely incorporate what they've heard from players in the locker room. It's also fair to presume they're listening to open discussion from Eberflus' peers on the late-game braincramp. New England Patriots first-year coach Jerod Mayo stepped away from the final minute of the Bears' loss on CBS Thursday to talk to his coaches and support staff about the time management elements in play and how they would navigate the situation.

Wisconsin (7-0) hasn't played since Sunday's 81-75 victory over Pittsburgh in the Greenbrier Tip-Off tournament. The Badgers are off to their best start since 2014-15, a season in which they reached the NCAA Tournament final. Chicago State (0-8) lost to Drexel 83-71 in Tuesday's third-place game at the Sunshine Slam in Daytona Beach, Fla. The Badgers returned just two starters -- Steven Crowl and Max Klesmit -- after leading scorer AJ Storr transferred to Kansas and three-year starter Chucky Hepburn departed to Louisville. Graduate transfer John Tonje, limited to eight games last season at Missouri due to medical issues, has come on to average a team-best 23.0 points per game, including a career-high 41 in a Nov. 15 win over Arizona. He is shooting 95.2 percent from the free-throw line, tops in the country among players with 30 or more attempts. Tonje was named Big Ten Player of the Week on Monday for the second consecutive week. He scored 25 of his team-high 33 points in the second half in the comeback win over Pitt, finishing a perfect 10 of 10 from the line. ""It's like he's been here four years,"" Wisconsin coach Greg Gard said of Tonje. ""He's fit in perfectly within the culture, because he's a really good person. He cares about his team, he cares about winning."" John Blackwell and Nolan Winter moved into the starting lineup this season. Blackwell is second in scoring at 16.0 per game, including a career-high 30 vs. UT-Rio Grande Valley. Winter adds 9.3 points and a team-high 5.6 boards. Wisconsin, long known for its defensive style, has scored at least 79 points in each of its first seven games -- the longest such streak in school history. The Badgers are averaging 86.9 points per game, while allowing 71.6. Wisconsin entered the week leading the nation in free-throw percentage at 86.5 percent. The Badgers have made more free throws (147) than their opponents have attempted (131). Chicago State, which joined the Northeast Conference this season, averages just 59.1 points per game, allowing 84.4. The Cougars' point differential of minus-25.3 ranks 351st out of 355 teams in scoring margin. First-year coach Scott Spinelli's squad has struggled offensively, shooting just 34.4 percent overall and 29.7 percent from 3-point range. They are shooting 65.0 percent from the free-throw line, averaging 11.1 attempts per game to 17.4 for opponents. Jalen Forrest averages a team-high 9.5 points, and Quincy Allen is the leading rebounder at 4.3. Spinelli knew his team, which finished 13-19 last season, would face challenges in his first year. ""We've got kind of a new bunch here of players, a lot of new faces,"" Spinelli said at the Northeast Conference media day before the season. ""We lost 75 percent of our scoring from last year.

The Falcons are seeking their first winning season and playoff appearance since 2017. Prior to the bye last week, Atlanta lost 38-6 on the road to the Denver Broncos. The offense managed just 226 total yards, while producing its lowest point total of the season. The Falcons' defense didn't fare much better, as the unit was gashed by rookie quarterback Bo Nix, who threw four touchdowns. QB Kirk Cousins has thrown for 2,807 yards -- good for fifth in the NFL -- and would become the first Falcons quarterback since Matt Ryan in 2008 to lead the team to the playoffs in his first year. Chargers first-year head coach Jim Harbaugh has his team in the second AFC wild-card spot, sandwiched between the 8-4 Baltimore Ravens and 7-5 Broncos and gained more breathing room with Miami's loss at Green Bay on Thanksgiving night. After starting the year 3-3, the Chargers won four games in a row before dropping their home game Monday to the Ravens, 30-23. In a battle between Jim and his brother John, Los Angeles squandered a 10-0, second-quarter lead. Making matters worse, starting running back J.K. Dobbins suffered an MCL sprain in his left knee in the loss, and is expected to be out this week. He is considered week-to-week beyond that. Chargers backup running backs Gus Edwards and Hassan Haskins will try to account for the absence of Dobbins, who's rushed for 766 yards and eight touchdowns this season. Pittsburgh Steelers (8-3) at Cincinnati Bengals (4-7), 1 p.m., CBS Steelers coach Mike Tomlin heaped praise upon Bengals QB Joe Burrow for his MVP-level play in 2024 and warned his troops this road trip isn't one to take lightly. Pittsburgh isn't panicked after a surprising Thursday night loss at Cleveland last week and with 10 days between games, Tomlin expects an effort representative of a division leader on Sunday. All three of the Steelers' losses this season have come against teams that currently have a losing record. Pittsburgh also fell to the Dallas Cowboys and Indianapolis Colts. The Bengals have been in a rut -- with three losses in their past four games -- and were on the wrong end of a 34-27 decision against the Chargers on Nov. 17. Like Pittsburgh, Cincinnati came back from a sizable deficit only to lose the last time out.  Joe Burrow threw three second-half touchdown passes against Los Angeles as the Bengals climbed out of a 27-6 hole, but Chargers running back J.K. Dobbins found the end zone from 29 yards out with 18 seconds left in regulation to break a 27-27 tie. Burrow went 28-for-50 passing for 356 yards and the three TDs. Making things harder for the Steelers could be the absence of linebacker Alex Highsmith, who did not practice on Wednesday because of an ankle injury that has forced him to miss two games. Houston Texans (7-5) at Jacksonville Jaguars (2-9), 1 p.m., FOX A week after a demoralizing loss to the Tennessee Titans, the AFC South-leading Texans visit Jacksonville with the Jaguars rested following a bye week. The week prior, Jacksonville was overwhelmed in a humiliating 52-6 loss to the Detroit Lions. It marked the fourth straight setback for the Jaguars, who had dropped their previous three games by a combined 13 points. Jaguars coach Doug Pederson noted that changes are coming, although he opted not to show his cards. QB Trevor Lawrence, who has not played since Nov. 3 due to a left shoulder injury, is eager to play and compete against Texans QB C.J. Stroud, who has run into some struggles during his sophomore season. Stroud has thrown nine interceptions in 12 games (all starts) after throwing only five as a rookie. He was picked off twice in the 32-27 setback against Tennessee, also throwing for 247 yards and two touchdowns on 20-for-33 passing. The Texans have lost three of their past four games and four of their past six as defenses continue to solve Stroud. The Texans topped Jacksonville 24-20 back on Sept. 29. Arizona Cardinals (6-5) at Minnesota Vikings (9-2), 1 p.m., FOX Add the Minnesota Vikings to the observers who were urging the Bears to use a time out in the final 25 seconds of their Thanksgiving Day loss to the Lions, who maintained a one-game lead in the NFC North by hanging on for a 23-20 win. With their focus back on the field, the Vikings are targeting a second five-game winning streak this season when the Cardinals come to town. Minnesota claimed a 30-27 overtime win on the road against the Bears last Sunday. The Vikings have won each of their past three games on the road, and they return home for the first time since beating the Indianapolis Colts 21-13 four weeks ago. Arizona is trying to return to winning after a 16-6 defeat on the road against the Seattle Seahawks last week. The defeat snapped a four-game winning streak for the Cardinals, who started the season 2-4 but have gone 4-1 since then. But Sunday's game and a rematch against Seattle could prove pivotal for his team's postseason hopes. Two wins would put Arizona at 8-5; two losses put the team below .500. Kyler Murray owns a 98.0 passer rating, throwing for 2,343 yards, 12 touchdowns and four interceptions. He also has 380 yards and four touchdowns on the ground. James Conner is Arizona's top backfield threat with 705 rushing yards and five touchdowns. Tight end Trey McBride has a team-high 61 catches for 685 yards. Indianapolis Colts (5-7) at New England Patriots (3-9), 1 p.m., CBS Penalties crippled the Colts' offense and erased multiple big plays by QB Anthony Richardson in Week 12, a loss to the Lions that left the locker room frustrated. But all is not lost for the Colts as they hit the road for another AFC East opponent.  Richardson and Co. collected only 11 first downs in a 24-6 loss to the Detroit Lions. Richardson completed 11 of 28 passes for 172 yards. He was also the Colts' leading rusher (10 carries, 61 yards). Star running back Jonathan Taylor was held to 35 yards on 11 carries against Detroit, but Indianapolis coach Shane Steichen is hopeful that he will do more damage against the Patriots. Getting the run going could become even more important if wide receivers Josh Downs, Alec Pierce and Ashton Dulin aren't able to take the field. All three wouldn't have practiced on Wednesday had the Colts not opted to simply do a walkthrough. Downs' absence could end up hurting Indianapolis the most. The second-year man has a team-leading 53 catches for 594 yards and four TDs. Patriots rookie QB Drake Maye said he's not worried about the so-called wall first-year players often encounter with the longer NFL season. Maye makes his ninth appearance (eighth start) of the campaign. He didn't excel in the Patriots' 34-15 loss to the Miami Dolphins last Sunday. He finished with 222 yards, one touchdown and one interception on 22-of-37 passing. Seattle Seahawks (6-5) at New York Jets (3-8), 1 p.m. ET, FOX Most of the focus for the Jets, who have lost six of their past seven games, already points to next season. That's part of the reason they might not risk a hobbled Breece Hall, who has 632 yards rushing along with 46 catches for 401 yards and six total touchdowns this season but began the week with a knee injury coming out of the bye week. QB Aaron Rodgers, who turns 41 Monday, wasn't among those listed on the injury report for the first time since September.  The streaky Seahawks are back to their winning ways and are tied with the Cardinals atop the NFC West. After opening the season by going 3-0, Seattle lost five of its next six games before winning its past two against division rivals. Coach Mike Macdonald's defense has been much improved since a bye in Week 10, as the Seahawks defeated the host San Francisco 49ers 20-17 and visiting Arizona 16-6 over the past two weeks. Coby Bryant returned an interception 69 yards for a touchdown and Leonard Williams had 2.5 sacks against the Cardinals. Tennessee Titans (3-8) at Washington Commanders (7-5), 1 p.m. ET, CBS Trade deadline acquisition Marshon Lattimore, a physical cornerback picked up from the Saints, could debut for the Commanders. They could use a jolt. Having lost three straight after a 7-2 start, the Commanders last won Nov. 3 on Hail Mary touchdown from rookie QB Jayden Daniels. Tennessee is coming off a 33-27 upset of the Houston Texans that featured one of Will Levis' best starts of the season. Washington has lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys the past three weeks and enters Week 13 two games behind the NFC East-leading Eagles. After sputtering for three quarters against Dallas, Washington scored 17 fourth-quarter points in a wild 34-26 loss last week. Daniels completed 25 of 38 passes for 274 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions, but 86 of those yards came on a late catch-and-run score by Terry McLaurin. In the three recent losses, Daniels has a 61.5 completion percentage, three touchdowns, three interceptions and a 77.7 passer rating while being sacked 10 times. Daniels did have his best rushing day since Week 1 when he gained 74 yards against Dallas. Improvement might not come easy. The Titans' defense that ranks second in the NFL behind the Eagles, giving up just 276.4 yards per game. Levis returned from his right shoulder injury and the Titans have averaged 224.3 passing yards per game, with nine touchdown passes and six interceptions in the past six outings. RB Tony Pollard had his best game of the season against Houston, rushing 24 times for 119 yards and a touchdown. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (5-6) at Carolina Panthers (3-8), 4:05 p.m. ET, FOX Few introductions are needed on Sunday, as first-year Panthers coach Dave Canales came to Carolina after serving as Buccaneers offensive coordinator a season ago. Canales' prized pupil last season, Tampa Bay quarterback Baker Mayfield was with the Panthers for part of the 2022 campaign. The Buccaneers (5-6) playing a division opponent for the first time since an Oct. 27 loss to the Atlanta Falcons. The goal will be notching back-to-back wins for the first time since the first two weeks of the season. Four different ball-carriers, including Mayfield, found the end zone on the ground during a 30-7 drubbing of the New York Giants last Sunday. Mayfield also completed 24 of 30 passes for 294 yards. Star wideout Mike Evans was back in action for Tampa Bay following a three-game absence due to a hamstring injury. He finished with five receptions for 68 yards against the Giants and now gets a crack at a Carolina team allowing a league-high 30.9 points per game this season.  However, the Panthers have tightened up their play as of late, winning two games in a row before hanging with the two-time defending champion Kansas City Chiefs in a 30-27 setback last Sunday. The outing against Kansas City may have been the most efficient performance of Panthers quarterback Bryce Young's two-year career. Young completed 21 of 35 passes for 263 yards and one score without throwing a pick.  Carolina and Tampa Bay might as well get used to each other, as the two teams will collide again in four weeks. Los Angeles Rams (5-6) at New Orleans Saints (4-7), 4:05 p.m. ET, FOX The Saints won both games they have played since interim head coach Darren Rizzi was promoted from special teams coordinator to replace Dennis Allen, who was fired Nov. 4 after a seven-game losing streak. New Orleans comes out of its bye sitting in third place in the NFC South, two games behind the Falcons and one game behind the Buccaneers. The Rams' visit will be the third straight home game for Rizzi as interim head coach. The Saints beat the Falcons 20-17 in his debut and followed that with a 35-14 victory over Cleveland in which they outscored the Browns 21-0 in the fourth quarter. A series of significant injuries contributed to the losing streak, but New Orleans has gotten progressively healthier in recent weeks. Quarterback Derek Carr improved in each of the last three contests after returning from a three-game absence caused by an oblique strain. The return of center Erik McCoy from groin surgery after a seven-game absence was a boost against the Browns. The Saints' signing of veteran receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling on Oct. 22 with top receivers Chris Olave and Rashid Shaheed injured has given Carr a much-needed big-play threat. In the past two games, Valdes-Scantling has three touchdown receptions and has averaged 39.2 yards on five catches. The Rams are coming off a 37-20 home loss against the Eagles on Sunday night, their second defeat in three games after a three-game winning streak. They are tied with the San Francisco 49ers for last place in the NFC West, but they're just one game behind the first-place Seahawks and Cardinals and have one game remaining against each of the three rivals. Coach Sean McVay called the loss to the Eagles ""a humbling night"" after his team struggled on both sides of the ball. The defense allowed Saquon Barkley to rush for a career-high and franchise-record 255 yards as well as two touchdowns, and Los Angeles quarterback Matthew Stafford was sacked five times.  Philadelphia Eagles (9-2) at Baltimore Ravens (8-4), 4:25 p.m. ET, CBS The Eagles have won seven in a row and play four of their final six games in Philadelphia, traveling only about 125 miles to visit the Ravens this weekend and the Commanders in Week 16. Sunday's game features the NFL's two leading rushers. Saquon Barkley (1,392 yards) and Derrick Henry (1,325) are far ahead of Green Bay's Josh Jacobs (944) in third place. Henry leads the league with 13 rushing touchdowns. Barkley (10) is tied for fourth and Philadelphia quarterback Jalen Hurts (11) tied for second. The matchup also features two of the top candidates for Most Valuable Player honors entering Week 13 in Barkley and Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson, who won his second MVP award last season. Their competition includes quarterbacks Josh Allen of Buffalo and Jared Goff of Detroit, with Allen widely considered the favorite. The showdown at M&T Bank Stadium also pits Baltimore's No. 1 offense (426.7 yards per game) and No. 2 scoring offense (30.3 points per game) against Philadelphia's No. 1 defense (274.6) and No. 6 scoring defense (18.1). The Eagles have held seven consecutive opponents to under 300 total yards, while the Ravens have gained at least 329 yards of offense in all 11 games. Philadelphia is coming off a 37-20 road win over the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday night in which Barkley smashed the franchise record with 255 rushing yards. Baltimore also earned a prime-time win in Los Angeles last week, defeating the Chargers 30-23 in the ""Harbaugh Bowl"" on Monday night behind Jackson's three touchdowns (two passing, one rushing). Philadelphia is 5-1 away from home this season -- 6-1 if you count their season-opening ""home"" victory against the Packers in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Baltimore is 4-1 at home. San Francisco 49ers (5-6) at Buffalo Bills (9-2), 8:20 p.m. ET, NBC Buffalo can clinch the AFC East before the calendar flips to December while the 49ers are staggered and stumble into New York bracing for snow with a good chance of backups in the forecast. QB Brock Purdy (shoulder) missed the Week 12 loss at Green Bay and San Francisco was also without All-Pro DE Nick Bosa (oblique, hip), with LT Trent Williams (ankle) motoring through the locker room this week on a knee scooter. Buffalo is not the ideal place to try to get healthy. The Bills dealt the Chiefs their only loss this season and Buffalo has scored at least 30 points in five consecutive games. QB Josh Allen has passed for 18 touchdowns against five interceptions this season after throwing a career-worst 18 picks last season. San Francisco got walloped last week without Purdy, falling 38-10 to the host Packers. Brandon Allen started at quarterback and completed 17 of 29 passes for 199 yards with one touchdown pass, one interception and one lost fumble. Allen is 2-8 as an NFL starter. He is again getting heavy work in practice in case Purdy's shoulder doesn't significantly improve. The 49ers could use a big performance from running back Christian McCaffrey, who had just 31 yards on 11 carries and caught three passes for 37 yards against Green Bay. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""We need that one win,"" said Bearcats running back Corey Kiner. ""We're trying to send the seniors out right. The underclassmen understand that, the older guys understand that, everybody understands that."" Understanding and doing are two different things, though, as Cincinnati (5-6, 3-5) has learned during a four-game losing streak that has brought the team to the brink of elimination from bowl eligibility.  The Bearcats were never in last week's 41-15 loss at Kansas State, trailing 27-3 at halftime. They allowed 281 yards on the ground and couldn't get Kiner going until it was too late. Kiner, the first Cincinnati player with back-to-back 1,000-yard rushing seasons since Michael Warren in 2018-19, eventually ran for 140 yards. But with the defense getting gashed constantly on the ground, his contributions weren't close to being enough. Meanwhile, the Horned Frogs (7-4, 5-3) improved their bowl standing last week by stomping Arizona 49-28 on their Senior Day. It was the fourth win in the last five games for TCU, which scored touchdowns on five straight drives to break the game open. One key to the Horned Frogs' recent success has been an increased deployment of wide receiver Savion Williams in the backfield. He rushed for 80 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona and now has 312 yards on the ground, good for second on the team. ""There was one play against Utah and it was supposed to be a one-off,"" TCU coach Sonny Dykes said of the strategy. ""And then it was like, 'That was really good, let's do that again.' I think this has helped his draft status unbelievably."" In addition to his rushing total, Williams is also second on the team with 57 receptions for 596 yards and six TDs. This will be the first meeting of the teams since 2004, when Cincinnati earned a 21-10 home win. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

That's hardly the case on Saturday in Chapel Hill, N.C., where North Carolina's Mack Brown coaches his final home game against rival North Carolina State. The university announced Tuesday that Brown, 73, will not return next season, despite Brown telling reporters on Monday he planned to be back in 2025. ""While this was not the perfect time and way in which I imagined going out, no time will ever be the perfect time,"" Brown said in a statement. ""We've had the chance to coach and mentor some great young men, and we'll miss having the opportunity to do that in the future. ... We want to send these seniors out right and I hope our fans will show up Saturday to do the same."" In addition to the emotionally charged atmosphere at Kenan Stadium for the host Tar Heels (6-5, 3-4 Atlantic Coast Conference), the Wolfpack (5-6, 2-5) desperately need a victory to become bowl eligible. A loss to North Carolina would mark just the third losing season for the Wolfpack since Dave Doeren took over in 2013. NC State is coming off a 30-29 defeat at Georgia Tech in which the Yellow Jackets regained the lead with 22 seconds left on an 18-yard run by Aaron Philo. True freshman CJ Bailey has completed 63.7 percent of his passes for 1,941 yards and 12 touchdowns with eight interceptions. Bailey has also rushed for 201 yards and five touchdowns. With three straight wins over the Tar Heels, Doeren knows how significant a fourth would be, especially considering it would send the Wolfpack to a bowl game and end Brown's tenure on a sour note. ""I'm a little different,"" Doeren said. ""I guess I don't treat it as a normal game. ... It's something that matters deeply. Not just to Dave Doeren. It matters a lot to the former players. It matters a lot to the alumni, to the donors, to the administration. It's not that the other games don't matter. They do, but this one runs deeper."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Unfortunately for the Bruins, they weren't able to secure a bowl berth and their 2024 campaign will conclude on Saturday afternoon with a nonconference game against visiting Fresno State. UCLA (4-7) needed to win its final two games to qualify for a bowl, however those hopes were dashed with a 19-13 loss to crosstown rival Southern Cal last Saturday at the Rose Bowl. ""They kept rebounding this whole season, so they will continue to be resilient and be the type of football players that I know they are,"" UCLA first-year coach DeShaun Foster said. ""The season is not over. They signed up to play ball, and we are going to finish the season on a good note. Our guys will get out there, and I am going to try to send the seniors off the right way."" UCLA recovered from a five-game losing streak by winning three in a row, but a 31-19 loss at Washington on Nov. 15 put the Bruins into a must-win situation against the Trojans. UCLA held a 13-9 lead entering the fourth quarter versus Southern Cal but only managed one first down on its final three possessions. ""We let one slip through our hands,"" Foster said. ""All of these losses have come to, pretty much, us just letting it slip through our hands. We have to find a way to finish games and just keep coming out after the half and play better and finish a game. We have to really put our stamp on the end of it. We've just got to learn from this."" Fresno State (6-5) secured a bowl bid with a 28-22 win against visiting Colorado State on Saturday. Bulldogs running back Bryson Donelson rushed for 140 yards and a touchdown on 12 carries, but the true freshman sustained a leg injury late in the game. He will be a game-time decision against UCLA.

""All of that should add to their motivation."" The Spartans (5-6, 3-4 Big Ten) snapped a three-game losing streak last weekend, holding on for a 24-17 win over Purdue to put them in a position for a postseason berth.  Aidan Chiles, who has passed for 2,265 yards and 12 touchdowns, has not thrown any interceptions in his last two starts after tossing 11 in his first nine games. ""A tremendous athlete,"" Rutgers coach Greg Schiano said of Chiles. ""Really, a quarterback that you can see is just getting better and better each week. We recruited him. We're very familiar with him. We really wanted him. He ended up going to Oregon State and now he's at Michigan State, but somebody that we really thought was an excellent player."" The Scarlet Knights (6-5, 3-4) are trying to rebound from a crushing 38-31 loss to then-No. 25 Illinois. Rutgers gave up a 40-yard, game-winning touchdown pass with four seconds left. Schiano expects to see the best from Michigan State. ""I think it's a huge challenge going on the road, playing a team that's certainly motivated with bowl aspirations but I don't worry about the other team,"" Schiano said. ""I learn about the other team. We use it to educate ourselves, but our team has overcome adversity all season and they will overcome it again."" With game-time temperatures expected in the low 30s, the Scarlet Knights will likely need to rely on the run game led by Kyle Monangai, whose 122 rushing yards against Illinois gave him 1,150 for the season. A win Saturday would give Rutgers its best regular season finish since 2014. ""We've had a lot of things that can test your will, test your focus,"" Schiano said.

Last week's 41-21 triumph over North Carolina helped the Eagles (6-5, 3-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) continue their late-season peak, while the Panthers (7-4, 3-4) have dropped four straight following a 37-9 loss at Louisville. Boston College's offense has continually developed in two full weeks with Grayson James taking over under center for the departed Thomas Castellanos. That has helped the Eagles extend their season beyond the task of facing a tough, physical Pitt team this week. ""For us in our first year, to be able to qualify for a bowl, says a lot about the players and the coaching staff. Those guys did a great job,"" Boston College coach Bill O'Brien said. ""We got hired in February. We're just very proud of the fact that we're able to go to a bowl."" James threw for 192 yards and a touchdown while also running for a score last week. The FIU transfer targeted Lewis Bond for a career-high nine catches and 81 yards, and freshman Johnathan Montague grabbed his first career touchdown. ""He's seeing it all (in the game),"" O'Brien said of James. ""That's one of the things that you see with him -- the more reps you get, the more improvement you'll see. He works very, very hard."" At stake is the Eagles' first seven-win regular season since 2018. Injuries have riddled Pitt of late, resulting in a skid dating back to an Oct. 24 win over Syracuse. Redshirt freshman quarterback Eli Holstein missed the Clemson game, a 24-20 loss, two weeks ago before being carted off with a leg injury in the first quarter against Louisville.  However, Holstein has not been ruled out moving forward. ""(The injury) is not season-ending,"" coach Pat Narduzzi said. ""It's not as bad as the one that he took a week ago."" Nate Yarnell entered into both situations, producing a 350-yard game against Clemson before throwing for 96 with a touchdown versus Louisville. In the latter contest, the Panthers were outgained 507-265 and trailed 27-0 before scoring and threw three interceptions. Attitude and effort have not wavered despite the depleted depth chart, which has also lost veteran lineman Branson Taylor. ""We've been unhealthy -- we've been unable to stay healthy, really, since the Cal game (a 17-15 win on Oct. 12),"" Narduzzi said. ""It's a perfect storm (at Louisville).

Texas Tech (7-4, 5-3) will attempt to reach six conference victories in a season for only the fifth time in program history. The Red Raiders also will try to win an eighth game in the regular season for the first time since 2009. ""We have to take advantage of our opportunities,"" Texas Tech coach Joey McGuire said. ""At the end of the day, we're going to take care of business on Saturday, and we're going to go into a bowl game. ""Our expectations would be 8-4 with an opportunity to get to that ninth win."" Texas Tech leads the Big 12 in points per game (37.4) and is second in yards per game (450.0). They are one of three Big 12 teams averaging more than 290 passing yards per game. The Red Raiders run a fast-tempo offense which results in a lot of plays behind quarterback Behren Morton. He completed 37 of 53 pass attempts for 401 yards with four touchdowns and an interception in last week's 56-48 win at Oklahoma State. Tahj Brooks is at 1,317 yards on 263 carries with 14 touchdowns.

The Bears (7-4, 5-3 Big 12) mathematically are alive for a chance to play in the Big 12 championship game but would need to beat Kansas and hope for a scenario in which eight teams tie for first in the league standings. The Jayhawks (5-6, 4-4) have won three straight games -- all against ranked opponents -- and four of their past five after a tumultuous start to the season. Kansas will be bowl eligible if it beats the Bears, pretty amazing if you consider it began the season with a 1-5 record. Baylor heads home after a 20-10 road win over anemic Houston last Saturday. Sawyer Robertson threw for 204 yards and two touchdown passes, Bryson Washington rushed 28 times for 113 yards and the Bears' defense allowed just 239 total yards in the victory. The Bears were 2-4 and winless in three Big 12 games after losing at Iowa State on Oct. 5. Since then, they've produced five straight victories -- three of them on the road. ""I never lost faith in the team,"" 'Baylor defensive tackle Elinus Noel III said. ""I think people started to see a replay of last year (3-9), maybe. But within the facility, we knew what it was. There were a couple things that we had to fine-tune. ""We've gotten better at cleaning that up, and it's starting to show. We've still got a lot further to go."" The Jayhawks beat conference-leading Colorado 37-21 in Kansas City last Saturday to help create a mishmash of the Big 12 standings. With the win over the then-No. 16 Buffaloes, Kansas became the first team in college football history with a losing record to win three straight games over ranked opponents. ""I'm so proud of this group and our coaching staff because so many people had written this team off,"" Kansas coach Lance Leipold said. ""Everyone was frustrated, pointing to things that should've been changed or done differently. But this group stuck together, stayed committed to the process and has everything we asked of them."" Devin Neal led the way in the win with 207 rushing yards and three touchdowns and another 80 yards receiving and a score in the win over Colorado.

There's also a mythical state championship on the line for the Blue Devils. They're 3-0 against North Carolina, North Carolina State and non-league foe Elon and could add another checkmark to win the prideful regional prize.   ""Winning in our state is something our guys are fully aware of,"" Duke coach Manny Diaz said.   Wake Forest (4-7, 2-5) carries a three-game losing streak into Saturday. The Demon Deacons will miss the postseason for the second year in a row and another defeat would secure a second-to-last place finish in the ACC.   ""It's where we are,"" Wake Forest coach Dave Clawson said. ""We're certainly a lot more competitive than we were a year ago. If you look at this year's season, we're a lot more competitive.""   The Demon Deacons are 1-5 in home games, but their last two setbacks came in road outings against North Carolina and nationally ranked Miami. Bookending the season with a home victory is the goal.   ""We owe it to our seniors in our program,"" Clawson said. ""I want those guys walking out with a great memory. We're going to treat this like a playoff game.""   Duke receiver Eli Pancol is coming off a three-touchdown, 188-yard effort stemming from his five catches in last weekend's Virginia Tech game. An 86-yard TD reception marked the sixth-longest pass play in team history.   Quarterback Maalik Murphy of Duke threw for three touchdowns and three interceptions last week.

Ending the season on a high note by winning the annual rivalry on Saturday night in Tallahassee, Fla., is the goal for these programs, but Florida stands an opportunity to further improve its bowl standing as a parting gift. Florida leads the all-time series 37-28-2, but the Seminoles have won the past two meetings by nine points or fewer. But this season, although they have experienced their ups and downs, things have gone markedly better for the Gators (6-5) than the Seminoles (2-9). Napier had been thought to be on the hot seat since the start of the season. Everything changed in November.  With the support of his administration, Napier revived the Gators. Consecutive victories over ranked SEC foes LSU and Ole Miss the past two weeks have Florida's outlook on the sunny side.  The Gators beat ranked teams in consecutive weeks for the first time since 2008 led by DJ Lagway, who threw a pair of touchdown passes in the 24-17 victory. A win over the rival Seminoles in a year they are favored to do so would be huge heading into a subsequent bowl game. ""It was complimentary ball,"" Napier said. ""We had a lot of comments about the game afterwards. So, you know, we have no time to play around here, because we're turning the page."" Florida State is fresh off its best offensive performance by far of this season, albeit against the lowly FCS-level Bucs, who finished their season 1-11.  The Seminoles scored a season-high 41 points, which was 20 more than their previous high, and snapped a six-game losing streak. Quarterback Luke Kromenhoek completed 13 of 20 passes for 209 yards and threw three touchdown passes and no interceptions. The performance earned him the chance to start again in Saturday's game per Florida State coach Mike Norvell. ""To be able to have three touchdown passes, he made a lot of good decisions,"" Norvell said during his Monday press conference. ""There's some throws that he missed, some parts of different reads and progressions where I think he's going to continue to even become that much more efficient around it."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

To the surprise of many, Chicago stuck right with the Detroit Lions on Thursday and found itself down 23-20 after forcing a three-and-out late in the fourth quarter. The Bears took over at their own 1 with 3:31 remaining and worked all the way down to the Detroit 25, where tragedy struck. Chicago guard Teven Jenkins was called for illegal use of hands to push the Bears 10 yards back, then quarterback Caleb Williams was sacked for a loss of 6. Williams was whistled down with 32 seconds to go before leisurely getting his team set up at the line of scrimmage. The Bears didn’t end up getting a snap off until there were six seconds remaining, and Williams proceeded to overthrow Rome Odunze as the clock hit zeros. A sloppy ending? Yeah. Big time. But it gets worse. Eberflus let it all happen with a timeout in his pocket. Rather than using it, Eberflus opted to let his rookie quarterback take the game into his own hands and chew nearly 30 seconds of clock. In case that wasn’t enough to make Eberflus the most hated man in Chicago on a day dedicated to giving thanks, togetherness and enjoying the company of loved ones, the 54-year-old then doubled down at the podium during his postgame press conference. “I like what we did there,” Eberflus said of the end-of-game sequence. “To me, I think we handled it the right way.” There is no way Eberflus should ever be able to bounce back from this. Ever. Coaching just isn’t for him. To be fair, Williams did have the opportunity to burn the timeout, too. He didn’t, so, yes, some of the blame does in fact lie with him. However, Eberflus is far from some coaching guru. This isn’t the first time that he has looked like a deer in the headlights on the sideline, and it certainly won’t be the last if he somehow continues to stay on this career path.  What more does the Bears’ front office need to see to make a change? If only all of us had this type of job security. Chicago fans have been absolutely going through the wringer as of late. They had to watch the Bears lose 30-27 to the Minnesota Vikings on a game-winning field goal in overtime on Sunday, a setback that came after the Green Bay Packers pulled off a 20-19 victory. Before all that, Chicago got blown out by a pair of seemingly lesser opponents in the Arizona Cardinals and New England Patriots. Then there was that time the Bears lost to the Washington Commanders on a tipped Hail Mary at the end of regulation, marking the beginning of their current six-game skid. A talented Chicago offense is finding new ways to get embarrassed on a weekly basis, and the man causing it still has a job. Hit the road, Eberflus. And don’t come back. Copyright 2024"

Saturday, Venables and the Sooners get their first experience in Baton Rouge when Oklahoma takes on the Tigers in the regular-season finale. The Sooners (6-5, 2-5 SEC) are riding high, coming off a stunning 24-3 home win over Alabama that gave them bowl eligibility for the 26th consecutive season. LSU (7-4, 4-3) is coming off a 24-17 home win over Vanderbilt to snap a three-game losing streak. The quarterbacks figure to be front and center. For the Sooners, it's a much different challenge than they faced with Alabama's Jalen Milroe. Oklahoma held Milroe to 164 yards passing with no touchdowns and three interceptions and just 7 rushing yards on 15 carries. Garrett Nussmeier isn't much of a runner, but is seventh nationally with 3,458 passing yards. ""He moves around really well, so they're taking advantage of that,"" Venables said. ""They boot him, they roll him out, they dash him, they sprint him, so he can do a great job keeping his eyes down the field and throws the ball really, really well on the move. ""I love his toughness, the guts he plays with. Everything goes through him."" Tigers coach Brian Kelly wasn't quite as effusive about Oklahoma quarterback Jackson Arnold. Arnold has struggled at times with ball security, but is coming off a game where he ran for a career-high 131 yards on 25 carries.

Virginia Tech is 3-2 at home this season and Virginia is 3-2 on the road.   Virginia Tech is coming off a 31-28 defeat at Duke, its fifth loss by seven or fewer points this season. By comparison, Virginia's last four losses were by a combined 91 points.   ""It's super frustrating,"" Hokies wide receiver Ali Jennings said of the Hokies' 0-5 record in one-score games. ""A lot of times we are the better team, but we shoot ourselves in the foot.""   Virginia Tech had twice as many first downs as Duke (24-12) and three times the rushing yards (190-64) but couldn't catch up after falling into a 31-17 hole. The Hokies had three chances to tie or take the lead in the final eight minutes but came up empty.   Collin Schlee started at quarterback for the injured Kyron Drones (knee), but Schlee exited with a first-half injury and was replaced by freshman William ""Pop"" Watson III.   Drones, who threw three touchdown passes in last season's 55-17 rout of Virginia, is considered day-to-day heading into Saturday's finale.   The Cavaliers fell 33-7 at home last weekend to then-No. 13 SMU. They trailed 26-0 before getting on the board with Anthony Colandrea's TD pass to Malachi Fields with 4:16 remaining.   Virginia also has a cloudy QB picture, with some calling for Tony Muskett to replace Colandrea (13 touchdown passes and 11 interceptions this season).   ""We gotta figure out who gives us the best shot, but at the end of the day, whoever's your quarterback, he's got to have help from his supporting cast all the way around,"" Elliott said.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Wildcats (4-7) lost 31-14 at No. 3 Texas last Saturday to ensure their first season without a bowl game since 2015, which was also their last full regular season with a losing record. They have won five straight against the Cardinals (7-4) dating back to the 2017 season.   With an eye to the future, Kentucky coach Mark Stoops plans to feature true freshman Cutter Boley in a start at quarterback for the Wildcats. The in-state recruit has played in relief in three games this season, including the last two.   Against the Longhorns last Saturday, he completed 10-of-18 passes for 160 yards and threw an interception.   ""We've made it a conscious effort to get Cutter some (first-team) reps the past couple weeks and get him time in practice during that bye week to get him prepped and ready for it,"" Stoops said. ""And ever since the bye week, I think you've seen him go out there and execute at a higher level.""   The Cardinals (7-4) will play in a bowl game for the fourth consecutive season, but coach Jeff Brohm said in his weekly press conference Monday that it's important to finish the season on a strong note. Last year, Louisville led by 10 points late in the third quarter but fell 38-31 after Ray Davis ran for a 37-yard touchdown with 1:02 left in the game.   ""If you don't win it, man, it puts a sour taste in your mouth, and we had that feeling last year,"" Brohm said. ""It's a bad taste. It stays there for a long time.""   Brohm's team ranks 15th nationally in total offense, averaging 453 yards per game and will face a Kentucky squad yielding just 332.7, 37th among FBS teams.   Ja'Corey Brooks leads the Atlantic Coast Conference with 1,013 receiving yards on 61 catches and nine touchdowns for Louisville. Isaac Brown has 896 rushing yards and nine scores. His 7.4 yards per carry leads the ACC and is third nationally. He needs just 65 yards to break Lamar Jackson's team record for rushing yards as a freshman. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Trojans will look for a revival from their offense on Friday night when they face New Mexico in the third-place game of the Acrisure Invitational at Palm Desert, Calif. The Lobos lost 85-82 to Arizona State late Thursday night to also fall into the third-place contest. Meanwhile, USC was crushed 71-36 by Saint Mary's and shot just 26 percent (13 of 50) from the field and was 0 of 12 from 3-point range in a humbling setback. ""We have a lot of work to do,"" Trojans first-year coach Eric Musselman said afterward. ""I'm extremely disappointed in so many different areas. Hopefully we will come out and play much better basketball (Friday). We really struggled offensively and defensively. Other than limiting ourselves to only 10 turnovers, there weren't many positives to take on either side of the ball."" Josh Cohen led the Trojans (5-2) with 12 points on 5-of-9 shooting. For the season, Cohen averages a team-best 12 points while shooting a superb 68.6 percent from the field. Desmond Claude (11.6), Chibuzo Agbo (11.1) and Terrance Williams II (10.8) also average in double digits. Agbo had eight points against the Gaels, which will meet Arizona State in the title game. Claude scored four points and Williams had one. New Mexico (5-2) recovered from a 13-point first-half deficit and led for the first 13 1/2 minutes of the second before the Sun Devils took their first lead of the half and eventually posted the victory. ""We went toe-to-toe with them,"" Lobos coach Richard Pitino told the Albuquerque Journal afterward. ""I was disappointed, obviously, with the result but I'm proud of the fact that we're taking on a Big 12 team and we're right there. We got to execute for 40 minutes a little better."" Donovan Dent and Mustapha Amzil carried the Lobos. Dent scored a season-high 30 points to raise his team-leading average to 18.9, while Amzil recorded a career-best 28 points and is second on the squad at 15 points per game. ""Everybody's got to be ready to score,"" Amzil told the Journal. ""I think we have what it takes. We just have to figure it out."" The Lobos shot just 38.1 percent from the field against Arizona State and were 6 of 16 from 3-point range.

USC (5-2) will play the Lobos (5-2) in the consolation game. Saint Mary's is off to its best start since it tied a program record with nine consecutive wins to open the 2013-14 season. Thursday's victory was the first ever for the Gaels against the Trojans. Jordan Ross led Saint Mary's with 15 points on 6-of-9 shooting from the field. ""Stuff is clicking at the right time,"" Ross said. ""We are getting better every game, getting better as we go. That's usually how you want it to be. You don't want to be playing your best basketball in November, December. We'll keep getting better as the games go."" Paulius Murauskas and Augustas Marciulionis each had 11 points for the Gaels.

The Sun Devils withstood a 21-1 run by New Mexico between the first and second halves that put the Lobos ahead by eight points with 18:10 left. Basheer Jihad, a transfer from Ball State, led the Sun Devils' comeback with 17 of his 20 points in the second half.

After strong follow-up performances, the teams will meet in the tournament's fifth-place game on Friday night. Gonzaga (6-1) won its first five games this season by no less than eight points, including double-digit victories over then-No. 8 Baylor and San Diego State. Instead of playing for a multi-team event title, the Bulldogs stumbled in their opener Wednesday by taking an 86-78 overtime loss to West Virginia. Gonzaga shot a season-worst 40 percent from the field and got outrebounded 42-36 vs. the Mountaineers, marking the team's first time losing the rebounding margin. With a short turnaround from a disappointing outcome, the Bulldogs bounced back with an impressive 89-73 victory Thursday over No. 14 Indiana. Gonzaga scored at least 85 points for the fourth time thanks to an offense that shot 48.4 percent from the floor. Perhaps more importantly, the Bulldogs won the rebounding battle 42-27, marking the third time they posted a double-digit advantage in that category. Khalif Battle led six Gonzaga players in double figures with 16 points to go with five rebounds. Nolan Hickman added 15 points along with Michael Ajayi, who also led the Bulldogs with nine rebounds after finishing with three against West Virginia. ""We all wanted to make a statement,"" Ajayi said after Gonzaga scored 23 second-chance points and 57 points by halftime. ""We all contributed on the glass; all gave great effort."" Graham Ike added 14 points, Ben Gregg contributed 13 and Ryan Nembhard collected 11 points and 13 assists for his fifth game with at least 10 assists. ""We responded well from (Wednesday's loss),"" Hickman said. ""I even responded well. I had a bad little turnover down the stretch, but that's just growth like coach (Mark Few) said in the locker room. A few years ago I wouldn't have been myself in this game."" Davidson (5-1) will face its second ranked opponent of the event, and it hopes it fares better than a 104-71 loss to No. 24 Arizona in the opening round. The Wildcats bounced back by starting fast in their 69-58 win over Providence on Thursday. Davidson scored the game's first nine points, led by as many as 22 and never was seriously threatened. It was Davidson's best defensive showing so far as it allowed a season-best 31 percent shooting from the field. The Wildcats forced Providence into missing its first 10 shots one night after getting worn down by Arizona's physicality. ""We were tough as nails and made them work for every basket,"" Davidson coach Matt McKillop said in his postgame radio interview. Connor Kochera led the Wildcats with 22 points, Bobby Durkin added 20, while Reed Bailey contributed 18 points to go with 11 rebounds and four assists. ""We did so many great things,"" McKillop said. ""Last night we had so many moments when we were spectacular and the wheels fell off and we were just worn down by their physicality and their speed, but we did not wear down tonight, and I think we wore them down."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Mississippi State, which won the Fort Myers Tipoff in 2022 and the Hall of Fame Tipoff Tournament in 2023, improved to 6-0 for the third straight season by cruising to a 80-58 victory over UNLV in the semifinals on Thursday.  The Bulldogs, despite falling behind 8-2 out of the gate, rebounded to take an 18-point lead (39-21) in the first half and went up by as many as 28 points (76-48) in the second. KeShawn Murphy, a 6-foot-10 forward, led the way for the Bulldogs with a double-double (14 points, 13 rebounds) while guard Josh Hubbard added 11 points, including three 3-pointers, and three assists. All 14 players who dressed for Mississippi State scored in the contest as the team finished with a 48-13 advantage in bench points.  The Bulldogs also dominated the Runnin' Rebels on the glass, finishing with a 46-29 edge in rebounding including 19-4 on the offensive boards. That resulted in an eye-popping 30-3 edge in second-chance points.  ""It was a big emphasis of ours going into the game,"" Jans said. ""(UNLV) gave up 21 offensive rebounds in their last outing. So, we wanted our guys to be excited about crashing with authority. We knew that we could get some second-chance opportunities. We've been emphasizing rebounding for longer than just this game. ""We struggled the first three games, and we've been better ever since. So, it was nice to see that and control the game in that way."" Murphy, who struggled with a foot injury last season and briefly left the team for nearly a month over lack of playing time, needed just 22 minutes to register his double-double and also had four assists, a steal and a blocked shot.  ""He's working,"" Jans said. ""He's after it and wants more. He's so awesome to coach right now, not that he wasn't before. But he's healthy mentally and physically. He feels really good about the dividends he's receiving and guys are happy for him.""  Butler's path to the title game was a lot more nerve-wracking. The Bulldogs (5-1), who led by as many as 15 points in the first half, had to sweat out two shots that rolled round the rim at the buzzer to hold on for a 71-69 victory over Northwestern.  Forward Jahmyl Telfort scored 23 points to go with five assists and four rebounds and Andre Screen, a 7-foot-1 transfer from Bucknell, added 15 points and nine rebounds to lead Butler.  Northwestern had two good chances to force overtime at the wire but Brooks Barnhizer, who scored a game-high 24 points, failed to convert on a drive to the basket and Nick Martinelli's tip-in try also rolled around the rim and came out.  Butler assistant coach Alex Barton sent out the following message afterward on X: ""Thankful for the kind rim here at Mullett Arena! Happy Thanksgiving. Go Dawgs!""  Butler won despite committing 15 turnovers, compared to five for the opponent, that resulted in a 14-8 advantage in points off turnovers for the Wildcats. The Bulldogs outshot Northwestern from the floor, 46.8 to 36.1 percent, and connected on 6-of-16 3-pointers. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Both teams need to win to avoid an 0-2 trip for this tournament, and whichever side can get cranked up on offense might emerge in a better place. Northwestern (5-2) lost 71-69 to Butler on Thursday, unable to convert on a frantic final possession with a drive to the basket and a tip on a putback. UNLV (4-2) was blown out 80-58 by No. 25 Mississippi State in Thursday's late game. The Rebels had a three-game winning streak snapped. This will be Northwestern's final primer before a couple of Big Ten games next week. Production on offense needs to improve for the Wildcats, who are averaging 73.6 points per game on 44.9 percent shooting from the field, including 30.8 percent from 3-point range. ""The offense, just got to be more efficient,"" Northwestern coach Chris Collins said. ""Be more crisp. Our offensive efficiency is not where it needs to be as the competition levels up."" Nick Martinelli, who averages 21.4 points per game for Northwestern, was held to seven points on 3-of-15 shooting by Butler.  The Wildcats continue to tinker with player rotations. ""I knew there was going to be a little bit of a rocky road here,"" Collins said. ""We've got to get some confidence. You've got to play great defense and win a game when you're not shooting the ball great."" UNLV was limited to a season-low point total against Mississippi State. With 13 points, Jailen Bedford led the Rebels in scoring for the first time this season. With a second game in less than 24 hours, UNLV coach Kevin Kruger will look for toughness from his team. That could be more difficult for the Rebels with the status of center Jeremiah Cherry uncertain after he departed the second half Thursday with a back ailment. A big concern for the Rebels is rebounding. Mississippi State tracked down 19 offensive rebounds. ""They out-toughed us,"" UNLV's Jalen Hill said. ""Every loose ball was theirs. I think that was the major key."" Second-chance points favored Mississippi State 30-3. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Purdue will look to put its best foot forward on Friday against No. 23 Ole Miss in the final. The Boilermakers (6-1) defeated previously unbeaten North Carolina State 71-61 in Thursday's opening game of the tournament. The contest was a rematch of their NCAA Tournament semifinal last spring. ""Sometimes we can't plug guys in,"" Purdue coach Matt Painter said. ""We've played bigger with this group, and we've gone smaller."" Ole Miss needed overtime in the second semifinal Thursday, upending BYU 96-85. Ole Miss (6-0) has won its last 19 non-conference games across multiple seasons. The Rebels had to dig out of a 10-point, first-half hole and respond from a four-point deficit with less than two minutes to play in regulation. ""We're continuing to have a lot of belief,"" Ole Miss coach Chris Beard said. Purdue had stretches of sputtering on offense against the Wolfpack. Fixing some of that will come from scoring more often because there were times that the Boilermakers worked for quality shots. ""We squandered some deep post-ups, squandered some layups around the rim,"" Painter said. Purdue's Trey Kaufman-Renn scored 22 points against North Carolina State, giving him at least 14 in every outing this season. He's averaging 18.3 points and 6.3 rebounds per game. The key will be playing to Kaufman-Renn's strengths, Painter said. The other Boilermakers were willing to fire up shots from the perimeter, and having success on those will be vital to help free Kaufman-Renn for movement. ""If you go small, you have to have everybody (with) the ability to shoot the basketball,"" Painter said. Purdue appeared to approve tracking down long rebounds or loose balls. That's something the coaching staff has emphasized during the past week. ""We got to be around the basketball,"" Painter said. ""I thought our guys were quicker to the basketball."" There's still the matter of Purdue finding more comfort in transition situations. The idea against the Wolfpack, and perhaps also when facing Ole Miss, will be breaking the press and then proceeding to look for scoring opportunities. The same holds true regarding other fast-break situations. ""We're not a team that's going to force a lot of turnovers, but when we do, we got to capitalize,"" Painter said. On the flip side, there were a few glaring oversights on defense. Painter said the Boilermakers have to be more attentive defensively against out-of-bounds plays that North Carolina State hurt them with in Thursday's game. There will be several areas to address in terms of slowing Ole Miss. Senior Jaylen Murray racked up a career-high 28 points on 10-for-14 shooting when the Rebels beat BYU.

Under first-year coach Pat Kelsey, the Cardinals (5-1) will square off against Oklahoma (6-0) in the championship game of the tournament on Friday in Paradise Island, Bahamas. In an event that includes three ranked teams, it's a final that few expected.  After posting an 89-61 victory over No. 14 Indiana in the opening round, Louisville advanced to the final with a 79-70 overtime victory Thursday against West Virginia.  Oklahoma advanced by edging previously undefeated Providence 79-77 and then toppling No. 24 Arizona 82-77.  So far, Louisville's rejuvenation has been the story of the tournament. The Cardinals were a combined 12-52 the last two seasons but immediately have been transformed under Kelsey, who took Charleston to the NCAA Tournament the last two seasons. Kelsey has done it by mining the transfer portal. His top seven scorers were at different Division I schools last year. In Thursday's win over West Virginia, Wisconsin transfer Chucky Hepburn scored 10 of his career-high 32 points in overtime.  Hepburn also was the catalyst in Louisville's domination of Indiana in the opening round as he recorded 16 points, 10 assists and seven steals. ""Chucky's performance was spectacular,"" Kelsey said. ""That was one of the single most dominant performances on both ends of the floor as a point guard that I've ever seen."" South Florida transfer Kasean Pryor and Reyne Smith, who accompanied Kelsey from Charleston, have totaled 27 points each in the two tournament games. The game within the game on Friday will be between the point guards as Oklahoma brings freshman Jeremiah Fears, who has delivered 46 points and 12 assists in the Sooners' two tournament wins. Fears, who turned 18 last month, will go up against Hepburn, who has played 109 games, all starts, in his college career. In the semifinal win over Arizona, Jalon Moore contributed 24 points and seven rebounds to help Oklahoma stay in charge in a game it led from the opening minutes. Moore's performance was a bounce-back from scoring a season-low six points in the opening-round win over Providence. Sooners coach Porter Moser said Moore needed an attitude adjustment after that game. ""He had a choice. He can either get in his feelings or be the energy guy that he is and be great at what he's good at,"" Moser said. ""He chose, 'I'm gonna be the leader that I am.'""   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Broncos (3-4) beat TCU to earn a spot in Friday afternoon's title game while Washington (5-1) outlasted Colorado State, both on Turkey Day.  Santa Clara was in control throughout most of its 69-52 win, on top for the first 24 minutes of the game, surrendering the lead briefly, and then taking charge with a 26-5 run over a nearly 12-minute span that was capped by a dunk from Carlos Stewart with 4:04 to play.  Stewart scored 18 points while going 8 of 9 from the floor for the Broncos, with Elijah Mahi adding 13 points and Camaron Tongue 11. Santa Clara outrebounded TCU 49-38 and had 42 points in the paint.  ""Our guys just played the right way when we got in the paint,"" Santa Clara coach Herb Sendek said. ""For the most part, our decision making was good, but the key was on the defensive end of the floor. I thought the guys really competed and gave a great effort defensively.""  The Broncos bounced back from a tough 71-69 home loss to Stanford on Saturday. Three of Santa Clara's setbacks this year have been by single digits.  ""I'm just happy for our guys,"" Sendek said. ""You know, they're tremendously, tremendously resilient. We've had some tough losses already this year, and for them to stick together and come out and play with this kind of toughness shows what they are made of.""   The Huskies beat Colorado State 73-67 in the nightcap Thursday in a clash that had seven lead changes and four ties. Tyler Harris led Washington with a 24-point effort that included a career-best five 3-pointers. Great Osobor added 16 points, eight rebounds and seven assists.  The Huskies were down 58-56 before forging a decisive 10-0 run that began with a 3-pointer by Mekhi Mason with 6:18 remaining. Washington held the Rams scoreless for more than five minutes and then survived a torrid Colorado State run that saw the Rams pull within two before the Huskies closed the game at the free-throw line to capture their fourth straight win.  ""The biggest in-game adjustment was us just being aggressive, and we got some shots to fall,"" Washington coach Danny Sprinkle said. ""The players did it, you know, give them credit, man. The second half, I thought they played terrific. We had a different urgency in the second half, a lot of urgency, for sure, and the guys came in and attacked."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

In Thursday's tournament opener, the Wolfpack (5-1) lost 71-61 to No. 13 Purdue in a rematch of their 2024 Final Four game. The Cougars (5-1) then scuffed up their unblemished season with a 96-85 overtime setback to No. 23 Ole Miss. BYU had a late four-point lead and possessed the ball with time running out in regulation but couldn't pull off the upset. Freshman Kanon Catchings scored 17 points, but the Cougars didn't have an answer for the Rebels' Jaylen Murray when it mattered most. Murray scored nine of his career-high 28 points in overtime after hitting a tough game-tying bucket late in the second half. Along with defensive issues, the Cougars struggled with the physicality of Ole Miss and committed 17 turnovers -- well over their season average of 10.8 per game. The Rebels scored 23 points directly off of BYU miscues. ""We haven't really been a turnover team this year,"" BYU coach Kevin Young said in his postgame radio interview. ""But the first time we faced a physical defens, we turned it over 17 times."" The Wolfpack's last two losses have come at the hands of the Boilermakers, including 63-50 in the NCAA Tournament semifinals last season. On Thursday, North Carolina State, which was within one point at halftime, hurt itself with six turnovers and poor shooting in the first 12 minutes of the second half. Those issues helped Purdue seize control with a 55-42 lead. ""We've got to do a good job of making the right play,"" North Carolina State coach Kevin Keatts said in an interview with The (Raleigh) News & Observer. ""We turned it over a couple of times and didn't find the right guy. But overall, I loved the way we competed. That's a really good team, the No. 13 team in the country.

Both teams will look to bounce back from disappointing defeats when they meet in the third-place game of the Acrisure Invitational in Palm Desert, Calif. TCU overcame a 13-point, first-half deficit Thursday to take a pair of one-point leads in the second half before fading in a 69-52 loss to Santa Clara.  Colorado State led by one point with less than seven minutes left before Washington earned a 73-67 win. TCU (4-2) didn't lead Thursday until going ahead 39-38 on a 3-pointer by Frankie Collins with 15:46 left. The Horned Frogs took their final lead a little more than two minutes later on a putback dunk by Ernest Udeh Jr. but were outscored 29-11 the rest of the way. The Horned Frogs missed 10 consecutive field-goal attempts following Udeh's dunk and were 4 of 19 over the final 13:12, including 0-for-6 from 3-point land. TCU finished the game 1-of-17 from beyond the arc. ""We've got to get to work, obviously,"" TCU coach Jamie Dixon told the Horned Frogs' radio network following the game. ""We've got a game (Friday). I told the guys, ‘There's nothing better than having an opportunity to get this thing out of your system by going and playing right away.'"" Colorado State coach Niko Medved likely feels the same way after his team suffered its third straight loss. The Rams (3-3), who trailed by as many as nine in the first half, led Washington 28-26 at intermission. They fell behind for nearly 11 straight minutes until a 6-0 run comprised entirely of free throws put them ahead 58-56 with 6:49 remaining, But the Huskies scored the next 10 points -- during which Colorado State missed five straight 3-pointers -- to begin a game-ending 17-9 run.

""Any time you can play for a championship of any fashion is great,"" he said. ""Obviously, we came here to win, so it will be a good Thanksgiving if we can do it."" The 18th-ranked Gators will try for that championship in Orlando against another unbeaten team, Wichita State. The Shockers face the same problem every Florida opponent has so far: How do you consistently score on that defense? Wake Forest found out the hard way Thursday how good the Gators are on the defensive end in a 75-58 defeat. In a game in which Florida (7-0) made just 39.7 percent of its field-goal attempts, it still won going away because it limited the Demon Deacons to 37.5 percent shooting and earned a 44-30 advantage on the glass. Defensive deficiencies were the prime reason Florida went one-and-done in the NCAA Tournament in March. This year? The Gators are 33rd in adjusted defensive efficiency on kenpom.com, allowing 96.4 points per 100 possessions. ""Too often, we got into track meets and didn't value the defensive side of the ball,"" Florida coach Todd Golden said of last season. ""This year's group has done a better job, as well as our staff, committing to being better at it."" The Gators' ability to force turnovers and chomp down on opponents might get a good test from the Shockers (6-0). They have the 15th-best turnover rate offensively in Division I at 9.2 per game and also bring a top 70 defense to the party with a 99.3 adjusted defensive efficiency. It was defense that allowed Wichita State to outlast Minnesota 68-66 in overtime on Thursday. It held the Golden Gophers to 41.5 percent shooting from the field, including 3 of 23 on 3-pointers.  The outcome seemed to back up second-year coach Paul Mills' assessment of his team. ""You win with men,"" he said. ""You don't win with young kids, you win with men. The way you win with men is men understand responsibilities and they follow through on them. Men show up. Men are responsible. You win with men and our guys are men."" The only question Mills presently has about his team is their inconsistency on the glass. Minnesota earned a 38-34 advantage on the boards, grabbing 13 offensive rebounds.  ""We've got to be better at being able to retrieve more of those opportunities,"" he said.  The Gators have won both previous meetings of the programs, which haven't met since January 1993. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Mountaineers will settle for playing for third place at the tournament when they meet No. 24 Arizona on Friday in Paradise Island, Bahamas. West Virginia (4-2) stormed back for a thrilling 86-78 OT win over No. 3 Gonzaga in the first round of the tournament, but the Mountaineers had to feel what it was like from the other side on Thanksgiving Day. They lost an early 11-point lead and were outclassed by Louisville in the five-minute OT session, when Chucky Hepburn scored 10 of his 32 points as the Cardinals won the semifinal 79-70. ""I thought Louisville did a nice job, made some plays, got to the foul line and there were certainly plenty of opportunities we could have capitalized on to come out on top,"" West Virginia coach Darian DeVries told the school's athletics website. Javon Small continues to power the Mountaineers' offense. The veteran guard had 31 points against Gonzaga and 26 versus Louisville, leading West Virginia both nights. He approached triple-double territory by adding seven rebounds and seven assists Thursday, and he paces the team with 19.8 points per contest. The Mountaineers also continue to rely on forward Amani Hansberry, a transfer from Illinois. He has scored in double figures in four of six games this year and followed a career-high 19-point effort against Gonzaga by scoring 19 again versus Louisville. West Virginia will catch a Wildcats group whose November isn't going according to plan. After Arizona (3-3) trounced Davidson 104-71 in the first round in the Bahamas, Oklahoma held on for an 82-77 win in Thursday's semifinals. The Wildcats have throttled winless Canisius, 2-6 Old Dominion and Davidson, but they've lost to Wisconsin by 15, Duke by 14 (at home) and Oklahoma by five. The Sooners made seven more 3-pointers than the Wildcats, outshooting them 41.4 percent to 26.3 percent in that area. ""They put us in some tough situations with coverages, and they hit some big shots,"" Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd said. ""Maybe some of those threes are shots you're going to kind of live with the attempt if they make them. But other ones, they were kind of subbing in and out different lineups."" Caleb Love led the Wildcats with 17 points but shot 7-of-18 from the floor to get there. What comes next is a college basketball oddity. As of this season, Arizona and West Virginia share a conference, with the Wildcats joining the Big 12. Before the two teams meet in Morgantown, W. Va. on Jan. 7, they'll get a preview of one another in the Bahamas. ""I've never been in the same conference with them, so we're just gonna approach it like any other game in the tournament,"" Lloyd said. Jaden Bradley leads the Wildcats with 14.3 points per game, including 16 against Oklahoma. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Forbes and the Demon Deacons will try to author a happier ending to their experience in the ESPN Events Invitational in Orlando on Friday when they play Minnesota for third place. Wake Forest (6-2) trailed the unbeaten Gators by just four at halftime but quickly surrendered a 10-0 run to start the second half. Even though the Deacons got as close as six after that, the slow start was too much to overcome. ""We were fighting uphill from there,"" Forbes said. ""It was a hard-fought game. We played hard but not smart enough to win."" Wake Forest received 14 points and 13 rebounds from Tre'Von Spillers, his second double-double of the season, but didn't get the usual offensive heroics from guard Hunter Sallis. He made only 5 of 17 from the field and finished with 15 points -- four under his average. The Deacons hope Sallis is back in form against the Golden Gophers (5-2), who suffered a 68-66 overtime loss to Wichita State in Thursday's first semifinal. Minnesota fought back from a five-point deficit in overtime to tie the game at 66 on Brennan Rigsby's dunk but committed a foul on a drive to the bucket and gave up the winning foul shots. The Gophers nearly won despite a rare off-day by senior forward Dawson Garcia. He was held to four points, 18 under his average, before fouling out in overtime. Lu'Cye Patterson took up the slack with a team-high 14 points and Femi Odukale added 13. Patterson and Odukale, who room together on the road, are finding the form Minnesota coach Ben Johnson envisioned for them after some early struggles. ""We knew we were playing bad,"" Odukale said, ""but we always talked about better days ahead.""

It's been a mortifying two games for Indiana (4-2). In the opening round, it trailed by as many as 38 points in an 89-61 loss to Louisville. Thursday was more of the same as Indiana fell to No. 3 Gonzaga, 89-73. The Hoosiers rallied to capture the lead midway through the first half against Gonzaga, but their success was fleeting. By early in the second period, they were down by 23 points. From there they never challenged. The rebounding numbers told the tale as Gonzaga won the battle on the boards 42-27, which paved the way for its edge in second-chance points, 23-4. Indiana coach Mike Woodson called the Hoosiers' lack of success on the boards ""the difference in the game."" ""It's a major problem that we've had and a lot of it is we're not putting bodies on bodies to block out,"" Woodson added. ""That's gotta stop. We gotta get our guys competing."" One of the few positives was the offensive work of 7-foot center Oumar Ballo, who hit 11 of 13 shots on his way to scoring a season-high 25 points. The Indiana guards have been outplayed. In the two games, Myles Rice tallied nine points and two assists, making 3 of 17 shots, while Kanaan Carlyle provided six points and three assists, while making just 2 of 10 shots from the floor. ""These last two games, our perimeter play has been exposed. I gotta fix that,"" Woodson said. Providence (5-2) enters in a similar mindset after trailing all the way in a lackluster 69-58 loss to Davidson on Thursday. The Friars, who shot just 31 percent from the floor, fell behind in the opening minutes 9-0 and trailed by double digits most of the way, never making a serious run at the lead. ""Disappointing night, disappointing response from our program,"" Providence coach Kim English said. Jayden Pierre scored 14 points and Wesley Cardet Jr. added 13 to lead the Friars. Freshman Oswin Erhunmwunse came off the bench to deliver 11 rebounds, including nine off the offensive board. Of particular concern to English was the Friars' inability to make shots from close to the hoop. Providence hit only 10 of 37 attempts from inside the arc. ""I'm looking forward to going back and watching it and really dissecting and seeing why we didn't finish better,"" English said. ""We feel like that was the difference in the game."" The Friars are without their top threat, Bryce Hopkins, who is recovering from surgery to repair a torn ACL. There was speculation that Hopkins, who averaged 15.5 points and 8.6 rebounds per game last season, would make his season debut in the tournament. After a 7:30 tipoff on Thursday night, Providence faces an 11 a.m. start on Friday. ""Tough spot to be in, right here, when you need work to improve on things, you need time to get better, identify things and rep it and rep it and demand it and demand it,"" English said.

BYU quarterback Jake Retzlaff passed for 346 yards last week, two off his season high. But he has thrown three picks to just two touchdowns in the Cougars' pair of losses. Houston (4-7, 3-5 Big 12) will conclude a disappointing first season under coach Willie Fritz, whose otherworldly success at Tulane did not immediately translate. Houston's 20-10 loss to Baylor last Saturday marked its second consecutive defeat, which stifled the momentum generated by three wins in four games before a 24-point loss at Arizona on Nov. 15. ""This is our bowl game in my opinion,"" Fritz said. ""We want to do the best we possibly can in preparation and go out and play great on Saturday night, national TV, in front of a full house I imagine.""

A win will also put the Rebels back in the Mountain West title game for the second straight season, giving them the opportunity for a rematch with Boise State. UNLV (9-2, 5-1) enters with its highest AP and CFP poll ranking in program history following a 27-16 victory at San Jose State last week. They regained control of their own destiny with Fresno State's 28-22 win over Colorado State on Saturday. Colorado State had been unbeaten in conference play to that point and was in position to join Boise State in the Mountain West title game before last week's loss. ""None of it matters if we don't take care of business this week,"" UNLV coach Barry Odom said. ""That's where our focus is and (we know) how important it is to win this rivalry game. ""It means a lot to me. It means a lot to our players. It means a lot to our organization, our fans, our donors, you know, the alumni and everything that goes into it. We know what this game means and we're certainly excited to have the game at home."" UNLV has lost to Syracuse and Boise State this season by a combined eight points. They've strung together an impressive resume, starting 4-0 with wins over Big 12 foes Houston and Kansas. The Rebels had to make a change at quarterback after the Kansas game owing to a highly publicized NIL dispute with then-starter Matthew Sluka. Hajj-Malik Williams has emerged as one of the nation's premier quarterbacks in the wake of Sluka's departure. Williams has thrown for 1,567 yards and 15 touchdowns and is second on the team in rushing with 664 yards in eight starts this season. Nevada coach Jeff Choate is one of many who believe UNLV improved at the position with Sluka's departure. ""They present a lot of problems and it starts with (Williams),"" Choate said. ""I mean, it might have been addition by subtraction when the quarterback situation happened earlier in the year down there. (Williams) is a dynamic player. Really good off-schedule, runs the offense efficiently. The RPO style of offense was a really good fit for him."" Ricky White will likely eclipse the 1,000-yard mark for the second straight season on Saturday, needing 35 more yards to get there. White has 70 receptions and 10 touchdowns on the season. Jai'Den Thomas leads UNLV with 697 yards rushing after a 135-yard performance last week. Nevada (3-9, 0-6) is seeking its first conference win, entering on a five-game losing streak. The Wolf Pack have come within three points in losses to Fresno State and Air Force, in addition to playing an impressive game against Boise in which they lost by seven as 24-point underdogs. Their best win was a 42-37 upset of Oregon State on Oct. 12. Choate is in his first season at the helm in Reno after a successful stint as Montana State's head coach 2016-20. His first season at Nevada hasn't been as positive but they've improved upon last season's 2-10 finish. It looks unbalanced on paper, but even newcomer Choate knows anything can happen in this rivalry series. ""Sometimes one team has an advantage for a while, but usually that pendulum shifts back and forth pretty consistently in this rivalry,"" Choate said. ""It's a perfect rivalry from the standpoint of how different economically, geographically, all those things Northern and Southern Nevada are."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Arizona's starting perimeter trio of Love, Bradley and KJ Lewis combined to make 2 of 12 from the field, 1 of 7 from beyond the arc at that point.

The Lions snapped a seven-game losing streak in their annual Thanksgiving Day game. Goff passed for 221 yards, while David Montgomery had 124 yards from scrimmage. Jahmyr Gibbs added a combined 104 yards for Detroit (11-1), which owns the best record in the NFC. Caleb Williams threw for 256 yards and three second-half touchdowns for the Bears (4-8), who have lost six straight. DJ Moore caught eight passes for 97 yards and a touchdown. Chicago's poor clock management on its last possession allowed Detroit to hold on. After a sack left the ball on the Chicago 41-yard line with 32 seconds left, the Bears failed to call a timeout on third down and the clock ran out on Williams' deep incompletion.

Cooper Rush completed 21 of 36 passes for 195 yards and a touchdown as the Cowboys (5-7) became the last franchise in the four major sports to win a home game in this calendar year. It was the team's second win in five days, keeping alive its long-shot hopes for an NFC playoff berth. Drew Lock hit 21 of 32 passes for 178 yards and an interception for the Giants, who dropped to 2-10 with their seventh straight loss.

Crowder passed a physical and went through meetings but didn't take part in Sacramento's midday shootaround. Playing in the game wasn't on his mind. ""Once I walked into that meeting room with the guys, I saw my name. I was like, 'Alright, it's here,' "" Crowder said. ""So, I just prepared and tried to get my mind where it needs to be."" Crowder, 34, will play his second contest for the Kings on Friday night when they visit the Portland Trail Blazers. The game is part of the NBA Cup. The Trail Blazers are 1-1 in West Group A play and the Kings are 0-2. The Houston Rockets lead the group with a 3-0 mark. Crowder played 27 minutes in his Sacramento debut and had eight points and four rebounds as the Kings rallied for a 115-104 victory. Sacramento outscored Minnesota 34-18 in the fourth quarter to end a four-game losing streak. The Kings are hoping the 13-year veteran's experience will be a nice complement to their star trio of De'Aaron Fox, Domantas Sabonis and DeMar DeRozan. He has averages of 9.3 points and 4.2 rebounds in 804 career games (435 starts) and has long been known for his strong defensive presence. The other trait long associated with Crowder is winning. ""Jae has been around a long time,"" Kings coach Mike Brown said. ""He's been in the playoffs 11 straight years, so he knows what it takes to win."" Sacramento is the ninth team for Crowder, who has averaged in double digits in scoring seven times. Before he was in the NBA, he was the co-star of a Marquette team that included longtime NBA star Jimmy Butler. DeRozan missed the contest against the Timberwolves due to lower back pain and has been ruled out for Friday's game. Portland has dropped two straight games and four of its last five. The Trail Blazers concluded a 1-4 road trip with Wednesday's 121-114 loss to the Indiana Pacers. Anfernee Simons broke out of his slump with 30 points and six 3-pointers. He had scored in single digits in four of the previous five games, including 2-of-14 shooting from the field for five points in a 123-98 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday night. ""I thought Ant was good. He was aggressive all night,"" Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups said after the loss to the Pacers. ""His shots were going. He made them pay for defensive mistakes that they made down there."" Billups was unhappy with Portland's board work as his squad was outrebounded 47-38. Indiana gobbled up 19 offensive rebounds. ""We fought extremely hard. All our guys played hard,"" Billups said. ""It's hard to overcome (nearly) 20 offensive rebounds and (22) second-chance points. It's hard to overcome that. ""You can play as hard as you want but if you can't grab that offensive rebound and you keep giving good offensive teams more opportunities to score ... it wears you down."" Trail Blazers forward Jerami Grant (sprained left knee) missed the Indiana game and is doubtful for Friday's game. Sacramento has won six of the past seven meetings, including a 111-98 home victory on Oct. 28. Fox scored 24 points and DeRozan added 23 for the Kings. Deandre Ayton recorded 20 points and 11 rebounds to pace Portland. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Miami is 0-8 in games started by Tagovailoa in games in which the temperature is 40 degrees or colder. Thursday's cold, snowy weather impacted Miami's initial opportunity to handle the ball. After the defense forced a Packers punt on the first possession of the game, Malik Washington mishandled the return. Green Bay's Robert Rochell recovered at the Dolphins' 9-yard line and the Packers scored three plays later on a 3-yard connection from Love to Reed. Green Bay took a 24-3 lead into halftime. Jacobs punctuated a 12-play, 76-yard drive with a 1-yard scoring run with 55 seconds left in the first quarter.

Oklahoma City could still need tiebreaking scenarios to fall their way in order to advance to the knockout round.   The Lakers' path to advancing in the tournament for a second consecutive season is narrow. The simplest way to advance is to defeat the Thunder and have the Phoenix Suns lose to the San Antonio Spurs, also on Tuesday.   Since dropping an NBA Cup game to the Spurs last week, the Thunder have not lost, with the most recent of their three consecutive victories coming Wednesday on the road when they beat the Golden State Warriors 105-101.   Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 35 points, although Jalen Williams departed just before halftime with an eye injury that occurred while defending a dunk attempt and did not return. He wasn't on the injury report for Friday's game. Oklahoma City also was without Chet Holmgren (hip) and former Laker Alex Caruso (hip).   Holmgren is out until the new year, while Caruso has missed the past two games and won't play Friday.   Isaiah Hartenstein scored 14 points with 14 rebounds for Oklahoma City, while doing his best to make up for the absence of Williams. Oklahoma City needed 12 points from Gilgeous-Alexander in the fourth quarter and won even after shooting just 31.6 percent in the final period.   ""That shouldn't change the way we play,"" Hartenstein said of Williams' departure. ""I think we didn't execute the way we should have. We shouldn't have been in that (close) situation.""   The Lakers ended a three-game losing streak with a 119-101 victory on the road against the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday. Rookie Dalton Knecht scored a team-best 20 points after making 4 of his 10 attempts from 3-point range.   Anthony Davis had 19 points with 14 rebounds while fellow star LeBron James delivered a triple-double with 16 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds. It was James' sixth triple-double of the season at age 39.   ""I'm very proud of our group,"" Lakers rookie head coach JJ Redick said of ending the longest losing streak of the season. ""The response was great. It's literally what I talked about with them before the game. You got to let go of the recent past and you got to get on to the next thing.""   A month shy of his 40th birthday, James has averaged 22.9 points, 9.3 assists and 8.2 rebounds while not missing a game this season. Knecht has continued to make an impact in his first season with an average of 11.7 points and three games of at least 20 points this season.   In two seasons of the NBA's in-season tournament, the Lakers have lost just once and it occurred Tuesday in a 127-100 road defeat against the Phoenix Suns. The Lakers are the defending tournament champion.   --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Central Division rivals will renew acquaintances when the Stars host the Avalanche on Friday night. The last time the teams met was in Game 6 of the Western Conference semifinals in May. Dallas won it with a double-overtime goal by former Colorado star Matt Duchene. It was the sixth time since 1999 the teams met in the postseason, with the Stars winning four times. That history doesn't matter in the first of three games between the teams this season. For Dallas, the focus is getting back on track after two straight losses in which it allowed six goals in both games, the last a 6-2 setback at Chicago on Wednesday night. ""It's that old adage: You're never really as good as you think you are when you win, and you're never as bad as you think you are when you lose, most of the time,"" Duchene said. ""This team, I don't think, has had a ton of adversity the last two years. There's a little bit coming at us right now. ""As long as we peak at the right time and work towards it, I think that's the only thing we can do. We've just got to keep figuring things out and working and pushing."" The Stars played Wednesday without center Roope Hintz, who missed the game after ""tweaking something"" Monday, according to coach Peter DeBoer. Hintz is listed as day-to-day. The Avalanche are accustomed to playing without key players. They were nearly whole after Jonathan Drouin, Valeri Nichushkin and Miles Wood returned a few games ago, while Ross Colton is slated to begin skating soon, but Drouin is now back on the injured list and is week-to-week with an upper-body injury. Nichushkin has played well since coming off a six-month suspension. He has two goals, including the only one in regulation in their 2-1 shootout win over Vegas on Wednesday night, as well as the lone shootout goal. ""(Nichushkin) is getting there,"" Avs coach Jared Bednar said after the win. ""His game is still coming. I do think his details have been tight and his puck play is starting to come."" The return of top forwards has taken pressure off star center Nathan MacKinnon, who was leading the NHL in points before a scoring drought. After compiling eight points in three games, MacKinnon has just two over the last six. MacKinnon has still been a force. He was double-shifted often in Wednesday's win over the Golden Knights and played a strong defensive game. Just as important, Alexandar Georgiev was sharp in net after a rough night in Tampa on Monday. He made 18 saves in regulation and stopped all five attempts in the shootout when both teams had trouble scoring. Georgiev was especially strong in the first period, when he made 10 stops to keep the game scoreless. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Oilers, who are 2-2-1 over their last five, have not played since a 6-2 win over the New York Rangers last Saturday. Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl, Connor Brown, Evan Bouchard and Mattias Janmark all recorded multi-point performances in the win over the Rangers. Draisaitl, who has goals in three straight games, has a team-leading 16 tallies and 30 points through 22 games this season. McDavid has 18 points (eight goals, 10 assists) in his last eight games. ""Our group played well in all aspects of the game,"" said McDavid, who had two goals and an assist against the Rangers. ""I thought the penalty kill was great, and they pitched in with a goal. Five on five, it seemed we were able to generate a lot, which is good."" Despite the time off, Edmonton will be without the services of forwards Zach Hyman and Viktor Arvidsson when they face Utah. Both right wingers are out with undisclosed injuries. Both are on the road with the team and could be available when Edmonton wraps up the trip against the Vegas Golden Knights on Tuesday. Goaltender Stuart Skinner, who is 7-6-2 with an .882 save percentage and a 3.23 goals-against average in 15 starts this season, is a perfect 3-0-0 with a 2.65 GAA and an .867 save percentage in three career appearances against the franchise formerly known as the Arizona Coyotes. The Coyotes won two of three meetings against Edmonton last season before relocating to Utah in the offseason. Utah has two wins over its last six games following a 3-2 overtime victory in Montreal on Tuesday. Mikhail Sergachev scored with 27 seconds remaining in overtime, and Dylan Guenther and Jack McBain scored the other Utah goals. McBain has scored in three straight games. ""We don't have to score six every time to win the game,"" Sergachev said. ""We can help out our goalies a little bit and give up two, maybe one, and still win the game. And we showed it (Tuesday). Now we've just got to keep it going. It's not going to be pretty sometimes. You have to go to the net and take shots and get elbowed in the face, but you have to get through it, and I feel like our guys are doing that right now."" Utah defenseman Robert Bortuzzo left Tuesday's game with a lower-body injury and, despite practicing on Thursday, remains day-to-day, according to coach Andre Tourigny. Utah enters Friday's contest vying for its first back-to-back victories since opening the season on a three-game winning streak (Oct. 8-12). Guenther leads all Utah scorers with 10 goals in 22 games this season, while Guenther and captain Clayton Keller share the team lead with 20 points. Karel Vejmelka, who will get the start Friday, is 3-6-0 with a .922 save percentage and a 2.25 GAA in 11 games this season. In four career appearances against the Oilers, Vejmelka is 1-3-0 with an .875 save percentage and a 4.66 GAA. Friday is the first of three meetings between the two clubs. Utah visits Edmonton on Dec. 31 and the teams conclude the season series on March 18 in Edmonton. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Bobby Durkin tied a career high with 20 points and Reed Bailey contributed 18 and 11 rebounds as Davidson (5-1) scored the game's first nine points, led by as many as 22 and bounced back nicely from 104-71 loss against No. 24 Arizona. Kochera made 7 of 10 shots and hit eight of Davidson's 17 free throws, while Durkin was 7-of-12 with four of Davidson's six 3s. The Wildcats shot 46.9 percent, including 11-of-15 on layups, and committed only eight turnovers. Kochera and Durkin helped Davidson advance to a meeting with No. 3 Gonzaga in Friday's fifth-place game. Jayden Pierre scored 14 points and Wesley Cardet added 13 but the duo combined to shoot 9-of-23 from the field. The Friars shot 31 percent, including 6 of 18 on layups. The Friars (5-2) held out Bryce Hopkins, who is close to returning from a torn ACL sustained Jan. 3. They struggled most of the game and will face No. 14 Indiana in Friday's seventh-place game after following up its two-point loss to Oklahoma with its worst showing this season. Providence missed its first 10 shots and trailed 11-2 about six minutes in. Davidson took a 17-5 lead on Durkin's 3 with 12:54 left, then added a fast 10-0 run to make it 27-8 on Bailey's jumper with 8:50 left. After Providence made a slight dent by getting within 31-17 on Cardet's triple with 3:59 left, the Wildcats took a 38-18 lead by halftime as Mike Loughnane sank a 3 with 55 seconds remaining. Providence ripped off seven straight points to get within 62-49 on a 3 by Pierre with seven minutes left. The Friars moved within 65-55 after Bensley Joseph sank two free throws with 2:08 left but got no closer the rest of the way. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Longhorns (5-1) return home after 67-58 win over Saint Joseph's in the finals of the Legends Classic in New York. Star freshman Tre Johnson led four Texas players in double-figure scoring with 17 points, marking the fourth time in his six-game career that he's led been the team's leading scorer. Texas also got 14 points in the win from Arthur Kaluma, 12 from Julian Larry and 10 from Kadin Shedrick. The latter produced dunks on back-to-back possessions in the final 5:02 that ignited a decisive 16-6 run and carried the Longhorns to their fifth straight win after a season-opening loss to Ohio State in Las Vegas. ""We learned a lot about ourselves in a loss against Ohio State and even more from the wins we had in New York,"" Texas guard Chendall Weaver said. ""We are beginning to understand our roles better and it's just about all of us coming together."" Texas has won its three home games -- all against mid-major teams -- by an average of 41.3 points. After Friday's game the competition is exponentially more difficult with games at North Carolina State and at home versus two-time defending national champion UConn. The Hornets (3-4) roll into Austin after a 111-43 walloping of Penn State Wilkes-Barre at home on Tuesday as Kaseem Watson and Robert Smith scored 19 points apiece, Martaz Robinson had 11 and Alston Andrews hit for 10. A member of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, Delaware State hasn't had a winning season since the 2011-12 campaign and has struggled against Division I programs this year, falling to Virginia Tech, Columbia, Providence and Mount St. Mary's (all on the road) by an average of 21 points.

After Boden Kapke sank a free throw with 5.8 seconds left to give Butler the two-point edge, Brooks Barnhizer drove the length of the court and his game-tying layup rolled off the iron -- and Nick Martinelli's tip a split-second before the horn curled around the inside of the rim before coming out. Fifth-year center Andre Screen came off the bench to contribute a season-high 15 points for Butler (5-1), which advanced to Friday's championship game against the winner of No. 25 Mississippi State and UNLV. Finley Bizjack added 12 points. Leading scorer Pierre Brooks II finished 1 of 7 from the field for two points -- 14 points below his average. Barnhizer paced Northwestern (5-2) with 24 points and seven rebounds while fifth-year center Matthew Nicholson finished with a season-high 14 points. Martinelli, who entered the day as the nation's No. 5 scorer with 23.8 points per game while shooting 60.2 percent from the field, missed his first six shots and finished with seven points on 3-of-15 shooting. Both teams needed time to heat up. Butler needed six possessions and four minutes to register its first points while Northwestern, after getting a Barnhizer fadeaway on the game's first possession, needed nearly five minutes to get its second basket. The Bulldogs found their groove first. They put together an 11-0 run that began with Patrick McCaffery's jumper at the 14:28 mark and concluded with Screen's power move for a layup to take a 15-6 lead with 11:17 to go. While the Wildcats were busy missing 10 out of 11 field-goal tries, Butler pushed its margin to 24-10 with 6:43 left as Screen threw down a putback dunk and a layup and Telfort swished a 3. K.J. Windham came off the bench to kickstart a Northwestern rally with a 3-pointer and a transition layup. Barnhizer finished the half with a 3-pointer and two free throws to cap a 13-2 run and pull the Wildcats within 31-28 at the break. In the second half, Northwestern failed to capitalize on its first seven possessions to tie or take the lead. Then Jalen Leach cashed a pullup just beyond the free-throw line with 6:27 left to give the Wildcats a 53-52 edge -- their first lead since 6-4. That sparked Butler's game-defining run. Telfort hit two free throws, Bizjack made a 3-pointer and Telfort sank a 3 from the wing to push the Bulldogs' margin to 60-55 with 3:45 to play. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

They'll face Northwestern State (3-4) on Friday night in Baton Rouge, La. ""We just found a way down 20 to just keep playing the next possession, and eventually started really executing well on the offensive end of the floor,"" LSU coach Matt McMahon said, ""and we were able to get enough rebounds to get out with the win."" The Tigers trailed by 20 late in the first half, got within 40-25 at halftime, fell back 52-34 with less than 13 minutes remaining and made a 17-6 run at the end of the regulation to extend the game.

For Vegas, this is its first game back from a long five-game road trip, while the Jets are in the middle of a stretch of games that, once it ends on Sunday in Dallas, will see them play only once at home in 10 contests. The exhaustion from time-zone hopping and long-distance travel has perhaps caught up to the league-best Winnipeg Jets. After a record-breaking 15-1-0 start, the Jets have dropped four of their last seven games. ""Everybody is ornery. When you lose hockey games, you're never really happy,"" said Jets coach Scott Arniel, lamenting a lack of time to continue maintaining their systems and keeping them sharp. ""That's kind of the schedule we're all facing right now. We'll work on things ... we'll get a chance to have a couple of practices this week."" Another issue the Jets have faced recently is their play away from home ice against determined teams, like the Los Angeles Kings on Wednesday. The Kings shut down Winnipeg, holding them to only 14 shots on goal and stifling one of the league's best offenses in a 4-1 victory. ""We weren't desperate enough,"" Jets forward Nino Niederreiter said following their defeat in L.A. ""At the end of the day, we're a hunted team. We're the first-place team, and everybody comes after us. We have to make sure we bring our best every single night to be successful ... you want to make sure you bounce back and bring that same mentality to the next game going to Vegas."" The Golden Knights are also a first-place team, holding onto the top spot in the Pacific Division. Despite the fatigue caused by the road trip, Vegas was still able to collect seven of a possible 10 points on the move and gained its final point in a 2-1 shootout loss to Colorado in Denver on Wednesday. Despite that, their head coach wasn't happy with the game. ""We looked tired. We're at the end of a long road trip, and we are tired. I'm not going to lie to you,"" Vegas coach Bruce Cassidy said following Wednesday's shootout loss. ""We'll probably be tired Friday (against Winnipeg). So, we just have to find ways to stay in games ... Hopefully, Friday (we) will."" The Jets have two defensemen on injured reserve, Dylan Samberg and Logan Stanley. Stanley is much closer to returning, as he has been skating with the team in a non-contact jersey and is on the trip. For Vegas, blueliner Zach Whitecloud and winger Victor Olofsson are both day-to-day. The Golden Knights would love to have them both available on Friday for a game that they are taking very seriously against Winnipeg. ""Well, you just look at their record, and you just see how they started their season off,"" Vegas forward Cole Schwindt said. ""We've kind of had them circled for a while.

It's amazing to me that he can come out the first night out and play as well as he did in a limited amount of time."" Boston has been off since Monday's 126-94 triumph over the Los Angeles Clippers. That game marked the season debut for Boston's Kristaps Porzingis, who had been recovering from offseason foot surgery. Porzingis had 16 points and six rebounds in 23 minutes against the Clippers. ""I felt better than expected,"" Porzingis said. ""Obviously the first wind is pretty crazy, you know, lungs burning, legs burning, everything. But after that, it was decent and just normal. It has been killing me inside not to be able to be out there, but it was worth the wait."" Porzingis also had two of Boston's season-high 11 blocked shots during the win. ""We have to get better at protecting the rim, which we saw a little bit of that (Monday),"" Boston coach Joe Mazzulla said. ""I think when we're fully healthy, it allows us to play different lineups, like more double-big situations where protecting the rim is easier because of the type of versatility we have out there."" Monday's victory extended Boston's winning streak to six games. The Celtics have an 8-1 road record this season, while the Bulls are 2-6 at home. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Butler, a six-time All-Star, is Miami's spiritual leader and best all-around player. But he left Miami's win over Charlotte on Wednesday due to a back injury and is listed as probable for Friday's matchup. ""His back tightened up,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said of Butler, who missed the entire fourth quarter and played just 25 minutes, scoring six points and grabbing four rebounds. Butler, 35, is averaging 18.4 points per game, two points lower than last season and four points lower than the previous campaign. That's not a trend Miami wants to see. If Butler can't be ready for Friday's game, Tyler Herro becomes even more important to the Heat. Herro, who will turn 25 in January, is having a career year, averaging a team-high 23.6 points. He also leads the team in assists (5.1). Those are both career highs for Herro, a sixth-year pro who is trending toward his first All-Star season. If Butler is out, the Heat will also look for more scoring from Bam Adebayo (15.9) and Terry Rozier (12.8). Both will likely need to do more if the Heat (8-8) are to get their record over .500. Friday's matchup is an NBA Cup game. Miami (1-2) and Toronto (0-2) are likely out of contention in the Eastern Conference's Group B as Milwaukee (3-0) and Detroit (2-0) are better positioned. Meanwhile, in terms of the overall standings, this season has been a struggle for the Raptors, who are 5-14 overall and a dismal 1-10 on the road. Then again, the Raptors are coming off their only road win of the season, beating New Orleans 119-93 on Wednesday. Toronto made 21 3-pointers on Wednesday, its most since January 2021. Prior to Wednesday, the Raptors ranked last in the NBA with just 10.4 3-pointers per game. ""We have capable shooters on this team,"" said Raptors reserve Jamison Battle, who made 6-of-8 3-pointers and finished with a career-high 24 points on Wednesday. ""It's just a confidence thing,"" Battle said. ""There's no reason for us not to take them when they're open."" Battle, 23, is an unexpected success story. He played for three colleges (George Washington, Minnesota and Ohio State), and he went undrafted. He's contributing now, and that's important to the Raptors, who have some key players on the injured list including Immanuel Quickley (elbow); Gradey Dick (calf); Bruce Brown (knee); and Kelly Olynyk (back). Brown, who played for the University of Miami, and Olynyk, who is a former Heat player, have yet to get into a game this season but were both consistent starters for Toronto last season.

The Huskies (5-1) won their fourth straight and also got 16 points, eight rebounds and seven assists from center Great Osobor, a transfer from Utah State. Nique Clifford's 13 points and nine rebounds led Colorado State (3-3), which lost its third straight game. Jalen Lake scored 12 and Kyan Evans added 11. Washington will face Santa Clara in the invitational's championship game Friday, while Colorado State will meet TCU in the third-place game. Harris, who was a West Coast Conference all-freshman selection last year for the University of Portland, drove to the basket with no one to defend him as he reached the rim and scored for a 66-58 Huskies lead. That capped off a 10-0 run with 2:41 to go. But the Rams made it 67-65 with 45.7 seconds to play, when Evans hit a 3-pointer. They couldn't reclaim the lead, however, as the Huskies sealed their win with six free throws, four from Mekhi Mason inside of 21 seconds left. The Huskies surged to a pair of eight-point leads in the second half, but the Rams wouldn't go away. Clifford's 3 with 9:58 to play trimmed it to 51-49 for the Huskies, then Lake connected from long range to make it 53-52 Washington. Colorado State took a 57-56 lead with two Lake free throws at the 7:20 mark, but moments later the Huskies went ahead 59-58 on a triple by Mason. Osobor had 13 points, six assists and five rebounds in the second half, causing problems for the Rams' defense. The first half saw Harris score 14 points, knocking down 5 of 7 shots, including three 3-pointers. Washington, with two Harris 3s and one from Zoom Diallo, scored 13 points in a row after trailing 4-0. But a 10-1 run put Colorado State in front 20-17 with 11:12 to play in the half. Colorado State didn't trail the rest of the half and took a 28-26 lead into the break. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Red Raiders (5-1) lost for the first time this season to Saint Joseph's before bouncing back to edge Syracuse 79-74 at the Legends Classic. Playing at home offers the expected comforts for Texas Tech: The Red Raiders have won their last 34 games against nonconference foes in Lubbock, with four wins this season. They have rolled in those games against Bethune-Cookman, Northwestern State, Wyoming and Arkansas-Pine Bluff, winning by an average of 33.8 points. Northern Colorado could put Texas Tech to a stiffer test with a veteran team that has gained some experience on the road against power-conference teams the first month of the season. The Bears (6-2) nearly upset Colorado in a 90-88 loss in double overtime, then dropped an 83-69 decision at Washington State. ""Northern Colorado is a well-coached team,"" Texas Tech coach Grant McCasland said. ""They have played a good schedule with a close game against Colorado and Washington State. They have a good team, and we'll have our hands full. We need to come out ready to play."" So far, the Red Raiders have fared well when tested. Transfer JT Toppin has been a force through six games, averaging 19.8 points and 10.3 rebounds per contest while shooting 62.3 percent from the floor and 75 percent from the free-throw line. Veteran Darrion Williams has also been solid with 16 ppg and a team-high 32 assists. The Red Raiders are generating 88.3 ppg and have fed off a defense that is forcing 15.7 turnovers per game. Northern Colorado doesn't figure to shy away from an up-tempo game. The Bears have also scored at a high clip (88.5 ppg) and are connecting on 10.4 3-pointers per outing. Zach Bloch has been the busiest shooter from deep, hitting 21 of 44 to bolster his 9.8 ppg. Isaiah Hawthorne, a transfer from San Francisco, has knocked down 18 of 51 and leads the Bears with 17.5 ppg (tied with teammate Langston Reynolds), buoyed by a season-high 27 against Northern New Mexico on Tuesday in a 92-50 triumph. The Bears shot 59.6 percent against Northern New Mexico, an NAIA team, after firing for 62.9 percent against Division I foe Prairie View A&M. ""Anyone in America would die for that stat,"" coach Steve Smiley told the Greeley Tribune. ""It's insane. You know, this is a Division I opponent we're playing, so I get excited about it."" The Bears share the ball well and have registered assists on 57.7 percent of their made field goals. ""Their team is well-drilled and has a good plan,"" McCasland said. ""They can bait you into playing the game a certain way. We'll need to attack inside-out and do a good job on some actions that they run."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Murray, who hit 10 of 14 shots, forced overtime with a tough game-tying bucket late in regulation and then tallied nine points in the extra session - outscoring the Cougars -- as the Rebels (6-0) put the game away. Ole Miss advanced to matchup with No. 13 Purdue, a 71-61 winner over North Carolina State, in the tournament championship game. BYU (5-1) will take on the Wolfpack on Friday in the third-place game. Dre Davis and Matthew Murrell each scored 18 points and Sean Pedulla totaled 13 points, five rebounds, three assists and two steals to help preserve Ole Miss's undefeated start. Kanon Catchings led the Cougars with 17 points. Richie Saunders, Egor Demin and Fousseyni Traore each scored 16. Ole Miss converted 17 BYU turnovers into 23 points and held a 40-26 advantage in the paint. The Rebels opened OT on a 6-1 run, including four points by Murray. Catchings made it a two-point game with a 3-pointer, but Murray responded with a three-point play, and then the Rebels secured the win by hitting eight straight free throws in an 8-0 run. Both teams made clutch plays near the end of regulation, leading to overtime. BYU missed an opportunity to win it as Fraore's off-balanced rush shot was off. Demin put BYU up 75-71 with a 3. The Cougars had a chance to add to that lead, but Pedulla picked off a pass that led to free throws by Murrell. Dre Davis then tied it with a layup. Murray followed a pair of Saunders free throws by making a tough shot over Saunders while falling down. BYU led by 10 in the first half thanks to Saunders and Catchings. Ole Miss erased the deficit with a 7-0 run. Mihailo Boskovic gave the Cougars a 42-39 halftime edge with a 3-pointer. The Rebels took a lead in the second half after hitting five straight free throws and went ahead by seven before the Cougars closed the gap. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The Pacers, while technically still alive for the Eastern wild-card spot in the quarterfinals, shot themselves to the bottom of the East Group B standings with losses to the Miami Heat and Milwaukee Bucks earlier this month. Indiana's only chances of advancing would require wins not only against the Pistons but also Tuesday at Toronto, both by large margins to improve their point differential, and then pray for a massive tie for the Eastern wild-card spot among second-place teams with 2-2 records. Having already beaten the Heat and Raptors, the Pistons have put themselves in a position to advance even should they lose to the Pacers. They complete Cup round-robin play Tuesday at home against the Bucks, who stand atop the group with a 3-0 record. A win over the Bucks, regardless of Friday's result, would give Detroit the Group B title by virtue of a head-to-head tiebreaker over Milwaukee. The advantage gained by beating Indiana is it would allow the Pistons to lose to the Bucks and still possibly earn the East's wild-card spot at 3-1 via a points-differential tiebreaker. Detroit stands plus-4 in that category. The Pacers come into the matchup in the better form of the two. They have beaten the Washington Wizards, New Orleans Pelicans and Portland Trail Blazers to open a four-game homestand. Tyrese Haliburton unveiled his true identity and came on strong late in Wednesday's 121-114 win over the Trail Blazers, finishing with 28 points. The star guard started the game wearing a plastic mask over his face to protect a bruised nose suffered in the previous outing against New Orleans. It lasted only until he missed three of his first five shots as Portland took an early lead. ""It was just getting it to sit right and strapped on right,"" he said of the issue. ""It was bothering me a little bit. But we persevered ... ""It's not coming back. Hopefully in a couple more days it stops hurting so much. I hope I never see that again."" Haliburton was held to 15 points on Opening Night when the Pacers won 115-109 at Detroit in the clubs' only previous meeting this season. Myles Turner (20 points) and Pascal Siakam (19) led the way. The Pistons have lost four of their last five, including three in a row on the road. They fell hard, 131-111, at Memphis on Wednesday. Improved defense was the key to Detroit's earlier Cup wins over the Heat and Raptors. The Pistons held Miami to 111 points in regulation of an overtime win, then kept Toronto to just 95 in a four-point win. ""They've embraced the mindset,"" Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. ""We keep talking to them and they've bought into the idea of playing in the mud. We drag you in the mud and let's see how much fun you have there. That's our mindset. We feel like we can thrive in that position."" The Pistons rank 11th in the NBA in points allowed at 112.0 per game. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Cooper Rush completed 21 of 36 passes for 195 yards and a touchdown as Dallas (5-7) became the last franchise in the four major sports to win a home game in this calendar year. It was the team's second win in five days, keeping alive its long-shot hopes for an NFC playoff berth. Drew Lock hit 21 of 32 passes for 178 yards and an interception for New York, which dropped to 2-10 with its seventh straight loss. Lock pulled the Giants within a touchdown on an 8-yard run with 2:18 left in the game. However, Dallas was able to seal the outcome via Rush's 3-yard pass to Brandin Cooks to gain a first down on the first play after the two-minute warning. The Cowboys took control with two third-quarter touchdowns, giving them a 27-10 advantage. Rush threw to Cooks for a 2-yard strike at the 11:37 mark and Dowdle added a 4-yard touchdown run just more than seven minutes later. Dallas finished with a 317-247 advantage in total yards as it completed a season sweep of New York. The pregame storyline concerned how New York would perform offensively while adjusting to its third different starting quarterback in as many weeks. Daniel Jones started during a Nov. 10 loss to Carolina, while Tommy DeVito got the call last Sunday against Tampa Bay but was injured. With Lock calling signals, the Giants took a 7-3 lead with 3:06 left in the first quarter as Tyrone Tracy Jr. capped a drive of nearly seven minutes on a 1-yard touchdown run. But that lead would not last. Dallas moved in front with two scores in 15 seconds -- Brandon Aubrey's 33-yard field goal and a 23-yard interception return by DeMarvion Overshown with 11:29 remaining in the second quarter. Graham Gano bombed a 46-yard field goal 3:21 before the half, making it 13-10 at intermission. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Edwards has been upset with the childish brand of basketball that Minnesota has been playing, something he hopes the Timberwolves can shed when they face the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday night in Minneapolis in West Group A action of the NBA Cup. Minnesota is only six months removed from a Western Conference finals appearance, but there's a growing disconnect in the locker room in Edwards' eyes. The Timberwolves lost 115-104 to the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday to fall to 8-10, leading the two-time All-Star to call for immediate change. ""We soft as hell as a team, internally. Not to the other team, but internally, we soft. We can't talk to each other,"" Edwards said. ""Just a bunch of little kids. Just like we playing with a bunch of little kids. Everybody, the whole team. ""We just can't talk to each other. And we've got to figure it out, because we can't go down this road."" Getting back on track against Los Angeles will be no easy task, though. The Clippers have won six of their past seven games, most recently beating the Washington Wizards 121-96 on Wednesday. James Harden led Los Angeles with a season-high 43 points on 13-of-22 shooting from the field. He was also efficient from deep, knocking down 7 of 11 3-pointers. Unlike Edwards, Harden hasn't had any complaints about those around him. ""These guys -- I'm not old, but they make me feel young,"" Harden told FanDuel Sports Network following the victory over Washington. ""They push me. We work together. It's a real team. ... I'm proud of the guys and the way we approach each game differently, in a great way. ""We're professional about it. And so, a lot of games are gonna be different than others, but the mindset and mentality that we have as a unit is very special."" The Clippers could be even stronger on Friday if Norman Powell suits up. The veteran guard/forward is averaging a team-high 23.3 points per game this season but hasn't played since Nov. 18 due to a hamstring injury. During his time with Los Angeles, Powell has averaged 16.5 points on stunning shooting splits (53.6 percent overall, 59.4 percent from distance) in six games vs. Minnesota. He could cause havoc for a team in the gutter that seemingly has Mike Conley as its only optimist. ""Trust me, we've spoken through the last three losses as a team, as players,"" Conley said. ""And at the end of the day, man, it comes down to us believing, believing again, believing in what we do. ""It's not about you in the big game. It's not about if you're making shots, missing shots, if you turn it over. We have to live with each other's deficiencies. We have to live with each other's mistakes and pick each other up."" Conley went for 16 points to complement Edwards' game-high 29 in the setback against Sacramento. Julius Randle contributed 21 points and nine rebounds, while Nickeil Alexander-Walker netted 17 points off the bench. Friday marks the final game of West Group A play for the Timberwolves, who are 1-2 in the in-season tournament. The Clippers are 1-1 and wrap up group action against the Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday. The Houston Rockets have already clinched West Group A thanks to a 3-0 record. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Arizona went on a 10-2 run to cut Oklahoma's lead to 78-75 following two free throws by Jaden Bradley with 1:14 remaining. Bradley had six of his 16 points in that stretch. Fears made two free throws with 20 seconds left after gathering a rebound following a 3-point miss by Bradley that could have tied the game. Bradley was fouled driving to the basket and made two free throws with 14 seconds left to cut the lead to 80-77.

Clemson faces the Rattlers (1-4) before entering a tough stretch of games that begins with a matchup against No. 8 Kentucky and continues with its Atlantic Coast Conference opener at Miami. Shaqir O'Neal scored 26 points to lead Florida A&M to its first win of the season, a lopsided 110-68 victory over Trinity Baptist of the NCCAA last Friday. Florida A&M had a season-best 17-of-39 shooting performance from 3-point range to key the win over Trinity Baptist -- its first under first-year coach Patrick Crarey II. They also recorded 21 assists and had 49 points from their bench. However, the Rattlers have struggled mightily in their first four games against power-conference foes, losing each contest by 24 or more points. Presenting another major obstacle for Florida A&M are the Tigers, who are averaging 74.7 points per game during their recent three-game winning streak, led by Chase Hunter and Ian Schieffelin.

Armed with an extensive injury list, the Nets will attempt to earn a fourth straight victory Friday night when they return home for an NBA Cup game against the Orlando Magic, who are surviving the absence of Paolo Banchero. The Nets will be without Cam Thomas for at least three weeks due to a strained left hamstring and Noah Clowney for at least two weeks with a sprained left ankle. Brooklyn is also attempting to navigate a lower back injury to Nic Claxton, who sat out Wednesday's impressive 127-117 win over the Phoenix Suns. Without Thomas' 24.7 points per game, Tyrese Martin shined in his 22nd NBA game by scoring a career-high 30 points -- three fewer than his first 21 contests combined. He hit eight of Brooklyn's 18 3-pointers as the Nets shot 45.2 percent (57-of-126) from behind the arc in wins over the Sacramento Kings, Golden State Warriors and Suns in their final three games of a four-game trip. Brooklyn is on its first three-game winning streak in almost a year and is seeking its first four-game winning stretch since the Nets won 12 straight in the Kevin Durant-Kyrie Irving era from Dec. 7, 2022, to Jan. 2, 2023. The past two seasons have started out strong for the Nets but devolved into difficult campaigns resulting in huge trades, with the likes of Durant and Irving leaving in 2023 and Mikal Bridges last season. This has made for low expectations this season, which first-year coach Jordi Fernandez likes to remind his players of. ""He told us that the one time and it's just been a thing, keep it in our head, keep a fire lit,"" Martin said. ""So after every game he reminds us they had us for 19 wins. We're here to compete every night. We're going to get more than that."" Dennis Schroder added 29 points after scoring 31 against Golden State while Trendon Watford contributed 18 as the Nets shot 56.4 percent after halftime, 50.6 percent overall and scored at least 125 for the third time this season. The Nets are 1-2 in their NBA Cup games with a minus-16 point differential while Orlando is unbeaten in its two in-season tournament games with a plus-37 differential in East Group A. One of Brooklyn's worst showings occurred Oct. 25 in Orlando when the Magic earned a 116-101 win by outscoring the Nets 67-55 in the second half. Banchero scored 15 points in the previous meeting but has been out since Oct. 30 with an oblique injury. Orlando is 10-5 in the 15 games without him and enters the opener of a five-game trip with four straight wins and 10 in its past 11. Orlando is last in the NBA in 3-point percentage (31 percent) but is coming off its most prolific outing in several weeks, shooting 38.5 percent from long range in a 133-119 win over the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday. ""They're getting the right shots, and I think their ability to stay confident in that is great,"" Orlando coach Jamahl Mosley said. Jalen Suggs scored a season-high 31 points after missing Monday's game in Charlotte with a hamstring injury. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added a season-best 24 after not scoring more than 13 in any game this season, helping Orlando score 73 by halftime. ""He was in the gym working (Tuesday), just continuously working, knowing at some point they're gonna fall,"" Mosley said. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

A struggling offense had been a common theme between the end of the Jim Montgomery era last week and Sacco's start behind the bench, as the Bruins endured a stretch of six consecutive games without scoring more than two goals prior to a 6-3 road win over the New York Islanders on Wednesday. Could the latest game be a sign of things to come? Captain Brad Marchand hopes that, at least, his team's three-goal third period to break a 3-3 tie will be. ""I just love the way that we played in the third,"" Marchand said. ""It's always about a 60-minute effort. You can start well and tail off throughout the game, but we did a good job continuing our pace and executing."" Marchand scored twice in the first 6:31 of the game, and Pavel Zacha led the Bruins' finishing kick with two goals in less than a three-minute span after assisting on a previous Morgan Geekie tally. David Pastrnak and Elias Lindholm each dished out three assists, helping Boston match its season-high goal total. The only other time the Bruins notched six goals was on Oct. 10 against the Montreal Canadiens -- the team's home opener and second overall game of the season. ""It's good for the confidence of the group (to have nine players record points),"" Sacco said. ""I think it helps everybody. When you're chipping in, you feel a little bit better about yourself, but being able to help the team is the most important thing."" Despite being Boston's leading scorer with 22 points, Pastrnak had not previously recorded a three-point game through the first 23 games. He had 14 such efforts last season, including a pair of hat tricks. On the flip side, Pittsburgh had endured longer-lasting struggles. A stretch of eight losses in 10 games (2-5-3) preceded the Penguins producing a four-goal first period on Wednesday en route to a 5-4 win over the Vancouver Canucks, who had posted a 2-0 shutout a night earlier in Boston. ""We should feel good about it because we really worked hard,"" Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. ""I thought we played on our toes. When you're going through a skid like we've gone through, as you guys can imagine, it's human nature (that) we're scarred, and it's because they care."" Similar to the Bruins' win over the Islanders, the effort against Vancouver allowed many Penguins to enter the holiday with a good feeling about their game. It was a night when they needed to kill off just a single penalty after allowing three power-play goals to the Utah Hockey Club in a 6-1 loss on Saturday. Bryan Rust led the way for Pittsburgh on Wednesday. He scored twice and registered an assist in his 25th career multi-goal game, but only his second multi-point game of the season. Defenseman Erik Karlsson logged three assists and captain Sidney Crosby had two. ""We play a game for a living,"" Rust said. ""I think sometimes everybody forgets that. It's supposed to be fun. Yes, it's our job. Yes, it's hard. We obviously take it very seriously. But it's a game. We're supposed to have fun. That breeds confidence, and everybody is on their toes when that happens.""

Denver (7-5) has won two straight games since falling to division rival Kansas City on a last-second blocked field goal. The Broncos enter Week 13 holding the seventh and final AFC playoff spot, and their bye awaits on the other side of ""Monday Night Football"" to reset them for the home stretch. Optimism is on the rise in the Rocky Mountains after the Broncos completed a season sweep of the Las Vegas Raiders with a 29-19 road win last week. ""To come here and take care of business and get the win -- the tide is turning,"" receiver Courtland Sutton said postgame. ""The Broncos are in the spot we want to be in, back in the AFC West (race), and that's an exciting spot to be in."" To notch their eighth win of the campaign, which would match last year's total, the Broncos will have to defeat a Cleveland team that has won two of its past four games since Jameis Winston took over at quarterback for the injured Deshaun Watson. The Browns (3-8) got 10 days between games after surprising the Pittsburgh Steelers 24-19 on ""Thursday Night Football."" Winston threw for 219 yards and ran for a touchdown in the snow. Winston and Broncos coach Sean Payton overlapped with the New Orleans Saints in 2020 and 2021. Winston became Payton's starter for part of 2021 and went 5-2, and Payton on Wednesday praised his former QB's ""natural leadership abilities"" while not discounting the 30-year-old's talent. ""He has tremendous arm strength,"" Payton said. ""He can get the ball down the field. He can get rid of it, and he can still slide up in the pocket and run."" Cleveland's season may look lost on paper, but Winston is bringing a positive vibe after the team's ugly 1-6 start under Watson. After downing both the Baltimore Ravens and the Steelers, can the Browns trip up another AFC team above .500? ""Getting a win in this league is important regardless of who the opponent is,"" Winston said. ""And I know this is a great defense, I know that it's a young kid from Alabama that's playing some great football right now, so I think that will be an important win for the Cleveland Browns to go and scratch away a win in Denver."" The young kid from Alabama is rookie quarterback Bo Nix, the former Auburn and Oregon star who followed up a 307-yard, four-touchdown game against the Atlanta Falcons with 273 yards and two TD passes against Las Vegas. Nix has been sacked just once in each of the Broncos' past two wins, but facing Myles Garrett is another prospect entirely. The reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year had three sacks and a forced fumble against Pittsburgh and was named AFC Defensive Player of the Week. Garrett ranks among the league leaders with 10 sacks, 13 tackles for loss and three forced fumbles. ""Happy for Myles, and also recognize that it takes everybody to achieve those (awards),"" Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said. ""But what Myles is doing play in and play out, game in and game out, with the amount of attention that he gets play in and play out, is pretty impressive."" This game also brings Cleveland receiver Jerry Jeudy back to Denver after the Broncos traded him to the Browns in March. Jeudy has broken out while playing with Winston, collecting 24 catches for 379 yards and a touchdown in the past four games. Nix was limited on Denver's estimated practice report Thursday with a back injury, as was defensive lineman John Franklin-Myers (shoulder). Cornerback Riley Moss (knee) sat out. For Cleveland, tight end Geoff Swaim (concussion), wide receiver Cedric Tillman (concussion), left tackle Jedrick Wills Jr. (knee) and safety Juan Thornhill (calf) were out Thursday. The Browns designated rookie cornerback Myles Harden to return to practice, opening his 21-day window. He had been on the IR with a shin injury since Sept. 12. He was limited Thursday, along with corner Greg Newsome II (abdomen) and tackle Germain Ifedi (biceps). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

""I have no doubts about that because we've always had a really good relationship with Carlos."" Leclerc and Sainz traded positions throughout the Vegas race, but at a critical point, Sainz passed Leclerc, who had just exited from a pit-stop and had just been told by race engineer Bryan Bozzi that Sainz was instructed not to put pressure on Leclerc or overtake Leclerc. Sainz ended up in third, with Leclerc behind him in fourth. Immediately after the race, Leclerc could be heard on the radio saying, among other things, ""Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I did my job, but being nice (bleeps) me over all the (bleeping) time, all the (bleeping) time. It's not even being nice, it's just being respectful. I know I need to shut up but ..."" Leclerc insisted Thursday that he and Sainz have cleared the air and that it won't affect future races. ""Sometimes I have overstepped the lines and sometimes he did, and then it only requires a discussion between us two and we look ourselves in the eye,"" Leclerc said. ""We know each other since a very long time now. We understand each other very, very quickly so I have no doubts. Sometimes we need these kind of things to reset a little bit."" The race results didn't affect the constructors standings but Leclerc currently has 319 points, just 21 behind McLaren's Lando Norris for second overall for the drivers' championship. Sainz is in fifth with 259 points. ""It's very clear for both of us that we just want to win the constructors',"" Leclerc said.

The No. 11 Blue Devils take on visiting Seattle on Friday night at Durham, N.C. ""We focused, the whole summer, on being our best in March,"" Duke coach Jon Scheyer said. ""That doesn't mean we want to sacrifice winning in November. Every game, we've been coming in to win. That's what we can do and should do."" Duke (4-2) is coming off Tuesday night's 75-72 loss to No. 1 Kansas in Las Vegas. That game had several ebbs and flows and revealed the grand possibilities and glitches that come with the Blue Devils. ""I think it says a lot about the potential this team has, but also the character, right now, that we have,"" Scheyer said. ""To me, it's character. You either have a competitive spirit or you don't."" Duke's 13-point deficit in the first half marked its largest hole of the season. The ability to rally was one of the positives that the Blue Devils identified. ""As much as I badly want to win -- I think maybe at some point, I've thought about if I'm crazy for the schedule that we've had our first six games,"" Scheyer said. ""But I did it with this group because I thought they could take it. They're wired the right way. They have toughness about them. The growth that we're going to have from this game, this whole trip -- playing at Arizona and then playing Kansas on a neutral site -- we're going to grow so much."" Duke has relied on freshmen Cooper Flagg and Kon Knueppel in clutch situations. Those ones didn't work out for the Blue Devils in losses to Kentucky and Kansas, but there could be big-picture benefits. ""We'll understand how teams are going to play us,"" Scheyer said. ""We'll understand time and score. All those kinds of things, we need to continue to improve."" Duke guard Tyrese Proctor scored all 15 of his points on 3-pointers vs. Kansas. The five 3s marked a career high for the junior. The Blue Devils have demonstrated depth at times. In four of their games, reserves have contributed at least 20 points. Seattle (2-4) had a two-game winning streak snapped with a 61-56 loss to Furman in the nightcap in Las Vegas. That marked the lowest-scoring game of the season for the Redhawks. ""Defensively we want to dictate,"" Seattle coach Chris Victor said. ""We don't want to be reactive. So everything we do is aggressive."" Seattle has shot only 42 percent from the field while opponents are hitting at 49.5 percent. The leading scorer for the Redhawks is forward Matthew-Alexander Moncrieffe with 14.5 points per game. He makes 63.2 percent of his shots from the field and he's averaging a team-leading 10.5 rebounds. Seattle was the champion of the College Basketball Invitational last spring.

The Broncos (3-4) advance to play the winner of the late first-round game between Washington and Colorado State on Friday afternoon. The Horned Frogs (4-2) will compete in the third-place game against either the Huskies or the Rams. Elijah Mahi added 13 points for Santa Clara, while Camaron Tongue hit for 11. The Broncos outrebounded TCU 49-38 and produced 42 points in the paint. Frankie Collins led the Horned Frogs with 15 points, and Noah Reynolds added 12. TCU went 1-for-17 on 3-point attempts. Santa Clara led for the first 24 minutes of the game, surrendered the advantage briefly, and then took charge again with a 24-3 run over a nine-minute span that was capped by a basket from Stewart with 4:04 to play. TCU missed 14 of its 15 shots in that pivotal stretch and never recovered. The Broncos scored the game's first four points, and they went up 13-5 on a bucket by Mahi 4 1/2 minutes into the contest. TCU cut the deficit to two points on Reynolds' driving layup at the 10:34 mark of the first half. Santa Clara pushed its advantage to 34-21 after a jumper by Kosy Akametu with 3:09 to play in the half. The Horned Frogs then scored the final six points of the half, as Reynolds hit a pair of layups that sandwiched two free throws by Ernest Udeh Jr. and culled the margin to 34-27 at the break. Stewart led all scorers with 14 points before halftime while Mahi added 11 for the Broncos. Reynolds paced TCU with 10 points as the Horned Frogs were 0-for-7 from beyond the arc over the first 20 minutes of play.

They hope to be a bit more cutthroat on Black Friday in a road game against the San Jose Sharks. The Kraken took just their third loss in their past nine games on Wednesday, a 5-2 decision to visiting Anaheim to split a home-and-home series with a Pacific Division rival. What was galling for Seattle was that three of the Ducks' goals came after turnovers in the Kraken's end of the rink. ""I think that says it all,"" said Kraken forward Oliver Bjorkstrand, who tallied along with teammate Eeli Tolvanen. ""We've just got to bear down, make the right plays, get it out. I can't go through the plays and what the mistakes were, but if we turn it over, just find a way to get over the blue (line) or make a better play depending on the situation."" Seattle rallied from a 2-0 deficit to tie the score but managed to get only two of 44 shots past Anaheim goaltender John Gibson. ""(The Ducks) were a little harder around the walls, and they were a little harder around our net,"" Kraken coach Dan Bylsma said. The turnovers led to Seattle goalie Joey Daccord allowing more than four goals for the first time this season. The Kraken reached Thanksgiving with an 11-11-1 record and two points out of the final wild-card spot in the Western Conference. The Kraken have accomplished that with defenseman Vince Dunn appearing in just four games because of a pair of injuries and with captain Jordan Eberle out for the next three months after pelvis surgery last week. ""Record maybe could be a little better than it is, but we're about .500, which is nice,"" said Seattle defenseman Brandon Montour, one of two big offseason signings along with forward Chandler Stephenson. The Kraken will get their first look at this summer's No. 1 overall draft pick, the Sharks' Macklin Celebrini, in the Friday matinee. Celebrini scored his seventh goal in just 13 games in a 4-3 loss to the visiting Ottawa Senators on Wednesday. The Sharks rallied from a two-goal deficit on third-period tallies by Celebrini and fellow rookie Will Smith, the fourth overall pick in 2023, but allowed the Senators to score the winner with 4:12 remaining. Ottawa won despite putting just 11 shots on goal. ""Results were (poor),"" San Jose coach Ryan Warsofsky said. ""We played some good hockey. (We've) got to be smarter in some scenarios, which we're learning. (It was) a frustrating night."" Celebrini, who aggravated a hip injury in the season opener and missed a dozen games, had two goals and an assist on Monday in a 7-2 rout of the Los Angeles Kings. ""My teammates, they're setting me up and putting me in good spots,"" Celebrini told NBC Sports California. ""I can't complain about them."" San Jose forward Barclay Goodrow left the game against the Senators in the first period with an upper-body injury, and he was placed on injured reserve Thursday. The Sharks recalled forward Ethan Cardwell from their AHL affiliate to take the roster spot. The Friday game will open a home-and-home series between the teams. The Sharks and Kraken are also scheduled to meet Saturday in Seattle. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The rivalry between No. 24 Kansas State and No. 18 Iowa State is one of the longest continuously played series in college football. The two schools have played each other every year since 1917, making this the 108th straight season and the eighth-longest uninterrupted active series in the FBS. The Wildcats travel to Ames, Iowa, on Saturday with plenty on the line for both teams. Kansas State still has a slim chance to reach the Big 12 Championship Game and a possible berth in the College Football Playoff. The Cyclones have an even better shot at the conference championship game. K-State (8-3, 5-3 Big 12) is coming off a convincing 41-15 victory over Cincinnati. They need a win on Saturday and a combination of several other outcomes to make that league title game berth possible. To reach the title game, Iowa State (9-2, 6-2) needs a little help. The Cyclones require a win and losses by two of the other three teams in the four-way tie at 6-2 in league play: Arizona State, BYU and Colorado. ""I'm really excited about this week, getting an opportunity to go play Iowa State,"" Kansas State coach Chris Klieman said Monday. ""It will be a great environment, a great atmosphere. The game has meaning. ""Going back and looking at film, I thought our guys played great in all phases. Getting off to a fast start was important."" Kansas State fans are lamenting back-to-back losses earlier this month at Houston and at home to Arizona State. With just one of those going the Wildcats' way, they would control their destiny. But Klieman and his team are proud of the stability the Cats have showed in winning at least eight games in each of the last four seasons. ""It's hard to win college football games,"" Klieman said. ""It's expected, and you want to win every game. (But) it's difficult to win. The stability and success that our staff has brought here tells a lot about the players they have brought here and the men who are leading these guys."" Iowa State has won four of the last six games in the series after stopping a 10-year Kansas State streak. Iowa State leads 53-50-4 in the all-time series. Iowa State is looking to reach 10 wins for the first time in the program's 133-year history. They've won nine games for the fourth time, but just the second time (1906) that they've done it prior to a bowl game. Amazingly, Iowa State last won a conference championship in 1912 when the Cyclones captured their second straight Missouri Valley title. Now, the opportunity to change that stat is there for the taking. But head coach Matt Campbell is not looking past Kansas State. In fact, he said at his Tuesday press conference that he hasn't even looked at the tiebreakers. ""That's a question for a wise football coach,"" he said. ""I don't have much wisdom for that one.

No. 8 Kentucky has a brand new roster, led by a brand new coach. Six games in, it hasn't seemed to matter at all. The Wildcats have are off to a 6-0 start ahead of Friday's home meeting with Georgia State. Under first-year head coach Mark Pope and an entirely revamped team, Kentucky is off to its best start since the 2016-17 season, when it won its first nine contests. Last time out, the Wildcats pulled away from Western Kentucky, earning an 87-68 home win on Tuesday. Otega Oweh and Andrew Carr, transfers from Oklahoma and Wake Forest, respectively, led Kentucky with 18 points apiece in the victory. The Wildcats shot just 40.3 percent from the field, but attempted 42 free throws, making 29 of them. For Pope, it's important for his team to learn how to win defensive battles. ""We weren't functioning great on offense, but we were finding joy on the defensive side of the ball,"" Pope said. ""That is a winning formula. We're going to have games that we have to win on defense. If we can really find joy there, and keep going back to that well over and over, we have a chance to win a lot of games."" Kentucky's 95.3 points per game rank second in the nation through Wednesday's play. The Wildcats are led by Oweh's 16.5 points per contest, followed by Dayton transfer Koby Brea's 14.8. Former San Diego State star Lamont Butler adds 11.7 ppg, while Carr and BYU transfer Jaxson Robinson add 10.8 each. ""It's fun to know we can win games in different ways,"" Pope added. ""That's really important. It bodes well for our guys and our team."" Georgia State enters play on the heels of Wednesday's 74-71 win over Tulsa in the Jacksonville Classic. After falling to Austin Peay on Tuesday, the Panthers (4-3) salvaged their trip to Florida as Zarique Nutter converted a three-point play with two seconds left to ice the win. Nutter leads Georgia State with 17.2 points per game, and paced the Panthers with 22 on Wednesday, none more important than his final three. ""We were just trying to put the ball in his hands,"" Georgia State head coach Jonas Hayes said. ""We were going to run a high ball screen and allow him to operate and make decisions. ... We tried to play with a lot of poise and we were able to do that on a neutral court. I thought we had enough togetherness to withstand runs (Tulsa) went on. We were able to respond and escape with the win."" Hayes' group will prepare on short rest for its toughest test of the season at Kentucky. It's their second of three matchups against Southeastern Conference teams, as the Panthers fell 101-66 at Mississippi State on Nov. 8, and will travel to No. 4 Auburn on Dec. 17. Following Nutter, Toneari Lane adds 15.3 points per game, while Cesare Edwards chips in 11. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

The streak matches the franchise record established during their first season in Detroit in 1934. The Lions snapped a seven-game losing streak in their annual Thanksgiving Day game. Goff passed for 221 yards, while David Montgomery had 124 scrimmage yards. Jahmyr Gibbs added a combined 104 yards for Detroit (11-1), which owns the best record in the NFC. Caleb Williams threw for 256 yards and three second-half touchdowns for the Bears (4-8), who have lost six straight. DJ Moore caught eight passes for 97 yards and a touchdown. Chicago's poor clock management on its last possession allowed Detroit to hold on. The Lions outgained the Bears 279-53 in the first half and grabbed a 16-0 lead. Detroit controlled the ball for nearly eight minutes after the opening kickoff but settled for a 30-yard Jake Bates field goal. The Bears went three-and-out on their first possession. The Lions then methodically moved 90 yards down the field in 10 plays and scored on the first play of the second quarter, a 3-yard pass from Goff to LaPorta. The Lions added 36 and 48 yard field goals by Bates. The Bears got on the scoreboard on the opening possession of the second half. Williams finished off the 74-yard drive with a 31-pass to Keenan Allen. The Lions answered with a touchdown. That drive was completed by Goff's 1-yard toss to LaPorta to make it 23-7. Chicago cut the deficit to 23-13 on Williams' 9-yard scoring pass to Allen with 13:40 remaining. Williams threw an incompletion on the 2-point try. Bates missed a 45-yard field goal try with 8:42 left. The Bears then made it a three-point game with 5:36 remaining on Williams' 31-yard scoring pass to Moore. The Lions were forced to punt on their next possession but it was downed on the Bears 1-yard line. A pass interference penalty against Detroit on fourth-and-14 allowed Chicago's drive to continue in the final minute. After a sack left the ball on the Chicago 41-yard line with 32 seconds left, the Bears failed to call a timeout on third down and the clock ran out on a Williams incompletion. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

In the second game where newcomer Steven Stamkos will face his former team, the Predators will host the Tampa Bay Lightning on Friday afternoon to complete the season series. Both sides will be looking to rebound from disappointing blown leads on Wednesday that left a bitter taste the night before Thanksgiving. For Nashville, it was simple: Shut down the final seconds of the home matchup with the Philadelphia Flyers and take the turkey day off knowing it would meet the Lightning on a high note. That didn't happen. Leading 2-1 as the clock wound down and the visiting net was empty, Philadelphia's Morgan Frost chipped in the tying goal with only a dozen seconds left. Flyers captain Sean Couturier, who assisted on the equalizer, put the game away in overtime with a similar chip shot on the other side of goaltender Juuse Saros. ""We've developed some resiliency, but we've had too many of these kinds of games,"" Nashville coach Andrew Brunette said of his club, which is 4-6-3 this month. ""The devil is in the details, and we missed a few details. ""It'll be a big test on Friday."" With physical defenseman Jeremy Lauzon injured, the Predators recalled blue-liners Adam Wilsby and Nick Blankenburg from their AHL affiliate Milwaukee Admirals and inserted them into the lineup. ""I thought he was really good -- kind of what I had seen in camp,"" Brunette said of the 24-year-old Wilsby's NHL debut. ""I thought he had really good mobility and was firm on the puck in his battles. I thought both guys played well."" Two nights after hitting the net five times in the opening 20 minutes in a home win over Colorado, the Lightning continued their torrid first-period scoring by getting two past Washington Capitals goalie Charlie Lindgren. However, the Capitals, playing their fourth game without star sniper Alex Ovechkin (fractured fibula), battled back three times to tie the contest before Tom Wilson put the win away with a power-play tally with 3:26 left in regulation. A bit worse than Nashville in the final frame, the Lightning surrendered a pair of one-goal leads in the third to lose for the third time in four outings (1-2-1). Brayden Point crafted the fifth hat trick of his career, though the third tally occurred in strange fashion. The center was the last home player to touch the puck before Lindgren inadvertently backhanded the puck into his own net without a defender anywhere nearby. Lightning center Anthony Cirelli, whose six-game goal streak ended, committed a double-minor high-sticking penalty late in the tie game -- a four-minute power play with 4:03 left in regulation. Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper said the puck entering the zone was offside. However, the play continued as normal with Cirelli soon committing the infraction. ""It's tough, but it's the way the rules are,"" said Cooper. ""If a goal is scored, it'll come off the board. But a penalty taken does not come off the board. ""It's kind of an unfortunate circumstance ... but in the end you've got to kill it off, and we didn't kill it off."" The Lightning won the first meeting against the Central Division club 3-2 in overtime on Oct. 28 in Tampa. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Los Angeles, which gave up five third-period goals in an embarrassing 7-2 loss to the last-place San Jose Sharks on Monday, rebounded with a 4-1 home victory over the NHL points-leading Winnipeg Jets on Wednesday. Anaheim, a 3-2 loser to visiting Seattle on Monday, took the second half of the home-and-home series with the Kraken after a convincing 5-2 road victory on Wednesday.   The Southern California rivals will try to build on their momentum in the second of their four meetings this season. The first one, played at Anaheim on Oct. 20, was tied 0-0 heading into the third period before the Kings scored four times, including a pair of empty-netters by Kevin Fiala and Mikey Anderson, to defeat the Ducks 4-1.   David Rittich needed just 13 saves, including only two in the third period, in the Kings' win over the Jets on Wednesday en route to his 100th career NHL win. Anze Kopitar and Adrian Kempe each had a goal and an assist and Alex Laferriere added two assists as third-place Los Angeles moved to within four points of Pacific Division-leading Vegas with the win.   ""It's an example maybe of how good we can be,"" Kings coach Jim Hiller said. ""It's hard to be really good like that night after night. It's an 82-game season, but it gives us an example of what is possible if we all play together in a certain style of play.""   Said Kings left wing Trevor Moore: ""It's a great win. That's the best team in the league. We wish we could play like that every night, and that's on us. We have to bring that type of intensity and work ethic. We really committed to the forecheck tonight and I think that paid off for us.""   Anaheim won its third straight road game at Seattle with John Gibson making a season-high 42 saves to improve to 4-0-1 on the season. Trevor Zegras, Cutter Gauthier and Alex Killorn each has a goal and an assist for the Ducks, who were a perfect 5-for-5 on the penalty kill.   ""It's pretty simple for us,"" Anaheim coach Greg Cronin said. ""If we put the pucks deep, you saw it was a physical style to start the game, and then I thought we sustained it for 60 minutes. I've been saying all year when you get good sticks and finish checks that means you're skating, and I thought we did a good job of that for 60 minutes.""   Gibson, who missed the first month of the season after undergoing emergency appendectomy surgery on Sept. 25, has yet to lose in regulation in five starts while compiling a .919 save percentage and 2.57 goals-against average.   ""I feel pretty good with my reads,"" Gibson said. ""Just feel like I'm reading the play well and staying square and staying calm and just having fun.""   The win snapped an eight-game losing streak against Seattle for the Ducks.   ""We played really well,"" Gibson said. ""We did a lot of good things offensively, getting pucks to the net, bodies to the net, and found a way to get some greasy goals. It was a big team win.

While the Flames are challenging the Pacific Division-leading Vegas Golden Knights despite a recent 0-1-1 fall from a four-game win streak, this one has deeper meaning as the two teams that Johnny Gaudreau played for during his 11-year NHL career meet for the first time since his tragic death in August. ""Honestly, I don't want to look too far ahead. I'm just gonna try to get through the game -- to go there will be hard,"" Flames defenseman Rasmus Andersson said. ""Seeing the banner (at Nationwide Arena featuring Gaudreau's name and No. 13), that kind of stuff will be tough. There are probably going to be a lot of emotions, and rightfully so."" Andersson considered Gaudreau -- who began his NHL career as a Flame from 2013-22 before electing to sign closer to his native New Jersey with the Blue Jackets for the next two seasons -- one of his first close friends in the NHL. Many other players also share similar sentiments, adding emotion to both Friday's game and the return game next Tuesday in Calgary which the Gaudreau family is expected to attend. Among those players is Columbus center Sean Monahan, a former Flames player who expected to reunite with Gaudreau on the ice after signing as a free agent in July. The 30-year-old has still made a huge impact with his new team, including netting seven points during a three-game win streak that was snapped with a 4-3 overtime loss on Wednesday to the visiting Montreal Canadiens. Monahan's 20 points in 21 games are tied for second on the Blue Jackets and trail only defenseman Zach Werenski, who logged a goal and an assist against Montreal to extend his point streak to six games. ""Just to have a veteran presence, obviously with his connection with Johnny, was something we all were excited about seeing back together,"" Blue Jackets coach Dean Evason said. ""Obviously, and, unfortunately, that didn't happen. ""(Monahan) is the consummate pro. He's a stabilizing figure on the ice and in our locker room."" The NHL's First Star of the Week, Werenski's surge has been especially important with captain Boone Jenner injured (shoulder). The Blue Jackets' lineup also missed center Cole Sillinger (upper-body) on Wednesday. ""I think I have to (be a leader) with some guys out, but I'm also at the age (27) where I feel more comfortable doing it,"" Werenski said. ""I feel like I can get a pulse on the room, what needs to be said in certain situations, and I've enjoyed it."" The Flames also suffered an overtime loss on Wednesday. After Connor Zary's power-play goal with 2:48 left in the third period tied the score, the host Detroit Red Wings bounced back to take a 2-1 result. Zary and fellow center Yegor Sharangovich each ride four-game point streaks into Columbus. Sharangovich had scored in three straight contests prior to Wednesday. Zary's man-up goal was the sixth for the Flames in a five-game span. Calgary is 3-4-4 on the road, while Columbus -- which swept last season's head-to-head matchups -- is just 2-6-2 at home. Something has to give on Wednesday, and Flames coach Ryan Huska hopes that his team can stick to what makes it successful regardless of the place. ""There's things that make our team a good hockey team, and if those things are present, it gives us a chance to win,"" Huska said. ""It doesn't guarantee wins, but we feel we're going to be in games and now our power play can help us out and win us close games."" --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

He finished 14-for-17 on free throws during a game when his impact was huge at both ends of the court. Reserve Reyne Smith added 15 points and Kasean Pryor provided 13 points and eight rebounds for the Cardinals (5-1). Terrence Edwards Jr. chipped in 10 points. Javon Small drained four 3-point shots on the way to 26 points to lead West Virginia (4-2). Amani Hansberry's 19 points and Toby Okani's 12 also boosted the Mountaineers, who shot 44.1 percent (26 of 59) from the field but were hurt by Louisville's 14 offensive rebounds. The Cardinals, who trailed by as many as 11 points in the first half, will face either No. 24 Arizona or Oklahoma in the tournament championship game Friday. West Virginia meets the loser in the third-place game. Late in the second half, Hepburn scored nine points and made three steals during Louisville's 14-2 run that produced a 59-52 lead. But West Virginia stormed back in the next two minutes with eight straight points before Edwards' basket put the Cardinals back in front. Small scored on a drive, and then Hepburn made it 62-62 by making one of two free throws at the 31-second mark. West Virginia botched the final play of regulation. In overtime, the Mountaineers were held to two field goals and committed two turnovers. Small, who shot 10-for-19 from the floor, led West Virginia with seven rebounds and seven assists. The Mountaineers got only three points from their bench players. Louisville held a 24-9 scoring advantage on free throws despite missing nine attempts from the line.

Hill drove to his left on the next possession and was bumped by Frank Mitchell on the wing.

The Shockers will meet either No. 18 Florida or Wake Forest in Friday's championship game, while the Gophers will play the loser of that game for third place. Each team had one major shortcoming in a slow-paced, low-scoring first half. Minnesota turned the ball over nine times, while Wichita State was outrebounded 18-12. Neither team established more than a four-point lead in the half, with the Shockers taking a 13-9 advantage at the 11:56 mark on a 3-pointer by Bell. The Gophers rallied for a 20-19 edge with five minutes left on a corner 3-pointer by Isaac Asuma.

Pacheco, Kansas City's starting running back, sustained a broken fibula is his team's victory over the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 2. Omenihu, a defensive lineman, has yet to make his season debut. He has been recovering from a torn ACL sustained in last season's AFC Championship Game victory against the Baltimore Ravens. The Chiefs (10-1) also ruled out rookie kicker Spencer Shrader (right hamstring) and listed linebacker Cam Jones (illness) as questionable after he missed practice Tuesday and Wednesday but was a full participant Thursday. Game-day elevations were kicker Matthew Wright and tight end Anthony Firkser. Pacheco, 25, rushed for 135 yards with a touchdown and caught seven passes for 54 yards in two games before the injury. He has accumulated 2,328 yards from scrimmage with 15 touchdowns in 33 games (26 starts) since Kansas City drafted him in the seventh round in 2022.

Carolina racked up a total of seven goals in the third period across the past two games as the Hurricanes rallied to beat Dallas and the New York Rangers. Blake scored the winning goal on a power play Wednesday night against the Rangers. ""We made a couple of plays that we were able to score on,"" Hurricanes coach Rod Brind'Amour said. The Panthers haven't been nearly as productive as Carolina across the past couple of weeks, but they posted a 5-1 home victory against the Toronto Maple Leafs on Wednesday. That marked Florida's second win in its last eight games. ""We're not as strong defensively from our net to our forwards as I would like us to be,"" Panthers coach Paul Maurice said. ""We look like there's potential there to get better."" The Hurricanes have won nine straight home games since losing their opener to Tampa Bay. The home-ice streak matches the second-longest in franchise history. Carolina has produced at least one power-play goal in five consecutive games. ""The power play is about execution,"" Brind'Amour said. ""You always have a plan, but they executed."" Hurricanes forward Martin Necas moved into the NHL points lead with 37 by notching two assists Wednesday night against the Rangers. Forward Seth Jarvis has two goals and two assists in two games for the Hurricanes since returning from an injury. Defenseman Dmitry Orlov, who's in his 13th NHL season, has a career-high six-game points streak and ranks second among defensemen on the team with 14 points. Carolina needs to maintain high offensive production with uncertainty at the other end. Goalie Spencer Martin has been pressed into duty as the Hurricanes wait to see how long Pyotr Kochetkov will be in the concussion protocol. Martin has played in four consecutive games. ""We put him into a bit of a tough spot, obviously,"" Brind'Amour said. ""Throw to the wolves a little bit, but he's handling it. That's crucial."" The Panthers have offensive sources that will be challenging to contain. Sam Reinhart leads the NHL with 17 goals, including four short-handed tallies. About a quarter of the way through the season, trends start to be established, Maurice said. The Panthers still have the components of an elite team, but it's a matter of smoothing out certain areas. ""The challenge for this season is finding that energy source,"" Maurice said. ""Now we feel we're a pretty good team. ... You got a puzzle every day. You've got a puzzle every year and you've got to try to solve it."" Maurice had two stints as Carolina's coach.

Smith, 42, was an offensive lineman for the Tar Heels from 2001-05 and launched his coaching career as a graduate assistant in Chapel Hill in 2006. North Carolina announced earlier this week that this will be the final season for Mack Brown, the winningest head coach in school history. Smith said he had a preliminary call about the opening but told reporters he is personally and professionally happy in Pittsburgh, where the former Atlanta Falcons head coach is in his first season on Mike Tomlin's staff. ""I've got an awesome job here. When you've got something good, my family loves it here,"" Smith said, according to the Steelers' team website. Smith posted three consecutive 7-10 campaigns with the Falcons from 2021-23. He was an assistant coach with the Tennessee Titans from 2012-20, the last two seasons as offensive coordinator. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Ovechkin will be out for another 3-5 weeks after the superstar forward sustained a fractured fibula on Nov. 18. Washington lost its first two games in Ovechkin's absence but rebounded with a pair of wins in the Sunshine State -- a 4-1 result over the Florida Panthers on Monday and a wild 5-4 comeback victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning on Wednesday. Despite trailing three different times against the Lightning, the Capitals continually fought back and finally took the lead on Tom Wilson's power-play goal at 16:34 of the third period. ""When stuff happens and there's ups and downs, you find a lot out about your team and your teammates,"" Wilson said. ""And I couldn't be more proud of the group and proud of our goalie (Charlie Lindgren) and just everybody stepping up. A pretty gutsy, gutsy effort tonight."" New York's own comeback effort in Wednesday's 6-3 loss to the Boston Bruins was undermined by another late breakdown. The Islanders twice came back to equalize after falling behind in the first two periods, but Boston then scored three unanswered goals over the final 10 minutes of play. The Islanders have allowed a league-high 36 goals in the third period this season. Despite just two wins in the Islanders' last nine games (2-4-3), head coach Patrick Roy feels his team's results don't reflect the quality of play. ""We're not giving (up) 40 shots, we're giving 21 (against Boston),"" Roy said. ""We're not giving up 22 scoring chances, we're giving 10 or 12. So, we do a lot of good things. ... But I realize that we're making mistakes at key times that cause goals."" New York's struggling special-teams units rank 31st in the NHL in both power-play percentage (12.5) and penalty-kill percentage (70.2). The latter statistic is particularly frustrating since the Islanders have taken the fewest penalties (56) and served the fewest penalty minutes (121) of any team in the league. Washington's penalty-kill percentage (84.7) is the fourth-best in the NHL. The Capitals' 6-2-1 record in their last nine games has been aided by a resurgent power play. Washington is 8-for-20 on power plays over that stretch, after going just 4-for-46 with the extra attacker in their first 13 games. Per Washington's usual goalie rotation, Logan Thompson should start Friday since Lindgren faced the Lightning. Thompson is 9-1-1 with an excellent 2.44 goals-against average and .917 save percentage in 11 starts this season. Since the Islanders also play Saturday at home against the Buffalo Sabres, goalies Ilya Sorokin and Semyon Varlamov are expected to split the back-to-back starts in some order. Varlamov could be in line to face the Capitals after Sorokin allowed five goals on 20 Bruins shots Wednesday. After collecting just 10 points (seven goals, three assists) in the Islanders' first 20 games, Brock Nelson has tallied three goals and four assists in New York's last three games. Dylan Strome leads the Capitals with 31 points (seven goals, 24 assists). --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Detroit has won three of its last four games while giving up just six total goals during that span. Now the Red Wings will host the New Jersey Devils on Friday afternoon. Detroit needed overtime to pull out a 2-1 victory over the Calgary Flames on Wednesday night. Lucas Raymond extended his goal streak to four games by scoring on a power play during the extra session. Cam Talbot didn't allow a goal until a Flames power play late in regulation. ""We've shown that we can play these games. We knew coming into this game with Calgary -- they're an aggressive team, they forecheck hard. They tend to just outwork the opponent and grind them down,"" Talbot said. ""We bent but we didn't break for the most part all night.  ""If anything, we kind of took it to them for most of the game. Gave up that late one and you can do one of two things -- either fold and give the game back to them or you can go out in overtime and get the game winner. We did a good job mentally of not letting that get to us and finishing the win."" Detroit had surrendered 15 goals while losing all three games of a West Coast trip prior to its improved four-game stretch. ""Our D zone has been unbelievable as of late,"" Talbot said. ""Guys are doing a good job of clogging up the middle and making the other team give up the puck coming into the zone. Once we clean up the (penalty kill), you'll see that number come down even more. But 5-on-5 our team has been pretty dialed in in the defensive zone."" Raymond has been dialed in on the offensive zone. ""I felt like it was a matter of time,"" coach Derek Lalonde said of Raymond's hot streak. ""It's a good sign. I'm not surprised."" New Jersey, one of the top offensive teams in the league, continued its odd habit of getting shut out in its losses. The Devils were blanked at home 3-0 on Wednesday by the St. Louis Blues. New Jersey has scored an average of 4.6 goals per game in its 10 victories since late Oct. 27. In their four losses during that stretch, the Devils have been shutout each time. The Devils surrendered all three Blues goals Wednesday in the first period. ""It's tough against any team when you spot them a lead like that,"" Devils coach Sheldon Keefe said. ""They're parking the bus, clogging it up, making it hard to get to their net. They're not taking any chances on offense. You have to find your way through that. Clearly, it was a struggle for us.""   New Jersey squeezed off 31 shots on goal against St. Louis goaltender Jordan Binnington and wound up frustrated. ""Lots of looks, lots of chances, posts, one of those nights it didn't go in for us,"" Devils forward Stefan Noesen said.

The Canucks look to dust themselves off on Friday afternoon when they visit the Buffalo Sabres for the fourth leg of their six-game road trip. Vancouver dropped a 5-4 decision to the Pittsburgh Penguins on Wednesday, marking their first loss away from British Columbia since a 4-1 setback to the Tampa Bay Lightning on Oct. 15. The Canucks limped out of the blocks and surrendered four goals in the first period on Wednesday, much to the chagrin of head coach Rick Tocchet. ""The first period, obviously, we gifted the goals,"" Tocchet said. ""Seemed like anything they shot went in, but we also gifted some goals. Then you're behind 4-1."" Vancouver allowed another goal at 3:40 of the second period before Pius Suter responded 10 minutes later. Defenseman Quinn Hughes and Elias Pettersson each tallied in the third, however the Canucks could not complete the comeback. ""I liked the battle back from us,"" Pettersson said, ""But we can't come out with an effort like that to start and expect to win a game."" Hughes collected a goal and two assists on Wednesday to boost his point total to 15 (three goals, 12 assists) in 12 games this month. Pettersson, in turn, scored and set up a goal versus the Penguins to give him 12 points (five goals, seven assists) in his last nine contests. Conor Garland notched an assist to extend his point streak to six games (two goals, five assists). Kevin Lankinen is expected to return to the crease following a night off on Wednesday. He owns a sterling 10-3-2 record and has won all eight of his starts on the road this season. The Sabres returned home from a successful four-game road trip (3-1-0) only to be shut out for the first time this season in a 1-0 setback to the Minnesota Wild on Wednesday. Buffalo's Tage Thompson told reporters that he didn't think his team had reason to hang its head, however, especially after matching a season high with 39 shots on goal. ""Honestly, I think we played a really good game (on Wednesday). I don't think we can let that discourage us,"" Thompson said. ""Obviously, it stings when you lose, especially one like that where you feel like you outplayed them most of the night. Sometimes you run into a hot goalie and (there is) not much you can do. You've just got to find ways to get one."" Thompson recorded six shots on goal in his return from a five-game absence due to a lower-body injury. ""Felt great,"" Thompson said. ""Obviously, you miss that much time, lungs are burning a little bit, legs are a little heavy first few, and then you get into a rhythm and start to feel good. I felt I got better as the game wore on."" Despite missing time, Thompson still leads the Sabres with 11 goals on the season. His 18 points are three shy of the club lead held by Alex Tuch, who also has a team-best 14 assists. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Both teams won Wednesday, albeit in vastly different fashion. The Wild won on the road for a league-leading 10th time this season by blanking Buffalo 1-0. Chicago, which had lost four of five games, got a much-needed win at home in a 6-2 rout of Dallas that featured a couple of key players ending lengthy droughts. The Central Division matchup features second-place Minnesota, which has the league's third-best record overall, against the Blackhawks, who are tied with division rival Nashville with the fewest points in the league. Minnesota played, arguably, its best defensive game of the season Wednesday. Filip Gustavsson made 39 saves for his second shutout of the season and his teammates blocked 32 shots, one shy of the team record set 13 years ago against San Jose. Wild coach John Hynes told reporters afterward that he likes the maturity his team is showing. ""I liked the fact that it was a tight game, and I thought that we continued to push for offense, even the third period,"" Hynes said of his team, which registered 25 of its 29 shots after the first period. ""We didn't just check the whole game. I thought when we had to defend hard, we did, but I also thought we pushed."" Kirill Kaprizov continued his campaign for the Hart Trophy by scoring the game's lone goal in the first period. The 2021 Calder Trophy winner is now tied for second in the NHL with 35 points. Chicago's victory came thanks in large part to a turn-back-the-clock game for Taylor Hall. The 33-year-old went into the Dallas game with just two goals and six points in 20 games, but he finished it with his first hat trick in nearly 11 years. The 2018 Hart Trophy winner is the sixth player in league history to go 10 years or longer between three-goal games. Hall's breakout game came less than two weeks after Chicago coach Luke Richardson made the veteran a healthy scratch in a game versus Nashville. The move stunned the left wing, yet both said they were on the same page after discussing the benching. After Wednesday's win, Richardson raved to reporters about a play Hall made midway through the third period -- when Chicago led 6-1 -- that prevented a Stars goal. ""I think that's just as important as the others, and that's the professional he is,"" Richardson said. ""He played a complete game. He wasn't just happy with his three goals. He played hard for (goalie) Petr (Mrazek), backchecking hard and helping the defense out. That's a good example for everybody."" The mix of experienced players, like Hall and Teuvo Teravainen, with several youngsters, led by last year's Calder winner Connor Bedard, has yet to pay dividends on the rebuilding club. Even after Wednesday's outburst, Chicago is tied for 27th in the league, averaging just 2.5 goals per game. Bedard also scored his fourth goal of the season, and first since Oct. 26, in the win. Friday's game is the second of four the teams will play this season. Chicago beat the Wild at home 2-1 in overtime on Nov. 10. --Field Level Media Copyright 2024"

Philadelphia hopes to ride the momentum from an exciting win when it hosts New York in a Black Friday matinee. The Flyers were outplayed by the Nashville Predators for most of Wednesday's contest before Morgan Frost scored with 12 seconds left to force overtime. Sean Couturier's deflection found the back of the net in the extra session, securing one of the Flyers' more improbable wins in recent memory. ""There were a lot of minutes that it just was not good for us tonight,"" Flyers coach John Tortorella said. ""I readily admit that. But I just like the way they just stayed with it and tried to plug along."" Philadelphia has won two of its last three games (2-0-1) with the only defeat in that stretch coming Monday. That night, the Flyers held 3-0 and 4-3 leads versus the Vegas Golden Knights before suffering a bitter defeat in a shootout. ""Just staying with it, staying patient,"" Flyers defenseman Travis Sanheim said Wednesday. ""It wasn't our best effort. Find a way to stay in the game and get one late and end up probably stealing two points. But you look at (Monday) night, probably a game that we should've had and end up losing it. That's the way hockey is sometimes. We'll take the two points and move on."" The Rangers wish they could have escaped with two points Wednesday against the Carolina Hurricanes. They led 3-2 midway through the third period before allowing two goals in 2:07 to fall behind in an eventual 4-3 defeat -- the team's fourth straight setback. ""The effort was good, (but) nobody feels good,"" New York coach Peter Laviolette said. ""We ended up losing a hockey game we were winning going into the third period."" Brett Berard scored his first NHL goal for the Rangers, while Jonny Brodzinski and Adam Edstrom also tallied. The team has been outscored 18-9 during its current skid. ""We did enough to put ourselves in position to win tonight. Sometimes it just doesn't work out,"" New York forward Reilly Smith said. Friday's matchup will pit one of the league's premier goalies -- the Rangers' Ilya Shesterkin -- against one of the Flyers' backup netminders, unless Philadelphia starter Samuel Ersson is ready to return from a lower-body injury. There has not been a recent update on Ersson (who has not played since Nov. 11), while Ivan Fedotov and Aleksei Kolosov have essentially split time in the Philadelphia net. Regardless of Friday's starter, New York certainly will look to come out aggressively against a team it has dominated in recent years. Over the previous three seasons, the Rangers went 9-1-1 against the Flyers. This is their first meeting this season. ""We're going through a little bit of adversity as a group,"" Rangers captain Jacob Trouba said.

The way they beat the Raiders on Friday still had Patrick Mahomes and Co. shaking their heads in disbelief. The two-time MVP watched from the sideline as Las Vegas drove within range of a winning field goal with 15 seconds left, only to botch the snap on its final offensive play, allowing the Chiefs to escape with a 19-17 victory that also secured their 10th consecutive playoff berth — the second-longest streak in NFL history. “Obviously a big stop in a big moment that got us the win,” Mahomes said. The Raiders (2-10) had taken over at their own 8-yard line with just under two minutes to go, and quarterback Aidan O'Connell quickly moved them across midfield, eventually spiking the ball at the Kansas City 32 to stop the clock. Rather than try for the winning field goal — Daniel Carlson had missed three from 50-plus — the Raiders lined up to run a play, hoping to gain a few yards with a throw to the sideline before time expired. But amid the roar of Arrowhead Stadium, rookie center Jackson Powers-Johnson snapped the ball when O'Connell wasn't expecting it, and it bounced off the QB's shoulder. Chiefs linebacker Nick Bolton pounced on it, and the recovery stood when a flag on the play turned out to be an illegal shift by the Raiders. “I actually didn't watch,” Raiders coach Antonio Pierce said of the fateful play. “That last play there was a lot going on, from the officiating to the flags to the ball being snapped.” Mahomes finished with 306 yards passing and a touchdown, and fill-in kicker Matt Wright made four field goals for the two-time defending Super Bowl champion Chiefs (11-1), who won their NFL record-extending 14th consecutive one-possession game. Like many of them, including last week's last-second win over Carolina, the Chiefs seemed to be in no mood to celebrate. “I mean, we just hold ourselves to such a high standard. We don’t feel like we’re playing our best football,” Mahomes said. “We have to find a way to build up to play great (as) a full, entire team. It’s awesome that we’re finding ways to get wins. That’s what you’re going for. But our goal is to get to the Super Bowl.” The Raiders had a chance to take the lead earlier in the fourth quarter, too, when O'Connell drove them across midfield. But the Chiefs forced three incompletions — George Karlaftis and Justin Reid batted down two — to bring up fourth down. Carlson headed onto the field, but his 58-yard try with 2:21 remaining never got near the uprights. O’Connell finished with 340 yards passing and two touchdowns for the Raiders, who have lost eight of nine to their bitter AFC West rivals. Brock Bowers had 10 catches for 140 yards and one of the scores. “These guys battled until the very end, until the clock hit zero,” Pierce said. “They believed we were going to win and fought their (butts) off to the very end. All phases contributed to help us get in that position, but Aiden did hell of a job. He stayed in the pocket, made big-time throws for us, pushed the ball down the field. The numbers say what they’re going to say. I’m proud of my team, our team. I'm proud of the fight. We came up short yet again against the world champs. Twice now.” The hapless Raiders were able to hang around thanks to the same problems that have plagued the Chiefs much of the season: Their offensive tackles were unable to give Mahomes time to throw, their secondary kept breaking down and they committed too many penalties — three on one offensive possession alone. In fact, Mahomes was under extreme duress when he found Justin Watson from 6 yards out late in the first half. The pass not only gave the Chiefs a 10-3 lead but sent the two-time MVP past Len Dawson with his franchise-record 328th TD throw. O'Connell, thrust back onto the field when Gardner Minshew broke his collarbone last weekend, got off to a slow start after missing a month with a broken thumb. But as the Chiefs continued to kick field goals, O'Connell found his rhythm, eventually slinging a pair of touchdown passes to give Las Vegas the lead. The first was to Bowers, already one of the most productive rookies in NFL history, with 1:40 left in the third quarter. Then, after the Chiefs went three-and-out, O'Connell hit Tre Tucker with 58-yard strike on the first play of the fourth quarter. The Chiefs answered with Wright's fourth field goal to take a 19-17 lead with about 10 minutes to go. A whole lot was still to transpire before that was the final score. “The win was a positive here. These things are hard to get, especially against this crew,” Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. “They do a nice job against us it seems every time we play them. It comes right down to the end.” Chris Jones had two sacks for Kansas City. He had not had one the previous seven games. ... Las Vegas has trailed by double digits in every game this season. ... Mahomes had gone 113 straight starts without being sacked five-plus times. Carolina and Las Vegas have done it in consecutive weeks. ... The Raiders were officially eliminated from playoff contention. Raiders: WR DJ Turner left in the second half with a knee injury. The Raiders visit Tampa Bay on Dec. 8.

Edwards hit a pull-up 3-pointer with 2:24 to go for a 92-90 lead. The Clippers made only one basket, a layup by Zubac, over the final four minutes. Clippers: With star Kawhi Leonard (knee) yet to play this season and starter Norman Powell (hamstring) sidelined for a his sixth straight game, the Clippers have been hanging in there in the loaded West. Timberwolves: The 11-point second-quarter lead evaporated in the type of funk that has troubled this team since reaching the conference finals last season, be it from a lack of intensity on defense, a stoppage of movement on offense, or both. With three straight turnovers to start the second half, the Timberwolves found themselves in a tie game soon after. The Clippers host Denver Sunday.

Halep, a 33-year-old Romanian who initially received a four-year ban for doping, said there had been severe differences in how their cases were treated by tennis authorities. “I sit and try to understand but it is really impossible for me to understand something like this,"" Halep posted Friday on her Instagram account. “I sit and wonder, ‘Why such a big difference in treatment and judgment?’  ""I can’t find, and I don’t think there can be, a logical answer. It can only be bad will on the part of ITIA, the organisation that did absolutely everything to destroy me despite the evidence."" The International Tennis Integrity Agency announced on Thursday that the five-time major champion Swiatek accepted a one-month suspension after testing positive for the banned substance trimetazidine, a heart medication known as TMZ. The 23-year-old Polish player failed an out-of-competition drug test in August, and the ITIA accepted her explanation that the result was unintentional and was caused by the contamination of a nonprescription medication, melatonin, that Swiatek was taking for issues with jet lag and sleeping. Halep, who won the French Open in 2018 and Wimbledon in 2019, received a four-year suspension after testing positive for the banned drug Roxadustat at the 2022 U.S. Open. Her suspension was reduced by the Court of Arbitration for Sport to nine months after CAS accepted her explanation of a contaminated supplement. But she missed 1 1/2 years of playing. “I have always believed in good, I have believed in the fairness of this sport, I have believed in kindness,"" Halep wrote on Instagram. “The injustice that was done to me was painful, is painful and maybe will always be painful. How is it possible that in identical cases that happened at about the same time (of the season), ITIA has completely different approaches, to my detriment?” Swiatek's case prompted men's tennis player Nick Kyrgios, the 2022 Wimbledon runner-up, to post “OUR SPORT IS COOKED” on X, formerly known as Twitter.  Canadian tennis player Denis Shapovalov, ranked No. 56, posted a sarcastic-sounding “ 1 month ban eh ” on his page. Swiatek's case follows a similar one involving Jannik Sinner, the top-ranked men's player.  Sinner tested positive twice for an anabolic steroid in March but was not banned in an ITIA decision because the agency determined he was not to blame. It led to claims by some observers of a two-tier system, with critics arguing it afforded Sinner protection because of his status as a leading player.  Earlier this month, ATP Tour chairman Andrea Gaudenzi acknowledged there “ could have been better communication ” in explaining the rules involved in Sinner’s doping case, but refuted allegations of double standards. The decision to clear Sinner of wrongdoing, however, was appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in September. WADA is seeking a ban of one to two years and the Switzerland-based CAS is expected to make a final ruling on the case in 2025.  ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Sculptors offer advice,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/face-facts-statues-stars-kane-ronaldo-deliver-sculptors-116332692,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 06:34:15 -0500",One art critic compared the new Harry Kane bronze statue to a bulging-jawed comic strip character,"One art critic compared the new Harry Kane bronze statue to a bulging-jawed comic strip character LONDON -- One art critic compared the new Harry Kane bronze statue to a bulging-jawed comic strip character.  In Miami, observers say the Dwyane Wade sculpture looks more like actor Laurence Fishburne than the former basketball star. Of course, the infamous Cristiano Ronaldo bust in 2017 gave the chiseled soccer star a chubby face and goofy smile. A statue of Mohamed Salah in 2018 depicted the Liverpool star with a disproportionately large head. In 2011, a terracotta warrior statue of Andy Murray at a Shanghai tennis tournament drew chuckles, including from the star himself: “I thought I was better looking than that."" It wasn't always this way. In classical times, sculptors “had absolutely no interest in depicting people accurately,” explained Lucy Branch, a London-based sculptural conservator. “What they ended up doing quite often, they recycled sculptures so when another athlete became more prominent, they just changed the name on the plaque,” said Branch, host of the “Sculpture Vulture” podcast.  “There’s this idea now, in this era, that commemorative sculpture should be like portraiture — it should look exactly like the person they are commemorating. But actually that's a really new idea in sculpture."" To avoid pitfalls, here are some tips from sculptors: London-based sculptor Hywel Pratley studied countless images of Queen Elizabeth II to create a memorial statue in the East Midlands town of Oakham. “A good portrait sculpture is evidence of 1,000 decisions after 10,000 observations,” Pratley said. In addition, Yorkshire county sculptor Steve Winterburn recommends getting close with a subject's family and friends to help find characteristics. “You don’t want it looking like a Madame Tussauds,” said Winterburn, who created a statue of five Rugby League greats at Wembley Stadium. “It still needs a bit of art in it, a bit of soul. That’s what makes art really sing.” The Ronaldo bust depicted the Portugal star smiling crookedly. Likewise, the Salah sculpture features the Egyptian smiling while celebrating a goal. In Miami, Wade's mouth is open in the statue representing the moment the player famously jumped onto a courtside table and yelled “This is my house.” It's probably best avoided. “It’s really difficult to do teeth looking good in sculpture,” Pratley said. Start ""by understanding the profile"" before moving on to determine widths from the front view, Pratley said. “Get the profile right and you will have won half the battle, because then you can have something at least that you can trust,” he said. “When you’re lost, you can say, ‘well I knew where I was then,’ — and you will get lost as a sculptor in the forms. ""There’s so many to understand. It’s not two dimensions, it’s three. There’s an exponential opportunity for everything to go wrong. If you’ve got the profile, then you can go forward with more confidence.” Winterburn tries to make the eyes “come alive” in his work. ""The eye is the soul of the person that carries it,"" he said. “If you look at a lot of public work, I’m not being funny, they’re dead. There’s nothing in them, they’re just featureless, soulless. With a painting, if in doubt, fade it out. With sculpture, there is nowhere to hide."" For Pratley, especially when he is working with a live model, “I’m often struck by how the absolute essence of somebody is somewhere between the nostrils and the mouth. The flicker of muscles and the subtle movement of muscles around the mouth is so much you — it’s so much that person.” Commemorative sculpture historically has been on plinths, Branch notes. “Part of the reason for that is because we put our heroes on a pedestal,"" she said. ""The problem is, the lower to the ground the sculpture is, the more scrutiny it’s going to get and the less it can get away with not looking quite right.” The Kane sculpture features the England captain seated. “Being so low, people get to look at it incredibly closely,” Branch said. “It’s trying to get sculpture to be more with the people, but then that comes with its own problems.” In the UK, local councils — like a city council in the US — might propose a project, fund it and select the sculptor, sometimes with little input from the public and limited vetting of artists. Branch says there's a better way: Vote on it. That's what happened for the Emmeline Pankhurst statue in Manchester. A selection committee used an online platform to get public input and Hazel Reeves' proposal to honor the suffragette won. “It is a really good balance and check for whether people on the committees have chosen the right sculptor or the right composition for that person who is being commemorated,” Branch said. “(The public) may not necessarily be highly educated about sculpture, but they always tend to know whether the artist has hit the nail on the head.” ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Swift had the Thanksgiving weekend off from her Eras Tour before it wraps with three shows in Vancouver beginning Dec. 6. Swift walked down the tunnel into Arrowhead Stadium wearing a black outfit and red jacket as camera flashes created a strobe-like effect. Her arrival at Chiefs games over the past year-plus — ever since she started dating Kelce, who had reached out to her with an invitation to a game — has become a red-carpet moment for both local and national media. Earlier in the day, Target stores across the country began selling an exclusive book devoted to the Eras Tour along with a bonus edition of her “The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology” that it said would only be available in stores on Black Friday. There also are two new Christmas movies on television that have Swift connections. “Christmas in the Spotlight,"" which premiered Nov. 23 on Lifetime, stars Jessica Lord as a pop star and Laith Wallschleger as a football player who meet and fall in love. The script was written by Eirene Tran Donohue, who said she was inspired to write a script loosely based on her favorite musician after watching Swift and Kelce's relationship blossom. On Saturday, Hallmark will air “Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story,” which centers on a new Chiefs employee (Tyler Hynes) who meets a woman — played by Hunter King — whose family’s dedication to the team goes back decades. The story was written by Sherman Wolfe, a 49ers fan who was asked to pen it after the Chiefs beat San Francisco in the Super Bowl. “Holiday Touchdown” has several cameos involving Chiefs players along with a small role for Kelce's mother, Donna Kelce. And the team celebrated its pending release Friday by handing out small pennants and pins to fans at the game. ___ Associated Press writer Alicia Rancilio contributed to this report. ___ AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

The lucrative constructors' championship is still wide open with McLaren, Ferrari and Red Bull battling for the title. The contest for teams is worth around $140 million to the winner, though the precise payout depends on variables. This weekend in Qatar, a sprint race Saturday means extra points are on offer — a maximum of 59 for a team over the whole weekend. McLaren leads by 24 points from Ferrari, with Verstappen's Red Bull 29 further back. McLaren could seal its first constructors' crown since 1998 this Sunday, wrapping up the title ahead of the final round in Abu Dhabi next week, but would likely need either a perfect weekend or for Ferrari to encounter problems. McLaren's Lando Norris beat Mercedes' George Russell by just .063 of a second to take pole position Friday for the Saturday sprint race. Norris' teammate Oscar Piastri is third, .159 off the pace, ahead of the two Ferraris of Carlos Sainz Jr. and Charles Leclerc. Verstappen is sixth. “Great qualifying today, especially to bounce back from where we were last time out in Vegas,” said Norris, whose title chances ended with a sixth-place finish behind Verstappen in Las Vegas. “We're coming here to get pole and we did that, so job done for today."" Leclerc led the way in the sole practice session earlier Friday, with Norris 0.425 seconds slower and Piastri .047 further back. Verstappen was 11th fastest. McLaren’s bid is the new focus for Norris after his challenge for the drivers’ title ended last week in Las Vegas. Norris on Thursday dismissed a reported claim from Verstappen that he could have won the crown earlier in a McLaren and suggested the Dutch driver try “comedy.” He then offered a suggestion of his own. “Red Bull probably would have won the constructors' (championship) if they had two drivers as good as Max, that’s for sure,” Norris said. The contributions of Piastri, who won the Qatar sprint race as a rookie last year, have been key to McLaren's hopes. Ferrari's Leclerc and Sainz have been close on the track — and sometimes too close for comfort — all year.  Red Bull's Sergio Perez is the only driver at the top three teams without a race win this year and he's eighth in the standings with less than half of Verstappen’s points total. Perez was 18th fastest in practice Friday and qualified 16th for the sprint, his latest dismal results. Perez, who has faced speculation over his future almost all year, says he's struggled to make the title-winning Red Bull car fit his driving style. “It’s very difficult for people to understand if they’re not part of the team,” he said Thursday. “When you are not able to extract 100% out of your car, it’s irrelevant how good your car is, and this is what happened.” Last year's race in Qatar pushed drivers to the limit. Esteban Ocon reported being sick as he battled the heat and humidity, while Lance Stroll said he was on the verge of losing consciousness. The FIA expressed concern that drivers “should not be expected to compete under conditions that could jeopardise their health or safety,” and this month approved new driver cooling kits for hot races. Those kits aren't available until next year, but don't expect drivers to be clamouring for them in Qatar this week. With the action taking place in November and December instead of early October, much milder weather is forecast than last year, and Stroll said “for sure” that's a relief.  “I have no interest in experiencing last year’s heat in Qatar again,” the Aston Martin driver said. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

PAUL, Minn. -- Jared Spurgeon ended a 33-game scoring drought with two of Minnesota’s three second-period goals and the Wild beat the Chicago Blackhawks 3-2 on Friday. Marco Rossi also scored for Minnesota and Marc-Andre Fleury, who turned 40 on Thursday, made 20 saves to improve to 5-0-1. The Wild is 13-0-1 against the Blackhawks dating back to Feb. 4, 2020. Spurgeon’s long wrist shot from just inside the blue line handcuffed Petr Mrazek late in the second period for a 3-2 lead. On his 35th birthday, Spurgeon’s goals were his first since April 8, 2023, and his eighth career multigoal game. Ryan Donato scored twice and Mrazek stopped 27 shots for Chicago, tied with Nashville for the fewest points in the NHL at 18. Blackhawks: Chicago has scored first 13 times this season. Only four teams have opened the scoring more: Minnesota (15), Anaheim (14), Carolina (14) and Tampa Bay (14). Wild: Fifteen times in the team’s 23 games, Wild goalies have allowed two-or-fewer goals, best in the NHL. Entering the game, Minnesota led the NHL with a 2.34 GAA and .919 save percentage. Rossi and Spurgeon scored 17 seconds apart midway through the second period — Minnesota’s fastest two goals since scoring 15 seconds apart Dec. 4, 2022 — to tie the game 2-2. Rossi completed a pretty passing play with Kirill Kaprizov and Marcus Johansson before a Spurgeon shot deflected off a defender’s skate in the crease. Kaprizov played his 300th career game. He’s scored 174 goals and recorded 192 assists for 366 career points. The only active players with more points through 300 games are Sidney Crosby (407), Connor McDavid (394), Alex Ovechkin (384) and Evgeni Malkin (371). Only Ovechkin (204) and Auston Matthews (176) have more goals. The Blackhawks host Columbus on Sunday.

The senior quarterback, named winner of the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award before the game against Oklahoma State, came in needing 40 yards to pass Koy Detmer's 28-year-old record of 3,527 yards. Sanders got there by hitting LaJohntay Wester for a 10-yard touchdown pass in the first quarter. Sanders finished with 438 yards in a 52-0 win Friday to close out the regular season with 3,926 yards. Sanders also added five TD passes against the Cowboys to increase his total to a school-best 35 for the season. Detmer's yards passing mark came in 1996, when Rick Neuheisel was coaching the Buffs, who went 10-2 and finished the season ranked No. 8 in the AP Top 25.

After falling behind 17-0 at halfti... ATHENS, Ga. -- As the clock crept past midnight in a marathon for the ages, Nate Frazier finally ended it for No. 6 Georgia with a little 3-yard burst that may have locked up the biggest prize of all. Another trip to the College Football Playoff. Frazier ran for a 2-point conversion in the eighth overtime after Georgia pulled off an improbable fourth-quarter comeback, giving the Bulldogs a 44-42 victory over Georgia Tech on a Friday night that stretched into Saturday morning. “The overtime was epic,” Georgia coach Kirby Smart said. “What a great game.” After falling behind 17-0 at halftime and being dominated most of the game, the Bulldogs (10-2, No. 7 CFP) showed plenty of grit in their bid for a spot in the 12-team playoff — no matter how they fare in next weekend’s Southeastern Conference championship game against either No. 3 Texas or No. 20 Texas A&M. “That's for someone else to decide,” Smart said. “Our opportunity is in front of us.”  Carson Beck threw five touchdown passes — two of them in OT — in a game the Bulldogs never led until after regulation ended 27-all. He finished 28 of 43 for 297 yards.  Georgia Tech (7-5) was powered by Haynes King, who ran for for three touchdowns and threw for two more. But the Yellow Jackets took their seventh straight loss to the Bulldogs on a frigid, excruciating night between the hedges.  King passed for 303 yards and ran for 110 in a brilliant performance that wasn't quite enough.  Frazier, a freshman, took a handoff from Beck and burst up the middle, sending fireworks into the sky above Sanford Stadium.  It was the longest game in SEC history and just one overtime shy of the record for any FBS game — Illinois' 20-18 victory over Penn State in 2021 that went to nine extra periods. “We are a beat-up football team,” Smart said. “We've got to get well.” King scored on an 11-yard run to give Georgia Tech a seemingly comfortable 27-13 lead with 5:37 remaining, but the Bulldogs drove 75 yards in eight plays to give themselves a chance. Beck connected with Dominic Lovett on a 17-yard touchdown pass with 3:39 to go. Then, the Bulldogs’ defense forced a huge turnover by King after struggling to contain the slithery quarterback most of the game. He kept it himself on third-and-1 — only to cough up the ball on a big hit by Dan Jackson. Chaz Chambliss recovered the fumble at the Yellow Jackets 32, and Beck quickly guided the Bulldogs to a tying touchdown on a 3-yard pass to Lovett with 1:01 left in regulation. Then, it was on to overtime -- and a game that just kept going and going.  Beck and King threw matching touchdown passes followed by conventional extra points. Then it was King scoring on a 1-yard run, only to have Beck respond with a 25-yard scoring pass to Cash Jones. Both teams failed to convert their 2-point tries, so it came down to nothing but 2-point tries. Both teams converted in the fifth OT, but it was Frazier who finally ended it. “There's no moral victories,” Georgia Tech coach Brent Key said, fighting back tears. “But I'm proud of those guys.” The first half was an absolute stunner for the Bulldogs, who have long dominated the state rivalry known as “Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate.” Georgia Tech raced to a lead that could have been even bigger, outgaining the Bulldogs 307-137 in total yards and nearly doubling up in time of possession in the opening half. King, who has battled shoulder issues, looked to be fully recovered as he guided the Yellow Jackets up and down the field. He scored on a 2-yard run and threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Jamal Haynes, who made a soaring leap to the pylon. The Yellow Jackets also got a 31-yard field goal from Aidan Birr. But Birr also clanked a 25-yard attempt off the left upright, and Georgia Tech squandered another scoring chance when Haynes was stuffed for a 1-yard loss on fourth-and-1 at the Bulldogs 25. Even with those setbacks, Georgia Tech built its biggest lead over the Bulldogs since a 20-0 edge in the 2013 game -- when Georgia rallied for a 41-34 victory in double overtime. These Bulldogs did it again, extending their school-record home winning streak to 31 in a row. Georgia Tech: When Key took over this downtrodden program, he insisted the Yellow Jackets could compete with anyone — including their mighty state rival. This one will hurt for a while, but Georgia Tech showed it's on the verge of backing up his bold words after just two full seasons in charge. “He's done a tremendous job turning that program around,” Smart said. Georgia: The Bulldogs aren't nearly as dominant as the team that won back-to-back national titles during the 2021 and 2022 seasons. They surrendered 563 yards to the Yellow Jackets, including 260 on the ground. But, amazingly, Smart's squad still has a shot at winning it all for the third time in four years.  Georgia Tech: Awaits a second straight bowl invitation and another shot at its first eight-win season since 2016, which also was the last year they beat the Bulldogs. Georgia: Heads to the SEC championship game for the fourth straight season and seventh time in Smart’s nine years as coach. The opponent will be the winner of Saturday night’s game between Texas and Texas A&M. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

Sellers scored his second touchdown, this one from 20 yards out with 1:08 to play, for South Carolina's sixth straight victory, four of them in that run coming over ranked opponents. Are you paying attention, College Football Playoff selectors? “If the committee's job is to pick the 12 best teams, you tell me,” Beamer said. It would be hard to pick against the Gamecocks (9-3, 5-3 SEC; No. 15 CFP) with Sellers, a confident, poised freshman, playing as well as he is. He finished with 166 yards rushing and 164 yards passing. Two games ago, he set career bests with 353 yards passing and five TD throws in twice rallying the Gamecocks from fourth-quarter deficits to defeat Missouri 34-30. This time, Sellers shrugged off his interception near Clemson's goal with less than 11 minutes left to lead his team to a field goal and then his game winner. Sellers spun away from defender Peter Woods in the backfield, broke through the line and cut left to reach the end zone. Sellers hears defenders get angry when they get their hands on but can't bring down the speedy, 6-foot-3 passer in his first year since taking over for Spencer Rattler. How does he do it? “I don't really know,” Sellers said. Beamer had an answer to that one, too. “He's a competitor, he's a warrior,” Beamer said. “He doesn't get too high or too low. He's out there having fun.” The Gamecocks hope to have more fun in a week so, confident they'll hear their name called among the expanded field of 12 that will play for a national crown. They know, too, they'll have Sellers leading the way. “He's a magician, man,” Gamecocks linebacker Demetrius Knight Jr. said. “LeMagic, LeComeback, whatever you want to call him.” Clemson (9-3, 7-1 ACC, No. 12) had a final chance and drove to the South Carolina 18 with 16 seconds left — well within reach of a tying field goal — when Cade Klubnik was intercepted by Knight to end things. The Gamecocks were 3-3 after losing at Alabama in mid-October and then pulled off their longest winning streak since 2012. The Tigers also were hoping to play their way into the CFP's 12-team field. But their offense had too many costly mistakes and their defense could not corral Sellers. “He's a great player and made great players,” Clemson linebacker Barrett Carter said. Still, there could be postseason hope for Clemson, which will cross its fingers and pray Syracuse can pull off an upset over No. 8 Miami later Saturday that would get the Tigers into the Atlantic Coast Conference title game next week against SMU. Both teams came in on highs, the Tigers having won three straight and the Gamecocks five in a row, including three consecutive over ranked opponents Texas A&M, Vanderbilt and Missouri. But neither team found its offensive rhythm in the opening half. Sellers was sacked by T.J. Parker and turned the ball over as Parker recovered with South Carolina inside the Clemson 20. The Tigers drove to the South Carolina 11 and turned down a chip-shot field goal to go for it on fourth-and-1. But Mafah was stopped way short by Jalon Kilgore and Knight. Klubnik had scoring runs of 13 and 18 yards for the Tigers.  South Carolina: What a run by the Gamecocks, who before the season were picked 13th in the SEC and now may find themselves part of the national championship playoff field. Clemson: The Tigers lost to both ranked SEC opponents they faced this season, first to No. 1 Georgia to start the year and then to rival South Carolina.  Tigers coach Dabo Swinney was proud of his team's regular season but knew the loss might leave it short of getting back to the playoff. “We could've had a great year,” he said. ""We got better this season, a lot of positives to build on. “But this one is tough. It's tough. It hurts,” he continued.

ABC News: Sports,Desrosiers scores 3 TDs as Memphis tops No. 18 Tulane 34-24 to end the Green Wave's faint CFP hopes,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/desrosiers-scores-3-tds-memphis-tops-18-tulane-116313084,"Fri, 29 Nov 2024 02:42:24 -0500","Greg Desrosiers Jr. caught two scoring passes and ran for a touchdown, and Memphis defeated No. 18 Tulane 34-24 to knock the Green Wave out of contention for a berth in the College Football Playoff","Greg Desrosiers Jr. caught two scoring passes and ran for a touchdown, and Memphis defeated No. 18 Tulane 34-24 to knock the Green Wave out of contention for a berth in the College Football Playoff NEW ORLEANS -- When three deep passes by Darian Mensah resulted in turnovers, Tulane's long-shot hopes of sneaking into the College Football Playoff slipped away. Greg Desrosiers Jr. caught two scoring passes and ran for a touchdown, and Memphis defeated No. 18 Tulane 34-24 on Thursday night to end the Green Wave's eight-game winning streak. “You can’t have the critical mistakes we had,"" said Tulane coach Jon Sumrall, whose team needed to win its regular-season finale and the American Athletic Conference title game to have any realistic chance at making the new 12-team CFP. “There’s a lot of stuff we didn’t execute to our standard that we have for several games in a row now,"" he added. ""It’s very frustrating. We’re all hurting, and it should hurt when you play a game like that.” Two turnovers by Tulane (9-3, 7-1 AAC, No. 17 CFP) came on fumbles after long receptions at or inside the Memphis 10-yard line. Another came on a long pass by Mensah that was intercepted at the 2-yard line by Davion Ross, and the Tigers responded with a game-sealing drive capped by Mario Anderson Jr.’s 47-yard touchdown run. “We could have easily held our heads down,” Desrosiers said, referring to a pair of conference losses that dropped Memphis (10-2, 6-2) out of the AAC title picture. “Obviously, the season didn't go as planned ... but we know what we deserve. We know what we're capable of. So, we came out here and we wanted to dominate.”  Tigers defensive back Kourtlan Marsh caused both momentum-turning fumbles, the first when he leveled Yulkeith Brown after the receiver's 40-yard catch. AJ Watts recovered at the 10 and returned it 37 yards, initiating a drive that ended with Desrosiers' 29-yard touchdown run on third-and-4 to give Memphis a 27-10 lead. In the fourth quarter, with Tulane trailing 27-17, Mario Williams fumbled at the Tigers 9 after hauling in a 55-yard pass. Marsh recovered. “If those three turnovers don’t happen, we’re probably talking about a final play to figure out who the winner is,"" Sumrall said. Seth Henigan completed 22 of 29 passes for 218 yards and two TDs without a turnover for Memphis, which totaled 454 yards against a Tulane defense that had allowed just nine points in its previous three games combined. Anderson rushed for 177 yards on 24 carries. “When you can't win the conference championship, all you can do is win the play that you're in and the game that you're in,” Henigan said. “Our guys came together and played for each other.” Mensah passed for 317 yards and two TDs, and Arnold Barnes ran for a 2-yard score — not enough for Tulane to prolong its 17-game streak of regular-season conference wins. “I didn’t see that performance coming,” Sumrall said. “I thought we’d play better than we did. Memphis played good, but we didn’t play to our standard. We didn’t help ourselves a whole lot.”  Tulane gave up a touchdown on Memphis' opening drive when Henigan hit Desrosiers for the first of his two touchdown catches — a leaping 17-yard grab in tight coverage. “To come out on the opening possession and score, that was big for our offense and maybe our confidence as well, just to know we could execute on these guys,” Henigan said. “Playing against a great opponent, that's an opportunity. So we had to make sure that opportunity wasn't wasted.” Tulane's only lead came when Williams' 7-yard TD catch made it 10-7 late in the first quarter. Desrosier's 25-yard catch and run put the Tigers back in front for good in the second. Memphis: The Tigers played like a team that felt disrespected as two-touchdown underdogs. They converted 10 of 16 third downs to help them surpass 20 points for a 39th straight game. Their defense was disruptive and opportunistic. Now they have consecutive 10-win seasons for the first time in program history. Henigan also became the AAC's all-time leading passer, now with 13,972 career yards.  Tulane: The Green Wave looked tight early. Receivers dropped several passes and Tulane's normally productive run scheme did not match up well with a Memphis run defense that ranked 18th nationally. Missed tackles on defense and trouble getting third-down stops made for a rough night. Tulane might drop out of the AP Top 25, lessening the magnitude of next week's AAC championship game.

ABC News: Sports,Andrew Luck returns to Stanford as the GM of the football program,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/andrew-luck-returns-stanford-gm-football-program-116338003,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 13:14:30 -0500",Andrew Luck is returning to Stanford in hopes of turning around a struggling football program that he once helped become a national power,"Andrew Luck is returning to Stanford in hopes of turning around a struggling football program that he once helped become a national power STANFORD, Calif. -- Andrew Luck is returning to Stanford in hopes of turning around a struggling football program that he once helped become a national power. Athletic director Bernard Muir announced Saturday that Luck has been hired as the general manager of the Stanford football team, tasked with overseeing all aspects of the program that just finished a 3-9 season under coach Troy Taylor. “I am a product of this university, of Nerd Nation; I love this place,” Luck said. “I believe deeply in Stanford’s unique approach to athletics and academics and the opportunity to help drive our program back to the top. Coach Taylor has the team pointed in the right direction, and I cannot wait to work with him, the staff, and the best, brightest, and toughest football players in the world.” Luck has kept a low profile since his surprise retirement from the NFL at age 29 when he announced in August 2019 that he was leaving the Indianapolis Colts and pro football. In his new role, Luck will work with Taylor on recruiting and roster management, and with athletic department and university leadership on fundraising, alumni relations, sponsorships, student-athlete support and stadium experience. “Andrew’s credentials as a student-athlete speak for themselves, and in addition to his legacy of excellence, he also brings a deep understanding of the college football landscape and community, and an unparalleled passion for Stanford football,” Muir said. “I could not think of a person better qualified to guide our football program through a continuously evolving landscape, and I am thrilled that Andrew has agreed to join our team. This change represents a very different way of operating our program and competing in an evolving college football landscape.” Luck was one of the players who helped elevate Stanford into a West Coast powerhouse for several years. He helped end a seven-year bowl drought in his first season as starting quarterback in 2009 under coach Jim Harbaugh and led the Cardinal to back-to-back BCS bowl berths his final two seasons, when he was the Heisman Trophy runner-up both seasons. That was part of a seven-year stretch in which Stanford posted the fourth-best record in the nation at 76-18 and qualified for five BCS bowl berths under Harbaugh and David Shaw. But the Cardinal have struggled for success in recent years and haven't won more than four games in a season since 2018. Stanford just finished its fourth straight 3-9 campaign in Taylor's second season since replacing Shaw. The Cardinal are the only power conference team to lose at least nine games in each of the past four seasons. Luck graduated from Stanford with a bachelor’s degree in architectural design and returned after retiring from the NFL to get his master’s degree in education in 2023. He was picked No. 1 overall by Indianapolis in the 2012 draft and made four Pro Bowls and was AP Comeback Player of the Year in 2018 in his brief but successful NFL career. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

Hayes, a Londoner who coached the U.S. women to the Olympic soccer gold medal this summer after 14 major trophies at Chelsea, came home for a friendly against European champion England. In a matchup of the two best women's teams in the FIFA rankings, the U.S. had the best chances but the game ended in a goalless draw. “I'm super proud of the way we imposed ourselves on the game, it's just the last part of the pitch,” Hayes said. “Generally, I'm pleased with the performance.” The U.S. was without its injured attacking trio of Trinity Rodman, Sophia Smith and Mallory Swanson. But the quality among the visitors still overwhelmed England, which had injury issues, too. Forward Lauren Hemp and defender Maya Le Tissier were ruled out. Alyssa Thompson's curling shot forced an early parry from England goalkeeper Mary Earps as the U.S. pinned England in its half and turned over England ball too easily in midfield. The Americans dominated possession and earned a lot of space to develop their game and press high. But they lacked an edge in the final third and could not break the deadlock. Sam Coffey's shot from the edge of the box in the 44th minute was easily stopped by Earps, and at the start of the second half U.S. captain Lindsey Horan had a goal disallowed then missed the target with an angled shot. The U.S. also received a penalty but it was reversed after the VAR showed the ball hit Alex Greenwood’s chest and not her arm. But one of the most successful coaches in the women’s game was left satisfied. Hayes won seven Women’s Super Leagues in a 12-year reign at Chelsea. During that time, the men’s team had 11 different managers. She was asked how she felt about being in the away dugout and listening to the English national anthem. “You can be two things at once,” Hayes said. “I'm a proud Englishwoman who is proud to coach America. I don't have to choose, I definitely love both countries.” ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

An automatic bid to the 64-team NCAA Tournament is on the line in Saturday's final. Colorado State made the final by beating fifth-seeded San Diego State 20-25, 25-23, 25-21, 25-23. Boise State, which twice boycotted regular-season matches with San Jose State, pulled out of the conference tournament on Wednesday night, hours after it defeated Utah State to secure a spot against the Spartans in Friday’s semifinals. While the Broncos didn’t announce explicitly why they withdrew, a lawsuit was recently filed in Colorado by players from various schools against the conference and San Jose State officials calling for a Spartans player to be blocked from participating in the tournament. They cited unspecified reports asserting there was a transgender player on the San Jose State volleyball team, even naming her. U.S. Magistrate Judge S. Kato Crews in Denver ruled Monday that the player was allowed to play, and a federal appeals court upheld the decision the following day. “It's been a really complex and emotional situation for us this season,” Colorado State's Kohan said. ""Unless you're in those rooms having those hard conversations and making those hard decisions, I don't think you truly know how this feels. I also think regardless of your opinion on it, there's some room here to acknowledge that there's been a lot of young people showing courage all season long. “This can stop with us. We're not going to pass these difficult conversations on to the NCAA committee or any other team to have those crying conversations in the hotel.” San Jose State, which received six forfeit victories because of boycotts from opponents during the regular season, is seeded second in the conference tournament and received a first-round bye. Boise State was the latest school to forfeit. The Broncos’ athletic department released a statement Wednesday night saying their team “should not have to forgo this opportunity while waiting for a more thoughtful and better system that serves all athletes.” In addition to Boise State, Mountain West members Wyoming, Utah State and Nevada as well as Southern Utah canceled matches this season against the Spartans. Nevada’s players said they “refuse to participate in any match that advances injustice against female athletes,” without providing further details. While some media have reported those and other details, San Jose State has not confirmed the school has a trans women’s volleyball player. The Associated Press is withholding the player’s name because she has not publicly commented on her gender identity and through school officials has declined an interview request. Participation of transgender women in women’s sports became a hot political topic ahead of the recent election. Two protestors from Davis, California, stood outside Cox Pavilion before and during the Colorado State-San Diego State semifinal match on Friday. They supported those teams that forfeited matches against San Jose State, arguing the Spartans had an unfair athletic advantage. ___ AP college sports: https://apnews.com/hub/college-sports 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
NYT > Sports,Michigan Upsets No. 2 Ohio State in 4th Straight Rivalry Victory,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5958582/2024/11/30/michigan-ohio-state-football-score-recap/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 21:32:35 +0000","The unranked Wolverines took down the Buckeyes, 13-10, at Ohio Stadium on Saturday in a bitter matchup.","NCAAF By Austin Meek, Cameron Teague Robinson and Ralph Russo COLUMBUS, Ohio — Michigan extended Ohio State’s rivalry misery by upsetting the No. 2 Buckeyes 13-10 on Saturday at Ohio Stadium after Dominic Zvada made a 21-yard field goal with 45 seconds left. It’s the Wolverines’ fourth consecutive win against Ohio State, their longest winning streak in the series since 1988-91. After Michigan finished off the win by stopping Ohio State’s final possession, members of the two teams got into a lengthy postgame altercation. A fight has broken out between Michigan and Ohio State after The Game pic.twitter.com/XPwdAjfYzN — FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) November 30, 2024  The loss is likely to cost Ohio State (10-2, 7-2 Big Ten) a spot in the Big Ten title game, as No. 4 Penn State can now advance to Indianapolis to meet No. 1 Oregon with a win against Maryland on Saturday. If the Nittany Lions lose, No. 10 Indiana would get the nod with a win over Purdue. With a Big Ten title a long shot, Ohio State would thus be left fighting for an at-large bid in the 12-team College Football Playoff. According to The Athletic’s projections model, Ohio State still has a 99 percent chance to make the Playoff after Saturday’s game, with a 92 percent chance to host a game, though that could be dependent on other Rivalry Week and conference championship game results. Advertisement Ohio State was a 21-point favorite entering the game against the Wolverines (7-5, 5-4), who have struggled much of their first season under new coach Sherrone Moore following last year’s national championship. But despite finishing with just 235 total yards, Michigan shocked Ohio State on Saturday thanks to stout defensive play and several Buckeyes miscues, including a pair of missed field goals and two interceptions thrown by Will Howard. Michigan’s winning drive covered 57 yards in 11 plays, with an illegal substitution penalty on Ohio State allowing it to convert a key third down at the 9-yard line to run more clock and set up Zvada’s field goal. Ohio State’s second-half drives resulted in a punt in Michigan territory, an interception, a missed field goal, a three-and-out and the final turnover on downs, as it gained only 1 yard in four plays with the game on the line. Ohio State’s 10 points were its fewest against an unranked opponent since 2011. The loss ended a 47-game winning streak against unranked teams dating back to 2018 against Purdue, making it the Buckeyes’ first loss to a team outside the AP Top 25 under coach Ryan Day. GO DEEPER Michigan, Ohio State players and police involved in postgame fight after shocking upset Here are some immediate takeaways from Michigan’s upset win: In Michigan’s past three victories against Ohio State, these teams were on relatively equal footing. The Wolverines beat Ohio State last year with a senior-laden team that was on its way to the national championship. This year, with Michigan rebuilding and Ohio State boasting one of the most talented rosters in college football, the Buckeyes were supposed to get their payback. If it wasn’t clear before, it’s obvious now: Michigan has a massive psychological edge on Ohio State. These games bring out the best in Michigan and the absolute worst in Ohio State. For this Michigan team, which lost five games, to beat this Ohio State team as a three-touchdown underdog is one of the biggest upsets in the history of the series. For Moore, Michigan’s first-year head coach, this is a signature win that transforms this season from a disappointment to year that will be remembered for how it finished. — Austin Meek, Michigan beat writer Dominic Zvada connects to give Michigan the late lead at No. 2 Ohio State 🙌#B1GFootball on @CFBONFOX 📺 pic.twitter.com/GfQzAmv2pO — Big Ten Network (@BigTenNetwork) November 30, 2024  Ohio State’s offensive line injuries have been a problem all season. The Buckeyes are missing starting left tackle Josh Simmons and center Seth McLaughlin, and their reshuffled unit gave them no chance to run on the Michigan defensive line. Ohio State ran for just 77 yards, averaging three yards per carry. Despite the struggles between the tackles, it stuck with the run thinking it would tire out the Michigan defensive front. Michigan never wore down, though, and it made Ohio State one-dimensional. Yet again, the Wolverines won the matchup in the trenches with superior physicality. Advertisement The acclaimed running back duo of Ole Miss transfer Quinshon Judkins and TreVeyon Henderson combined for 67 yards, and Howard didn’t add much more on the ground, finishing with just 10 yards. Michigan’s biggest advantage in the game was always going to be on the defensive line. If it was going to win or at least keep it close, it had to dominate up front. It did just that. With the run game taken away, Ohio State had to rely on Howard, and he had one of his worst games of the season, throwing two interceptions and completing just 19 of 33 passes for 175 yards. — Cameron Teague Robinson, Ohio State beat writer One of the few advantages Michigan had coming into the game was on special teams, and in a close game it made a huge difference. Ohio State twice started drives inside its 10 because of failure to properly field a kick, the first a punt and the second the second-half kickoff. Add in a short punt by Ohio State that put Michigan in range for a 54-yard field goal from Zvada in the second quarter and Buckeyes kicker Jayden Fielding missing kicks of 34 and 38 yards, and the Wolverines dominated that part of the game. Add to the special teams gaffes, two interceptions by Howard — one that set up the only Michigan touchdown and another in the red zone that might have cost the Buckeyes points — and Ohio State did all it could to give Michigan its best chance to win. — Ralph Russo, national college football writer ""You hate to see stuff like that after the game. It's just bad for the sport, bad for CFB… They gotta learn how to lose man. You can't be fighting.""@JennyTaft speaks with Michigan's Kalel Mullings after a fight broke out between Ohio State and Michigan after the game ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/z6rmxu2YJQ — FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) November 30, 2024  The strangest time in the history of Ohio State football has arrived. Day and the Buckeyes did not complete the mission. They have now lost four in a row against Michigan, the latest as a three-touchdown home favorite with a trip to the Big Ten championship game on the line against the worst team the Wolverines have fielded since the pandemic. Advertisement Ohio State has no more games on its schedule, but the Buckeyes’ season is not over. They lost the game they absolutely could not lose. And yet, the national championship is still on the table. In 2022, the second game of the streak, Ohio State got a reprieve after losing The Game and still made the four-team Playoff. C.J. Stroud then nearly led the Buckeyes to a semifinal victory against Georgia. With seven at-large spots available in this Playoff and contenders get dinged left and right, there’s still likely to be room for Ohio State now, as it is 10-2 and owns a pair of wins against top-10 Penn State and Indiana teams. So what now for the Buckeyes? A nervous week of hoping to get into the dance, while fans crush Day for falling to 1-4 against Michigan. This was supposed to be the team that not only got over the Michigan hump, but won the Big Ten. Instead, it faltered under the pressure of the rivalry game again. Day will find some way to explain it, but after four straight losses, the Buckeyes still haven’t closed the gap physically with Michigan, even at its worst. Do Buckeyes fans even want their team to make the Playoff? It’s impossible to know how the selection committee will sort things out with so many impactful games still to play. Maybe the Buckeyes get squeezed out depending on how things shake out in the SEC and ACC. But more likely, the Buckeyes will spend this week agonizing over what could have been and hoping for another shot at redemption. At this point, maybe only a national title will do it for Day. — Russo This story will be updated. (Top photo of Sherrone Moore: Jason Mowry / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Then everything crumbled.","NFL KANSAS CITY, Mo. — For the first six plays of what could’ve been the game-winning drive, nothing could go wrong for the Las Vegas Raiders. The Kansas City Chiefs jumped offside on the first play of the possession, and then quarterback Aidan O’Connell completed five passes in a row to move the Raiders to the Chiefs’ 32-yard line. Advertisement The Raiders were trailing 19-17 when O’Connell spiked the ball with 15 seconds remaining in regulation, but they looked to be well on their way to pulling off an improbable upset. On the next snap, however, everything would crumble. As the Raiders broke their huddle with nine seconds left on the play clock, O’Connell clapped his hands as a signal for his teammates to line up quickly. With six seconds left on the clock, O’Connell stopped clapping and looked to his right to communicate with receiver Tre Tucker. When he looked to his left to do the same with receiver Jakobi Meyers, the ball was snapped. It deflected off his bicep, bounced around on the field and ricocheted off right tackle DJ Glaze into the waiting arms of Chiefs linebacker Nick Bolton. The Raiders fumble it, the Chiefs recover it to seal the game ‼️#LVvsKC on Prime VideoAlso streaming on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/WvNvUONRM5 — NFL (@NFL) November 29, 2024  Just like that, the Raiders went from being in position to win to staring down their eighth straight defeat. All Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes had to do from there was kneel out the clock to knock Las Vegas down to 2-10 on the season. GO DEEPER Chiefs survive vs. Raiders after Las Vegas' critical botched snap: Takeaways The Raiders’ game-sealing fumble was a result of miscommunication. Right after O’Connell finished clapping, right guard Dylan Parham tapped rookie center Jackson Powers-Johnson. In their three games playing next to each other, there have been times Parham has done that as a signal for Powers-Johnson to snap the ball. (It happened just last week against the Denver Broncos.) So, Powers-Johnson snapped the ball even though O’Connell wasn’t looking for it. What a WILD ending on Black Friday 👀 pic.twitter.com/JtYRVva6Zy — NFL (@NFL) November 29, 2024  During his postgame news conference, O’Connell took the blame for his clapping, which can be used as a sign to snap the ball when the crowd is too loud for a verbal cue. “The clock was running down. I was trying to get the guys lined up,” O’Connell said. “It’s completely my fault. … Jackson did exactly what he should’ve done. … And then it’s just how the football bounces sometimes. It didn’t go our way. It’s super tough, but there’s really nobody to blame but myself. That’s probably the hardest part to swallow.” Advertisement Powers-Johnson, meanwhile, said he was at fault for the mishap. “I thought he was calling for the snap and I snapped the ball,” Powers-Johnson said. “I’ve got to be better in that situation. We were about to beat a really great team. Those miscommunications can’t happen. I’m taking full responsibility. I’m going to put that loss on me.” Parham didn’t speak to reporters in the locker room, but Powers-Johnson refused to put it on him. The rookie didn’t think the noise should have been a factor. “We didn’t come up short,” Powers-Johnson said. “I came up short.” The truth is O’Connell, Powers-Johnson and Parham all contributed to the fumble that ended the Raiders’ upset bid. But what also requires examination is the decision-making of head coach Antonio Pierce. It seemed like the Raiders were attempting to run a quick play to shorten the distance for kicker Daniel Carlson. It would’ve been a 50-yarder if they’d kicked from the Chiefs’ 32-yard line. While Carlson is a former All-Pro who has made over 30 field goals of 50 or more yards throughout his career, he had already missed three kicks short Friday — from 56, 55 and 58 yards. It would’ve made sense to try to make his final attempt easier. Surprisingly, that wasn’t the Raiders’ plan. “We were going to throw the ball away and waste four or five more seconds and kick the field goal,” Pierce said. If that was the intention, then the Raiders should’ve just waited longer to spike the ball after O’Connell’s completion to running back Ameer Abdullah. Running another play opened the door to unnecessary risks such as O’Connell getting sacked or a deflected pass getting picked off. A botched snap can always happen, of course, but there’s a greater chance of error on a snap out of the shotgun compared to being under center, which is what O’Connell did on the spike. Pierce’s decision to run another play ultimately helped open the door for the fumble that cost the Raiders the game. Advertisement Another controversial element of the play was that a penalty was called. One referee appeared to run in from the sideline and make the signal for a false-start penalty against the Raiders — but the infraction was changed to an illegal shift. The Raiders players and coaches protested the change because a false start is a dead-ball penalty and they heard one official whistle the play dead, and therefore the fumble wouldn’t have counted. But the illegal shift call allowed the play to continue, so the Chiefs simply declined the penalty and the fumble was upheld. A clearly frustrated Pierce declined to answer when asked to share the explanation he got from the referees. The referees confirm an illegal shift on the offense but the Chiefs recovered the backwards pass.#BlackFridayNFL pic.twitter.com/9nM9AF0tZa — NFL on Prime Video (@NFLonPrime) November 29, 2024  “It is what it is,” Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby said. “You can’t control everything. (Stuff) happens. It’s disappointing, to say the least.” The Athletic reached out to the NFL after the game to get clarity on the official’s ruling on the play. NFL senior vice president of football and international communications Michael Signora responded via email. “Had the clock been running at the snap, then by rule an illegal shift would convert to a false start,” Signora wrote. “Since the clock was stopped (due to the spike on the second-down play), an illegal shift is a live-ball foul.” A false start is called when a player moves illegally after lining up but before the ball is snapped. The Raiders were called for an illegal shift because the ball was snapped before they were lined up. By the letter of the rule, the referees made the correct call. The disastrous finish to Friday’s game will overshadow the fact the Raiders put forth a valiant effort against the back-to-back defending Super Bowl champions. O’Connell threw for a career-high 340 yards after a five-week absence due to a broken thumb. Running back Sincere McCormick continued to spark a previously dormant ground game and averaged 5.3 yards per carry. Tight end Brock Bowers had another sensational performance with 10 catches for 140 yards and a touchdown. Receiver Jakobi Meyers had six catches for 97 yards, and fellow wideout Tre Tucker hauled in a 58-yard score. The defense harassed Mahomes all game long, sacking him five times, and largely held the Chiefs offense in check. Abdullah excelled as a returner. That collective effort had them on the edge of victory. “They fought their asses off until the end,” Pierce said. “All three phases at some point contributed to help us get into that position.” Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

As the reality of the loss set in, it remained difficult for Crosby to accept. “I don’t know how to explain it,” the three-time Pro Bowler said. “You can’t describe it. It’s so disappointing for the guys because everyone out there is literally putting their life on the line. … We’re 13.5-point underdogs that nobody believes can go in there and win, and we had ’em right on the ropes. It’s disappointing, but I’m so proud of my teammates.” Advertisement Pierce inspired confidence in the Raiders during his nine-game run as interim head coach last year, but his first full season on the job has been defined by the team consistently finding ways to let winnable games slip away. Although there’s no questioning their resolve, the results have to improve at some point. “I’m proud of my team,” Pierce said. “The record is what it is, but this is a team that’s prideful and that’s playing for one another. There’s no quit. There’s no putting their heads down or their chins down. “But I don’t want to keep saying that after losses, right? We’ve just got to keep battling. They’ll have some time off, and we’ll regroup. But one thing I’m not going to take away is the effort, the pride and the way they competed.” (Photo: David Eulitt / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,He Left Football For His Mental Health. Now He Returns to His Happy Place.,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5958205/2024/11/30/andrew-luck-stanford-general-manager-football/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 21:32:35 +0000","The former N.F.L. quarterback Andrew Luck is finally back in football. The destination? His alma mater, as Stanford football’s general manager.","By Zak Keefer, Sam Khan Jr. and Lauren Merola Former Stanford star quarterback Andrew Luck is returning to the football program as general manager, the school announced Saturday. Luck will start in his new role immediately, the school said. In the expanded GM position, Luck, 35, will oversee every aspect of the program, both on and off the field. He will work with coach Troy Taylor on recruiting and roster management and with administration on fundraising, alumni relations, sponsorships, student-athlete support and stadium experience, the school said. Advertisement Luck will also be involved in the film room. When asked on “College GameDay” on Saturday morning if he would have a hand in the X’s and O’s, Luck said “absolutely” while acknowledging it’s mainly Taylor’s domain. Luck said he and Taylor are “close,” and that he was on Stanford’s hiring committee when the school brought Taylor on board before the 2023 season. “I imagine this (role) being very hands-on,” Luck said. Ready to build the future of Stanford Football.#GoStanford pic.twitter.com/0F8tTTOBPx — Stanford Football (@StanfordFball) November 30, 2024  While Luck assuming the GM title itself isn’t unique, the scope of his power is. According to ESPN, the entire coaching staff reports to Luck. If he has final say on personnel decisions, that would be a significant evolution in how rosters are currently managed. In virtually every other FBS program, the head coach has the final say on who is signed — or who isn’t. The only other program that approached something akin to an NFL model is Texas Tech, where head coach Joey McGuire allows his general manager James Blanchard to offer scholarships to recruits without his approval and that department is entrusted with the evaluation of recruits and transfers. But McGuire still has the final say. Many power conference programs invest significantly in scouting and personnel departments to manage both high school recruiting and the transfer portal, similar to how NFL teams dedicate staff to college (NFL Draft) and pro (free agency) scouting. Some general managers, like Blanchard, Alabama’s Courtney Morgan, Ohio State’s Mark Pantoni and Clemson’s Jordan Sorrells, make six-figure salaries. But that’s the exception, not the rule — most personnel and recruiting staffers under the GM make five-figure salaries. But GMs, colloquially known as directors of player personnel, have become a must-have position for modern programs. Advertisement The GM role in college football became en vogue in recent years. With the launch of the transfer portal in 2018 and rise of transfers since, the shift to making transfers immediately eligible plus the addition of NIL compensation, roster management has become quite complex. Gone are the days of simply signing 25 high school recruits per year. Now most teams sign a mix of high school recruits and a double-digit number of transfers. Luck’s role also will span far beyond simple roster management, though that’s a key component of it. One aspect that’s unclear: With the coaching staff reporting to Luck, how much influence will he have in hiring and firing decisions? Does that remain the domain of the athletic director and school president? If Luck has significant weight in those decisions, his role more resembles that of an NFL GM. Stanford’s decision to give Luck more power than any other college football GM could foreshadow the sport’s future. With revenue sharing on the way via the House v. NCAA settlement, college football rosters can be managed similarly to the way NFL rosters are: Payrolls will have to be managed. Evolving how players are acquired and teams are built only makes sense. GO DEEPER What to know about House v. NCAA settlement and a historic day for college sports The Cardinal may be on the cutting edge of college football program management and installing someone like Luck, a sharp mind who has a deep football background and is passionate about the school, is a logical first step. “I am a product of this University, of Nerd Nation; I love this place,” Luck said in a statement. “I believe deeply in Stanford’s unique approach to athletics and academics and the opportunity to help drive our program back to the top. Coach Taylor has the team pointed in the right direction, and I cannot wait to work with him, the staff, and the best, brightest, and toughest football players in the world.” Advertisement Stanford has always been Luck’s happy place. It’s where, in four years, he went from nerdy, redshirt freshman to a two-time Heisman runner-up and arguably the best NFL prospect since John Elway. It’s where he met his wife Nicole as an undergrad, and where they settled with their two daughters in 2022 after moving from Indianapolis — where they lived for three years after he stunned the Indianapolis Colts and NFL with his August 2019 retirement. Luck was most recently volunteering as a quarterback coach at Palo Alto High School while pursuing his Master’s degree in education at Stanford. He earned a Bachelor’s degree in architectural design there in 2012. But Luck was looking, since as far back as the early days of his retirement, for his next challenge, unsure of what was next for him. He craves a challenge, and retiring at such a young age — he was just 29 when he walked away from the NFL — left him wandering. He surfed. He skied. He cooked. He read. For a time, he was a stay-at-home dad while Nicole pursued a career in television production. He’d sometimes joke with himself, saying “I can’t be retired at 30. That ain’t right.” So the gig with the Stanford football program — and a unique one at that — fits him and his talents. Along with Jim Plunkett and Elway, Luck is one of the greatest players in program history. In three years with the Cardinal, Luck completed a combined 67 percent of passes for 9,430 yards and 82 touchdowns against 22 interceptions. He added 957 yards and seven scores on the ground en route to a 2022 College Football Hall of Fame induction. Now, Lucks looks to reinstate dominance at Stanford after the program posted four straight 3-9 seasons. “Football gave me a lot,” Luck said last spring. “Most importantly … the relationships and the experiences with people that I love. Part of me feels like it’s my turn to give back to this game.” (Photo: David Madison / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,How Georgia Football Pulled Off What Might Be Its ‘Best Win of All Time’,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5958031/2024/11/30/georgia-football-georgia-tech-eight-overtimes/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 21:32:35 +0000",Coming back from a 17-0 deficit at halftime and persevering through eight overtimes to come out victorious left players and coaches emotionally spent. For good reason.,"NCAAF ATHENS, Ga. — The wildest game many had ever seen had just ended. Players and coaches from both Georgia and Georgia Tech were lingering, shaking hands, comparing notes, celebrating and consoling. Amid all that, Mike Cavan, a 76-year-old former Georgia quarterback, assistant coach and now staff member, grabbed someone close to him by the arm. Advertisement “Best win of all time,” Cavan said. The best? Cavan won an SEC championship as a player, recruited Herschel Walker, was an assistant on the 1980 national championship team and has been on the sideline during all of Kirby Smart’s run. The best? “Best all-time win over Tech,” Cavan said. Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox.

That’s a clarification that still says plenty: Before Friday, if you told Georgia people they would need eight overtimes to get a 44-42 home win over Georgia Tech in a game they were favored to win by nearly three touchdowns, the reaction would probably have been … ugh. In the more sober light of morning, they still may end up feeling that way. But after the way this went — trailing 17-0 at halftime and 27-13 with five minutes left in regulation and then going eight overtimes, including the last six in a two-point shootout — perspective could wait. Quarterback Carson Beck called it “one of the most emotional games I’ve been a part of.” Linebacker Jalon Walker said he was nervous for his grandmother, who came to the game for the first time. Many Georgia fans left after Georgia Tech went up 14 with 5:37 left in the game. But many stopped or circled back to watch from the bridge over the west end zone. What they witnessed: • Beck hitting Dominic Lovett with a 17-yard touchdown with 3:39 left to make it 27-20. • Georgia safety Dan Jackson forcing Georgia Tech quarterback Haynes King to fumble, which was recovered by Georgia. Jackson is the one connection on defense with the 2021 unit who was on the field for Kelee Ringo’s famous pick six, then was a part of his own moment on Friday night. “That hit-fumble will be one for the ages,” Smart said. • Beck and Lovett connecting again for a 3-yard touchdown with 1:01 left, tying the score. The next minute then saw Georgia Tech try to get in field goal range, get stopped at Georgia’s 45-yard line, then Beck get sacked on a Hail-Mary try. That forced a back-and-forth of emotions. No one could know it was just beginning. Georgia had practiced the overtime rules — one drive each from the 25-yard line in the first two overtimes, then a two-point shootout after that — before the Texas game last month. But this was the first time going through it for real. GO DEEPER How does college football's overtime format work? “We go over the situation but not every single day,” tight end Ben Yurosek said. “So a couple people were probably asking around, making sure (the third overtime) it was a two-point shootout.” • In the first overtime, Beck hit London Humphreys for a touchdown. But King answered with a scoring pass for Georgia Tech. Advertisement On to the second overtime, and Georgia Tech started with King scoring on a 1-yard run, but the rules required a two-point try. It failed. Georgia got the ball, and Beck right away connected with Cash Jones on a touchdown pass. The Bulldogs could have won the game with a two-point conversion but also missed. • It was time for the two-point shootout, an ironic twist for Smart: If Georgia lost this game, his decision to go for two after Georgia’s third-quarter touchdown would have loomed large. There was still 9:53 left in the quarter when it happened, and Smart seemed to acknowledge later it was a questionable decision. “Yeah, interesting question. I’m not going to dig real deep in,” Smart said. “It is analytics, and we follow almost to a tee. It’s what our chart says. It ended up looking really interesting because you (could have kicked) an extra point to win the game.” GO DEEPER Eight OTs? No. 7 Georgia outlasts Georgia Tech after rally from 14 down in fourth But that time, it was the third overtime, and nobody had that choice. The only strategy was in which plays to call, and even then, there were no huge surprises: Georgia Tech offensive coordinator Buster Faulkner was at Georgia from 2020-22, and Smart said his coaches recognized a lot of the two-point plays the Yellow Jackets were running. But Faulkner surely knew which calls were in Georgia’s playbook and was telling his fellow coaches. Maybe that’s why there were so many failures. • The offenses both failed in the third and fourth overtimes. Then Georgia converted with Beck hitting Dillon Bell. Georgia Tech answered with King completing a pass. Then the sixth and seventh overtimes, which were both failures for each team. In all, the second team could have won the game on four of five exchanges but didn’t. “It just was weird that it seemed like every time somebody failed, they had to go again,” Smart said. “So you gotta get over that, then they would fail, and they had to go again.” Advertisement • Finally, the eighth overtime. By this time, Georgia’s defense was being aggressive, going after King on every play, just from a different place each time. Georgia linebacker CJ Allen went right at King, who heaved a pass out of the end zone. Beck and the Georgia offense took the field. So did Nate Frazier, a freshman tailback, who might have seemed like a decoy as both teams basically had been passing in overtime. Georgia offensive coordinator Mike Bobo called a run-pass option, a play the Bulldogs had used earlier. “But not in that way, if that makes sense,” Beck said. “We run the same play in a lot of different ways.” This time, Beck saw the look of the defense, and when the moment came, he gave the ball to Frazier. The hole was there, he burst through it, and the game was finally over. Walker was later asked about his reaction when Frazier scored. “I don’t know, you tell me,” he said, laughing. “My mind went blank.” It took a couple of moments for everyone to realize it was the game over. Smart went to the postgame handshake with Georgia Tech coach Brett Key, and instead, they embraced for a while. Smart and Key both coach at their alma maters and played against each other in the 1990s, and they have a healthy respect for each other, especially after this game. “Nobody knows what it’s like to sit on that sideline and go through that pain and the highs, the lows that, ‘We’re going to win, we’re going to lose, we’re going to win, we’re going to lose,’” Smart said. “I mean, he was emotionally spent, and so was I.” After a few minutes of exultation, almost all of Georgia’s team had to be called back out of the locker room for a ceremony at midfield, where Georgia governor Brian Kemp gave the state trophy to Smart and his team for the seventh straight year. The team came back out still smiling. Maybe that was part relief, but there was genuine celebration. Advertisement Still, it leaves the question: For Georgia to struggle against a team it was supposed to beat easily, on its home field — where it has not lost a night game since 2009 — what does that say? “It shows the resiliency of this team,” Yurosek said. “No matter what happens, what we’re faced with, we’re ready to put our heads down, keep working, no matter the situation. It shows a lot about this team and its character.” Whether the College Football Playoff committee sees it the same way will be reflected in the penultimate rankings on Tuesday. Either way, Georgia can make it all moot by winning the SEC championship next week against Texas or Texas A&M. The winner gets a bye into the quarterfinals. And by pulling this game out against their state rivals, the Bulldogs almost certainly will be in the field either way: A 10-2 regular season featuring wins at Texas and over Clemson and Tennessee earn some leeway to survive a game like this. Still, when asked if this win ensured at least an at-large bid, Smart said he wouldn’t answer but then seemed to acknowledge the stakes of those overtimes. “If things went the other way on one of those plays tonight, we’d be playing next week for our lives,” he said. Indeed, a spot in the Playoff was on the line, and it came down to essentially a series of coin-flip overtimes. It was a bizarre way for things to go down. There will be time to dissect and argue about what it means and should mean in the coming days and two weeks. But in the immediate aftermath, Walker, Georgia’s defensive leader, only could shake his head. “I mean,” he said, with a smile, “I haven’t ever seen anything like that.” (Top photo of Carson Beck: Todd Kirkland / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,The Bears Finally Fired Matt Eberflus. But He Lost the Locker Room Long Ago.,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5957910/2024/11/30/matt-eberflus-fired-bears-players-locker-room/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 21:32:35 +0000","After Chicago’s sixth straight heartbreaking loss, the players weren’t ready to hear another “sticking together” speech. They’d had enough.","NFL Another crushing, confounding loss for the Chicago Bears meant another postgame speech about “sticking together” from head coach Matt Eberflus in front of a frustrated, crowded locker room at Ford Field in Detroit. This time, though, team captain Jaylon Johnson wasn’t having it. Not after another winnable game slipped away — a 23-20 loss to the Lions on Thanksgiving. Advertisement Not after another day of highly questionable coaching decisions. This postgame message required a different tone, a different vibe, and probably a different voice. Like a lot of Bears players, Johnson had had enough. Sick of finding new ways to give games away, they wanted accountability and answers. “Jaylon went crazy,” one Bears player said. “He was very emotional and pissed but rightfully so. He’s been here longer than most.” Said another player: “He was going off more so at (Eberflus).” GO DEEPER Who could be the Bears' next head coach? Here are 15 potential candidates According to multiple players and staffers in the locker room, some players were asking why Eberflus didn’t call a timeout. Other players got going, too. “Guys were furious,” a staff member said. “It was an accumulation of this season.” “The locker room was ugly,” another staffer said. “There was a lot of yelling.” Said the first player: “We felt as players it’s been too many instances where we fought our way back into games to lose because of bad time management and decision-making.”  Multiple sources added that the emotions were so high between the players and their head coach that Eberflus left the locker room immediately after his speech and the exchange with players. There was nothing left to say. It was a moment for this Bears team that would inevitably force chairman George McCaskey into something the franchise had never done before. By Friday morning, Eberflus was out — but not before the team decided to have him address the media over Zoom just after 9 a.m. Two hours later, he was gone. The Bears made it official by sharing statements from general manager Ryan Poles and president/CEO Kevin Warren. A team source explained that McCaskey, Poles and Warren were still meeting during the scheduled news conference. At that point, no decision had been made about Eberflus’ future so there was no reason to delay the presser, which might have signaled something big was happening. By the time the decision to fire Eberflus was made, the news conference was over. Advertisement With two years remaining on a five-year contract, Eberflus became the first head coach ever fired by the Bears during a season. While Eberflus was liked by some in the building, his records in one-score games (5-19, the NFL’s worst record during his tenure) and in NFC North matchups (2-13) were abysmal. His decision to hire Shane Waldron to be quarterback Caleb Williams’ first offensive coordinator in the NFL transformed into a dysfunctional debacle in a matter of weeks. And his clock management and situational football awareness were even worse. Unfortunately for the Bears, what happened in the final 32 seconds in Detroit wasn’t the first time that Eberflus’ decision-making left those at Halas Hall or watching from home wondering if he was equipped for the job. The unraveling began weeks earlier during the team’s disastrous loss to the Washington Commanders. In that game, the defense gave up a Hail Mary touchdown in the closing seconds. Cornerback Tyrique Stevenson missed his assignment completely, tipping the ball into the hands of Noah Brown for the game-winning touchdown. To make matters worse, Stevenson was caught interacting with fans moments before the play. Eberflus told Stevenson days later that he wouldn’t start against the Arizona Cardinals. Upset with the news, Stevenson briefly left practice to calm himself before returning. A;FK;JD;KJF;LAKEJFLKJVAL;KEJL;JF;EFJ;LFAKJ JAYDEN DANIELS HAIL MARY! @COMMANDERS WIN! pic.twitter.com/BsQ0Z84Rko — NFL (@NFL) October 27, 2024  Players accepted that, but what didn’t sit well with some team leaders was Eberflus avoiding accountability for his own coaching errors. Players pointed to the play before the Hail Mary. Eberflus allowed Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels to complete a 13-yard pass on the penultimate play and then didn’t call a timeout before the Hail Mary to discuss his defense and calm emotions. When he was asked about it by reporters, Eberflus downplayed the importance of Daniels’ 13-yard completion to receiver Terry McLaurin and even doubled down on his decision, which many believe was among the mistakes. Advertisement “That didn’t sit well in the locker room,” a player said. “It didn’t go over right,” the second player said. “That week is when he lost the defensive guys.” As the Bears’ losing streak expanded, there was a shift in tone and messaging from Eberflus when discussing the team’s latest problems. He seemed to go out of his way to take the blame for nearly everything. His subsequent attempts to take accountability felt insincere to the players. By then, it was too little, too late. The damage was done in Washington and in the days that followed. Eberflus never led his team through that loss. “As a leader of men,” one of the Bears players said, “you’re supposed to take blame for everything that happens under your watch.” GO DEEPER Bears go from 'HITS' to firing a coach in-season: The Matt Eberflus timeline The first signal that the Bears were going to function differently during this season was the firing of Waldron on Nov. 12, which came two days after losing 19-3 to the New England Patriots and just nine games into his tenure as offensive coordinator. For the Bears, it was a break from the past. The team had never fired an offensive coordinator during the season, either. Players’ frustrations with Waldron had been bubbling since the summer. The new offensive coordinator changed the Bears’ run game, scrapping two years of progress under offensive line coach Chris Morgan. His decision to install a pure progression passing system — a challenging scheme even for veteran QBs — further complicated things for Williams. Players voiced concerns to their head coach at various times but rarely felt heard. Receiver Keenan Allen told reporters at Halas Hall after Waldron’s firing that Waldron was “too nice of a guy,” a sentiment that other players shared. “He just didn’t demand things properly,” one player said. That included how Waldron handled coaching Williams. After the loss to the Patriots, meetings at Halas Hall grew tense. Some team leaders even floated the idea of benching Williams in favor of backup Tyson Bagent, believing Waldron’s system was hurting the rookie’s growth. Two days later, Waldron was fired. A team source said Warren wanted changes. Advertisement Eberflus considered keeping Waldron on the staff, but it didn’t happen. “Where they messed up was with Shane and making him the coordinator to begin with,” the player said. Thomas Brown, then the team’s passing game coordinator, was named offensive coordinator and provided an instant jolt for everyone involved in the offense. Even assistant coaches hired by Waldron quickly got on board with Brown. His communication style and leadership skills earned the respect of players and staff. “There’s been a little bit better communication clearly from the top down as far as what we’re trying to get accomplished,” wide receivers coach Chris Beatty told The Athletic in an interview before Thanksgiving.  “I think there’s been expanded roles for everybody. That’s allowed some guys to be able to interject with some new ideas and different ways of doing some things.” GO DEEPER For Matt Eberflus and Bears, the math didn't work out. What is next formula for success? With Brown in charge, the pure progression passing scheme was kept, but different concepts and plays were added to get the ball out of Williams’ hand more quickly. The Bears turned to tighter formations and more motions. “Instead of doing pure progressions all the time and going full-field reads, we kind of changed some of those thoughts to make it 1-to-2 (reads) to use your legs,” Beatty said. “And so those things are showing up.” The biggest change discussed among players is Brown’s leadership presence, something the Bears had been missing. One player suggested that the way Brown is during his news conferences is just a glimpse into how he functions behind the scenes. The Bears are bought in. “He’s in charge — and he’s done a great job of being in charge,” Beatty said. “We were lacking some of that at the beginning (on offense). So I think those things have shown up. It’s a … clearer line of communication as opposed to how it was.” Advertisement In an 18-day span, Brown was promoted from passing game coordinator to offensive coordinator to, now, interim head coach. The Bears now face the challenge of finding stability in a season defined by change. Early signs have been promising, but his ability to galvanize the locker room while leading Williams’ development will be closely monitored by Poles and Warren. He’ll continue calling plays, too. “He’s just a direct person — direct, honest,” quarterbacks coach Kerry Joseph told The Athletic before the Lions game. “He knows what he wants to get across and is confident about it. And he’s Thomas. That’s the thing you love about him being around him. Caleb’s been good. That relationship has been good and (they’re) just kind of growing in it. “To be elite, there’s a certain way to do things and he knows that. That’s what Thomas brings. There’s a certain way to do it — and it’s the right way to do it. And that’s the way we’re going to do it. When you say ‘direct,’ that’s what it is. It’s authentic. It’s honest and he understands what it takes to be elite as a player, as a team.” GO DEEPER Football, fatherhood and new opportunities: Get to know new Bears OC Thomas Brown The next five weeks can be viewed as an elongated interview for Brown. Williams could be an essential part of what’s next for the Bears, but now Brown must prove he can relate to everyone on the roster and not cost his team games. For a team desperate for accountability and clear direction, Brown might be the leader they’ve been searching for. “There’s an authenticity about him that’s infectious and everybody responds to it,” tight ends coach Jim Dray said in an interview with The Athletic before Thanksgiving. “Very clear, very concise, very measured on what it is expected — and he holds everybody accountable.” (Top photo: Brooke Sutton / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

So, as a result, the holidays leave Sunday’s schedule for Week 13 lighter than usual, but certainly not lacking. Our writers Mike Sando, Zak Keefer and Jeff Howe dish on Trevor Lawrence’s return, Aaron Rodgers’ future, a possible leap for second-year quarterbacks, a potential Super Bowl LIX preview in Philadelphia Eagles–Baltimore Ravens and more in this week’s roundtable. Advertisement The Panthers, who nearly beat the Chiefs in Week 12, host the Bucs on Sunday. The Titans, who knocked off the Texans, are on the road against the Commanders. Do you feel second-year quarterbacks Bryce Young and Will Levis have turned a corner or do you need to see more? Sando: Young seems to have stabilized to the point where the Panthers can leave him in the lineup and hope he develops. I would not mistake his progress for a sky-high ceiling, however. We still aren’t sure whether he can be more than a mid-tier starter. He does appear viable, however, and that’s a positive reflection on him and coach Dave Canales. In Tennessee, Levis just became the third player since 1960 to win a start while taking at least eight sacks and throwing a pick-six interception. That is not a winning formula. It was also the second time this season he had at least eight sacks and a pick-six in the same game. Definitely need to see more. Howe: They’ve definitely turned a corner, but they haven’t left the neighborhood. Young is playing well, so the time on the bench seemed to serve as a good reset for the No. 1 pick. I think it’s fair to be optimistic that Canales has helped Young elevate his game, considering his track record with past quarterbacks. But until there’s more help around Young, it’s too soon to know where his potential lies. Levis is playing better, too, though I had him ranked as the worst starter in the league for a couple of weeks before this turnaround so there was clear room for growth. Levis still has to eliminate the crucial mistakes before he can be viewed as a long-term starter in the league. GO DEEPER Bryce Young showed progress — and then the fire teammates were waiting to see Keefer: Young deserves a ton of credit — rarely has a top pick who flailed so badly early in his career, then was benched, bounced back in a more impressive way with the same team. I still believe the Panthers see him as part of the organization’s future, and that wasn’t a guarantee just a few weeks ago. As for Levis, Jeff is right — his game-breaking mistakes remain a serious flaw. I think the Titans look long and hard at adding a new starting quarterback in the offseason. Trevor Lawrence (shoulder) is trying to come back from injury and is expected to play this week against the Texans for the last-place Jaguars. Is it worth it? Should he be shut down for the season? Sando: If Lawrence is healthy, he should play. I think that’s the general standard for players and would not hold him out of games otherwise. Advertisement Howe: It’s absolutely worth it. Lawrence’s job is secure because of his contract, but plenty of other jobs in the organization are on the line and he owes it to them to be on the field. He also has to try to create optimism for 2025. If Lawrence plays well under the injury circumstances, it will carry weight in the locker room. That would be really important amid a lost season. Keefer: When you sign a $275 million contract that pays you like one of the best quarterbacks in the league, there are certain expectations that come with it. For one, if you’re healthy, you suit up. Period. Lawrence is also staring at his fourth different head coach next season if Doug Pederson is ultimately let go — including interims — which tells you how chaotic his tenure in Jacksonville has been. I still think the Jaguars have enough to pull an upset one of these weeks, and it’s not like the Texans are playing well at the moment. The Jets host the Seahawks with a chance to play spoiler, but the conversation around New York these days is about Aaron Rodgers, whose future is now in question. What’s best for the Jets at quarterback? What do you think will happen at this point? Sando: Turning the page would be best for the Jets given Rodgers’ age and all that comes along with having him on the team. Acquiring him was worth the risk because the upside was high and the team appeared ready to win, but his Achilles injury and the overall state of the team makes a reset more appealing. I’d imagine this will be it for Rodgers and the Jets. Howe: I asked three high-ranking executives who will be GM candidates how they’d handle the Rodgers situation if they ran the Jets. All three said they would release him with the post-June 1 designation, and I agree with them. Barring a significant turnaround in performance, this shouldn’t be a difficult decision, especially for a new regime that won’t wish to be anchored by the contract. GO DEEPER Stay or Go? From Aaron Rodgers to Anders Carlson, vote on which Jets should return in 2025 Keefer: It’s time to move on. This gamble has been a bust from the start, and in typical Jets fashion, none of the immense hype — hype this team welcomed — translated into any real success. The Jets need to find new leadership and a new quarterback for 2025. The Chargers and Falcons meet Sunday. Los Angeles is trying to hang on in the AFC wild-card hunt. Atlanta is trying to hang on in the NFC South race. Both teams have been exposed somewhat in the last week. What is your current confidence in them? Sando: I’ve got more confidence in the Chargers than I have in the Falcons. There’s no shame in losing to Baltimore, as the Chargers did to end a four-game winning streak. Atlanta lost to New Orleans and then got blown out by Denver, leading coach Raheem Morris to question the team’s effort. That’s much more concerning that the Chargers’ slipup Monday night. Advertisement Howe: However inconsistent the Ravens have been at times, the Chargers ran into a buzzsaw this week. I think they’re in a good spot to make the playoffs because Justin Herbert is playing well and the defense should hold steady, but I don’t view them as a threat to make a run in January. The Falcons have too many sporadic performances. There are weeks when the defense looks pretty good and others when it can’t make a stop, and the offense has dealt with similar inconsistencies. They earned the tiebreaker by sweeping the Bucs, which is significant with a one-game lead in the NFC South, but it’s going to be a nervous ride to the finish line. Keefer: I still don’t see the Chargers as a great team — certainly not on the level of Kansas City, Buffalo and perhaps even Pittsburgh in the AFC — but they remain a solid playoff contender. All four losses this season have come against a team in the thick of the postseason race. The Falcons? They remain more of a mystery — good enough to beat the Eagles early in the year and bad enough to get blown out by the Broncos the last time they played. Give me Los Angeles in this one as the NFC South race continues to get muddier. Eagles-Ravens feels like it could be a Super Bowl preview and one storyline is what Saquon Barkley and Derrick Henry have done for their respective teams this season. Has their play done enough to revitalize the running back market? Sando: Running back salaries at the top of the market already rebounded some after declining. I think those salaries at the top should continue to rebound partly because of the success these players have enjoyed. The running game in general has made a comeback and that will likely benefit running backs in the market. Howe: No, they’re viewed as exceptions because they’re elite talents who joined strong organizations with solid rosters. It would be just as easy to look at Christian McCaffrey and point out how quickly a running back could go from the best in the league to someone with potentially career-altering injury issues. That’s why teams are so reluctant to go all in on a running back. Last offseason helped to stabilize the second and third tiers of the running back market, but it’ll be rare to see teams break the bank at the position. Keefer: Not really. The running back market as a whole won’t shift all that much, but what Barkley and Henry are doing this season is reminding personnel execs how much an elite one truly matters. There’s only one or two on the market each year, but the game-changers at running back still matter. Imagine where the Eagles would be without Barkley this season? His three-year, $37.8 million contract was a steal. (Top photo of Trevor Lawrence: Jorge Lemus / NurPhoto via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

NYT > Sports,Rival Captains Didn’t Shake Hands Before the Game. The Disrespect Continued.,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5958215/2024/11/30/nebraska-iowa-college-football-hand-shake/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 21:32:35 +0000","The Nebraska Cornhuskers are not above a petty gesture. They are mad. They’ve had enough, a columnist for The Athletic writes.","NCAAF IOWA CITY, Iowa — So people are wondering why the Nebraska captains refused to shake hands on Friday night before the coin toss at Kinnick Stadium. Let me try to explain. They do not like Iowa. Those Nebraska players didn’t want to engage in an act of good sportsmanship in the company of that opponent. They did not care about respecting the game in a series that has included repeated moments of disrespect — in their view — committed by the Hawkeyes and directed at Nebraska. Advertisement The Huskers are not above a petty gesture. They are mad. They’ve had enough. And it’s disingenuous of the Hawkeyes to act as if they don’t understand or that this protest came out of the blue. Nebraska selects game captains before each kickoff. On Friday, Elliott Brown, Emmett Johnson, MJ Sherman and DeShon Singleton walked to the center of the field. When the Iowa captains moved to shake the Huskers’ hands, a traditional gesture, the four from Nebraska didn’t move. Ope 😂  pic.twitter.com/jTJlQnJOUH — Hawkeye Football (@HawkeyeFootball) November 30, 2024  “That was a little weird,” Iowa linebacker Jay Higgins said after the 13-10 Iowa victory. Was it, though? Understand that tradition in this series is for Iowa to rip out the Huskers’ hearts. It happened again on Friday. Defensive lineman Max Llewellyn stripped Nebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola and recovered his fumble with 20 seconds to play before Drew Stevens nailed a 53-yard field goal as time expired to beat the Huskers 13-10. Imagine getting kicked in the gut over and over and watching the bully celebrate in your face. Four times now in the past seven years, Iowa has beaten Nebraska on field goals in the final seconds. Last year in Lincoln, amazingly, Iowa defensive lineman Ethan Hurkett intercepted QB Chubba Purdy in the final 20 seconds and the Hawkeyes won 13-10 on a 38-yard field goal by Marshall Meeder as time expired. In celebration of reclaiming the Freedom Trophy after Nebraska’s lone win since 2014 two years ago, Iowa players waved goodbye to the Huskers and their fans, wishing them, “Merry Christmas,” before Nebraska stayed at home in bowl season for a seventh consecutive year. It was painful, second-year Nebraska coach Matt Rhule said last week. GO DEEPER Iowa tops Nebraska on 53-yard walk-off field goal: Hawkeyes-Huskers takeaways In 2019, Iowa kicker Keith Duncan hit a 48-yard walk-off field goal at Nebraska, then turned to the home bench, wagged his finger and blew kisses at the Huskers. On Friday when Nebraska players arrived at Kinnick Stadium and moved toward the center of the field to gather as a team in prayer, uniformed police officers guarded the logo. There will be no meeting on 50 yd line. Odd how this has become a thing. pic.twitter.com/fFnhloycx0 — Damon Benning (@damonbenning) November 29, 2024  Nebraska didn’t play dirty against Iowa on Friday. It was a clean game — aside from the Huskers’ special teams blunders, blown assignments in the second half and the late turnover. They didn’t head hunt. They didn’t try to start fights or commit personal fouls. Common in rivalry games, those actions would have crossed the line of poor sportsmanship. Advertisement But a silent protest before the coin toss as a reminder of the motivation in play? Spare us the insincere audacity. Higgins and his teammates either chose not to pay attention, or the Hawkeyes knew exactly why Nebraska wanted to send a message that it was done with getting bullied. None of the Nebraska game captains, in defeat, were made available to the media. And problem is, the strategy backfired on the Huskers. GO DEEPER Nebraska football seniors left their mark despite losses: ‘They played so damn hard’ Nebraska dominated much of the game. It pitched a shutout until late in the third quarter when Iowa could only kick a field goal after it recovered a muffed punt at the Nebraska 4-yard line. The Huskers held Iowa to 20 yards and one first down in the first half — and a paltry five first downs in the game. But Kaleb Johnson raced for 72 yards, 44 percent of the Hawkeyes’ output, on the first play of the fourth quarter to even the score and foretell the inevitable Nebraska collapse. “Very similar to last year and probably years previous,” Rhule said. “We found a way to lose the game at the end.” Rhule said he was beyond disappointed in the finish. He said he was angry. “Credit to them,” the coach said. “Those guys, they’ve won for a long time. They believe. They make the plays all the way to the very end. We’ve got to catch them.” The Huskers, at 6-6, lost five games this year by a total of 29 points. In four, against Ohio State, UCLA, USC and Iowa, they committed turnovers at the end with plentiful time available to win or even the score. And in the fifth, Raiola missed an open receiver in the end zone that would have put the Huskers ahead before Illinois won in overtime. Nebraska is set for the first time since 2016 to accept a bowl invitation next weekend. The season is not over. But it has been defined by these late-game miscues. “One game doesn’t define us,” senior defensive lineman Ty Robinson said. Advertisement No. But five do. After last season, when the Huskers lost four games by a field goal and a fifth in overtime, they created a mantra, “Chasing 3.” Nebraska built its offseason regimen and motivational base around the bid to get three points better. The irony was thick in cold Kinnick air on Friday. “We had to do what they did,” Rhule said. He said he doesn’t believe in bad luck. “We’ve just got to get better.” Raiola said he “couldn’t be more proud” of the progress Nebraska has made since Week 1. “Losing this way doesn’t do justice to all the success and the strides that we’ve made as a team,” the freshman QB said. But progress is measured largely by wins. Against Iowa, Nebraska counts one win in the past decade. Its pregame gesture on Friday, while not an affront to the sport of football or anything more than a turnabout against Iowa, rung hollow. In the end, when it always matters for Nebraska against Iowa, the Huskers fell short again. “It should probably bother people for a little bit,” Rhule said. Rest assured, people are bothered.

NYT > Sports,"FIFA ‘Has a Responsibility’ to Compensate Qatar World Cup Workers, Report Says",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5958142/2024/11/30/fifa-qatar-world-cup-report-workers/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 21:32:35 +0000",A report commissioned by FIFA has concluded that football’s governing body should compensate workers who suffered during the hosting of the 2022 World Cup.,"World Cup A report commissioned by FIFA has concluded football’s governing body “has a responsibility” to compensate workers who suffered during the hosting of the 2022 Qatar World Cup. The long-awaited report from FIFA’s sub-committee on human rights and social responsibility — finally published on Friday at midnight Central European Time — says the governing body “took a number of steps to seek to meet its responsibility to respect human rights” as part of the delivery of the tournament two years ago. Advertisement However, FIFA failed to meet one of the report’s primary recommendations of using the Qatar Legacy Fund to remedy workers impacted by human rights abuses, instead announcing they would donate the money to several other programmes which will not directly compensate workers in Qatar. FIFA insisted the study was not “a legal assessment of the obligation to remedy”. The independent study, commissioned by the sub-committee and developed by the business and human rights advisory firm ‘Human Level’, notes that “a number of severe human rights impacts did ultimately occur in Qatar from 2010 through 2022” for a number of workers connected to the tournament. This included “deaths, injuries and illnesses; wages not being paid for months on end; and significant debt faced by workers and their families reimbursing the fees they paid to obtain jobs in Qatar.” While acknowledging that “the main responsibility to rectify such shortcomings lies with the direct employers of these workers as well as with the Qatari government” the sub-committee “endorses the view expressed in the Human Level Study that FIFA too has a responsibility to take additional measures to contribute to the provision of remedy to these workers.” World Cup organizers have put the number of deaths directly linked to the delivery of the tournament at 40. Human rights groups have long estimated that thousands of workers died. GO DEEPER Explained: Why it is so hard to provide a death toll for Qatar’s migrant workers A FIFA spokesperson said: “All reports and recommendations were considered during a comprehensive review by the FIFA administration and relevant bodies. While all recommendations could not be met, practical and impactful elements were retained. “It should be noted that the study did not specifically constitute a legal assessment of the obligation to remedy.” The report recommends that FIFA should use its Qatar Legacy Fund to remedy workers impacted or, for those who died, their family members. Advertisement The sub-committee advises them to “act upon the intention, as indicated by FIFA in a press release of 19 November 2022, to dedicate the FIFA World Cup 2022 Legacy Fund in full or in part to further strengthen the competition’s legacy for migrant workers.” However, two days before the report’s publication FIFA announced the $50million fund would instead be used on a series of social programmes globally in collaboration with Qatar and three organisations, the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Trade Organization (WTO) and UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, instead. A FIFA spokesperson said: “The creation of the FIFA World Cup 2022 Legacy Fund was unanimously endorsed by the FIFA Council following a proposal made by the FIFA governance, audit and compliance committee. “A Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was established in Qatar in 2018 and FIFA believes the new Legacy Fund, endorsed by recognised international agencies, is a pragmatic and transparent initiative that will encompass social programmes to help people most in need across the world.” Following the award of the World Cup to Qatar, FIFA has added human rights as a consideration as part of its bidding process for tournaments. On Friday FIFA’s evaluation report for Saudi Arabia’s 2034 World Cup bid declared the risk assessment for human rights to be “medium”. A vote on the hosts for the tournament — where the Saudi bid has no rival — will take place at the FIFA Congress on December 11.

NYT > Sports,The Rangers Have Fallen Apart in One Week. What Now?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5957400/2024/11/29/new-york-rangers-trouba-kreider/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 21:32:35 +0000","New York is not going to tell you things are off the rails. But you have eyes, a columnist for The Athletic writes.","NHL They’re not going to tell you things are off the rails. But you have eyes. You can see how wrong it’s gone for the New York Rangers. Eight days ago they were hitting the ice in Calgary, a 12-4-1 team that had gotten some incredible goaltending and timely scoring to get out to a fast start on the season. Advertisement Eight days later and it’s not only gone wrong on the ice and in the standings but in the executive suite and in the locker room. Friday’s 3-1 loss to the Flyers was the Rangers’ fifth straight regulation loss, something they haven’t done since the end of the 2020-21 season — a stretch of defeats that included the Tom Wilson-Artemi Panarin incident, Madison Square Garden’s subsequent public criticism of the NHL and the firings of president John Davidson and general manager Jeff Gorton. That they haven’t had as bad a week in four years is a window into how good the Rangers have been since then. That the second bad week in four years has brought almost as much turmoil to this organization as the last one did is a window into how this team and its bosses seemingly get tossed into a full-blown panic when things start to snowball. And this time there’s not the previous three seasons of rebuilding to blame for the pent-up frustration. The bad eight days in November still have left the current Rangers in a playoff spot, still with one of the best goalies in the league and a collection of pretty good talent all around. The past eight days for the Rangers: Thursday: Lose 3-2 in CalgarySaturday: Blown out in EdmontonMonday morning: Word leaks that Drury is open to trades and mentions Kreider, Trouba to league GMsMonday: Lose 5-2 to STLWednesday: Lose 4-3 in CarolinaFriday: Lose 3-1 in PHI — Peter Baugh (@Peter_Baugh) November 29, 2024  So this chaos, these incredibly bad vibes, are all self-inflicted. And you can see what Chris Drury’s overreaction last weekend has wrought. A first period on Friday so thoroughly lifeless and borderline embarrassing that only Igor Shesterkin stood between the Flyers and a 5-0 or 6-0 lead. Panarin getting into it with an entire five-man Flyers crew after a whistle with zero teammates coming in to back him up. An entire team, one that’s played decently in its own end before, seemingly allergic to the space between the hash marks in the Rangers end, where the Flyers produced about a dozen high-danger scoring chances in the first 40 minutes. Advertisement Then, finally, Shesterkin — you know, the guy the Rangers need to pay to be able to keep even a faint chance of being a Stanley Cup contender — skating off on his own, acknowledging no one, after yet another loss. “That can’t happen to a team that’s sitting here, looking for ways to win hockey games,” Peter Laviolette said afterward. As we outlined earlier on Friday, the reverberations of Drury’s leaguewide “come and get it” memo to the other 31 GMs on Sunday are still being felt. Chris Kreider, one of the two Rangers veterans mentioned by name in Drury’s note, is still out with the back spasms he so carefully noted in Raleigh a couple of days ago you’d have thought he had one of those anatomy charts next to him. That may have been the longest-tenured Ranger’s way of telling the hockey world that he’s not feeling so hot and trading for him might not be in their best interest. Jacob Trouba, the other named party in the note, hasn’t been hitting much lately. He hasn’t been talking much to the media, except when he has to answer for the GM trying to trade him for the second time in about four months. The idea of Trouba tossing his helmet and yelling at his own bench to wake (the f—) up, as he did around this time two seasons ago after a huge hit and fight, seems absurd at the moment. You can call that indifferent behavior unprofessional. Unbecoming of an $8-million-a-year guy who wears the C. All true. But think about how we got here — Drury tried to put the cart before the horse in June, attempting to force Trouba into a move before the player was ready and before any other team, the Red Wings included, had even given much thought to acquiring him. That poisoned the situation. Now it seems irreparable. No one is trading for Trouba with him playing like this, not now and maybe not this summer without a decent sweetener in the deal. Advertisement And there is a domino effect. Trouba was named captain despite not being a Ranger as long as some teammates because he did all the things you need to do as a leader. Fans may have wanted Kreider or Mika Zibanejad or Adam Fox, but it’s Trouba who has wrangled the team behind the scenes, has gone to coaching and management with player requests and has been an intermediary on sensitive issues between the front office and the locker room. Kreider prefers to do his leadership work one-on-one with younger players. Zibanejad and Fox are lead-by-example types, very soft-spoken otherwise. It’s not a boisterous room filled with outsize personalities and Trouba was the guy they all looked to for leadership. Now, he’s adrift; it’s not that surprising the ship is listing too. In such a crucial year, with Shesterkin due for big money, Alexis Lafrenière already cashing in (and not doing a whole lot since securing the bag) and K’Andre Miller mounting a very curious campaign to earn a big extension, the Rangers needed calm. They needed a steady hand. They’ve got a snow globe getting worked over by a jackhammer at the moment. All in just eight days — off-ice turmoil, on-ice disinterest, you name it. It’s some kind of world record for how fast this thing has fallen apart. The Rangers were within two games of a Stanley Cup Final back in June, a team that had flaws but enough skill in net and up front to feel like a contender for at least a little while. The Barclay Goodrow saga, with Drury informing the alternate captain and well-liked teammate that he’d be on the 2 p.m. waiver wire at about 1:45, didn’t get the offseason going in the right direction. The Trouba thing hamstrung Drury’s attempts to remake the top four of his defense and also had the effect outlined above. Now, at the first sign of real trouble this season, it’s a tire fire. Advertisement What will Saturday bring? The Canadiens, another young, fast team, come to the Garden. The Rangers have missed Filip Chytil, sure, as well as Kreider, but even at full strength this season they’ve looked painfully slow — either to react to teams counterattacking off turnovers or simply tracking back on a regular old rush. During this losing streak, they’ve stopped defending off O-zone possessions by opposing teams, leading to situations like Friday’s three-on-Shesterkin down low off a faceoff. So what’s next? Do you strip Trouba of the C? Put him or someone else on waivers? All that does is further humiliate a core player, one of the reasons the Rangers are in this mess. Is Laviolette next? That would mark three coaching searches for Drury in four years. What about Drury? There’s no indication the president/GM is on the hot seat here, but remember what happened the last time the Rangers lost five in a row. The Rangers do need something to change and they are getting older a lot faster than you would have thought watching them play deep into the postseason two of the last three playoffs. They’re playing poorly. They’ve gone from a comfortable spot near the top of the Metro Division to peering nervously below to all the mediocre teams bunched up close behind them. But all that’s really changed for the Rangers is their own boss making them more and more miserable. Hard to see how that helps — or how it gets fixed soon.

Texas A&M's rushing attack is ranked second in the SEC and 18th in the country, with the Aggies averaging 208.4 yards per game. Le'Veon Moss leads the Aggies with 765 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns this season and will be seeking his first 100-yard rushing performance since Oct. 5. The Longhorns rush defense is one of the best in the nation (fourth in SEC, 14th nationally), allowing 104 yards per game. Linebacker Anthony Hill Jr. (79 tackles), David Gbenda (48 tackles) and Liona Lefau (38 tackles) lead the way for Texas and will be tasked with stopping the ever-dangerous Moss at Kyle Field.

In another world, perhaps the rivals could have been playing in the SEC much sooner.  The prime-time showdown, which will decide who plays Georgia in the SEC Championship Game, is the culmination of a decades-long dance between the schools and the conference where “It just means more.” Although Texas A&M officially joined the league in 2012 and Texas arrived this summer, informal discussions about a potential union involving the schools trace as far back as the late 1980s.

The Longhorns have more firepower with their collection of skill talent at receiver, tight end and running back. When quarterback Quinn Ewers is comfortable, things go well for the Texas offense. But if the Longhorns yield consistent pressure — like they did early against Georgia — that’s when things can get messy. If Texas asserts its will and takes care of the ball (something that has been an issue this year), it should be just fine.

Despite some recent struggles, the Longhorns still have the better team with the better offense and the better defense. Texas A&M has been so up and down, considering the losses to South Carolina and Auburn, and you have to wonder how much confidence the Aggies will enter Saturday night with. If the Texas defense can keep Marcel Reed contained, the Longhorns’ offense won’t have to put 35 on the board to win. If he’s consistently scrambling, getting outside contain and moving the chains in off-script ways, it’s going to be a frustrating night for Texas.  Advertisement Texas' defense has been strong all season. It's second nationally in total defense and third in scoring defense. That's not the problem. The offense, however, has been inconsistent and sloppy. It's time for that to stop. The Longhorns need to find their rhythm on offense at the most important time of the season, especially on the road against their biggest rivals.  The Aggies have to be able to run the ball. In all three of their losses against Notre Dame, South Carolina and Auburn, the Aggies had less than 170 yards rushing, including 146 against the Irish and 144 against the Gamecocks. Establish the run, limit the turnovers and let the rest of the offense open up from there. COLLEGE STATION, Texas — In the third quarter of Texas A&M’s blowout win against New Mexico State on Nov. 16, senior mechanical engineering student Ronaldo Resendiz left Kyle Field.  Resendiz, a San Antonio native who will graduate in December, has attended most A&M home games in his four years on campus. With the Aggies’ eighth win of the season well in hand, he and a few friends ventured out for a quick meal so they could get back to the stadium as soon as possible — not for the end of the game, but to camp out for tickets to the home finale against hated rival Texas.

The Sun Devils don’t quite control their destiny to reach the Big 12 championship with a win, but most of the tiebreakers work in their favor and a victory would put them in a solid position to play for a conference championship. ASU outgained Arizona 390 yards to 57, with running back Cam Skattebo rushing for 113 yards and three touchdowns and quarterback Sam Leavitt throwing for two more. Will McLelland / Imagn Images I'm not sure what Auburn did inside the 5-yard line, but it wasn't good. The Tigers got stuffed on a second-and-goal rush. Then they hurried up for another rush, which was also stuffed. Then they took a delay of game at the 2 and will settle for a field goal. Auburn either had awful, unacceptable game management or opted to take a delay of game to get a better angle on a field goal when it's down 11 late in the first half.

Will McLelland / Imagn Images Last Saturday at Oklahoma (73rd nationally in turnover margin): Alabama was minus-2 margin with three total turnovers in a 24-3 loss. This afternoon vs Auburn (128th nationally in turnover margin): Alabama is minus-2 margin with two total turnovers and leads Auburn 7-3 midway through the second quarter. That's exactly how a Playoff team gets into closer-than-expected games with barely .500 teams. The turnover margin was once a strength, now it's Alabama's biggest hindrance to end the regular season. Will it cost the Tide against Auburn? Auburn cuts into Alabama's lead with a field goal halfway through the second quarter. Field Goal, 4th & 15 at ALA 19 Ian Vachon makes a 37 yard field goal. Auburn has had two trips in the red zone and has been flagged for a false start on both of them. The Tigers have certainly had chances to do something but can't get out of their own way. Auburn had a would-be touchdown, too, but Payton Thorne overthrew Keandre Lambert-Smith. This, obviously, is a key third-and-long opportunity coming up.

So, I'll find out exactly what happened.

Will McLelland / Imagn Images Alabama leads Auburn 7-0 after a fairly even first quarter. The Tigers face a big fourth-and-4 when the game resumes. Does Auburn try another field goal after missing the first? Or do the Tigers try for more? I feel like Auburn probably needs some points here so it doesn't waste a trip inside the red zone. Another slow start for Alabama's offense after its performance at Oklahoma last week. The first drive sees a Ryan Williams fumble, and the next drive only spans four plays and ends in a punt, and that was a fortunate outcome considering Jalen Milroe fumbled the ball on third down but recovered it.

Advertisement The draft picks have not yet been confirmed. Hunt, 22, the Wild’s most NHL-ready defense prospect, was supposed to play Saturday afternoon against the Checkers but was pulled from the lineup just before the game. Jiricek, who turned 21 years old on Thursday, was selected with the No. 6 pick in the 2022 NHL Draft, but his awkward skating and erratic play kept him from grabbing a lineup spot under three different Blue Jackets coaches, including current bench boss Dean Evason. The Blue Jackets had demoted Jiricek last week to the AHL’s Cleveland Monsters after he’d appeared in only six of Columbus’ games this season. In those six games, Jiricek averaged only 11 minutes, 14 seconds of ice time. GM Don Waddell, who joined the Blue Jackets in late May, and Evason, who came aboard a month later, provided Jiricek a fresh start in his third pro season. While it hasn’t been contentious, as it was last season, Jiricek and the organization remain at loggerheads over his NHL readiness. Jiricek and his camp have felt since last season that he was ready for a prominent role in the NHL — top-four ice time, a spot on the power play, etc. The Blue Jackets have given him chances to grab a lineup spot, but his defensive reads and clumsy skating have relegated him to the third pair — and often to the press box as a healthy scratch. Unable to see eye to eye, the two opted to part ways, but Waddell wasn’t going to simply accept the best offer for Jiricek and move forward. The Blue Jackets have been in that spot before with Pierre-Luc Dubois, Patrik Laine and others, but that wasn’t the case here. Waddell wasn’t trading Jiricek until he heard the right trade offer, some combination of prospect(s) and pick(s) that he felt was commensurate with Jiricek’s value. After several days of listening to offers, making counteroffers, etc., the Wild finally met the bar on Hunt and a bunch of picks. Advertisement Brock Faber’s eight-year extension kicks in next season. While the Wild still have right-shot defenseman David Spacek — the son of former Blue Jackets defenseman Jaroslav Spacek — in the pipeline, the opportunity to add a prospect as highly decorated as Jiricek was too good of a chance to pass up. The Wild envision Faber, 22, and Jiricek, 21, on the right side in the top four for a decade-plus. In essence, they are planning for life after Jared Spurgeon, the Wild captain and 15-year vet who was limited to 16 games last season due to shoulder, hip and back injuries and has two years left on his contract after this season. All teams covet right shots, and Jiricek is a two-way defenseman with a heavy shot who plays hard and will bring much-needed size to a blue line that doesn’t have a ton of it. While mobility has long been his weakness, the Wild believe their skating expert, Andy Ness, could do wonders for him. Jiricek is a decorated junior player with lots of international experience and success. He was named the best defenseman of the 2023 World Junior Championship, helping lead Czechia to a silver medal. In a league that’s awfully unkind to teenage defensemen, Jiricek had 38 points in 55 games in his first year pro with AHL Cleveland in 2022-23 and helped lead the Monsters to the Eastern Conference final last season with 11 points in 14 games. Jiricek’s camp accepts that he may begin his Wild career in Iowa. While it shouldn’t be long before the Wild make room for him on the big club, he has barely played this year (six NHL games and a four-game stint in Cleveland where he has scored two goals and an assist) and the Wild may want him to get his game in order in the minors. Of course, with Jonas Brodin hurt, the Wild will need to tap into an extra defenseman and Hunt was their top recall candidate. — Michael Russo, Wild beat reporter Wild coach John Hynes has said since the start of training camp that Hunt was ready for the NHL. They just couldn’t get him in the lineup because of seven defensemen on NHL contracts ahead of him. He played one game earlier this season. He’s a smart, mobile, left-shot defenseman with size. Advertisement On Nov. 13, Hunt told The Athletic, “I want to be in the NHL, simple as that. But everyone’s path is different, and right now mine is to be in the American League. Time will tell, but I’m hoping someday I’ll be here full-time. But right now everybody’s playing well and the team’s winning, which is great to see.” — Michael Russo, Wild beat reporter Hunt played 12 games last season for the Wild with one assist.   (Photo: Patrick Smith / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,F1 Qatar GP preview: Can Ferrari stave off McLaren’s title bid another week?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5958639/2024/11/30/f1-qatar-gp-preview-mclaren-ferrari-championship/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 22:20:40 GMT",McLaren could be celebrating its first constructors’ championship in almost three decades — but a few rivals stand in the way.,"Formula 1 LUSAIL, Qatar — One week after clinching his fourth Formula One world championship in Las Vegas, Max Verstappen reminded his rivals why he is so hard to beat. After toiling to eighth place in the Qatar sprint race earlier in the day, unable to even catch the Haas of Nico Hülkenberg, Verstappen roared back in qualifying by taking his first pole position since the Austrian Grand Prix in June. Advertisement But three hours after the conclusion of qualifying, the stewards announced that Verstappen had received a one-place grid penalty for driving unnecessarily on a cool-down in qualifying, dropping him to P2 and giving pole to George Russell. Both Russell and Verstappen managed to leapfrog the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, who, after sealing a 1-2 finish in the sprint, would surely have been giving thought to a potential constructors’ championship victory in Qatar. McLaren needs to outscore Ferrari by 15 points on Sunday to secure its first teams’ title since 1998, making the grid spots from third to seventh — Lewis Hamilton is the interloper in the second Mercedes — important to follow when the lights go out. This year’s Qatar race promises to be very different from 2023 when skyrocketing temperatures and limited stint lengths led to one of the most physically challenging events in F1 history. If anything, the weekend thus far has felt cool due to the breezy conditions, which, combined with no repeat of last year’s tire issues, should make for a more ‘normal’ race, even if Qatar’s high-speed layout will put a toll on the drivers’ bodies. Here are the key storylines to watch out for in Sunday’s Qatar Grand Prix. By this time tomorrow, McLaren could be celebrating its first constructors’ championship in almost three decades. It’s been a long title drought for the Woking-based team, and that same year, Mika Häkkinen and David Coulthard led the team to victory over Ferrari. But to secure the title in Qatar, McLaren would need a 45-point lead over second-place Ferrari. It entered the weekend with a 24-point lead, and with a 1-2 finish in the sprint race, Piastri and Norris extended the gap to 30 points. McLaren needs to outscore Ferrari by 15 points in the Qatar Grand Prix, or else the battle will rage on to the season finale in Abu Dhabi. Advertisement Piastri and Norris already have an edge over Ferrari’s duo. They may not have continued the fast pace from earlier on Saturday, but they secured a McLaren second-row lockout while Leclerc will line up in P5 and Sainz in P7, split by Hamilton. Q3 wasn’t particularly smooth for Norris, who really was in charge of the sprint race. The Briton said he made a mistake on his first push lap, dipping his wheel into the gravel. He ended up in dirty air, and it wasn’t a stellar lap. Though, as he pointed out, it was his “first mistake really of all of the qualifying and the whole weekend so far.” The second push lap of Q3 was one he felt “pretty happy” about as “I feel like I got everything out of it.” Piastri echoed a similar feeling. “I was happy with the lap that I did. I don’t think there was much left on the table at all.” One big push to come on Sunday! 🙌#QatarGP 🇶🇦 pic.twitter.com/OjOsj3ZCUc — McLaren (@McLarenF1) November 30, 2024  There have been a number of weekends recently where McLaren was the fastest car, but Norris does not believe that is the case in Qatar. “I think the clean air that I had earlier today made us look probably a bit better than we were. I don’t think we’ve necessarily been the quickest, to be honest, this weekend – I think Mercedes have, so (I’m) expecting a tough battle and excited to see what we can do,” he said. “I would like to give the guys ahead a little battle tomorrow and, of course, go forward. Our target would be to try and win the race, but these two guys (are) probably going to make my life pretty tough tomorrow.” Piastri acknowledged one of this track’s unique elements: “Whatever your qualifying pace is is pretty much your race pace as well because of the nature of the track and how much you can push.” The best way to take care of the battle with Ferrari, though, is to win, he said. Advertisement Ferrari always anticipated struggling in Qatar against McLaren, given how the high-speed layout would suit the papaya cars. The 1-2 finish for Piastri and Norris in the sprint seemed to confirm those fears, turning the screw on Ferrari in the constructors’ fight. McLaren remained a step ahead of Ferrari through qualifying, but the step forward from Verstappen and Russell limited Norris and Piastri to the second row. If the cars finish tomorrow in the same positions as they qualified, then Ferrari will keep the title fight alive to Abu Dhabi. But Charles Leclerc, the lead Ferrari in P5, knew the team needed more to seriously stand a chance of the championship. “If we want to win the constructors’, we’ve got to finish in front this weekend,” Leclerc said. “We cannot afford to just take the points available. We need to overperform in order to target the constructors. Tomorrow, we’ve got to do something special in order to gain some points on them.” Leclerc admitted that Ferrari was closer to McLaren than expected in Qatar, giving him and teammate Carlos Sainz some hope they could get in the fight. The difficulty in overtaking at the Lusail track will make a good start vital, but the surprise surge from Red Bull and Mercedes might actually help Ferrari. “It depends (on) the way you see it,” Leclerc said. “Because if tomorrow we overtake (the McLarens) at the start, then I wish the two in front were not there. If we stay behind at the start, then I’m happy if they can keep the first and second place.” Ferrari knows the odds are stacked against it in the constructors’ race. But there’ll be a sliver of added hope post-qualifying compared to post-sprint when it did look like McLaren could sweep the weekend and wrap things up in dominant fashion. It’s rare to hear Verstappen celebrate a pole position with quite as much vigor as he did on Saturday night in Qatar. Given that he opened the year with seven poles in a row and had already clinched the championship, the result may not seem like a big deal. But it was clear from his expletive-filled radio call back to the Red Bull pit wall just how much it meant to Verstappen. After struggling through the sprint race, losing places on the opening lap due to snaps of oversteer and then limping home in eighth place for a solitary point, Verstappen was not expected to be a factor in the fight for pole. Advertisement Until he was. Red Bull made a series of changes to the setup of its RB20 car in response to the sprint race stuggles, believing it could unlock more pace, but it also required Verstappen to turn in the kind of impressive performance that has made him a four-time world champion. “Honestly, I didn’t expect that,” Verstappen admitted after qualifying, even joking that “a miracle happened” for him to (temporarily) get pole. The added stability that Verstappen felt with his car, which he described as more “connected,” allowed him to really throw it into the high-speed corners. Verstappen has been trying to combat balance issues with his car for much of this year. Even if the title is already wrapped up, learning how to cure those problems will be valuable for next year. You have to go back to the Spanish Grand Prix in June for the last time that Verstappen won a race in the dry (he executed his comeback from 17th on the grid in Brazil in the wet). While there’ll be obvious pressure from Mercedes, McLaren and potentially even Ferrari in Qatar, and an extra place to make up after his penalty, the Dutchman will know this is an excellent chance to give a late, unexpected confidence boost to his latest championship year. He admitted the long-run pace of the Red Bull was “still a bit of a question mark,” given how much he struggled in the sprint. “This is great, to be on pole, but I’m not sure yet if it’s going to be enough to really be the outright fastest,” Verstappen said. “We’ll find out tomorrow.” At the end of a season that increasingly looked like a write-off for Mercedes as it dwindled toward its lowest constructors’ championship finish since 2012, this final triple-header has become increasingly fruitful. Russell qualified P2 for the sprint and finished third, believing he only failed to beat Piastri thanks to McLaren’s team DRS tactics. He kept up the impressive pace by grabbing second place on the grid for Sunday’s grand prix before his late promotion to P1, giving him back-to-back pole positions. Mercedes’ pace in Qatar is not a total shock. The W15 car has always performed better in cooler conditions and on a smoother track, as the 1-2 proved last week in Las Vegas, setting things up nicely for Russell. Advertisement “It’s just great to be in this groove at the moment for front row starts, which has been really pleasing considering where we were three or four races ago,” Russell said. “The race pace this morning looked great. Max did a great job. Red Bull seemed to turn it around a little bit since yesterday, but let’s see what tomorrow brings.” Teammate Hamilton has endured a tougher time lately and again trailed Russell by half a second in qualifying as he slipped to P6. Hamilton said after sprint qualifying on Friday that he was “definitely not fast anymore,” but after qualifying, he appeared to hook that assertion more on his car not responding as he wanted, saying: “I know I’ve still got it.” Russell anticipates a close fight against Red Bull, Ferrari and McLaren in Qatar, but Mercedes has every reason to feel confident off the back of its Vegas success. All eyes may be on the battle between McLaren and Ferrari, but the tighter fight is at P6, where six points cover Haas, Alpine and RB after the sprint race. Out of that group, Haas’ Kevin Magnussen was the only driver to advance to Q3, qualifying 10th. But it is a prime spot because DRS trains can easily form. Alpine’s Pierre Gasly, though, isn’t far off after qualifying 11th, just 0.012 seconds from the cutoff. It’ll come down to who has the stronger long-run pace. Haas’ was notable during the sprint race, with Hülkenberg scoring two points, but Magnussen noted to F1 TV that Gasly’s race pace was quick as well. On Friday, RB team boss Laurent Mekies described it as “a crazy intense battle.” “Of course, it gets a bit less interest compared to what’s happening at the very top. But to have three teams after 22 races separated by four points, it’s very much, you work all these years as mechanics, as engineers, as staff to be involved in this sort of battle. That’s why you love the sport,” Mekies continued. “So I think it’s great for the team to be part of that. It’s pushing us to improve. It’s pushing us to learn, sometimes in a hard way. But it’s a great battle to be involved in.” Advertisement The P6 battle likely won’t be decided in Qatar, but it shows the improvement rate and notable car development trajectory from all three teams. They’ve had their difficult spells and standout moments — some bigger than others, like Alpine’s double podium in Brazil. “We all have a car that is able to produce a top 10,” Mekies said. “So, you know, everybody has been trying to develop their cars throughout the whole seasons, and the fact that at the very end of that, we have a car that is able to fight for P10 is a good sign. “So I don’t know how it will finish in Abu Dhabi, but for sure, in terms of the team growing through that battle, it was extremely helpful.” Top photos of Carlos Sainz, Charles Leclerc and Lando Norris: SIPA USA"

The Dutchman received a one-place grid drop for driving “unnecessarily slowly on a cool-down lap,” according to the stewards’ decision that came a few hours after qualifying ended. In Q3 of qualifying, Verstappen was trying to cool his tires when the incident occurred. Russell had not expected Verstappen to be driving so slowly on the racing line and had to pull up and swerve to avoid a collision. Advertisement “The Stewards regard this case as a complicated one in that clearly Car 1 (Verstappen) did not comply with the Race Director’s Event Notes and clearly was driving, in our determination, unnecessarily slowly considering the circumstances,” the stewards’ decision read. Verstappen will start P2, while Russell starts from pole position. This would have been Verstappen’s first pole position since the Austrian GP in June. This also happened earlier this year when he qualified first in Belgium but had an engine penalty, which dropped him 10 grid positions. George Russell, who initially qualified second, will now line up P1.Qualifying looked rather different than sprint qualifying a day prior. Some drivers who performed solidly and advanced to SQ3 on Friday, like Pierre Gasly, Liam Lawson and Nico Hulkenberg, didn’t have a similar performance on Saturday, as none made Q3. Meanwhile, others like Sergio Pérez struggled during sprint qualifying and the sprint race but advanced to Q3. The competitive picture shifted because the cars were out of parc fermé between the sprint race and qualifying on Saturday. Teams are allowed to make adjustments during this window to the cars’ setups. However, there was some consistency — both McLarens, Ferraris, and Mercedes cars (as well as Verstappen) advanced to Q3. The Dutchman had a surprising qualifying on the hunt for pole throughout. It contrasted his sprint performance, where he finished eighth, and he even commended the team for the turnaround over the radio: “Let’s f—ing go, guys! Well done, what a turnaround. Yes!” As for the papaya, McLaren’s sprint performance didn’t carry over, though they’ll line up ahead of the Ferraris. Verstappen had qualified first at the Belgian Grand Prix in July but took a grid drop penalty for exceeding his engine allowance and didn’t start from pole. All eyes likely will be on Ferrari and McLaren. After Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris finished 1-2 in the sprint race earlier on Saturday, the championship gap between McLaren and Ferrari widened slightly, as the Woking-based crew secured a combined 15 points and the Prancing Horse took nine combined points. It’s a 30-point gap with 88 points remaining this season, and McLaren needs to outscore Ferrari by 15 points during Sunday’s grand prix to secure its first constructors’ championship since 1998.

Advertisement The content included a video, publicly shared by the player, of a sermon given in a Christian worship space talking about how being gay and “feeling transgender” is wrong. When Albert joined the game on Saturday as a substitute in the 73rd minute, she was met by loud boos from the mostly-English crowd.  GO DEEPER USWNT's Korbin Albert apologizes for social media posts after Megan Rapinoe's criticism  “Of course, I understand the booing, and everybody is entitled to their opinions on it,” Hayes said after the 0-0 draw at Wembley Stadium, London, on Saturday evening. “My job is not to weigh in on the debate, my job as a football coach is to produce a football team. And like I always do, I’ve sat down with Korbin, I’ve had several conversations with her to make sure that self-development piece is there. Hayes has said multiple times that Albert has done work following the incidents earlier this year, but the coach and player have not elaborated when asked previously by The Athletic. “No one is going to enjoy (being booed), but you have to appreciate that there is a community that support our team, and everybody wants to feel that we create an environment that is inclusive, respectful, and tolerant, which I do. “But I cannot control what happens outside our environment, and I’m sure when the moment comes and Korbin is asked about it, then it’s for her to address, not for me, but I totally appreciate the fans doing that, and they’re entitled to do that.” It is not the first time Albert has been booed in recent months. During the USWNT’s 4-0 win over South Korea in June, the Paris Saint Germain midfielder was met with boos from the Commerce City crowd as she appeared as a 71st-minute substitute. Retired USWNT midfielder Megan Rapinoe responded strongly to the content reposted by Albert. “Wake TF up,” Rapinoe wrote in part in an Instagram story on her personal account, addressing the note to “the people who want to hide behind ‘my beliefs’” and saying that “all you believe in is hate.” Advertisement Albert posted an apology to her Instagram account in March. “I want to sincerely apologize for my actions on social media,” she wrote in part. “Liking and sharing posts that are offensive, insensitive, and hurtful was immature and disrespectful which was never my intent.” GO DEEPER USWNT coach on Korbin Albert: 'I think she’s had a really, really tough time' (Photo: Alex Broadway/USSF/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

They have fired coach Jim Montgomery. Elias Lindholm and Nikita Zadorov, their primary offseason signings, are improving but have yet to reach their thresholds. They are coming off a 2-1 loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins, whose minus-32 goal differential is the worst in the league. “We’re a .500 club right now,” Jacobs said on Saturday ahead of the Bruins’ centennial game on Sunday against the Montreal Canadiens. “I think we’ve yet to play our best game.” The Bruins are 3-2-0 under interim coach Joe Sacco. Jeremy Swayman, who missed all of training camp before signing an eight-year, $66 million contract, has a .943 save percentage in his three starts following Montgomery’s dismissal. Swayman has an .892 save percentage over 17 appearances. Meanwhile, David Pastrnak is stuck in a seven-game goal-scoring drought for the second time this season. The Bruins have scored on 12 percent of their power plays, second-lowest in the league. “Being a captain and a player of this historic team means embracing what it means to wear the spoked B,” Brad Marchand said during a Saturday speech unveiling the franchise’s centennial bear statue next to TD Garden. “It means playing with that same spirit every night. Showing up in the toughest moments and leading by example, especially when times are tough.” “Tomorrow, it will officially be a year,” Jacobs said of the organization’s centennial celebration. “It’s going to be something.

Malzahn, 59, went 28-24 with the Knights, but after two nine-win seasons in the AAC, UCF fell to 10-15 in its first two years in the Big 12. Advertisement UCF finished 4-8 in 2024, ending the season with a 28-14 loss at home to Utah on Friday. Malzahn and Florida State coach Mike Norvell have known each other for almost 20 years. Malzahn was the offensive coordinator at Tulsa when he heard about Norvell through a friend. Malzahn hired Norvell — then a graduate assistant at Central Arkansas — as a GA with the Golden Hurricane before the 2007 season. Norvell rose the ranks after Malzahn left to become an assistant at Auburn. Malzahn will be taking over a Florida State offense that heads into its season-finale against Florida ranked 131st nationally in both yards per game and points per game. Malzahn is 105-62 in 13 seasons as an FBS head coach with one season at Arkansas State and eight at Auburn. The Arkansas native went 68-35 at Auburn, with a BCS championship game appearance in 2013, his first season as head coach. He never had a losing record there and went 3-5 against Nick Saban and Alabama in the Iron Bowl, but he was fired after the 2020 season, with the school paying a then-record $21.5 million buyout to get rid of him. Malzahn was also a successful offensive coordinator in the SEC, first at Arkansas and then at Auburn, helping Cam Newton and the Tigers win a national title in 2010. UCF athletic director Terry Mohajir swooped in soon after Auburn let Malzahn go and brought him to Orlando, a splashy move to replace Josh Heupel after he left for Tennessee. Malzahn seemed invigorated by the new challenge. He bought into the branding — and underlying idea — that UCF was the future of college football as a growing program in the center of one of the nation’s biggest football states. Malzahn’s 2024 recruiting class was the best in program history, finishing 39th in the 247Sports Composite. His staff fended off one of the in-state powers, Florida, to sign defensive lineman John Walker, the nation’s No. 95 overall prospect and the top recruit in program history. Advertisement But even during two seasons in the AAC, UCF failed to meet the elevated expectations of a program that went to back-to-back New Year’s Six Bowls in 2017 and 2018 under Scott Frost and Heupel. The Knights went 18-9 his first two seasons, losing the American title game in 2021 before beating Florida in the Gasparilla Bowl. All three former AAC schools, including Houston and Cincinnati, have struggled since entering the Big 12. UCF had the best first season by reaching a bowl game. But the Knights had one of the season’s biggest collapses when they blew a 28-point second-half lead to Baylor in their first conference home game in the Big 12. Year 2 was expected to bring success — or at least solid results — with Arkansas transfer KJ Jefferson a promising match for Malzahn’s offense. Instead, it brought a carousel at quarterback, a midseason firing of defensive coordinator Ted Roof, Malzahn handing off play-calling duties to offensive coordinator Tim Harris and several close losses that could have flipped the season. UCF issued the following statement Saturday: “We would like to thank coach Malzahn for his contributions to our football program over the past four seasons, including our transition into the Big 12 Conference. We appreciate his professionalism and dedication to our student-athletes throughout his tenure at UCF and wish he and his wife, Kristi, the very best in their future endeavors.” Malzahn had three years left on a contract that would have paid him about $5.5 million annually.

Dobbins (knee) and safety Alohi Gilman (hamstring) on injured reserve Saturday ahead of their Week 13 game at the Atlanta Falcons. Dobbins and Gilman, two starters, were both injured in Monday night’s loss to the Baltimore Ravens. Dobbins was tackled awkwardly with about five minutes remaining in the second quarter. He did not return. Advertisement The running back was having a resurgent 2024, making a case for NFL Comeback Player of the Year after missing most of the past three seasons with two significant lower-extremity injuries. Dobbins leads the Chargers in rushing yards (766) and touchdowns (eight). He had emerged very clearly as the Chargers’ best back. Now coach Jim Harbaugh will have to move further down the depth chart at running back. Gus Edwards is next in line. But this could be a big opportunity for rookie Kimani Vidal, who has only been active for four games this season. Vidal got his debut regular season NFL action in Week 6 when he caught a touchdown pass on his first career touch. Edwards is a physical back. Vidal could provide an ideal change of pace with Dobbins out. Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

Gilman missed the tackle, and Hill scored a 51-yard touchdown that put the game away. Gilman’s absence will have a substantial impact on the defense. With Gilman and Elijah Molden at safety, the Chargers and defensive coordinator Jesse Minter could move Derwin James Jr. around frequently, most notably to the nickel position. Now James will be forced to play more at safety. The Chargers lost their fourth safety, AJ Finley, earlier this week when they waived him and he was claimed by the Seattle Seahawks. They claimed Marcus Maye off waivers from the Miami Dolphins on Wednesday. The Chargers also signed veteran safety Tony Jefferson to the active roster as part of Saturday’s moves.

Since his arrival in Morgantown in 2019, Brown has helped the team to a 37-35 overall record but is 25-28 in the Big 12 over that span. West Virginia (6-6 overall) reached bowl eligibility — its fourth time doing so in Brown’s six seasons — with its sixth victory against UCF on Nov. 23, but none of the teams the Mountaineers triumphed over won more than five games heading into the final weekend of the regular season. Advertisement On Saturday, Texas Tech (8-4) outscored West Virginia in every quarter, peaking with a 29-0 second frame. That makes 10 of 12 games this season in which the Mountaineers were outscored in the final half, per the AP. The Mountaineers finished 5-4 in the Big 12. Brown is no stranger to the hot seat. He coached his way off of it in 2023, leading West Virginia to a 9-4 rebound and a Duke’s Mayo Bowl victory after being picked last in the Big 12 preseason media poll. In March he signed a one-year contract extension through 2027 and took a voluntary pay cut, forgoing $400,000 in salary increases over the next three years of the contract and electing to reinvest that money in his staff. Brown earned $4 million in salary in 2024. More than $700,000 was added to the staff salary pool between the pay cut and an additional increase from the university. Athletic director Wren Baker did not hire Brown, but Baker opted for patience when he took the job in November 2022, choosing to retain Brown despite back-to-back losing seasons. That patience was rewarded in 2023, so it will be curious to see Baker’s approach this time. Brown’s amended buyout stipulates that he’s owed 75 percent of his remaining salary if fired, which would be north of $9.5 million if let go after this season. Along with additional staff buyouts, that’s a steep price for West Virginia to pay with the impending House settlement and $20-plus-million in annual revenue sharing on the horizon. WVU athletics had a total operating revenue of $106 million in fiscal year 2023, which ranked in the bottom half of the Big 12. But in a newly wide-open conference and expanded College Football Playoff, there could be enough pressure to make a change after failing to finish better than .500 in the regular season for the third time in four years. — Justin Williams, staff writer, college football (Photo: Chris Coduto / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

GO DEEPER How Michigan stunned No. 2 Ohio State for fourth rivalry win in a row: Key takeaways As the two teams congregated at midfield after the game, a group of Wolverines attempted to plant a Michigan flag at midfield. Ohio State players tried to break up the celebration and the heated exchange evolved into a brawl. At one point, Ohio State defensive end Jack Sawyer ripped the flag away from a Michigan player and threw it to the turf. A fight has broken out between Michigan and Ohio State after The Game pic.twitter.com/XPwdAjfYzN — FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) November 30, 2024  Police and team staff stepped in to break up the fight. In the process, some players were seen on the ground rubbing their faces after coming into contact with pepper spray. “Following the game, officers from multiple law enforcement agencies assisted in breaking up an on-field altercation,” Ohio State University police said in a statement. “During the scuffle, multiple officers representing Ohio and Michigan deployed pepper spray. OSUPD is the lead agency for games & will continue to investigate.” Players and coaches from Michigan and Ohio State had differing viewpoints on the fracas. “For such a great game, you hate to see stuff like that after the game. That’s just bad for the sport, bad for college football, but at the end of the day, they’ve got to learn how to lose, man,” Michigan running back Kalel Mullings said in a postgame interview with Fox. Advertisement “You can’t be fighting and stuff just because you lost a game. All that fighting, we had 60 minutes, we had four quarters to do all that fighting. And now people want to talk and fight. That’s wrong. That’s just bad for the game. Classless, in my opinion. And people got to be better.” Buckeyes coach Ryan Day said his players were defending home turf. “I don’t know all the details of it, but I know that these guys are looking to put a flag on our field and our guys weren’t going to let that happen,” Day said. The loss — Ohio State’s fourth in a row to Michigan — is likely to cost the Buckeyes (10-2 overall, 7-2 Big Ten) a spot in the conference title game. No. 1 Oregon already clinched its place in the championship, and No. 4 Penn State will earn the second spot with a win over Maryland on Saturday. The Buckeyes still have more than a 99 percent chance of making the College Football Playoff and now have a 92 percent chance of hosting a first-round game, according to The Athletic’s Austin Mock. Michigan (7-5, 5-4) and Ohio State were tied at 10 for the entirety of the second half until the final minute of the fourth quarter, when Michigan kicker Dominic Zvada hit a 21-yard field goal to give the Wolverines the three-point pad. Ohio State failed to gain more than a yard on its next drive, turning the ball over on downs and giving Michigan its 62nd series victory. “We’re going to win in your house and we’re gonna plant the flag,” Michigan quarterback Davis Warren said. “You should’ve done something about it.” The planting of the flag is no novice tradition in college football, especially between these two teams. In 2022, after Michigan captured its first victory at Ohio Stadium since 2000 — a 45-23 win over the then-top-ranked Buckeyes — the team also mounted its “M” over the “O” logo at Ohio State’s midfield. That flag was later placed on display in the Towsley Museum lobby inside Michigan’s Schembechler Hall. Infamously, former Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield planted the OU flag over the “O” emblem in 2017, when the Sooners upset the Buckeyes 31-16. Mayfield even ran a victory lap with the flag before stabbing it into the ground, though the Ohio State team had already departed for the locker room. Mayfield said at the time that his and his teammates’ reaction to the 2017 upset was in part because it was “embarassing” to hear the Ohio State players sing their fight song on the Sooners’ field after a 45-24 drubbing the year before. Advertisement With roughly two minutes remaining in the game, several dozen law enforcement officers on bicycles assembled in the end zone as part of the postgame procedure. Michigan players and coach Sherrone Moore were going back and forth with Ohio State fans behind the Michigan bench in the closing seconds, and there was a big celebration on the field with water being sprayed once the clock hit zero. While Moore did his postgame interview on Fox, one group of Michigan players ran to the end zone to celebrate with fans and another gathered at midfield to plant the flag, just as they did after their victory against the Buckeyes in 2022. Shoving broke out as players were in the process of planting the flag, and a chaotic scene ensued with some staff members rushing in to break up the fight and others running away. The fight appeared to be under control, but then it flared up again. At that point law enforcement officers were involved in separating the teams, and at least one Ohio State fan was being handcuffed on the field. I noticed a strong chemical taste when I got closer to the center of the altercation, and a reporter walked away from the scene rubbing her eyes and saying she couldn’t see. Michigan players said several of their teammates were sprayed with mace as well. At that point, Moore and other Michigan staff members were trying to hold back players and direct them toward one of the end zones. The law enforcement officers formed a line with their bikes at midfield to separate the teams and players gradually cleared the field.

It’s the Wolverines’ fourth consecutive win against Ohio State, their longest winning streak in the series since 1988-91. After Michigan finished off the win by stopping Ohio State’s final possession, members of the two teams got into a lengthy postgame altercation. A fight has broken out between Michigan and Ohio State after The Game pic.twitter.com/XPwdAjfYzN — FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) November 30, 2024  The loss is likely to cost Ohio State (10-2, 7-2 Big Ten) a spot in the Big Ten title game, as No. 4 Penn State can now advance to Indianapolis to meet No. 1 Oregon with a win against Maryland on Saturday. If the Nittany Lions lose, No. 10 Indiana would get the nod with a win over Purdue. With a Big Ten title a long shot, Ohio State would thus be left fighting for an at-large bid in the 12-team College Football Playoff. According to The Athletic’s projections model, Ohio State still has a 99 percent chance to make the Playoff after Saturday’s game, with a 92 percent chance to host a game, though that could be dependent on other Rivalry Week and conference championship game results. Advertisement Ohio State was a 21-point favorite entering the game against the Wolverines (7-5, 5-4), who have struggled much of their first season under new coach Sherrone Moore following last year’s national championship. But despite finishing with just 235 total yards, Michigan shocked Ohio State on Saturday thanks to stout defensive play and several Buckeyes miscues, including a pair of missed field goals and two interceptions thrown by Will Howard. Michigan’s winning drive covered 57 yards in 11 plays, with an illegal substitution penalty on Ohio State allowing it to convert a key third down at the 9-yard line to run more clock and set up Zvada’s field goal. Ohio State’s second-half drives resulted in a punt in Michigan territory, an interception, a missed field goal, a three-and-out and the final turnover on downs, as it gained only 1 yard in four plays with the game on the line. Ohio State’s 10 points were its fewest against an unranked opponent since 2011. The loss ended a 47-game winning streak against unranked teams dating back to 2018 against Purdue, making it the Buckeyes’ first loss to a team outside the AP Top 25 under coach Ryan Day. GO DEEPER Michigan, Ohio State players and police involved in postgame fight after shocking upset Here are some immediate takeaways from Michigan’s upset win: In Michigan’s past three victories against Ohio State, these teams were on relatively equal footing. The Wolverines beat Ohio State last year with a senior-laden team that was on its way to the national championship. This year, with Michigan rebuilding and Ohio State boasting one of the most talented rosters in college football, the Buckeyes were supposed to get their payback. If it wasn’t clear before, it’s obvious now: Michigan has a massive psychological edge on Ohio State. These games bring out the best in Michigan and the absolute worst in Ohio State. For this Michigan team, which lost five games, to beat this Ohio State team as a three-touchdown underdog is one of the biggest upsets in the history of the series. For Moore, Michigan’s first-year head coach, this is a signature win that transforms this season from a disappointment to year that will be remembered for how it finished. — Austin Meek, Michigan beat writer Dominic Zvada connects to give Michigan the late lead at No. 2 Ohio State 🙌#B1GFootball on @CFBONFOX 📺 pic.twitter.com/GfQzAmv2pO — Big Ten Network (@BigTenNetwork) November 30, 2024  Ohio State’s offensive line injuries have been a problem all season. The Buckeyes are missing starting left tackle Josh Simmons and center Seth McLaughlin, and their reshuffled unit gave them no chance to run on the Michigan defensive line. Ohio State ran for just 77 yards, averaging three yards per carry. Despite the struggles between the tackles, it stuck with the run thinking it would tire out the Michigan defensive front. Michigan never wore down, though, and it made Ohio State one-dimensional. Yet again, the Wolverines won the matchup in the trenches with superior physicality. Advertisement The acclaimed running back duo of Ole Miss transfer Quinshon Judkins and TreVeyon Henderson combined for 67 yards, and Howard didn’t add much more on the ground, finishing with just 10 yards. Michigan’s biggest advantage in the game was always going to be on the defensive line. If it was going to win or at least keep it close, it had to dominate up front. It did just that. With the run game taken away, Ohio State had to rely on Howard, and he had one of his worst games of the season, throwing two interceptions and completing just 19 of 33 passes for 175 yards. — Cameron Teague Robinson, Ohio State beat writer One of the few advantages Michigan had coming into the game was on special teams, and in a close game it made a huge difference. Ohio State twice started drives inside its 10 because of failure to properly field a kick, the first a punt and the second the second-half kickoff. Add in a short punt by Ohio State that put Michigan in range for a 54-yard field goal from Zvada in the second quarter and Buckeyes kicker Jayden Fielding missing kicks of 34 and 38 yards, and the Wolverines dominated that part of the game. Add to the special teams gaffes, two interceptions by Howard — one that set up the only Michigan touchdown and another in the red zone that might have cost the Buckeyes points — and Ohio State did all it could to give Michigan its best chance to win. — Ralph Russo, national college football writer ""You hate to see stuff like that after the game. It's just bad for the sport, bad for CFB… They gotta learn how to lose man. You can't be fighting.""@JennyTaft speaks with Michigan's Kalel Mullings after a fight broke out between Ohio State and Michigan after the game ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/z6rmxu2YJQ — FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) November 30, 2024  The strangest time in the history of Ohio State football has arrived. Day and the Buckeyes did not complete the mission. They have now lost four in a row against Michigan, the latest as a three-touchdown home favorite with a trip to the Big Ten championship game on the line against the worst team the Wolverines have fielded since the pandemic. Advertisement Ohio State has no more games on its schedule, but the Buckeyes’ season is not over. They lost the game they absolutely could not lose. And yet, the national championship is still on the table. In 2022, the second game of the streak, Ohio State got a reprieve after losing The Game and still made the four-team Playoff. C.J. Stroud then nearly led the Buckeyes to a semifinal victory against Georgia. With seven at-large spots available in this Playoff and contenders get dinged left and right, there’s still likely to be room for Ohio State now, as it is 10-2 and owns a pair of wins against top-10 Penn State and Indiana teams. So what now for the Buckeyes? A nervous week of hoping to get into the dance, while fans crush Day for falling to 1-4 against Michigan. This was supposed to be the team that not only got over the Michigan hump, but won the Big Ten. Instead, it faltered under the pressure of the rivalry game again. Day will find some way to explain it, but after four straight losses, the Buckeyes still haven’t closed the gap physically with Michigan, even at its worst. Do Buckeyes fans even want their team to make the Playoff? It’s impossible to know how the selection committee will sort things out with so many impactful games still to play. Maybe the Buckeyes get squeezed out depending on how things shake out in the SEC and ACC. But more likely, the Buckeyes will spend this week agonizing over what could have been and hoping for another shot at redemption. At this point, maybe only a national title will do it for Day. — Russo This story will be updated. (Top photo of Sherrone Moore: Jason Mowry / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"England 0, USWNT 0 takeaways: New-look front three offer promise, if not goals",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5958233/2024/11/30/england-0-uswnt-0-takeaways/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 19:38:25 GMT","The USWNT duked out a rather tepid 0-0 game against England at Wembley in front of 78,346 fans - but what can they really learn from it?","The United States duked out a rather tepid 0-0 game against England at Wembley in front of 78,346 fans. The U.S. women’s national team looked like a team of players mostly out of season and preparing to hunker down for some time off. There were flashes of excitement; after all, this is a roster minus quite a few usual starters, and it’s always nice to see a first cap, as Ally Sentnor earned hers on Saturday.  Advertisement There was also no denying the atmosphere. The sight of Geri Horner — “Ginger Spice” — in the Wembley VIP box and Michele Kang on punditry duty was evidence of the irresistible intrigue surrounding this fixture. But it was 10 minutes before kick-off, as the Wembley Stadium announcer promised “something never been seen”, that the USA’s arrival in England felt fiercest. Lights dimmed and a technicolor EDM-concert-meets-Super-Bowl-Sunday strobe light and fireworks show followed, culminating in plumes of red smoke for the players to walk out under.  It was pre-match pageantry appropriate for the billing, though the first-half display made hard work for the crowd. Optimistic chants of ‘USA! USA!’ were met duly by English boos, as was the arrival of midfielder Korbin Albert in the 72nd minute. A better second-half performance from both sides inspired a more Wembley-appropriate atmosphere from the 78,000-plus in attendance. As for what happened on the pitch, Steph Yang, Meg Linehan and Charlotte Harpur analyze the key points.  The USWNT was without its usual starting front three of Mallory Swanson, Trinity Rodman, and Sophia Smith. Head coach Emma Hayes started Alyssa Thompson, Lynn Williams, and Emma Sears, with Thompson and Sears part of the younger and more inexperienced player pool that is getting a rollout in this info-gathering era between major tournaments.  The inexperience of the front three starting against England, both in terms of playing time and time spent playing together, showed in the way the forwards weren’t able to convert their entries into the final third into better chances on goal. The best U.S. chances in the first half were outside looks, including ones from Thompson, Casey Krueger and Sam Coffey. Understanding that the purpose of these games is to season younger players and evaluate the next generation of starters, it was good to see both Sears and Thompson play the wings. Watching Thompson navigate frequent one-v-one duels with the older and somewhat more tired-looking England fullback Lucy Bronze posits a fun problem for the near future: where to put Thompson amidst the dominance of her preferred starting wingers. As for Sears, she was less robust than Thompson in her duels but was still a handful, either pulling wide herself or cutting inside off of Emily Fox coming from deep. Advertisement Yazmeen Ryan was substituted on for Sears at the start of the second half, and Ally Sentnor got her first senior appearance, coming on in the 88th minute for Lindsey Horan. Both players, especially Ryan, have patiently improved their stock in NWSL while searching for a place on this team. Ryan was asked to play both forward and midfield, eventually dropping deeper underneath Horan. Jaedyn Shaw also came on, replacing Williams in the 73rd minute, and took advantage of her ability to navigate the space between forward and midfield. All of these players are part of a bigger question for Hayes, who has a delightful problem in perhaps having too many attacking options. Do you ask all these players to try to add to their toolboxes and risk playing them in second-best positions, or do you resign yourself to just having a really, really, ridiculously good bench?  — Steph Yang Called-back goal notwithstanding, Horan’s presence in the game was marred by a lot of time on the ground. It’s natural for a central player as involved as Horan to get targeted, but she also toppled over a few times seemingly disproportionate to the actual force applied. Without trying to read too much into it, that’s commonly a symptom of a player who’s a little bit out of ideas.  To be fair, Horan was trying to enable some unfamiliar players, but she knows Williams well enough and that connection wasn’t there either, nor was Horan a good outlet for Coffey or Rose Lavelle. The weight of her through balls was lacking and shifting her higher in the second half didn’t really pull England’s defense out of shape. We got a glimpse of Shaw playing that role deeper in the midfield while Horan pushed high; Shaw was a good companion to Lavelle, pushed higher on the right. Lavelle and Krueger kept trying to aim for Horan’s head in front of goal — not necessarily the worst plan based on history, but one that wasn’t close to working on the night. Advertisement With a better central target for their efforts — perhaps Sentnor, given more time to settle in, or Shaw, pushed higher into the 9 again after Horan’s substitution — there was definitely more the U.S. could have found in front of the goal. — Steph Yang For a friendly, it does not get much bigger than England versus the U.S. in front of 78,346 fans. Such occasions are where England goalkeeper Mary Earps thrives. She has a presence that commands authority and soaks up the pressure. Head coach Sarina Wiegman chose Hannah Hampton for the previous big Wembley occasion against Germany in October, hinting to Earps that there was uncertainty surrounding her No. 1 status. Following her move from Manchester United to Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2023, it took Earps some time to settle into France’s domestic league. Everything was new: coach, training, routines, culture and language. Now that she feels more at home at the club it shows on the pitch for her country. With a commanding save, she denied Thompson in the fifth minute and later parried Williams’ shot wide to stop Hayes’ side again. She made other shots look comfortable thanks to her positioning while she was dextrous with her feet, at one point skilfully rounding Shaw far outside her box. Earps’ biggest strengths are her communication and organization of her defense. Wiegman will be pleased with her performance, but it gives the England manager an ongoing selection headache looking ahead to the 2025 European Championships. — Charlotte Harpur This friendly won’t make the list of instant classics by any stretch and largely reflects where the USWNT is following the conclusion of one cycle and the start of another. It feels like a very long time until the 2027 World Cup, and even 2026’s World Cup qualifiers.  Advertisement Younger players like Thompson, Sears and Ryan experienced the Wembley atmosphere, and hopefully got the exact level of development Hayes was hoping for out of a big-game environment — with Ryan in particular impressing in the second half. Naomi Girma looks as solid as ever, and Alyssa Naeher edged one cap closer to the end of her international career without needing to make any major stops. Hayes, meanwhile, managed to sneak a senior team debut in, with Sentnor coming in for Horan in the final moments of the second half. The late waves of pressure from the U.S. were encouraging but remained unfruitful. In the end, Hayes didn’t have to show too many cards at Wembley. A stalemate against England feels like a perfectly acceptable result for November 2024. — Meg Linehan Tuesday, Dec. 3: Netherlands (Bingoal Stadium, Hague, Netherlands), friendly, 2:45 pm ET (Top photo: Alex Broadway/USSF/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Raiders to send video of final play of loss vs. Chiefs to NFL for review,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5958469/2024/11/30/las-vegas-raiders-kansas-city-chiefs-video-review/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 19:35:05 GMT",The Raiders said they heard an official's whistle on the last play of Friday's game that resulted in a fumble and a 19-17 loss.,"NFL Las Vegas Raiders coach Antonio Pierce said Saturday that his team “heard a whistle” on its sideline during the calamitous final play of Friday’s 19-17 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs and will send the NFL video of the play for a review. Such reviews are often a standard process for teams when they disagree with how a play is officiated in hopes the league at least acknowledges a mistake. Advertisement On the final play, center Jackson Powers-Johnson snapped the ball before quarterback Aidan O’Connell was ready. The ball bounced off O’Connell’s chest and was recovered by the Chiefs to secure Kansas City’s victory. Before the fumbled had been recovered, one referee appeared to run in from the Raiders’ sideline and make the signal for a false-start penalty against Las Vegas — but the infraction was changed to an illegal shift. The Raiders players and coaches protested the change because a false start is a dead-ball penalty and they heard one official whistle the play dead, and therefore the fumble wouldn’t have counted. The Raiders fumble it, the Chiefs recover it to seal the game ‼️#LVvsKC on Prime VideoAlso streaming on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/WvNvUONRM5 — NFL (@NFL) November 29, 2024  The Athletic reached out to the NFL after the game to get clarity on the official’s ruling on the play. NFL senior vice president of football and international communications Michael Signora responded via email, saying: “Had the clock been running at the snap, then by rule an illegal shift would convert to a false start. Since the clock was stopped (due to the spike on the second-down play), an illegal shift is a live-ball foul.” The Raiders were at the 32-yard line with 15 seconds left in the game, within range for a potential game-winning field goal — although kicker Daniel Carlson had already missed three field goals on the day. The botched snap makes the Raiders the first team since at least 2000 to turn it over in the final 30 seconds when in field-goal range (35-yard line or closer) and trailing by one or two points, per the Associated Press’ Josh Dubow. The loss is the eighth straight for the 2-10 Raiders. Leading up to the blunder, Las Vegas spiked the ball with 16 seconds left after a 7-yard pass to Ameer Abdullah. Pierce and O’Connell both said the Raiders wanted to run another play — and throw the ball out of bounds — to kill more clock, something they could have done had they simply waited to spike the ball. Instead, O’Connell lined up in shotgun formation and clapped his hands, but it was a signal for his teammates to hurry up and not for Powers-Johnson to snap the ball. Advertisement Asked Saturday morning if he would do anything differently on the sequence at the end of the game, Pierce said, “No.” He added that he sent a text to his players, coaches and other team personnel thanking them for their effort in a tough loss on a short week against one of the best teams in the league.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"West Ham 2 Arsenal 5: Gabriel - king of corners, Saka's record to chase, one warning sign",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5952416/2024/11/30/west-ham-2-arsenal-5-result-premier-league-saka-gabriel/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 19:30:28 GMT",Arsenal beat West Ham 5-2 as they look to put pressure on Liverpool at the top of the Premier League. Here are the big talking points...,"EPL Arsenal switched on the style to dismantle West Ham at the London Stadium in a 5-2 victory that they will hope can reignite their Premier League title hopes. A Gabriel header from a corner after 10 minutes started a sequence of seven goals in the first half. Leandro Trossard and Kai Havertz also scored from open play with Martin Odegaard and Bukayo Saka adding two more goals from the penalty spot. Advertisement An Aaron Wan-Bissaka goal and a wonderful free kick from Emerson reduced the arrears for the home side, but Arsenal cruised to the win in the second half and sit six points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool, who face Manchester City tomorrow. Here Jordan Campbell breaks down the key parts of the Arsenal win. In the opening 10 minutes, it did not look like a game destined to explode into a goal fest as West Ham tried to restrict Arsenal’s possession. But that is why Arsenal’s prowess at set pieces can be so disarming. A Bukayo Saka delivery was glanced into the net by Gabriel, who scored his fourth of the season. It opened the floodgates. It was the 20th time Arsenal have scored the first goal of the game from a corner since Nicolas Jover was appointed as set-piece coach in July 2021. It means 24 per cent of their 83 league victories in that period have started this way. 7 – West Ham v Arsenal is only the fourth Premier League game to see seven goals in the first half alone, after Blackburn v Leeds in September 1997, Bradford v Derby in April 2000, and Reading v Man Utd in December 2012. Crazy. pic.twitter.com/Zji8BguDu6 — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) November 30, 2024  The Brazilian was a doubt after coming off in the 5-1 Champions League win over Sporting CP in midweek — in which he scored another header from a corner — but he recovered to open the scoring and win the penalty that saw Arsenal make it 5-2 after being wiped out by Lukasz Fabianski. He is not only the main target at corners, he is the person the takers confide in before delivering and the chief organiser in the penalty area. Gabriel’s dominance in both boxes is so important to Mikel Arteta’s side. He and centre-back partner William Saliba have played 96 league games together in the last three seasons, establishing themselves as one of the most dominant duos in European football. Advertisement Saliba usually receives more attention as he is smoother on the ball, but the Frenchman’s first century of appearances, a landmark he reached on Tuesday, has been made so much easier by having Gabriel as the aggressor next to him, which is why his substitution at half-time will be a worry — along with Riccardo Calafiori’s removal when he was clutching his groin. It seems that with every game Saka plays, another record appears on the horizon. The next one? The most assists in a single Premier League season. The mark has stood since Thierry Henry recorded 20 in 2002-03. Kevin De Bruyne equalled it in 2019-20 and Saka is already at the halfway mark after just 13 games (just over a third of the season). Cesc Fabregas in 2014-15 (12), Mesut Ozil in 2015-16 (12) and Harry Kane in 2020-21 (11) are the only other players to reach double figures in fewer games. 10 – Bukayo Saka has 10 assists in Arsenal’s 13 Premier League games this term; only Cesc Fàbregas in 2014-15 (12), Mesut Özil in 2015-16 (12), & Harry Kane in 2020-21 (11) have reached 10 assists in fewer of a team’s games from the start of a season in the competition. Platter. pic.twitter.com/9c6T2hvLK6 — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) November 30, 2024  Saka has four goals to his name too. He converted a penalty at the London Stadium but handed the first spot kick over to his captain, Odegaard, despite his slaloming run drawing the foul from Lucas Paqueta. It was Saka’s inch-perfect corner delivery that set up Gabriel for the opener and he caused so many more problems for West Ham. His assists tally is often queried given the percentage that come from set pieces, but his deliveries have become so consistently pinpoint that it is difficult to dilute their credibility. He is not hopefully lobbing a cross into a general area; he is whipping the ball in with a precise velocity and trajectory that lands on a particular forehead (usually that of Gabriel). Advertisement The assists had dried up for a few weeks after he added one in each of the first five games of the season, but Odegaard’s return has him back to his best. The combination for his assist to Leandro Trossard was sublime as he played a give-and-go before squaring it to the Belgian. Many winger may have chosen to shoot themselves but Saka has a record to chase. Just as many West Ham fans had started streaming out of the stadium, Arsenal gave them a reason to stick around. Mikel Arteta’s side were 4-0 up inside 36 minutes and some fans were eyeing up the all-time record for the biggest margin of victory. Four minutes later it was somehow 4-2 and the home crowd sensed anxiety. Bukayo Saka’s penalty in the fifth minute of stoppage time helped quell the growing sense that a sensational comeback might be on the cards, but for 10 minutes there was a complete transformation in the mood and the momentum of the game. Arsenal had completely outplayed the home side and looked capable of scoring as many as they liked. Yet one moment in which Trossard and Calafiori switched off at the back post led to one goal back, and then a brilliant Emerson free kick created a little bit of panic. Mikel Arteta came out of his technical to call for calm, but you could even see the perplexed look on his face. It was similar to how Arsenal’s win over Sporting CP unfolded in midweek: complete dominance followed by a brief drop in level that saw the opposition come alive after looking utterly beaten. Arteta was pleased his team were able to re-establish their control of the game in Portugal, but he made an interesting point about his players’ tendency to let the game drift when ahead. “You cannot speculate,” he said. “We had a period after 39, 40 minutes where we did that and I had to stop it because that’s the tendency that the team wants to do, to control it. We’re not very good at that. Advertisement “Unfortunately, they scored very early in the second half and that created some momentum. We dealt with it really well.” Arsenal again dealt with the setback but it was a warning that when this far ahead, it should be completely stress-free. Speaking to the BBC’s Match of the Day, Arteta said: “We made it crazy. We played so well at the start of the game. We scored three early goals and then they score one immediately after kick-off and then another one — then it was game on. We have to manage the game — we did that really well. The last two games were tricky and to score goals is a big one.” Speaking in the post-match press conference about Gabriel being withdrawn, Arteta said: “It was related to the previous injury that he had in Lisbon. Obviously he did great to be part of that (today’s game), but with that result and still with the niggle that he’s feeling, we decided to take him off.” He also commented on Calafiori being brought off, saying: “Well, he’s been with niggles in the last few weeks. Obviously he had a really serious knee injury. He’s doing really well but we have to manage his minutes, and today we have to do the same.” Wednesday, December 4: Manchester United (H), Premier League, 8.15pm GMT, 3.15pm ET (Top photo: David Price/Arsenal FC via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Iowa's torment of Nebraska continues, 10 years after the words that planted rivalry's seed",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5958432/2024/11/30/iowa-nebraska-rivalry-history-shawn-eichorst/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 19:19:05 GMT","Former Nebraska AD Shawn Eichorst awoke something in Iowa on Nov. 30, 2014 that still carries ramifications for today’s Huskers.","NCAAF The moment the Iowa-Nebraska series became a true football rivalry came not during a game but in an offhanded remark. On Nov. 30, 2014, two days after the Huskers had rallied from a 17-point deficit to beat Iowa 37-34 in overtime, Nebraska athletic director Shawn Eichorst held a news conference to discuss the firing of coach Bo Pelini, who had led the program into an unfortunate state of purgatory of good but not great football. Advertisement Pelini was 67-27 in seven seasons and had won nine or 10 games each year, but his teams had also lost exactly four games each season, and every important game ended in embarrassing defeat. Two weeks before beating Iowa in 2014, Pelini’s vaunted defense gave up 408 rushing yards to Wisconsin’s Melvin Gordon in a 59-24 loss. Huskers faithful aspired to return to their perch atop college football, and Pelini wasn’t the guy to get them there. Eichorst, who was a nondescript administrator until that decision, stepped in front of the cameras and unwittingly launched the pseudo-rivalry between Nebraska and Iowa into a blood feud. When asked whether the Huskers’ comeback gave him pause in his decision to fire Pelini, Eichorst replied, “Our kids showed great character and resiliency in a tough environment, so it did play a factor. But in the final analysis, I had to evaluate where Iowa was.” With those two sentences, Eichorst served his base with a juicy slice of Go Big Red meat. Nebraska fans viewed Iowa in the way they did Kansas or Iowa State or Missouri, programs that were beneath them and their five national championships. The Huskers’ real challenge was to compete with Ohio State and Michigan for Big Ten titles. Beating Iowa was seen as a formality, not an accomplishment. Iowa’s program was at a crossroads at that moment, too. After compiling four top-10 finishes and two Big Ten titles from 2002 to ’09, the Hawkeyes had slipped into mediocrity. From 2010 to ’14, the Hawkeyes went 34-30 overall and 19-21 in Big Ten play. Nebraska joined the Big Ten in 2011, and the teams met every year on Black Friday. The Huskers hadn’t seen the best version of the Hawkeyes, only a different shade of gold from their pals in Colorado. It was at that moment that the two passionate fan bases discovered how much they disliked one another. A decade later, their mutual disdain grows every time Iowa fans gloat after another win. It’s understandable for Nebraska’s proud fan base to hate what Iowa has done to the Huskers. Since the start of the 2015 season, Iowa has an 89-38 overall record, a winning percentage of 70 percent. The Hawkeyes rank fourth among Big Ten teams in victories, behind Ohio State, Michigan and Penn State. Advertisement Nebraska has a 49-69 overall record to sit 11th in the Big Ten in wins (not counting this year’s four new arrivals). The Huskers entered Saturday one win behind Maryland and one ahead of Illinois. Iowa has earned bowl eligibility all 10 years, won three Big Ten West titles, hit double-digit wins four times and won at least eight games in every season. Nebraska has posted one winning campaign in the last decade (9-4 in 2016), played in two bowl games (one came after a 5-7 regular season in 2015) and was the only power-conference team not to earn a bowl berth from 2017 to ’23. This year, the 6-6 Huskers have earned their third bowl bid in that 10-year block. The Hawkeyes have won nine of the programs’ 10 meetings since Eichorst’s remark. Only two Iowa wins were blowouts. The remaining eight games were decided by one score, including each of the last seven. The programs’ 40-win disparity over the last decade could lead one to deduce Nebraska flexes its rivalry muscles in this series while Iowa plays down to the competition. Or, to use the verb BTN analyst and former Minnesota defensive back Brock Vereen coined, no team gets “Iowa’d” more than Nebraska. In the last seven years, four different Iowa kickers have drilled game-winning field goals with either no time remaining (2018, 2023, 2024) or one second left (2019). Two took place in Lincoln, and two were in Iowa City. In the last two years, a Nebraska turnover caused by a backup Iowa defensive end inside the game’s final 20 seconds has given the ball to Iowa in Huskers’ territory and led to a field goal in a 13-10 victory. GO DEEPER Sherman: Nebraska denied the pregame hand shake against Iowa. And it backfired Last year, Iowa defensive end Ethan Hurkett dropped off in a zone blitz and intercepted Chubba Purdy with 15 seconds left. Iowa backup kicker Marshall Meeder replaced struggling teammate Drew Stevens and barely pooched the ball over the goal post from 38 yards out. Friday, Iowa defensive end Max Llewellyn crashed into Nebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola and stripped the football. Stevens then drilled a 53-yard attempt that snuck inside the right goal post. Advertisement Last year’s benching fueled Stevens, who vowed to put himself in that same position against Nebraska. Stevens, never one to lack confidence, said he had made plans in the second quarter to run directly to the north end zone and grab the Heroes Trophy after making a game-winning kick. What Stevens cites as the separation between Iowa and Nebraska isn’t just his confidence or that the Hawkeyes have better kickers; it’s the intangibles. “I think it’s the details, man,” Stevens said. “I think it’s the little things that we do well, that’s what we focus on. We even focus on that way back in summer, like you miss a line, everybody goes back five yards. One guy messes up, everybody messes up.” Stevens may have envisioned beating Nebraska because of last year’s moment, but he didn’t spend the offseason preparing strictly for the Huskers. The Hawkeyes did use a picture of former Nebraska wide receiver Kenny Bell catching the overtime touchdown pass in 2014 as a weight-room motivator for cornerback Greg Mabin the ensuing offseason, but that’s no different from their methods before facing other teams. Tight end George Kittle once said Northwestern’s cat roar at full blast was the most annoying sound he encountered during an Iowa practice. Others have said the same thing about the Minnesota fight song. The Hawkeyes have four annual rivalries, and each one fills a different category. With Wisconsin, it’s about physicality, respect and the Big Ten standings. Minnesota is Iowa’s most-played series, with the feistiest history and the greatest trophy in Floyd of Rosedale. Iowa State is most heated overall, the opponent Iowa players detest more than any other. However, Eichorst’s shade in 2014 and the ensuing antics like the Huskers captains not shaking hands before kickoff have led to more barbs from Iowa players toward Nebraska than any of the other three combined. This certainly wasn’t the vision Eichorst had for the Huskers when he dissed the Hawkeyes a decade ago. But he awoke something in Iowa that has ramifications for today’s Huskers, who are on their third different head coach since his remarks. Said another way, upon the final analysis, you fool around and you find out. (Photo: Matthew Holst / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The hometown star who put Minnesota on the map with a Final Four run during her senior season in 2004 was never able to recapture that kind of success as a coach, only making the WNIT postseason tournament twice. “I’m so excited to be back with the Lynx and back with Coach and Becky (Rebekkah Brunson),” Whalen said in a statement Saturday. “Eric and I have also known each other for a long time, and for me, I couldn’t imagine joining a better staff as I return to coaching and get my first opportunity to coach in the WNBA. We have a special group with this team and I can’t wait to get to work.” The two hires bring much familiarity back to Minnesota for Reeve as she has long histories with both the Thibault family and Whalen. Reeve and Mike Thibault, a Saint Paul, Minn., native, have known one another for years. He took over the Connecticut Sun in 2003 and drafted Whalen out of Minnesota in 2004. In 2010, when Reeve became the Lynx head coach after spending nine seasons as an assistant at various franchises, Minnesota — which was trying to bring Whalen back to the Lynx for several seasons — was finally successful in navigating a trade with Thibault and the Sun. Reeve also selected Mike Thibault as an assistant for her Team USA Olympic staff this summer ahead of the Paris Games. In 2024, the Lynx had its most successful season since the Whalen years, winning the Commissioner’s Cup and advancing to the WNBA Finals, where Minnesota lost in five games to the New York Liberty. The Lynx return its core from that playoff run in 2025, including WNBA defensive player of the year Napheesa Collier, as well as standouts Alanna Smith, Kayla McBride, Courtney Williams and Bridget Carleton. Minnesota also has the No. 11 pick in the 2025 WNBA Draft. (Photo: Jordan Johnson / NBAE via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"The never-published Georgia-Georgia Tech game story, and what it says about college football this season",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5958428/2024/11/30/georgia-georgia-tech-score-analysis/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 18:43:06 GMT",Georgia vs. Georgia Tech is a great reminder of why games — and sportswriters — should never hit publish until it's really over.,"NCAAF The most maddening, hard to figure out Georgia football season in recent memory has yet another confounding twist: Dominated by Georgia Tech, an embarrassing showing at home that seemed to confirm the worst of what many suspected about this year’s team — it just isn’t very good. That was the first paragraph of a story filed to my editor at 10:45 p.m. ET on Friday night. Georgia Tech had just scored to go up 27-13 with 5:37 left in the game. We wanted a story to go quickly after the game ended, and with print media permitted on the field at Sanford Stadium with less than five minutes left in the game, yours truly wanted to get down there to take in what was sure to be a scene of despair on the Georgia sideline and exultation on Georgia Tech’s. GO DEEPER How Georgia pulled off 'the best win of all time' (over Georgia Tech) Georgia is almost certainly out of the running for an at-large spot in the College Football Playoff after Friday night’s loss to Georgia Tech. The Bulldogs are now 9-3, the goodwill from their SEC schedule almost certainly canceled out by this loss, in which Georgia looked far inferior to its ACC in-state rival. Advertisement That was the third paragraph. The next two took pains to point out that all was not lost for Georgia, which could still win the SEC championship next week and get an automatic first-round bye in the Playoff. But it all came down to that now, having been stunned by its in-state rival, as I continued: A win on Friday night would have locked up the at-large berth, so this could also end up the season-ender. Georgia was a 19.5-point favorite. It had not lost to Georgia Tech since 2016, not lost at home since 2019, and not lost a home night game since 2009. Someone with no prior knowledge of college football or these programs would have assumed Georgia Tech was the premier program. Then I wrote three quick sections summarizing why Georgia was dominated, finishing with this final stake to the heart: Georgia fans started heading to the exits, with 5:37 still left, leaving their team on a cold sideline to contemplate how it ended up in this position. Feeling very good about that last line, I hit send, and started the trip from the press box down to the field. Of course, Georgia outlasted Georgia Tech in eight overtimes to win 44-42. GO DEEPER Eight OTs? No. 7 Georgia outlasts Georgia Tech after rally from 14 down in fourth Every sportswriter who’s been around long enough has these stories. The great game stories never published. In my case the most notable has always been the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship, where during halftime I put together the top 10 events that led to Georgia finally ending its 37-year championship drought. Then Tua Tagovailoa happened. Then it still looked like Georgia would pull it out in overtime. Then second-and-26 happened. The “Washington Post” would later get four national sportswriters to provide their abandoned leads on Georgia winning it all, so they ultimately didn’t go to waste. Neither did mine: The next summer I repurposed them for a story on the top 10 events that led to Georgia’s “ascent as a national power.” But the actual national title would have to wait. Advertisement There have been others. The back-and-forth ending of the 2022 Peach Bowl caused a lot of cutting and rewriting. There was this year’s Georgia loss at Alabama, where we all wrote about Georgia getting blown out, then had to rewrite it into a comeback, then Alabama winning after all, then Georgia going downfield and … The plight of sportswriters, many of whom hope for the game to be “quick and easy,” is another reminder of not only how great sports are but that narratives are decided by thin margins. Seven years ago, Alabama was still the preeminent program in the country and Georgia the pretender because a safety momentarily bought an eye fake from Tagovailoa. Three years ago, Georgia was the preeminent program and Ohio State head coach Ryan Day couldn’t win the big one, just because a long field goal wasn’t made. And on Friday night, Georgia was still safely in the Playoff just because … well, pick your play, but ultimately because of a two-point shootout that was essentially a coin toss. This is probably how it’s going to be the rest of the way. We have an expanded Playoff but we may not have any great teams. Oregon is the lone unbeaten, and it still barely won at home against Ohio State, largely because an offensive pass interference pushed the Buckeyes out of field position. Parity appears to reign, and games — or perhaps programs and history — may be decided because of single, random plays. About an hour after an eight-overtime win that Kirby Smart called “epic,” the Georgia head coach walked out of his postgame news conference. He walked in silence for a few moments, then looked up at the sky, shook his head and let out a high-pitched sigh. The kind you make when you’re exhausted, but relieved, and don’t know what else to say. A long night, in what has already been a long season, and more to go. Plenty to write about. Just don’t hit “publish” until it’s really over. (Photo: David J. Griffin / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Wood’s 24th Forest goal in the top flight — and his ninth of the season — was enough to secure a 1-0 win over Ipswich Town at the City Ground. Advertisement But it also moved him level with Bryan Roy, in their list of Premier League scorers. Wood, who is already New Zealand’s all time top scorer on the international stage, with 41 goals, is almost certain to break that Forest record, on current form. And Nuno believes the man, who turns 33 on December 7, has a few more years left in him yet. “I believe so. I believe so,” said Nuno, when asked if he expected Wood to still be going strong in a few years. “Chris is one of those players who really takes care of himself. Nutrition, rest… Chris has the ambition to keep going, so he has to take care of his body and his mind. “He is perfect now. He is perfect. If he continues, then good.” For​​est are in negotiations with Wood, who is currently out of contract next summer. Only Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah (10) and Erling Haaland (12) of Manchester City have scored more Premier League goals than him. “We are delighted. It is not only here, it is in New Zealand as well — he is going to break all the records. We are delighted for him and we are so, so grateful,” said Nuno. Wood scored from the penalty spot after Jota had been brought down by Sam Szmodics in the 49th minute. It was Jota’s first start for Forest in the league, following his summer arrival from Vitoria and the 25-year-old was frequently a lively figure. “Jota started the game really well. He got us going, he won us corners — then he won us the penalty,” said Nuno. “He is another option for us. We have wingers — Ramon Sosa also — who are gradually getting a little more time. They will get there.

Here are the key talking points...,"EPL Newcastle United drew 1-1 with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park after a late equaliser from Daniel Munoz. In a game of few chances for Eddie Howe’s side, they relied on a well-worked free kick in the second half to set up their goal, which was turned into the Palace net by Marc Guehi following Anthony Gordon’s flash across the six-yard box. Advertisement But deep into added time, Munoz scored a header to earn Palace a point as they battle to stay out of the relegation zone, with Newcastle now in 10th spot. Here, Jacob Whitehead breaks down the key talking points from the game… Alexander Isak was not one of Newcastle’s major injury doubts entering the match but the striker’s fragility means he is always a slight concern, a luxury watch that needs fine-tuning. After initially going down after nine minutes, rubbing his hip, he was withdrawn for good 11 minutes later. Callum Wilson made his first Premier League appearance of the season during Monday’s 2-0 home defeat to West Ham United — and the back-up striker was the presumed substitute here.  But with 70 minutes remaining, Howe instead shifted right-winger Anthony Gordon centrally, changing the style and system rather than turn to either of the specialist strikers on his bench in Wilson or William Osula. The implication was that Wilson was not yet fully fit, and Osula not yet ready. Wilson has been available for less than 50 per cent of Newcastle’s matches since the beginning of last season, while Osula was the club’s only outfield first-team signing. That neither was deemed a suitable replacement was a reflection of the squad-building position that they find themselves in after two poor transfer windows. While Wilson did come on for the final 15 minutes, if Newcastle are pursuing Europe with a first-choice striker who has been historically susceptible to injuries, they need a better contingency plan. Guehi created a Newcastle stalemate in the summer; he broke one on Saturday afternoon. Having been the subject Newcastle bids this summer — with the club rejecting that there had been as many as four — he ran out at Selhurst Park still a Crystal Palace player. The Palace defence stymied Newcastle in the opening 45 minutes — it was just the second time in the last 10 years that Newcastle have failed to have a shot in the opening half.  Advertisement But for Daniel Munoz’s inexplicable miss at the back post, they would have deservedly been behind. As it was, Newcastle scored without a shot on target. From a wide free kick near the Palace box, Lewis Hall slid the ball to an unmarked Sandro Tonali, whose perfectly weighted pass found Gordon.  Gordon’s cross was low and hard and flashed across the face of goal — too quickly for Guehi to react. The ball bounced off the centre-back’s shin and rolled past Dean Henderson — giving Newcastle a boost that they thought had passed them by. Daniel Munoz had missed two huge chances. In the first half he somehow contrived to slide wide from six yards out. In the second, Dan Burn threw himself across to prevent him firing into an empty net. In the 93rd minute, the right wing-back had his redemption, planting a downward header into the corner of the Newcastle goal — and it was the least his team deserved. The assist? Marc Guehi. Newcastle produced an expected goals tally (xG) of just 0.02 across the match, with just one shot in 90 minutes. Palace, in contrast, produced 16 shots — only denied by their own wastefulness, blocks from Burn and Schar, and two excellent Nick Pope saves. Three points would have papered over the cracks; as well as the defence played, this was not a winning performance. Newcastle will have to hope Isak’s injury is not serious — despite pushing Bruno Guimaraes further forward, and virtually a fully fit attacking squad, they had the cutting edge of a rolling pin. Last season, they were one of the entertainers with 85 goals, the fourth-most in the division. This year, they have managed just 14 so far — only five sides have fewer. Speaking to the BBC’s Match of the Day, Howe said: “It was a strange game. We didn’t have any goalmouth action, but I felt we were good in the game. I felt we nullified them pretty well. In the main, I think we controlled it pretty well. “It’s really gutting to concede the goal at the end. I felt like we’d weathered the storm and would see the game out. We defended crosses well, but one moment cost us today. In (our last) two games, we’ve let a lot of points slip.” Advertisement On Dan Burn, Howe said: “Dan’s been nursing an ankle problem for the last few weeks. It’s a gigantic performance from him, all things considered. I don’t think he deserved that (Crystal Palace) goal today.” Howe also spoke to Sky Sports about Alexander Isak’s injury, saying: “It was a contact injury not a muscle pull, which is good news for us. Hopefully he’ll recover quickly but at this moment I don’t know.” Wednesday, December 4: Liverpool (H), Premier League, 7.30pm GMT, 2.30pm ET   (Top photo: Glyn KIRK / AFP)  Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Survivor Pools | Fantasy football player rankings Updated through 11:45 a.m. ET, Nov. 30 Trevor Lawrence, QB, Jaguars (shoulder) — Questionable
Trevor Lawrence is officially questionable but expected to play Sunday. Head coach Doug Pederson told reporters, “He’s done some really good things this week. I would say as of right now, yes, he will play.” Fantasy managers with any stake in the Jags are desperate for Lawrence’s return. With him in, TE Evan Engram and WR Brian Thomas Jr. become fantasy-relevant again. Brian Robinson Jr., RB, Commanders (ankle) — Expected to play
Austin Ekeler, RB, Commanders (concussion) — Out
Ekeler has been ruled out while Robinson is expected to play. Backup RB Jeremy McNichols has been plucked off waiver wires all week. Lesser-known RB Chris Rodriguez Jr. could also factor into the running game if Robinson suffers any setbacks. Noah Brown, WR, Commanders (knee) — Expected to play
Brown has emerged as one of Jayden Daniels’ favorite targets after a 71-receiving yard performance in Week 12 and is now expected to play heading into Week 13. Outside of Brown, Terry McLaurin and Zach Ertz are the only startable pass catchers in Washington. On the season, McLaurin has had 74 targets, Ertz 69 and Brown 52. Olamide Zaccheaus is next on the list (other than Ekeler) with 35, but he’s surpassed 10 PPR points once this season, had zero points in two games and actually produced negative points in one. Breece Hall, RB, Jets (knee) — Questionable
Breece Hall was a full participant in Friday’s practice and is now expected to play, though officially questionable. Braelon Allen becomes an immediate add-and-play if Hall sits. Allen had a great Week 2 with 4.7 yards per carry and 19.6 PPR points. But he is averaging 3.7 yards per rush on the year and 5.36 PPR points. Advertisement Drake London, WR, Falcons (hip) — Expected to play
Drake London is expected to play in Week 13. He and Darnell Mooney are the Falcons top receivers. Mooney has averaged 13.55 PPR points this season, and his ceiling is right at the 31.5 points he scored in Week 5. London has averaged eight targets, 64.55 yards receiving and 15.27 PPR points per game this season. Younghoe Koo, K, Falcons (hip) — Questionable
Koo was a limited participant in Thursday’s practice, according to Daniel Flick of SI.com. While he’s officially listed as questionable, Koo is expected to play. Alec Pierce, WR, Colts (foot) — Questionable
Josh Downs, WR, Colts (shoulder) — Out
Neither Downs nor Pierce practiced Thursday, and Downs has now been ruled out. Adonai Mitchell becomes fantasy-relevant again as a down-the-field threat, and Michael Pittman Jr. is sure to get the most wide receiver looks for the Colts. DeMario Douglas, WR, Patriots (ankle) — Questionable
Douglas was limited at practice on Wednesday. Averaging 8.56 PPR points per game, Douglas is a flex option in deeper leagues at best. Kayshon Boutte and Kendrick Bourne could see more work with Douglas out. Austin Seibert, K, Commanders (hip) — Injured reserve
Seibert has been placed on IR after missing kicks following his return from injury. When Seibert was out, Zane Gonzalez kicked for the Commanders, going 3-for-3 on field goals and 4-for-4 on extra points. He is still on the practice squad and available for elevation. J.K. Dobbins, RB, Chargers (knee) — Out
Dobbins sprained his MCL and will miss the Chargers’ matchup against the Falcons. With him out, grab Gus Edwards and think about flexing him. He didn’t do too well after Dobbins left the game in Week 12, but he will surely lead LA’s backfield in Dobbins’ absence. Will Dissly, TE, Chargers (knee) — Expected to play
Dissly is ready to go in Week 13. He is averaging 7.9 PPR points on the season and had 18 in Week 11. In Weeks 11 and 12, he had 80 yards and 47 yards receiving, respectively. Advertisement Tyjae Spears, RB, Titans (concussion) — Questionable
Spears practiced fully on Thursday but remains questionable. Tony Pollard is the RB1 in Tennessee. In Spears’ Week 12 absence, Pollard had 119 yards on 24 carries, a touchdown and finished with 21.9 PPR points. Calvin Ridley, WR, Titans (ankle) — Expected to play
Ridley didn’t practice on Wednesday but is expected to play and had a solid Week 12 with 93 yards receiving. Nick Westbrook-Ikhine is still an intriguing flex play. NWI has scored over 10 PPR points in four of his last five games and had 117 yards receiving in Week 11. Often his production comes from limited targets and receptions, so beware. DK Metcalf, WR, Seahawks (shoulder) — Expected to play
Tyler Lockett, WR, Seahawks (knee) — Expected to play
Neither Metcalf nor Lockett practiced Thursday but are now off the injury report. Jaxon Smith-Njigba could still be a good flex option in Week 13 but has less potential with Locket and Metcalf on the field. DeVonta Smith, WR, Eagles (hamstring) — Questionable
Smith missed Week 12 with a hamstring injury and remains questionable for Week 13. According to EJ Smith of The Philadelphia Inquirer, the Eagles receiver said he’s not sure if he will play Sunday. Without Smith on the field, A.J. Brown and Dallas Goedert were the only pass catchers with more than one target. Saquon Barkley also caught four passes for 47 receiving yards. Ja’Tavion Sanders, TE, Panthers (neck) — Out
Sanders has been ruled out for Week 13, meaning Tommy Tremble will likely get the start. Tremble has not exceeded 5.9 PPR points in any game this season. Brock Purdy, QB, 49ers (shoulder) — Questionable
Purdy was limited in practice this week, but head coach Kyle Shanahan said Friday that he expects the quarterback to play, according to Nick Wagoner of ESPN.com. Brandon Allen would get another start if anything changes. Managers of Niners receivers would be incredibly thankful if Purdy returns for Week 13. Keon Coleman, WR, Bills (wrist) — Questionable
Dalton Kincaid, TE, Bills (knee) — Out
Coleman was limited at practice with a wrist injury, while Kincaid has been ruled out. Coleman hasn’t played since Week 9. Now, Coleman will share targets with Amari Cooper and Khalil Shakir. With Kincaid out, Dawson Knox is a quality backup who should demand streaming consideration for this week. Advertisement Cedric Tillman, WR, Browns (concussion) — Questionable
Tillman was diagnosed with a concussion during Thursday Night Football in Week 12 and hasn’t practiced this week. But Jerry Jeudy has been the surging Browns receiver lately. In Weeks 8-12, Jeudy has averaged 17 PPR points with a 26.2 point perfromance in Week 11. If Tillman sits, Jeudy is an even better fantasy option. Bo Nix, QB, Broncos (back) — Expected to play
Nix was limited in practice due to a back injury but is expected to play. With Nix set to play, WRs Courtland Sutton and Devaughn Vele are more attractive fantasy plays in Week 13. 
  Outdoor games only As the weather grows colder, two of the remaining matchups — 49ers-Bills and Steelers–Bengals — will be played in temperatures below 35 degrees. In Jake Ciely’s fantasy football strategy guide to weather, he notes that the passing game is impacted when temperatures drop below 35 degrees, which is illustrated in the table below. According to Rotowire’s aggregated NFL-related forecasts, there is an 82 percent chance of snow with an expected temperature of 27 degrees when the Bills welcome the 49ers to Buffalo. San Francisco 49ers (5-6) vs. Buffalo Bills (9-2) Snow and precipitation primarily affect the passing game. Typically, running backs are used more in difficult weather conditions, so their value is less impacted. Christian McCaffrey and James Cook should typically produce, and maybe Ray Davis even gets some carries if the game scripts lean run. Josh Allen has played in three games in the snow, in 2020 and 2021. In those games, he averaged a completion percentage of 51.8 percent, compared to a career 63.7 percent. While that’s dismal, he also still threw for an average of 256.33 yards per game. With Dalton Kincaid out, Dawson Knox and Cook out of the backfield could see a lot of short-yardage work. I may trust Khalil Shakir more than Amari Cooper this week because of Shakir’s rapport with Allen and consistent fantasy production. Advertisement Brock Purdy hasn’t played in the snow in the NFL. The San Francisco 49ers last snowy game was in Jan. 2022, in a divisional game against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field. They won 13-10, and seven of their points came off a blocked punt that went for a touchdown. Former 49ers QB Jimmy Garoppolo was 11-for-19 and threw for 131 yards and an interception. The team rushed for 106 total yards, and Kittle led the Niners in receiving with four receptions and 63 yards. A typical snow game.
 Game-specific previews and live updates are available on the day of the game. Philadelphia Eagles (9-2) vs. Baltimore Ravens (7-4) After Saquon Barkley’s 302 net yards and Hurts’ efficient performance against the Rams in Week 12, Philly still doesn’t get the odds against the Ravens in Baltimore. Led by MVP candidate Lamar Jackson, the Ravens can beat anyone, even the soaring Eagles. Derrick Henry’s impact on Baltimore’s dominant season cannot be overstated. He’s averaging 20 PPR points per game and just had a 140-yard rushing performance on Monday Night Football, breaking one tackle after another. He faces eight men in the box at the second-highest rate in the NFL (33.9 percent) and still averages 3.55 yards after contact (sixth in the league). Zay Flowers (Ciely’s WR23), Mark Andrews (TE19) and Rashod Bateman (WR54) round out the Ravens offense and give Jackson capable targets. The Ravens allow the fewest yards per rush (3.5), and even Barkley may find less room to run in this game. The Eagles have a great one-two punch with A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith (who was inactive in Week 12), and TE Dallas Goedert is great for the short game. With much focus on Barkley this season, Hurts’ seventh-ranked passer rating (102.3) and sixth-ranked completion percentage (69.1 percent) have gone under the radar. Brown has 727 receiving yards on the season and averages 16.96 PPR points per game. Read the full preview (coming Sunday).  San Francisco 49ers (5-6) vs. Buffalo Bills (9-2) The Niners have been disappointing this year and sit at the bottom of the NFC West. Still in playoff contention, they hope to have Brock Purdy back in Week 13. Christian McCaffrey hasn’t looked the same since his return from injury, averaging 3.5 yards per carry and under 50 rushing yards per game. However, the Bills D gives up 4.9 yards per carry (30th in the NFL), giving fantasy managers who have McCaffrey something to be thankful for this week. Interestingly in the receiving corps, Deebo Samuel is averaging only 10.5 PPR points per game, while breakout wideout Jauan Jennings is averaging 14.9. Josh Allen is on a tear this season, averaging 231.18 passing yards and 28.7 rushing yards per game and throwing for 18 TDs while rushing for five. He has only five interceptions with a passer rating of 98.2 and is fantasy’s QB5 with 20.3 PPR points per game. Now Allen has Amari Cooper alongside Khalil Shakir as his top two receivers. Shakir has only scored less than 10 PPR points once in Week 6; he offers a great floor and a ceiling of about 20 points. Read the full preview (coming Sunday).  Cleveland Browns (3-8) vs. Denver Broncos (7-5) On the shoulders of Bo Nix’s improved play and a tough defense, the Broncos are favored over the Cleveland Browns. I was big on Nix entering the season. His college career contained few errors, and I thought he’d fit into Sean Payton’s system well. But the first few weeks of his play had me cowering in a corner. But persistence has brought vengeance! Nix has thrown zero interceptions in the past three weeks while scoring eight touchdowns. From Weeks 10-12, his passer rating is 118.6, and he has a 71.4 percent completion rate. Courtland Sutton has been buoyed because of it. During that span, he averaged 81.67 receiving yards per game on nine targets. The Broncos running game is an entirely different story. Payton seems to be using the hot-hand approach to Javonte Williams, Jaleel McLaughlin and Audric Estime, making none of them viable fantasy plays. Advertisement The Browns have some fight in them with Jameis Winston under center. They aren’t winning games, but they’ve become more fun to watch, and Jerry Jeudy has become flex-relevant in deep leagues. Jeudy has scored 12 or more PPR points since Week 8, and in Week 11, he had 26.2. Denver has a stout pass defense, allowing only 199.8 passing yards per game (ninth in the NFL), so while I think Jeudy deserves flex consideration, temper expectations. Read the full preview (coming Monday). 
 Austin Mock scours his weekly projections to spot the top values on the board. New Orleans Saints +3 (-115) vs. Los Angeles Rams Subjectively, I hate this play, but the numbers are what they are. The Rams offense can pop off at any moment, and I’m not sure the Saints are the team that can stick with them. However, the Rams laying a full field goal on the road after getting dismantled by the Eagles on Sunday Night Football seems a bit much for me. Hopefully, we don’t get an incredible Matthew Stafford game because the Saints won’t be able to keep up if that happens. — Mock  See all of Mock’s best bets for Week 13. A weekly guide to staying alive from Renee Miller and Adam Gretz. Odds from BetMGM as of Thursday. Tampa Bay Buccaneers over Carolina Panthers The early bird to the survivor picks gets to write up the team playing the Panthers, as usual. (Sorry, Adam.) Although Carolina had Week 12’s Chiefs pickers very nervous, they ultimately gave in to their losing destiny. The numbers haven’t changed much: Carolina allows opponents the most points per game in the league while scoring the fourth-fewest points in the league. Their scoring margin of -13.3 is almost four points lower than anyone else’s (T-Jacksonville and Las Vegas). The Bucs came out of their bye week in ideal shape, carving up the Giants in New York 30-7, allowing them to move into fourth in points per game. It’s hard to say whether the Tampa Bay defense is starting to play better post-bye and heading toward the playoffs when it actually matters or whether Tommy DeVito and the Giants just presented zero challenge. Either way, Bryce Young and company are in very much the same garbage bin as the Giants when it comes to offense.

In acquiring Justus Annunen, 24, plus a sixth-round pick next June from the Avalanche in exchange for veteran Scott Wedgewood, the Predators, 7-12-5, have an eye past this season. Internally, there’s hope the Predators’ goaltending department led by Mitch Korn can unlock some of that potential from Annunen. The fact that Annunen is eight years younger than Wedgewood made this trade appealing given the disappointing season Nashville is having. Advertisement For the Avalanche, it’s all about the here and now. The hope is that the veteran Wedgewood, 32, will help stabilize things while starting goalie Alexandar Georgiev finds his game. The Avs, 13-11-0, are 30th in the NHL in goals against per game entering play Saturday. Wedgewood appeared in 32 games with the Dallas Stars last season, helping give the team solid insurance behind No. 1 Jake Oettinger. He signed a two-year, $3-million deal with Nashville on July 1 as a UFA. Wedgewood went 1-2-1 with a .878 save percentage this season for the Preds. Annunen, drafted 64th overall by the Avs in 2018, went 6-4-0 for Colorado this season with a .872 SP. The Preds also traded away Philip Tomasino to the Penguins earlier this past week and have indicated to clubs they remain open for business — especially to trading for younger players.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Should the Canucks trade for a defender with Filip Hronek out? 7 potential options,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5957696/2024/11/30/canucks-trade-filip-hronek-options/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 16:03:27 GMT","With Hronek sidelined, the Canucks might expedite their search for another top-four defenceman.","NHL The Vancouver Canucks were already short of a top-four defenceman when healthy. Add an injury to Filip Hronek, who missed Friday’s game against Buffalo and is undergoing further evaluation for a reported shoulder injury, and the organization is teetering on the edge of a blue-line crisis. A right side with Tyler Myers, Noah Juulsen and Vincent Desharnais is problematic. Advertisement The Canucks squeaked out a 4-3 overtime victory over the Sabres without Hronek, but that was more of a gutsy, bend-but-don’t-break performance that leaned heavily on goaltending rather than a sustainable formula. Vancouver is also entering a tougher stretch where it’ll play 10 games in 19 days, which includes contests against Tampa Bay, Florida, Colorado and Vegas, all of whom rank top-10 in goals scored per game. Should the Canucks expedite their search for a top-four defenceman with Hronek out? What options could be available on the trade market and does the club have what it realistically takes to make a move? Patrik Allvin’s front office shouldn’t leave any stone unturned in their hunt for additional defensive help, but it’s also important that they avoid making a knee-jerk move. It’s easy for media and fans to play armchair GM, but the logistics of crafting a fair trade that makes sense both short- and long-term are complicated. Here are some of the factors the club should be considering: • The Canucks shouldn’t just target any top-four defender, their ideal fit would be a high-end puck mover who can take the lead driving their pair.
• A right-handed defenceman would fit best, but a lefty would be fine too because Erik Brännström or Carson Soucy can temporarily play their off-side until Hronek comes back (both of them have experience playing the right side).
• The overall supply of quality top-four defenders on selling teams is awfully thin and the number of contenders who’ll be in the market for blue-line reinforcements is high. Prices will likely be expensive because of that.
• If Vancouver pays big for a defender, it should be for a player with term beyond this season. The return on investment would be poor if the club spends big on a rental that potentially walks for nothing in the summer.
• A rental would be acceptable if the acquisition cost is modest like last year when the Canucks gave up a third-round pick for Nikita Zadorov, but it may not be easy to find cost-effective options this early into the season. Remember that the Flames were motivated to sell Zadorov early because he requested a trade. Advertisement Flames defender Rasmus Andersson would be a near-perfect blend of ability, stylistic fit, handedness and contract status (signed through 2025-26 at a $4.55 million cap hit). There’s no indication that he’s available right now, though, as Calgary is off to a better-than-expected start. Andersson’s name didn’t appear on the trade boards of either The Athletic’s Chris Johnston or Daily Faceoff’s Frank Seravalli. That’s why he won’t appear on this targets list despite being exactly what the Canucks could use. Here’s a brief overview of the other potential options on the market. Truthfully, they’re underwhelming, which is why I don’t think management deserves flak if they cannot execute a quick move to shore up the defence. Pettersson, a left-shot rental, is a dependable shutdown defender with a massive wing span and sufficient secondary puck skills. He can play the right side if necessary and has a strong history of excelling next to offensive-minded partners, meaning he’d be an attractive contender to play with Hughes for however long Hronek is out. The Penguins are reportedly one of the teams that have explored the possibility of acquiring Nils Höglander, and the Canucks reportedly have interest in Pettersson, making this an intriguing possibility to watch. Höglander’s cratering ice time and recent struggles, plus Hronek’s injury don’t give the Canucks a lot of leverage in negotiations, though, so the big question is how much would the Canucks have to add on top of the 23-year-old winger to make a trade go through? There’s risk in overpaying for a rental who could walk in the summer and leave the Canucks with a top-four hole again. Stylistically, he isn’t a perfect fit either. He isn’t a dynamic puck-mover and is unproven as far as driving his own pair. Advertisement Borgen has been a steady, underrated player since arriving in Seattle. He drove solid, albeit unspectacular results over the last two seasons next to Jamie Oleksiak on the Kraken’s second pair, but has been relegated to the bottom pair this season because of Brandon Montour’s arrival on the right side. The 27-year-old right-shot defender isn’t the dynamic puck mover or high-end top-four piece that the Canucks are looking for, but consider him an effective band-aid solution to shore up the right side if Hronek is going to miss considerable time. Borgen has good size (6-foot-3), defends hard, is mobile, has top-four experience and would probably clock in at a reasonable, Zadorov-like acquisition cost. Borgen is on The Athletic’s trade board, but would GM Ron Francis be ready to start selling this early into the season? Francis had a splashy offseason and could end up on the hot seat if Seattle misses the playoffs again, so he could be incentivized to wait until closer to the deadline to sell pieces off. Byram’s dynamic skating, age (23) and high-end upside are tantalizing. Consistency and head injuries have been an issue for him, but this is a player who flashed star potential and led the Avalanche in five-on-five ice time during the 2022 Stanley Cup Final. He’s off to a strong start this season with 13 points in 24 games while logging huge top-pair minutes next to Rasmus Dahlin. Why did he appear on Chris Johnston’s trade board then? Well, it’s not that the Sabres are shopping Byram, but they have to be mindful of their cap picture beyond this season. Byram will be a restricted free agent at the end of this season and will command a huge raise because of his start. Buffalo already has nearly $24 million committed to three left-shot defenders in Dahlin, Owen Power and Mattias Samuelsson. Do the Sabres want to commit an additional big-money contract to a fourth left-handed blueliner? Advertisement I reached out to Sabres beat reporter Matt Fairburn for insight on the situation. He indicated that Buffalo wouldn’t be eager to move Byram but if the organization did go down that route, the return would need to include some win-now pieces given that the Sabres are in contention for a playoff spot. He specified that they could use a top-six forward and a right-handed defenceman. This is the biggest hang-up: Even if Byram is available, the Canucks likely lack the marquee win-now piece to get a deal done. Vancouver’s best shot at building a fair package would be built around futures, but Buffalo, who has a stacked prospect pool and wants to get better now, might not be interested in a futures-oriented deal. Jiricek, a right-shot drafted No. 6 in 2022, appears destined for a fresh start. I asked our prospects expert Scott Wheeler for some insight on why he’s stalled and what his outlook is. Jiricek’s a bit of a juxtaposition. This is his fifth full season of pro hockey despite having just turned 21, which is obviously extremely advanced. His production at Czechia’s top level at 17 and 18 and in the AHL at 19 and 20 plot him on a star trajectory from a data standpoint. And he’s 6-foot-4 and 200-plus pounds to boot. But there are also some practical flaws in the eye test (primarily sloppy pivots/feet going backwards and bad reads to overcompensate) that have posed a challenge as he has tried to establish himself as an 82-gamer at a very early age. I do think it’s important to remember that even though it feels like he has stalled, and he has in some ways, he’s still the eighth-youngest defenseman to play in an NHL game this year and D his age are often still in Europe or just getting started in the AHL after junior. Offensively, he can hammer it, he plays a confident style on the puck, and he actually moves quite well and handles quite well going forward. Defensively, there is upside in his length and he does have some natural instincts, but the timing and footwork is the X-factor in setting his ceiling. We’re still talking about a high-end D prospect here. Initially, the Blue Jackets were rumoured to be seeking an elite prospect (like Vancouver’s Tom Willander, which wouldn’t be worth it) in a one-for-one type of swap. But now Columbus is reportedly open to packages built around draft picks. The Canucks could kick tires on Jiricek, but I see a couple of major stumbling blocks. Advertisement Firstly, while he’s close to being NHL-ready, he’s ultimately still a prospect in the AHL. He has defensive flaws and doesn’t skate very well yet. This isn’t a player who’s going to magically solve the club’s top-four issues for this season. Heck, there’s no guarantee he can do that next season or even the year after. He’d be a much better fit for a young team on the rise rather than a win-now club like Vancouver. Secondly, even if Allvin tries to build a package around draft picks and Höglander, it’s unlikely that will be the most attractive offer from Columbus’ standpoint. The Canucks’ first-round pick, for example, will likely be late because they’re a good team. If you’re Columbus, you’d probably prefer a first-round pick from a non-playoff team since it’ll likely be significantly higher and more valuable. Will the 7-12-5 Predators make a hard shift to a rebuild? If they do, Carrier would be a player to monitor. The 28-year-old right-shot doesn’t fit the size element that the Canucks usually chase — he’s listed at 5-foot-11, 174 pounds — but he has a proven track record of driving strong defensive results and crucially, has accomplished it in a role where he’s trusted to play shutdown minutes defending against top forward lines. Carrier is a mobile skater, an above-average puck mover and a ferocious competitor who plays much bigger than his size. Carrier would represent a definite upgrade for the Canucks’ blue line but does he move the needle enough to justify taking on his $3.75 million cap hit through 2026-27? If he was a rental, this would be a good fit because of his puck-moving acumen and experience logging difficult matchups, but the term left on his deal is a complicated fit. Between Carrier and Myers, the Canucks would end up with $7.75 million committed long-term to two right-shot defenders who top out as ideally being No. 4/5s. That doesn’t even include Desharnais’ $2 million on the right side. The player is a good stylistic fit, but the contract might be suboptimal to have on the books beyond this season. Provorov is an experienced all-situations minute muncher who can play both sides of the blue line. His performance under this heavy workload has been inconsistent over the years. There were some seasons in Philly where he looked like a top-pair stud and others where he got his teeth kicked in and struggled mightily. Advertisement He was underwhelming during his first season in Columbus but is off to a strong start this year, with the Blue Jackets handily outshooting and out-chancing opponents during his five-on-five shifts. Provorov would be a top-four upgrade, but I’m skeptical about the fit for a couple of reasons. First is the acquisition cost: Columbus is seeking a first-round pick and the Canucks shouldn’t pay that price for a second-pair rental defenceman. Secondly, Provorov has spent most of his minutes this season caddying Zach Werenski (although recently he’s played with Damon Severson). I’m not convinced Provorov is capable of driving his own pair at a high level which is concerning given the potential asking price. Walman, a 28-year-old lefty with a $3.4 million cap hit through 2025-26, is having a huge bounce-back year in San Jose. The strong skating puck mover has already piled up 17 points in 21 games and is impressively winning his two-way matchups. San Jose is remarkably generating more shots and expected goals than it’s allowing during Walman’s minutes and it’s translated to a plus-four goal differential at five-on-five. That’s wildly impressive considering the Sharks are a bottom-feeder team. Walman spent the previous two seasons playing on Detroit’s top pair. He struggled at times last season but was a revelation in a big minutes role the season prior. His skating and skill on the breakout are enticing, but a trade fit with Vancouver isn’t exactly a slam dunk. If you’re San Jose, wouldn’t it make sense to keep Walman as a veteran so that the likes of Macklin Celebrini and Will Smith have a legit offensive defenceman to play with? They could easily just sell him as a rental next year. It may take a steep price for the Sharks to give up Walman this season, which would be a gamble for an acquiring team because he’s had an up-and-down track record over the last three seasons.

Luck will start in his new role immediately, the school said. In the expanded GM position, Luck, 35, will oversee every aspect of the program, both on and off the field. He will work with coach Troy Taylor on recruiting and roster management and with administration on fundraising, alumni relations, sponsorships, student-athlete support and stadium experience, the school said. Advertisement Luck will also be involved in the film room. When asked on “College GameDay” on Saturday morning if he would have a hand in the X’s and O’s, Luck said “absolutely” while acknowledging it’s mainly Taylor’s domain. Luck said he and Taylor are “close,” and that he was on Stanford’s hiring committee when the school brought Taylor on board before the 2023 season. “I imagine this (role) being very hands-on,” Luck said. Ready to build the future of Stanford Football.#GoStanford pic.twitter.com/0F8tTTOBPx — Stanford Football (@StanfordFball) November 30, 2024  While Luck assuming the GM title itself isn’t unique, the scope of his power is. According to ESPN, the entire coaching staff reports to Luck. If he has final say on personnel decisions, that would be a significant evolution in how rosters are currently managed. In virtually every other FBS program, the head coach has the final say on who is signed — or who isn’t. The only other program that approached something akin to an NFL model is Texas Tech, where head coach Joey McGuire allows his general manager James Blanchard to offer scholarships to recruits without his approval and that department is entrusted with the evaluation of recruits and transfers. But McGuire still has the final say. Many power conference programs invest significantly in scouting and personnel departments to manage both high school recruiting and the transfer portal, similar to how NFL teams dedicate staff to college (NFL Draft) and pro (free agency) scouting. Some general managers, like Blanchard, Alabama’s Courtney Morgan, Ohio State’s Mark Pantoni and Clemson’s Jordan Sorrells, make six-figure salaries. But that’s the exception, not the rule — most personnel and recruiting staffers under the GM make five-figure salaries. But GMs, colloquially known as directors of player personnel, have become a must-have position for modern programs. Advertisement The GM role in college football became en vogue in recent years. With the launch of the transfer portal in 2018 and rise of transfers since, the shift to making transfers immediately eligible plus the addition of NIL compensation, roster management has become quite complex. Gone are the days of simply signing 25 high school recruits per year. Now most teams sign a mix of high school recruits and a double-digit number of transfers. Luck’s role also will span far beyond simple roster management, though that’s a key component of it. One aspect that’s unclear: With the coaching staff reporting to Luck, how much influence will he have in hiring and firing decisions? Does that remain the domain of the athletic director and school president? If Luck has significant weight in those decisions, his role more resembles that of an NFL GM. Stanford’s decision to give Luck more power than any other college football GM could foreshadow the sport’s future. With revenue sharing on the way via the House v. NCAA settlement, college football rosters can be managed similarly to the way NFL rosters are: Payrolls will have to be managed. Evolving how players are acquired and teams are built only makes sense. GO DEEPER What to know about House v. NCAA settlement and a historic day for college sports The Cardinal may be on the cutting edge of college football program management and installing someone like Luck, a sharp mind who has a deep football background and is passionate about the school, is a logical first step. “I am a product of this University, of Nerd Nation; I love this place,” Luck said in a statement. “I believe deeply in Stanford’s unique approach to athletics and academics and the opportunity to help drive our program back to the top. Coach Taylor has the team pointed in the right direction, and I cannot wait to work with him, the staff, and the best, brightest, and toughest football players in the world.” Advertisement Stanford has always been Luck’s happy place. It’s where, in four years, he went from nerdy, redshirt freshman to a two-time Heisman runner-up and arguably the best NFL prospect since John Elway. It’s where he met his wife Nicole as an undergrad, and where they settled with their two daughters in 2022 after moving from Indianapolis — where they lived for three years after he stunned the Indianapolis Colts and NFL with his August 2019 retirement. Luck was most recently volunteering as a quarterback coach at Palo Alto High School while pursuing his Master’s degree in education at Stanford. He earned a Bachelor’s degree in architectural design there in 2012. But Luck was looking, since as far back as the early days of his retirement, for his next challenge, unsure of what was next for him. He craves a challenge, and retiring at such a young age — he was just 29 when he walked away from the NFL — left him wandering. He surfed. He skied. He cooked. He read. For a time, he was a stay-at-home dad while Nicole pursued a career in television production. He’d sometimes joke with himself, saying “I can’t be retired at 30. That ain’t right.” So the gig with the Stanford football program — and a unique one at that — fits him and his talents. Along with Jim Plunkett and Elway, Luck is one of the greatest players in program history. In three years with the Cardinal, Luck completed a combined 67 percent of passes for 9,430 yards and 82 touchdowns against 22 interceptions. He added 957 yards and seven scores on the ground en route to a 2022 College Football Hall of Fame induction. Now, Lucks looks to reinstate dominance at Stanford after the program posted four straight 3-9 seasons. “Football gave me a lot,” Luck said last spring. “Most importantly … the relationships and the experiences with people that I love. Part of me feels like it’s my turn to give back to this game.” (Photo: David Madison / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Cade Cunningham's playmaking keeps Pistons unbeaten in NBA Cup with win over Pacers,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5957936/2024/11/30/cade-cunningham-playmaking-pistons-nba-cup/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 15:33:18 GMT",Detroit missed Cunningham during his 3-game absence due to a left sacroiliac joint sprain.,"NBA INDIANAPOLIS — As the clock ticked inside three minutes left in the third quarter, Cade Cunningham dribbled toward the right wing around another screen from Isaiah Stewart. The Detroit Pistons got what they wanted, forcing Indiana Pacers center Myles Turner to switch to Cunningham. As Pacers guard T.J. McConnell pursued Cunningham from behind, Stewart rolled to the basket. As prescribed, Obi Toppin, Indiana’s forward covering the left corner, dropped into the paint to cover Stewart. Advertisement Once again, that left Ausar Thompson all alone in the corner. It was the third wide-open look from the same spot. The first two missed badly, hitting the side of the rim. Thompson, the second-year forward working his way back from a blood clot issue, looked like a career 18.8 percent 3-point shooter on his first two looks. Yet, when Cunningham saw Thompson drift toward Stewart in the paint, he knew the same action had produced the same look. And even though the same shooter stood in the corner, Cunningham made the same decision. He zipped a two-hand pass over his head to the left corner into Thompson’s shooting pocket and Thompson knocked it down. The message was delivered. “That I believe in him, more than anything,” Cunningham said postgame of the message he was sending Thompson. “I’ve seen the work that he’s put in. He has confidence in it, so I have confidence in it. If they were going to continue to guard it like that, he was the only open guy so it’s on him to make a play. I believe he felt confident in that shot. That’s why he kept shooting it.” The presence of Cunningham alone changes the swagger of the Pistons. His return after a three-game absence, due to a left sacroiliac joint sprain, infused Detroit with new life. The Pistons dominated the Pacers 130-106 on Friday night, improving to 3-0 in the NBA Cup standings. GO DEEPER Cade Cunningham, defense are difference as Pistons improve to 2-0 in NBA Cup But it’s more than just Cunningham’s presence. It’s more than just the 24 points and 11 assists he produced. It’s the confidence he instills into his teammates, intentionally as well as indirectly. His playmaking is a declaration of his belief in them. Friday’s game provided an example of his determination to lift the Pistons back to relevance. The comfortable win at Indiana provided a three-possession illustration of Cunningham’s understanding that he can’t do it alone. Advertisement Detroit (9-12) currently sits in the final Play-In spot. On Tuesday, the Pistons will host Milwaukee Bucks, also 3-0 in the NBA Cup, to see which team advances from Group B. Despite the difficulties the Pistons have endured already, the window to do something special is right before them. How special it becomes seems to depend on who steps up to join Cunningham. “He shows belief in his teammates and that’s what leadership is,” Detroit coach J.B. Bickerstaff said of Cunningham postgame. “Cade is the type of person and player that he’s with you no matter the good and the bad. He believes in you because he watches how hard everybody works and he knows what everybody is capable of. When you have a leader that believes in you, it gives you more comfort and more confidence.” J.B. Bickerstaff spoke to the media following tonight's win pic.twitter.com/sbaYaFba0n — Detroit Pistons (@DetroitPistons) November 30, 2024  After Thompson missed a second consecutive corner 3-point attempt, he met Cunningham at half court and high-fived him during a dead ball. The two had a brief discussion, then walked toward the free-throw line nearest their bench, where the restricted area was designed to look like the NBA Cup trophy, while the Pacers were preparing to inbound the ball. It was almost as if Thompson thanked Cunningham for going back to him after the first miss. This is just the third appearance of the season for Thompson, whose rookie campaign ended early due to the blood clot issue. Bickerstaff has reiterated the organization would be patient with the 21-year-old wing’s recovery. Thompson is averaging 4.3 points, 2.7 rebounds and 4.0 assists on 23.2 percent from the field and 28.6 percent from 3-point range in 16.1 minutes. Despite the less-than-stellar shooting percentages, Thompson has been working on his 3-point jumper with Pistons shooting coach Fred Vinson. If Thompson, who possesses elite athleticism and is the team’s best perimeter defender, can develop a consistent 3-point shot, he has a chance to blossom into a premier two-way player. Advertisement The kind that can make a real difference to the Pistons chances. “But, again,” Bickerstaff said, “give Ausar the credit because he had the confidence to keep taking them. He didn’t hesitate.” Thompson had already decided to launch the third one before the pass ever came. “I was shooting it if I got it again,” Thompson said as Jalen Duren blasted Toure in the locker room. Duren is another player who directly benefits from Cunningham’s return. The pick-and-rolls between the two led to one of their signature alley-oops. i missed this. pic.twitter.com/HjHRKzMr7q — Detroit Pistons (@DetroitPistons) November 30, 2024  The two have a chemistry in those situations that Duren doesn’t have with any other player on this roster. He finished with 14 points and 12 rebounds. Duren offers a unique skill set as a big man who averages 3.3 offensive rebounds but also can occasionally bring the ball up the floor and initiate offense on his own. Cunningham just adds another wrinkle to his game with the ability to turn him into a lob threat. Thompson’s lone basket was Cunningham’s ninth assist of the game. In the three games he missed, the highest assist total from a single player was eight by Jaden Ivey in the win over the Toronto Raptors on Monday. Cunningham’s 11 assists only give a glimpse of how his vision and passing boost the Pistons. At 6 foot 6, his ability to see over the defense coupled with his control of the offense creates opportunities that aren’t there otherwise. The crosscourt skip passes Cunningham makes, even those that didn’t lead to baskets, move the defense in a way that opens up opportunities. He did enter Friday’s game averaging a career-high 4.6 turnovers per game and added six more against the Pacers. But turnovers are part of life as the primary ballhandler, and Cunningham’s next stage of development is ball security even while having to force the issue to maximize the attention he draws. Advertisement Nonetheless, his 11 assists accounted for 26 points scored by seven Pistons. Ivey, who took charge of the primary ballhandling duties while Cunningham was out, was another beneficiary of Cunningham’s playmaking Friday. Rather than being the one to initiate offense and make plays for others, Ivey was free to focus more on scoring and let his assists come within the flow of the offense. The Purdue product had seven turnovers to one assist in 18 minutes in Wednesday’s loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. But in Indiana, with Cunningham running the show, he finished with 23 points, six assists, five rebounds and three turnovers on 8-of-13 shooting. And Thompson is the latest piece of that foundation, which is why Friday’s moment was significant. Cunningham highlighted the value of Thompson by going back to him even after two bad misses. But on the third one, Thompson displayed the potential of these young Pistons. He stepped right into the corner 3 with purpose and before it even went through the net, Thompson began trotting toward the opposite end of the court knowing his shot was good. And of course, he pointed at Cunningham for good measure. “The next one came to him,” Bickerstaff said, “and he got it back and knocked it down.

The long-awaited report from FIFA’s sub-committee on human rights and social responsibility — finally published on Friday at midnight Central European Time — says the governing body “took a number of steps to seek to meet its responsibility to respect human rights” as part of the delivery of the tournament two years ago. Advertisement However, FIFA failed to meet one of the report’s primary recommendations of using the Qatar Legacy Fund to remedy workers impacted by human rights abuses, instead announcing they would donate the money to several other programmes which will not directly compensate workers in Qatar. FIFA insisted the study was not “a legal assessment of the obligation to remedy”. The independent study, commissioned by the sub-committee and developed by the business and human rights advisory firm ‘Human Level’, notes that “a number of severe human rights impacts did ultimately occur in Qatar from 2010 through 2022” for a number of workers connected to the tournament. This included “deaths, injuries and illnesses; wages not being paid for months on end; and significant debt faced by workers and their families reimbursing the fees they paid to obtain jobs in Qatar.” While acknowledging that “the main responsibility to rectify such shortcomings lies with the direct employers of these workers as well as with the Qatari government” the sub-committee “endorses the view expressed in the Human Level Study that FIFA too has a responsibility to take additional measures to contribute to the provision of remedy to these workers.” World Cup organizers have put the number of deaths directly linked to the delivery of the tournament at 40. Human rights groups have long estimated that thousands of workers died. GO DEEPER Explained: Why it is so hard to provide a death toll for Qatar’s migrant workers A FIFA spokesperson said: “All reports and recommendations were considered during a comprehensive review by the FIFA administration and relevant bodies. While all recommendations could not be met, practical and impactful elements were retained. “It should be noted that the study did not specifically constitute a legal assessment of the obligation to remedy.” The report recommends that FIFA should use its Qatar Legacy Fund to remedy workers impacted or, for those who died, their family members. Advertisement The sub-committee advises them to “act upon the intention, as indicated by FIFA in a press release of 19 November 2022, to dedicate the FIFA World Cup 2022 Legacy Fund in full or in part to further strengthen the competition’s legacy for migrant workers.” However, two days before the report’s publication FIFA announced the $50million fund would instead be used on a series of social programmes globally in collaboration with Qatar and three organisations, the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Trade Organization (WTO) and UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, instead. A FIFA spokesperson said: “The creation of the FIFA World Cup 2022 Legacy Fund was unanimously endorsed by the FIFA Council following a proposal made by the FIFA governance, audit and compliance committee. “A Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was established in Qatar in 2018 and FIFA believes the new Legacy Fund, endorsed by recognised international agencies, is a pragmatic and transparent initiative that will encompass social programmes to help people most in need across the world.” Following the award of the World Cup to Qatar, FIFA has added human rights as a consideration as part of its bidding process for tournaments. On Friday FIFA’s evaluation report for Saudi Arabia’s 2034 World Cup bid declared the risk assessment for human rights to be “medium”. A vote on the hosts for the tournament — where the Saudi bid has no rival — will take place at the FIFA Congress on December 11.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Nebraska repaid the disrespect against Iowa. Spare us the insincere audacity,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5958215/2024/11/30/nebraska-iowa-college-football-hand-shake/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 15:17:06 GMT",Another close loss to Iowa could define Nebraska's season more than the Huskers think it will.,"NCAAF IOWA CITY, Iowa — So people are wondering why the Nebraska captains refused to shake hands on Friday night before the coin toss at Kinnick Stadium. Let me try to explain. They do not like Iowa. Those Nebraska players didn’t want to engage in an act of good sportsmanship in the company of that opponent. They did not care about respecting the game in a series that has included repeated moments of disrespect — in their view — committed by the Hawkeyes and directed at Nebraska. Advertisement The Huskers are not above a petty gesture. They are mad. They’ve had enough. And it’s disingenuous of the Hawkeyes to act as if they don’t understand or that this protest came out of the blue. Nebraska selects game captains before each kickoff. On Friday, Elliott Brown, Emmett Johnson, MJ Sherman and DeShon Singleton walked to the center of the field. When the Iowa captains moved to shake the Huskers’ hands, a traditional gesture, the four from Nebraska didn’t move. Ope 😂  pic.twitter.com/jTJlQnJOUH — Hawkeye Football (@HawkeyeFootball) November 30, 2024  “That was a little weird,” Iowa linebacker Jay Higgins said after the 13-10 Iowa victory. Was it, though? Understand that tradition in this series is for Iowa to rip out the Huskers’ hearts. It happened again on Friday. Defensive lineman Max Llewellyn stripped Nebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola and recovered his fumble with 20 seconds to play before Drew Stevens nailed a 53-yard field goal as time expired to beat the Huskers 13-10. Imagine getting kicked in the gut over and over and watching the bully celebrate in your face. Four times now in the past seven years, Iowa has beaten Nebraska on field goals in the final seconds. Last year in Lincoln, amazingly, Iowa defensive lineman Ethan Hurkett intercepted QB Chubba Purdy in the final 20 seconds and the Hawkeyes won 13-10 on a 38-yard field goal by Marshall Meeder as time expired. In celebration of reclaiming the Freedom Trophy after Nebraska’s lone win since 2014 two years ago, Iowa players waved goodbye to the Huskers and their fans, wishing them, “Merry Christmas,” before Nebraska stayed at home in bowl season for a seventh consecutive year. It was painful, second-year Nebraska coach Matt Rhule said last week. GO DEEPER Iowa tops Nebraska on 53-yard walk-off field goal: Hawkeyes-Huskers takeaways In 2019, Iowa kicker Keith Duncan hit a 48-yard walk-off field goal at Nebraska, then turned to the home bench, wagged his finger and blew kisses at the Huskers. On Friday when Nebraska players arrived at Kinnick Stadium and moved toward the center of the field to gather as a team in prayer, uniformed police officers guarded the logo. There will be no meeting on 50 yd line. Odd how this has become a thing. pic.twitter.com/fFnhloycx0 — Damon Benning (@damonbenning) November 29, 2024  Nebraska didn’t play dirty against Iowa on Friday. It was a clean game — aside from the Huskers’ special teams blunders, blown assignments in the second half and the late turnover. They didn’t head hunt. They didn’t try to start fights or commit personal fouls. Common in rivalry games, those actions would have crossed the line of poor sportsmanship. Advertisement But a silent protest before the coin toss as a reminder of the motivation in play? Spare us the insincere audacity. Higgins and his teammates either chose not to pay attention, or the Hawkeyes knew exactly why Nebraska wanted to send a message that it was done with getting bullied. None of the Nebraska game captains, in defeat, were made available to the media. And problem is, the strategy backfired on the Huskers. GO DEEPER Nebraska football seniors left their mark despite losses: ‘They played so damn hard’ Nebraska dominated much of the game. It pitched a shutout until late in the third quarter when Iowa could only kick a field goal after it recovered a muffed punt at the Nebraska 4-yard line. The Huskers held Iowa to 20 yards and one first down in the first half — and a paltry five first downs in the game. But Kaleb Johnson raced for 72 yards, 44 percent of the Hawkeyes’ output, on the first play of the fourth quarter to even the score and foretell the inevitable Nebraska collapse. “Very similar to last year and probably years previous,” Rhule said. “We found a way to lose the game at the end.” Rhule said he was beyond disappointed in the finish. He said he was angry. “Credit to them,” the coach said. “Those guys, they’ve won for a long time. They believe. They make the plays all the way to the very end. We’ve got to catch them.” The Huskers, at 6-6, lost five games this year by a total of 29 points. In four, against Ohio State, UCLA, USC and Iowa, they committed turnovers at the end with plentiful time available to win or even the score. And in the fifth, Raiola missed an open receiver in the end zone that would have put the Huskers ahead before Illinois won in overtime. Nebraska is set for the first time since 2016 to accept a bowl invitation next weekend. The season is not over. But it has been defined by these late-game miscues. “One game doesn’t define us,” senior defensive lineman Ty Robinson said. Advertisement No. But five do. After last season, when the Huskers lost four games by a field goal and a fifth in overtime, they created a mantra, “Chasing 3.” Nebraska built its offseason regimen and motivational base around the bid to get three points better. The irony was thick in cold Kinnick air on Friday. “We had to do what they did,” Rhule said. He said he doesn’t believe in bad luck. “We’ve just got to get better.” Raiola said he “couldn’t be more proud” of the progress Nebraska has made since Week 1. “Losing this way doesn’t do justice to all the success and the strides that we’ve made as a team,” the freshman QB said. But progress is measured largely by wins. Against Iowa, Nebraska counts one win in the past decade. Its pregame gesture on Friday, while not an affront to the sport of football or anything more than a turnabout against Iowa, rung hollow. In the end, when it always matters for Nebraska against Iowa, the Huskers fell short again. “It should probably bother people for a little bit,” Rhule said. Rest assured, people are bothered.

As Max Christie crouched in his stance, waiting for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to charge, coach JJ Redick called out a defensive coverage. Advertisement Christie, misunderstanding what Redick was signaling, thought his coach was implying the Lakers had a foul to give and fouled Gilgeous-Alexander on a drive. The Lakers did not have a foul to give. The Thunder were already in the bonus — and had been in the bonus for several minutes. Gilgeous-Alexander calmly walked to the free-throw line and sank both shots, extending the Thunder’s lead to four with 22.4 seconds left and essentially icing the game. “It was a misinterpretation on my part,” Christie said. “I knew the time and score of the game, but I didn’t realize they were in the bonus. … I take responsibility for that. … I’m not going to say that my mistake cost us the entire game, but it was definitely probably the biggest one of the game.” The Lakers’ 101-93 loss to the Thunder on Friday dropped them to 11-8 and eliminated them from the NBA Cup. Los Angeles has lost three straight home games and four of five games overall, with several coming against teams that project as some of the best in the West (the Thunder, Denver Nuggets and Phoenix Suns). Christie’s foul may have been the loudest error, but it was far from the only one. On the next possession, Austin Reaves, who played through an arm injury he suffered late in the second quarter that required him to briefly leave the game, threw an errant pass to Dalton Knecht that was picked off for a game-sealing dunk by Jalen Williams. LeBron James, Reaves and Russell combined for 14 of the Lakers’ 17 turnovers, which led to 20 points for the Thunder, who lead the league in points off turnovers. And for a Lakers team that ranks 25th in the NBA in defense, those types of errors are too much to overcome against elite competition. “There were half-dozen to a dozen plays that just shot us in the foot even before the late-game stuff,” Redick said. “We played well enough and hard enough to win against the best team in the West. So, there’s definitely good stuff.” Advertisement James, in particular, had several inexcusable turnovers. He had multiple travels and jump-passes that ended up in the Thunder’s hands. He’s turned the ball over four or more times in nine straight games and five or more times in four straight games. The past two-plus weeks have easily been one of the worst decision-making stretches of his legendary career. James had 59 turnovers in 14 games in November. The last time he had that many turnovers in a month was January 2021, and he did so in 16 games. High-usage superstars will always be among the league leaders in turnovers. Still, many of James’ recent miscues have been questionable. “They got great hands,” James said of the Thunder. “Very aggressive at the point of attack. They got some guys that can guard the ball. They do a good job of getting their hands on loose rocks out there, 50-50 balls.” The loss undermined what had otherwise been one of the Lakers’ best defensive performances of the season. The Lakers followed up an impressive defensive outing against the San Antonio Spurs by holding the Thunder to 101 points, including 40.9-percent shooting and 32.5-percent 3-point shooting. Oklahoma City scored just 39 points across the second and third quarters. Los Angeles also allowed a season-low 38 paint points. The Lakers did a good job of both walling off the paint and spraying out to shooters. The Thunder’s offensive system is difficult to stop because they have shooting and ballhandling everywhere, forcing the opposing defense to get into rotation and scramble. The Lakers held up as well as they reasonably could. “That was as connected as our group has been on that end of the floor since the first game of the season,” Redick said. “Just a really outstanding job with a lot of the stuff we talked about.” Their only defensive shortcomings were they didn’t force many turnovers (the Thunder had only 10), and they allowed 15 offensive rebounds as the hectic style of defense allowed the Thunder perimeter to crash among the chaos. Advertisement Those two OKC advantages — along with Los Angeles’ turnovers — led the Thunder to attempt 20 more shots than the Lakers, which was the difference in the game. “I mean, when you’re shading and helping a lot – especially against Shai and J-Dub – they have a numbers game on offensive rebounding,” James said. “But we got to do a better job of trying to clean glass.” Following a 3-0 start against three playoff-caliber opponents and a six-game win streak that propelled them to 10-4, the Lakers have seemingly been reminded of their place in the league hierarchy recently. They were crushed in the second half in demoralizing blowout losses to the Denver Nuggets and Phoenix Suns. They also lost nail-biters to the Orlando Magic and Thunder in which they executed poorly down the stretch. Their lone win was a rout of the San Antonio Spurs, who are above .500 but just 10th in the West. They went just 1-4 in this five-game stretch that some around the organization felt would be telling of where they currently stand. Near the quarter-mark of the season, the Lakers appear to be an above-average team that can compete with just about anybody any night, but can’t always summon the defensive effort, focus or execution to beat the league’s best. They are 7-1 against teams below .500 and just 4-7 against teams above .500. The beginning of December will further test the Lakers. After their pitstop at home — the Lakers played a back-to-back in Phoenix and San Antonio before Thanksgiving — they head back on the road for a four-game trip in Utah, Minnesota, Miami and Atlanta. The Lakers have already dropped to sixth in the West after being in the top four for much of the early part of the season, and are at risk of finding themselves in an unenviable hole if they can’t stop this skid soon. “We got to figure it out,” James said of the upcoming road trip. “Lean on each other if you don’t have it. … It’s going to be a tough road trip for us. We got to be ready to go.” (Top photo: Ronald Martinez/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Naz Reid's sweat equity pushes Timberwolves to snap miserable skid,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5957709/2024/11/30/naz-reid-timberwolves-snap-skid/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 14:24:06 GMT","""As a group, after the game, I asked them how bad do we want to win?"" Anthony Edwards said.","NBA The only thing Minnesota Timberwolves fans have wanted to see from their team all season long has been a heartbeat. They booed the Wolves off the floor in back-to-back losses to the Houston Rockets and Sacramento Kings earlier in the week. Their ire was drawn not because the Wolves were losing games. It was how they were losing them, shoulders slumped and energy low without an ounce of fight to be seen. Advertisement At the start of the fourth quarter on Friday night against the LA Clippers, Naz Reid made them look. It started with the Wolves clinging to a 72-68 lead and Clippers wing Jordan Miller surging up the court in transition. He missed a tough layup, and Reid hustled back in transition to be in position for a rebound, starting a flurry of winning plays from him born of the desperation from a four-game losing streak. On the Clippers’ next possession, Terance Mann was streaking down the court for an easy layup when Reid did his best LeBron James impression with a soaring chase-down block to wipe another two points off the board. THIS BLOCK 🫣 pic.twitter.com/ZnhOOskjF2 — Minnesota Timberwolves (@Timberwolves) November 30, 2024  Donte DiVincenzo broke out of a terrible shooting slump with a 3-pointer on the other end, and suddenly a crowd that had its eyes glazed over by a combination of tryptophan and Timberwolves turnovers was on its feet, roaring its approval and begging for more. Naz obliged. With the game tied at 80 and under eight minutes to play, DiVincenzo threw an ill-advised bounce pass at Rudy Gobert’s ankles. The ball bounced around the Wolves half court like a pinball, squirting out past the 3-point arch and on its way out of bounds for what was going to be another Timberwolves turnover. Instead, Reid dove to the floor and tapped it to DiVincenzo, who banked in a 3 just before the shot clock expired. a DDV 3 👌 pic.twitter.com/TUHCiQ5nFe — Minnesota Timberwolves (@Timberwolves) November 30, 2024  Target Center bumped Nas’s hip-hop anthem, “Made You Look” in tribute to Reid’s work ethic. It’s a song that normally signals a scoring binge, but Reid is one of several Wolves who has yet to find an offensive rhythm this season. So he took pride in impacting the game in other ways on Friday night. Advertisement “I’m not just an offensive player. When my shot’s not falling, I’m always going to try to make the extra effort in some way, shape or form,” Reid said. The Timberwolves have a term of endearment for the kind of plays that Reid was delivering in Friday’s 93-92 win. They call them “big little plays,” according to Nickeil Alexander-Walker, who had a few of his own on his way to 12 points and 10 rebounds. “The game had turned against us, and he turned it back by getting those plays, particularly that chase-down in transition was huge,” coach Chris Finch said on Reid. The Wolves (9-10) needed every one of them on a night when they shot 41 percent from the field and turned it over 21 times. The offense was largely inept, but Minnesota kept itself in the game with pure desperation. They had lost seven of their previous nine games, a ghastly skid filled with missed shots, ole defense and bad body language. The vibes were such that Edwards gave a blunt critique of their lack of connectivity after collapsing against the Kings on Wednesday night. “Everyone’s still a little too into their own struggles,” Finch said before the game. “We just gotta be better when we give ourselves a chance to win.” If the shots aren’t falling, the only way forward is with sweat equity. Edwards was just 7 of 21 from the field, but he teamed up with Gobert, Alexander-Walker and Jaden McDaniels to hold Clippers star James Harden to 20 points on 20 shots. Gobert was just 3 of 7 from the field with three turnovers, but he also made his presence felt at the rim on defense and grabbed 12 rebounds. Julius Randle made several aggressive plays as the low man in the Wolves defense and grabbed 10 rebounds to go with 11 points. “Those are winning plays. We talked as a team how we want to win and change it around and get back to who we are defensively,” Edwards said. “Those are things that we gotta do over and over and over again, no matter how tiring it is, how exhausting it is.” Advertisement It was far from a perfect night for Reid. He missed 6 of 9 shots for eight points in 23 minutes. There were a couple of defensive rotations that Reiz was a hair late on, giving Nicolas Batum enough space to launch a 3. The Wolves had their hands full with the Clippers despite them missing Kawhi Leonard and Norman Powell. If they were clicking on all cylinders and connected the way Finch wants them to be, this would have been a double-digit victory. But every game is a grind for the Wolves these days, and they were happy to finally get back on the winning side of things. “That’s just the way we need to play regardless,” Reid said. “You see what it does. It’s good for us. We win games like that. I think that’s just how we need to play overall.” Each time a Wolves player was on the floor for a loose ball or scrambled out to the corner on a defensive rotation, the home crowd’s volume increased as if willing the team to embrace that down-and-dirty style. It was a welcome change for the home team after a couple of ugly performances and it probably wasn’t a coincidence that the struggling DiVincenzo had his best game in a while. The newness of the situation post-KAT trade and the ongoing chemistry experiment between Randle and Gobert have made the Timberwolves one of the bigger disappointments in the league to this point. Through all of the struggles, they have insisted that they just need some time to familiarize themselves with one another. A one-point win over a short-handed team at the end of a four-game road trip will do little to convince anyone that they have solved their problems. But they have to start somewhere. “As a group, after the game, I asked them how bad do we want to win?” Edwards said. “If we want to win, we’re gonna do that (stuff) every game. We’re not going to do it one game, and not do it the next game.” (Photo of Naz Reid and Rudy Gobert: Jordan Johnson / NBAE via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Flares are burning in the freezing night and banners whip through the cold air. The home stands are duelling with each another, trading songs across the pitch, to salute a 3-1 victory over Holstein Kiel. Beyond the stands, the neon glow of the winter fair is pulsing in the distance as a blue and green orbiter somersaults in the dark. Advertisement St Pauli are newly promoted to the Bundesliga this season. Prior to this game week, they had scored just seven goals from 11 matches, none of which had come at home. They have been resilient. They have by far the best defensive record in the bottom half of the division and have conceded fewer than Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen. But that lack of goals at the other end has kept them towards the foot of the table. They have consistently been in the bottom four of a division from which two are relegated automatically and one faces a playoff. This was a game that had to be won. When the full-time whistle blows, goals from Manolis Saliakas, Morgan Guilavogui and Johannes Eggestein have secured the win, the three points, and — until Saturday afternoon at least — the safety of 15th place. The Millerntor roars. It has seen its first win and goals — by St Pauli at least — of the season. Survival suddenly seems possible. Six months ago, everything was different. Needing a win to clinch promotion, St Pauli hammered Osnabruck in brilliant sunshine. When the full-time whistle blew on that 4-0 win, the fans rushed onto the Millerntor pitch from all four sides. The players were swallowed up and Fabian Hurzeler, the head coach, was hoisted up on shoulders and held up in the light. Hurzeler’s was a remarkable story. In his first full season coaching professional football, he had — in spite of a meagre budget — taken St Pauli back to the Bundesliga for the first time since 2011. And then he was gone. Off to Brighton. He has done wonderfully well and most who paid attention to his rise are not surprised by that. From a St Pauli perspective, however, it was devastating. The team he left was full of players who were performing at the highest level of their careers — Jackson Irvine, Dapo Afolayan, Eric Smith, Elias Saad and many others — but without him the Bundesliga was a daunting rather than exhilarating prospect. Added to this, Marcel Hartel left for MLS club St Louis as his contract expired. Hartel scored 17 goals and provided 12 assists last season. He took corners and free kicks, too. St Pauli lost their coach and their top scorer in a single summer, and with them their hope. It was quite an inheritance for Alexander Blessin. He moved from Union Saint-Gilloise in Belgium and replaced Hurzeler in June, and has had the unenviable task of galvanising a team loyal to someone else. The dynamics of the challenge he faced were understated, too, which is really a feature of local life. St Pauli — to the outside world — are not really about the football. The game comes second, behind the politics, the activism and the socialising. When people talk and write about St Pauli, often the last thing they mention is what happens on the pitch. Advertisement That might reflect how some supporters feel. Particularly many of the older ones, for whom the club is a meeting point and an identity. It is for many of the young people, too, and for those who arrive in Hamburg from outside Germany, searching for their first sense of belonging. But the football matters — probably more than many realise. Promotion brought an outpouring of pride. There were tears in the stands and among club staff, too. Six months later, that same pride is still there, even if it feels more defiant now in the midst of this fight against the drop. After the game, Jacob is on the U3 train towards Barmbek. Someone had spilt beer on him during the game and the right shoulder of his grey hoodie is still a slightly different colour to the rest. He tells The Athletic the perception that football is not that important at St Pauli is a source of annoyance. “Because I’m super proud of the team and we achieved a lot by getting promoted. And now we want to stay. Yeah, I love the fan scene, but we can have both, no? That with the football.” Another fan is sitting opposite him. He’s wearing a three-quarter-length black jacket and a black hat with St Pauli’s distinctive Totenkopf. It’s not clear whether they went to the game together, or are just sharing a journey home, but he agrees. “Look at HSV. Every year,” he says, rubbing his thumb and forefingers together, describing how much Hamburg’s other club spend, “and they are still in the 2.Bundesliga. But look at this.” He gestures through the window, vaguely back towards the Millerntor. No two St Pauli supporters seem to think about the club in quite the same way. That is a lesson from a few years spent in Hamburg. The St Pauli fans on the carriage melt away with each passing station. On the platform at Barmbek, The Athletic talks to an older fan — bundled up against the cold, wearing a brown and white scarf in a thick knot — who did not go to the game at all, or even watch it. He just spent the night in a bar close to the ground and seems bemused by the question. It depends who you ask. It depends what mood they are in. It also depends who is doing the asking. But the atmosphere inside the ground is the real tell. The Millerntor quivers with each kick of the ball and thunders its approval at every clattering tackle. Perhaps the perception is of a crowd with their backs to the game and something else in their heart. Not at all. It is desperate to see its team survive. Advertisement And they may just. Blessin has not reinvented Hurzeler’s team. They are still good with the ball and determined to play out from the back, as Hurzeler insisted on. Their defence is intact from last season and that has certainly helped. Goalkeeper Nikola Vasilj joined the club a few years ago and he has brought continuity. He makes an excellent penalty save in the first half to keep the score 1-0. But Blessin has also coached his way around some significant issues. His side do not have a prolific goalscorer, at least not a target man or traditional No 9. Last season, that was less of problem. In the 2.Bundesliga, St Pauli averaged almost 60 per cent possession in games and were very much a front-foot side. At the level above — inevitably — that control has weakened, and the average is closer to 40 per cent. In response, Blessin has coaxed wonderful counter-attacking impact from Afolayan and Guilavogui, who combined masterfully for the second goal against Kiel, and encouraged Eggestein to be one of the most hard-running and selfless forwards in the division. As of Friday, he has run 126km so far this season, the eighth-furthest in the Bundesliga and the only forward to be inside the top 10. The Kiel game was his payoff: he assisted the first two goals and scored the third, finally killing the game in the 86th minute. Eggestein is criticised for his lack of goals and has faced considerable pressure from local media. His scoreless run has been a constant topic in press conferences. Needless to say, there was no more popular goalscorer on Friday and nobody who enjoyed the night more than he did. So, this is a team and they have their crowd at their back. St Pauli are not happy to have their day out in the Bundesliga and then vanish away without a fuss, back to worrying about everything other than the football. They like it here and they want to stay.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,The Bears finally fired Matt Eberflus. But he lost the locker room long ago,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5957910/2024/11/30/matt-eberflus-fired-bears-players-locker-room/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 12:00:31 GMT",The Shane Waldron experience and the Hail Mary debacle cost Eberflus credibility at Halas Hall. The Thanksgiving loss was the last straw.,"NFL Another crushing, confounding loss for the Chicago Bears meant another postgame speech about “sticking together” from head coach Matt Eberflus in front of a frustrated, crowded locker room at Ford Field in Detroit. This time, though, team captain Jaylon Johnson wasn’t having it. Not after another winnable game slipped away — a 23-20 loss to the Lions on Thanksgiving. Advertisement Not after another day of highly questionable coaching decisions. This postgame message required a different tone, a different vibe, and probably a different voice. Like a lot of Bears players, Johnson had had enough. Sick of finding new ways to give games away, they wanted accountability and answers. “Jaylon went crazy,” one Bears player said. “He was very emotional and pissed but rightfully so. He’s been here longer than most.” Said another player: “He was going off more so at (Eberflus).” GO DEEPER Who could be the Bears' next head coach? Here are 15 potential candidates According to multiple players and staffers in the locker room, some players were asking why Eberflus didn’t call a timeout. Other players got going, too. “Guys were furious,” a staff member said. “It was an accumulation of this season.” “The locker room was ugly,” another staffer said. “There was a lot of yelling.” Said the first player: “We felt as players it’s been too many instances where we fought our way back into games to lose because of bad time management and decision-making.”  Multiple sources added that the emotions were so high between the players and their head coach that Eberflus left the locker room immediately after his speech and the exchange with players. There was nothing left to say. It was a moment for this Bears team that would inevitably force chairman George McCaskey into something the franchise had never done before. By Friday morning, Eberflus was out — but not before the team decided to have him address the media over Zoom just after 9 a.m. Two hours later, he was gone. The Bears made it official by sharing statements from general manager Ryan Poles and president/CEO Kevin Warren. A team source explained that McCaskey, Poles and Warren were still meeting during the scheduled news conference. At that point, no decision had been made about Eberflus’ future so there was no reason to delay the presser, which might have signaled something big was happening. By the time the decision to fire Eberflus was made, the news conference was over. Advertisement With two years remaining on a five-year contract, Eberflus became the first head coach ever fired by the Bears during a season. While Eberflus was liked by some in the building, his records in one-score games (5-19, the NFL’s worst record during his tenure) and in NFC North matchups (2-13) were abysmal. His decision to hire Shane Waldron to be quarterback Caleb Williams’ first offensive coordinator in the NFL transformed into a dysfunctional debacle in a matter of weeks. And his clock management and situational football awareness were even worse. Unfortunately for the Bears, what happened in the final 32 seconds in Detroit wasn’t the first time that Eberflus’ decision-making left those at Halas Hall or watching from home wondering if he was equipped for the job. The unraveling began weeks earlier during the team’s disastrous loss to the Washington Commanders. In that game, the defense gave up a Hail Mary touchdown in the closing seconds. Cornerback Tyrique Stevenson missed his assignment completely, tipping the ball into the hands of Noah Brown for the game-winning touchdown. To make matters worse, Stevenson was caught interacting with fans moments before the play. Eberflus told Stevenson days later that he wouldn’t start against the Arizona Cardinals. Upset with the news, Stevenson briefly left practice to calm himself before returning.

Players pointed to the play before the Hail Mary. Eberflus allowed Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels to complete a 13-yard pass on the penultimate play and then didn’t call a timeout before the Hail Mary to discuss his defense and calm emotions. When he was asked about it by reporters, Eberflus downplayed the importance of Daniels’ 13-yard completion to receiver Terry McLaurin and even doubled down on his decision, which many believe was among the mistakes. Advertisement “That didn’t sit well in the locker room,” a player said. “It didn’t go over right,” the second player said. “That week is when he lost the defensive guys.” As the Bears’ losing streak expanded, there was a shift in tone and messaging from Eberflus when discussing the team’s latest problems. He seemed to go out of his way to take the blame for nearly everything. His subsequent attempts to take accountability felt insincere to the players. By then, it was too little, too late. The damage was done in Washington and in the days that followed. Eberflus never led his team through that loss. “As a leader of men,” one of the Bears players said, “you’re supposed to take blame for everything that happens under your watch.” GO DEEPER Bears go from 'HITS' to firing a coach in-season: The Matt Eberflus timeline The first signal that the Bears were going to function differently during this season was the firing of Waldron on Nov. 12, which came two days after losing 19-3 to the New England Patriots and just nine games into his tenure as offensive coordinator. For the Bears, it was a break from the past. The team had never fired an offensive coordinator during the season, either. Players’ frustrations with Waldron had been bubbling since the summer. The new offensive coordinator changed the Bears’ run game, scrapping two years of progress under offensive line coach Chris Morgan. His decision to install a pure progression passing system — a challenging scheme even for veteran QBs — further complicated things for Williams. Players voiced concerns to their head coach at various times but rarely felt heard. Receiver Keenan Allen told reporters at Halas Hall after Waldron’s firing that Waldron was “too nice of a guy,” a sentiment that other players shared. “He just didn’t demand things properly,” one player said. That included how Waldron handled coaching Williams. After the loss to the Patriots, meetings at Halas Hall grew tense. Some team leaders even floated the idea of benching Williams in favor of backup Tyson Bagent, believing Waldron’s system was hurting the rookie’s growth. Two days later, Waldron was fired. A team source said Warren wanted changes. Advertisement Eberflus considered keeping Waldron on the staff, but it didn’t happen. “Where they messed up was with Shane and making him the coordinator to begin with,” the player said. Thomas Brown, then the team’s passing game coordinator, was named offensive coordinator and provided an instant jolt for everyone involved in the offense. Even assistant coaches hired by Waldron quickly got on board with Brown. His communication style and leadership skills earned the respect of players and staff. “There’s been a little bit better communication clearly from the top down as far as what we’re trying to get accomplished,” wide receivers coach Chris Beatty told The Athletic in an interview before Thanksgiving.  “I think there’s been expanded roles for everybody. That’s allowed some guys to be able to interject with some new ideas and different ways of doing some things.” GO DEEPER For Matt Eberflus and Bears, the math didn't work out. What is next formula for success? With Brown in charge, the pure progression passing scheme was kept, but different concepts and plays were added to get the ball out of Williams’ hand more quickly. The Bears turned to tighter formations and more motions. “Instead of doing pure progressions all the time and going full-field reads, we kind of changed some of those thoughts to make it 1-to-2 (reads) to use your legs,” Beatty said. “And so those things are showing up.” The biggest change discussed among players is Brown’s leadership presence, something the Bears had been missing. One player suggested that the way Brown is during his news conferences is just a glimpse into how he functions behind the scenes. The Bears are bought in. “He’s in charge — and he’s done a great job of being in charge,” Beatty said. “We were lacking some of that at the beginning (on offense). So I think those things have shown up. It’s a … clearer line of communication as opposed to how it was.” Advertisement In an 18-day span, Brown was promoted from passing game coordinator to offensive coordinator to, now, interim head coach. The Bears now face the challenge of finding stability in a season defined by change. Early signs have been promising, but his ability to galvanize the locker room while leading Williams’ development will be closely monitored by Poles and Warren. He’ll continue calling plays, too. “He’s just a direct person — direct, honest,” quarterbacks coach Kerry Joseph told The Athletic before the Lions game. “He knows what he wants to get across and is confident about it. And he’s Thomas. That’s the thing you love about him being around him. Caleb’s been good. That relationship has been good and (they’re) just kind of growing in it. “To be elite, there’s a certain way to do things and he knows that. That’s what Thomas brings. There’s a certain way to do it — and it’s the right way to do it. And that’s the way we’re going to do it. When you say ‘direct,’ that’s what it is. It’s authentic. It’s honest and he understands what it takes to be elite as a player, as a team.” GO DEEPER Football, fatherhood and new opportunities: Get to know new Bears OC Thomas Brown The next five weeks can be viewed as an elongated interview for Brown. Williams could be an essential part of what’s next for the Bears, but now Brown must prove he can relate to everyone on the roster and not cost his team games. For a team desperate for accountability and clear direction, Brown might be the leader they’ve been searching for. “There’s an authenticity about him that’s infectious and everybody responds to it,” tight ends coach Jim Dray said in an interview with The Athletic before Thanksgiving. “Very clear, very concise, very measured on what it is expected — and he holds everybody accountable.” (Top photo: Brooke Sutton / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How has the Oilers' start impacted future roster decisions? Stan Bowman Q&A,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5957912/2024/11/30/oilers-standings-start-stan-bowman/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 12:00:14 GMT","The Oilers are well ahead of their dismal 5-12-1 mark at this time last season, but they’re not where they should be, either.","NHL SALT LAKE CITY, Utah — American Thanksgiving has long been a signpost for how NHL teams are doing and what improvements need to be made. The Edmonton Oilers are well ahead of their dismal 5-12-1 mark at this time last season, but they’re not where they should be, either. With that in mind, it seemed like a good time to check in with GM Stan Bowman, who’s still learning on the fly about his team after being hired in July to replace Ken Holland. Advertisement Bowman sat down with The Athletic before Friday’s 4-3 overtime win against Utah, which left them with a 12-9-2 record, to discuss the Oilers’ start and where they can — and should — go from here. Note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity. We’re a little more than a quarter of the way through the season. How do you feel about your team? Where do you think your team’s at? We had a slow start. There’s no question about it. Probably should have a couple more wins than we have right now. I think we’re a little better than our record, but not way better. A few of those games early I thought we played pretty good, but we didn’t get the results. When you dig yourself a hole like that, it puts a little bit more stress on the group. But I thought we responded well and we got going, particularly on the road. We’ve been a pretty good road team this year. So, there’s elements of the game that I’m happy with. I would say that the areas that we struggled are the areas I didn’t expect us to struggle — scoring goals, power play, penalty kill. Those are probably the three areas that we haven’t been very strong. The area that was so talked about was our defence. The defence has played well. That hasn’t really been an issue. It was just a bit of a slow start. Couldn’t get going, couldn’t seem to find the chemistry. Maybe that’s just natural. You can practice all you want, but you got to play some games. Our last stretch here is more like the team that I had expected or envisioned. Is there anything that stands out about why those struggles have occurred? As somebody who’s been a general manager of a team that’s gone deep a lot, do you think that’s more it?  It’s not a great answer, but it is somewhat common (in this situation). Probably more often than not, you don’t get off to the great start that you talk about leading into camp. Everyone talks about wanting to get off to a good start and stress that you don’t want to be playing catch-up. But it just takes some time for the guys to maybe get their own internal rhythm or chemistry going. Advertisement Obviously, Connor (McDavid) and Leon (Draisaitl) really make the team go, and they’ve been excellent — in particular the last 15 or so games. They’ve really played at a high level. The St. Louis Blues are coming to town next week. With the benefit of hindsight, do you feel any differently about not matching those offer sheets to Philip Broberg and Dylan Holloway? No, I don’t. To me, it was really more of a mathematical reality. From a practical perspective of actually having a team that could be compliant with the salary cap, there was really no way to make that financially work. We would have to take someone on our team who’s a significant player, and they would have to be gone. When you really analyze it from that perspective, it was an issue — not just this season, but even a bigger one next season for those amounts. That’s something that I’ve looked at, and I’ve not spent a lot of time thinking about that at all since we made the decision that we weren’t going to have them on the team. It’s really not a reflection on their value as players or their importance to the team. Just, with the way that our team is structured, those salaries just don’t fit. You’ve been a general manager for a while, but you were only on the job for three weeks to a month. Were you surprised when that happened? Yeah. Certainly, it’s an uncommon situation. There’s never been two at the same time. So, I can’t say that I was expecting that. But when it’s in front of you, you evaluate it as best you can and move ahead. Last one on this topic: You mentioned the financial realities of the situation, but, again, you were very new on the job. Did you not having much of a relationship with those players, at least in Edmonton, allow you to look at the situation through a different lens compared to, say, if you would have drafted them? That’s probably fair. Certainly, I didn’t have the same emotional connection with them that the players do, or the fans. I get that, and I was probably coming at it more from a pragmatic standpoint not from an emotional one. Advertisement I don’t know if that’s good or bad, but the hardest part of our game is you’ve got to take the emotion out of it. Especially when you’re in this role, you have to look at things as objectively as possible and take the emotion out of it. Maybe that was an advantage for me relative to some of the other players or fans. I respect and understand the passion and the sadness people dealt with that those players aren’t here. But we have to turn the page and look ahead not backwards. And you did turn the page pretty quickly by acquiring Ty Emberson and Vasily Podkolzin. What have you thought of their starts to the season? I think they’ve both played well. For Podkolzin, it’s weird to say for a guy who’s got one goal (before Friday’s game), but he’s really played well going back to even last month. He started the year on the fourth line, and the one thing I remember about him is just he just does all the right things all the time. He’s got incredible habits. For a coach, it’s really easy to get excited for that, because he does the stuff that a lot of guys just don’t feel like doing sometimes — forecheck, backchecks, finishes his checks, goes to the net. Those are somewhat unheralded things, but someone’s got to do it, right? He wasn’t having much success on the scoresheet, but he just continued to play the same way. He worked his way up the lineup, and they gave him a chance to play with more talented offensive players. I don’t know if he’ll stay there all year, but it’s nice to see that other people recognize and appreciate him … he’s been a nice shot in the arm to our group up front. And Ty, he’s really settled in. In the first couple games, maybe you could tell our team wasn’t playing great, and I think his confidence wasn’t there. Now when I watch him play, he’s a little bit more assertive. He’s a pretty physical player. We don’t have a lot of real physical defencemen. I’ve liked that part of his game. He’s a pretty simple player. Our penalty kill’s struggled, but he’s been pretty good the last stretch. They’ve given him that chance to be in the first unit with (Mattias) Ekholm. That’s helped. He’s got a defined role. How would you categorize any talks you’ve had with pending RFA Evan Bouchard? Have there been any? No, we haven’t really done too much with that yet. We might decide to. I don’t know if there’s a right or a wrong way to approach it, but there’s really nothing to report on that front right now. I guess you don’t feel a lot of urgency there. We have had internal discussions. But as far as engaging with his agent, not really. Whether we will or not, I’m not sure. But he’s playing better lately, too. He got up to a slow start, but it’s nice to see his game rounding into form. Advertisement How have you felt about your plan to accrue cap space whenever you can? Obviously, it’s meant you’ve had a leaner roster. Well, it’s the only option we have right now. If we want to be able to add to our team (before the trade deadline), that’s really the only avenue — unless we’re going to be trading dollar for dollar. The whole point in doing it that way is so that we give ourselves options in the second half. It isn’t ideal. It would be nice to have extra bodies around and maybe some different combinations, but we’re doing the best we can. From a practical perspective, has it posed a lot of challenges with not having the AHL team in the same city, and with having an older roster, too? Yeah, no question about it. We’re not a young group. That’s evident. We’re a little bit different than the start. We got (Kasperi) Kapanen (off waivers last Tuesday) in here now. He’s only played couple games. I guess for our group, he’s a young guy, comparatively. But we’ll see. That’s our game plan. We’re going to stick to it for now. We may have to pivot if we need other players, or if guys aren’t getting it done. For the most part, those depth players haven’t been a big issue. Part of the reason you’re in this situation is the status of Evander Kane, right? Yeah. Is there any update there? Is there even a timeline for a return? It’s still too early. He hasn’t been able to do a lot yet. The first six or eight weeks it’s just letting the surgery heal … I don’t know that he’s to the point where we would know if he’s ahead or behind. He’s going to start ramping that up and actually doing some training soon. But right now, he feels great, he said. He’s doing everything that he can under the timeline. I have no reason to think he won’t be back when he was originally scheduled to be. He played hurt a lot last year. Are you confident that you’re going to get the top-six, top-nine player when he does return? I’m just going by what he’s said. He said, “I’ve never felt this good before.” These are his words. He feels great. So, that’s a good start because he was playing hurt. It’s hard to be at your best when you’re dealing with that. There were some tough injuries. You’ve got to give him credit for sticking it out. Advertisement There’s no reason to think he’s not going to come back and be as strong as can be. You’ve never been his GM, but you’ve probably watched him a lot. He probably provides a different element to this team. He does. I guess Podkolzin is probably the only guy that has that sort of physicality to his game. But Evander’s just different. He’s a more naturally aggressive player, and he can score, too, and he’s got speed. He would be a different element that we don’t really have. You mentioned how pleased you were with your defence. I just wonder then what is the area on your team you’re monitoring the most in terms of room for improvement as we head toward the trade deadline in March? I would say we’re struggling on the power play. We’ve got the players. I mean, it’s the same guys that were great last year, right? Well, (Zach) Hyman’s hurt right now, but he’ll be back soon. So, we have the guys. It’s really just the adjustment. Our power play has been so good for so long that it’s been very heavily scouted … the plays that were successful last year, those have been taken away. They’re starting to figure that out. (The Oilers scored two power-play goals in a game for the first time this season on Friday. They did that 18 times last season.) The other thing that’s complicated it a little bit is we haven’t had a ton of power-play opportunities. There was the stretch there where we had like eight power plays in five games. That’s just not many reps. Even if you are unsuccessful, but you have six or seven in a game, you get the reps. Some of these games, we haven’t scored many goals, but we’ve dominated. The Montreal game (last Monday) is a good example. We didn’t give them anything, really, for two periods. We controlled that game. We couldn’t score. They score late in the second, and then you’re trailing and chasing the game. That’s what happens when you don’t score. You allow teams to hang around. I’d like to try to see our offensive game pick up. Connor and Leon are flying right now. But outside of those two, we haven’t had a lot of guys really clicking on offence. That’s probably the area — goal scoring. I don’t know if it has to be external, though. It’s really just the guys we have here scored a lot of goals last year. And it’s the same group And then you might add Evander Kane, right? Right. Advertisement So, I want to see our power play improve and I want to see, in general, our goal scoring have an uptick. But that doesn’t mean that it’s going to be through new players. There are two roster things that everyone talks about. The first is another top-four defenceman. How much of a priority do you feel like that is for this group? That was the big talk coming into the season, and I understood that looking at it on paper. But our defence has played well. Defence is always something that you never have too much of it. We want that to be a strength, so we’re definitely looking. Whether it’s a quote/unquote top four, whether it’s a lefty or righty, part of that’s going to be dictated by the players that are available and the price. Can we acquire them? We’re, casting a pretty wide net right now with our staff. We haven’t really ruled anyone out. We’ll probably start to narrow that focus maybe around Christmas. From Games 40 to 50 is when we’re going to try to really decide which type of player would be the best one to add. If we can add a defenceman, we’d like to. And the other roster thing is goaltending. I’d be remiss if I didn’t ask you about it. How do you feel about your goaltending? I would say the goaltending has been inconsistent. I wouldn’t say it’s been a strength of our team. There have been certainly moments when the goalies have played great, and there’s moments when they’ve been off their game. I don’t think we’ve seen the best from them, but I wouldn’t say it’s like … A five-alarm fire? Yeah, or red alert or whatever. They’ve been inconsistent, but they’ve shown moments where they can really bail us out when we aren’t playing well. You’d like to try to have them bring that more often, and they’re working on it. But it’s not a big concern for me right now. It seems like you’re trying to increase your cap space because you don’t have a lot on the roster that you can move out. So, what about your prospect capital and your draft capital? Do you feel like you have enough assets there to make a relatively significant trade? Well, we’re going to try. Advertisement There’s a lot of factors in that. Like, I’m not setting the price, right? It’s a negotiated price, and it depends on who else is interested in the player, and how likely are they to get that price. Obviously, it’s not complicated to say we don’t have a ton of draft picks. We traded a lot of them away. We haven’t picked a lot of players in recent drafts, so we were coming at it from a different position than some teams. But hopefully we can pull something off. That’s the art of the deal. (Photo of Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl and Evan Bouchard: Codie McLachlan / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Rodrygo’s return is a positive development with the squad currently dealing with a number of injury issues. Eduardo Camavinga was ruled out for the next three weeks after picking up a hamstring injury during the Champions League defeat to Liverpool on Wednesday. Eder Militao and Dani Carvajal are already out after suffering anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries while David Alaba is still working his way back from his own ACL tear. Aurelien Tchouameni is currently sidelined with an ankle knock while Vinicius Junior this week suffered a hamstring injury which is likely to keep him out until mid December. “Tomorrow Rodrygo will be back,” Ancelotti told a press conference on Saturday. “Next game Tchouameni will be back, soon Vinicius will be back, soon Alaba will be back.” Prior to his injury Rodrygo had featured in 15 games for Madrid in all competitions this season, scoring three goals and adding two assists.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Vikings-Cardinals preview, predictions: Can Minnesota keep pace in the NFC North?",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5957315/2024/11/30/vikings-cardinals-preview-predictions-week-13/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 11:02:56 GMT","The Vikings need a win at home Sunday to stay one game behind the 11-1 Lions, who lead the way in the North and have the NFC's best record.","NFL Only four NFL teams have a better point differential than the Minnesota Vikings, and two of them are NFC North foes. The Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers have already played this week and won. Minnesota has the head-to-head advantage against Green Bay, and Detroit is only a game ahead. For the Vikings to remain in the thick of the conversation down the stretch, they’ll need to beat the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday. GO DEEPER Best division since realignment? Putting the NFC North's dominance in context The Cardinals are plucky. They have a dynamic quarterback and a creative and underrated defensive scheme. The Vikings, who have home-field advantage at U.S. Bank Stadium, are favored by only three points. As always, The Athletic’s Alec Lewis and Jon Krawczynski are here for an in-depth preview. Live: Coach Kevin O'Connell Press Conference  https://t.co/pXpojimzEr — Minnesota Vikings (@Vikings) November 29, 2024  Lewis: Sam Darnold. This has little to do with the Vikings signing Daniel Jones to the practice squad. It’s more about what Darnold has been doing of late and what that might mean for the future. The only quarterbacks with more passing touchdowns than Darnold this season are Lamar Jackson, Joe Burrow and Baker Mayfield. The only quarterbacks with higher big-time throw rates are Josh Allen and Justin Herbert. When Darnold doesn’t turn the ball over, he is as capable as anyone of explosiveness. And the more explosive he is down the stretch, the higher his value will be this offseason. The Cardinals play a non-traditional defensive structure and have unheralded but savvy personnel. Sunday might require Darnold’s best as a post-snap processor, which will serve as another fascinating data point to the Vikings’ potential ceiling and Darnold’s overall trajectory. GO DEEPER Sam Darnold's toughness surfaces when needed in Vikings' overtime victory over Bears Krawczynski: Aaron Jones. I haven’t been able to keep my eyes off of him all year long, but he seems to be getting stronger as December approaches. I wasn’t sure how his body would hold up, but his 106 yards and a touchdown in Chicago was an emphatic statement that he is good to go. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that Darnold had his best statistical game of the season on a day when Jones was a huge factor as well. Three games ago, Jones averaged 5.2 yards per carry in that slog of a win over the Jaguars. Now he faces a Cardinals defense that is 17th against the run, so there should be some room for him to do his thing. Advertisement Lewis: Arizona’s offense. Only the Ravens and Lions have higher explosive play rates than the Cardinals in 2024. Arizona does it via the run and pass, too. Kyler Murray has had a phenomenal season. Marvin Harrison Jr. is a vertical and underneath threat. The only tight ends with more catches than Trey McBride are Brock Bowers and Travis Kelce. James Conner is a bulldozer of a running back. And Arizona’s offensive coordinator, Drew Petzing, has put together a dynamic system featuring multiple styles. The Cardinals play with three tight ends on the field more than any team besides the Steelers. The Vikings have shown a willingness to match those types of looks with base defense (heavier personnel), and they may have to again Sunday. Krawczynski: Playing with fire. The Vikings have been doing it for weeks now. They came out of the gate this season firing on all cylinders, putting together dominant performances and convincing victories. Make no mistake, they took care of business like they needed to do in beating the bumbling Jags, Titans and Bears. But they seemed to mess around with each opponent, making the games harder than they needed to be. Now the schedule gets much more challenging. If they do not increase their sharpness down the stretch against better teams, it’s hard to see them wiggling out of jams like they have the last three weeks. Lewis: Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison and T.J. Hockenson versus the Cardinals cornerbacks. Arizona’s defense has the second-lowest pressure rate in the NFL. The more time Darnold has to throw, the longer the Cardinals secondary will be forced to blanket two of the most dynamic receivers in the NFL. Arizona’s starting outside cornerbacks are Sean Murphy-Bunting and Starling Thomas V. Neither can guard Jefferson or Addison in man-to-man coverage. If the Cardinals decide to double both, Hockenson will feast over the middle of the field. If the Vikings offensive line can hold up, all three of the team’s dynamic receiving weapons could be in for big games. Krawczynski: The Cardinals rushing offense against the Vikings rush defense. Strength against strength. Only five teams in the league have racked up more yards on the ground than the Cardinals. The Vikings, meanwhile, have allowed the fewest rushing yards in the league. Conner, Murray, Trey Benson. Jonathan Greenard, Harrison Phillips, Blake Cashman, Josh Metellus. A juicy matchup. If the Cardinals can get something going on the ground, it will put the Vikings defense on its heels and open things up even more for Murray, Harrison and the passing game. If the Vikings can shut that part of the offense down, forcing third-and-longs, they will be in good shape. GO DEEPER Russini’s what I’m hearing: Goff belief, Giant regrets and, maybe, the NFL’s first female GM Lewis: What is the Vikings’ ceiling? Is it the divisional round? The NFC Championship Game? The … Super Bowl? Unlike 2022, Minnesota has play callers in all phases capable of designing creative plans for one-game, do-or-die matchups. That said, the Vikings still turn the ball over too much offensively. Defensively, they’ve been too susceptible to explosive passes. Special teams have been solid but not perfect. The interior of the offensive line leaves plenty to be desired, especially against larger, more menacing fronts. These Cardinals are no joke. By most metrics, they’re an above-average team. This game kicks off a meat grinder of NFC opponents that will go a long way toward answering how far Minnesota can go this season. Advertisement Krawczynski: Nick Rallis coming back home. The former Gopher and Edina Hornet returns to U.S. Bank Stadium as the Cardinals’ defensive coordinator. It has been a fast rise up the coaching ranks for the 31-year-old, who has settled in nicely under head coach Jonathan Gannon to help the Cardinals exceed expectations. Rallis was a defensive quality control coach for the Vikings on his way up, and it will surely be an emotional time for the Rallis family as he comes back to try to derail the Vikings’ pursuit of a top seed in the NFC. What kind of tricks does he have up his sleeve to throw Darnold off his game after the quarterback seemed to rediscover his mojo in the last few weeks? Here is where each team ranks in the following categories, using explosive play rate for explosiveness and success rate for efficiency: Lewis: Vikings 26, Cardinals 20. This one scares me more than the last three have because of Arizona’s coaching. Gannon, Rallis and Petzing are sharp and innovative. Murray’s ad-libbing ability adds variance, too. But if the Vikings can stop the run as they have for the majority of the season, I think they’ll be able to do enough offensively. Krawczynski: Vikings 20, Cardinals 17. In four of the last five weeks, the Cardinals defense has held its opponents to 16 points or fewer. This feels like a brass knuckle fight.

The Aggies, having just dropped an overtime heartbreaker to Auburn, host the favored Texas Longhorns with an SEC title game berth on the line. The spread opened closer to a touchdown but has narrowed. Advertisement A&M is one of the few teams currently outside the playoff field with complete control of its playoff path. The Aggies must beat No. 3 Texas and No. 7 Georgia back-to-back. If the Aggies want in, there’s no other way but through. The Aggies run defense is good enough to slow Quintrevion Wisner and Jaydon Blue, and given the Longhorn backfield has fumbled eight times as a group, the defense has a chance to flip the field quickly for their offense. Former Heisman frontrunner Quinn Ewers has been effective under center for the Longhorns but has started slow multiple games this season and struggles when under pressure. More than 21 percent of pressures against Ewers have turned into sacks, and his completion percentage drops 20 points when under duress. His passer rating drops nearly 40 points. The Aggies’ pass rush may not be as consistent as some elite units, but it is disruptive. The Aggies have pressured opposing quarterbacks 194 times (more than Texas or Ohio State), and edge rushers Shemar Stewart and Nic Scourton have been particularly effective, generating 6.5 sacks as a pair. If they can make Ewers uncomfortable, the Longhorns offense becomes manageable. The Texas defense, on the other hand, doesn’t have a weakness. UT has allowed 16.2 points per game to conference opponents, and only Georgia and Vanderbilt managed more than 20. It pressures quarterbacks more than 35 percent of the time and allows 3.1 yards per carry (12th). A&M is far more effective on the ground (17th nationally) than through the air (86th), but without star running back Le’Veon Moss, it will be up to Amari Daniels to face down the fearsome Longhorn front.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Who will host 2030 World Cup final? The race between the Bernabeu, Camp Nou and Casablanca",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5958060/2024/11/30/world-cup-final-2030-stadium-where/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 10:58:37 GMT",FIFA has published the official bid evaluation report for the 2030 World Cup — so where will the final be played?,"World Cup Editor’s note: This is a new version of an article first published in October 2023, updated to reflect FIFA’s publication of the official bid evaluation report FIFA has published the official bid evaluation report for the 2030 World Cup in Spain, Portugal and Morocco. The three countries’ joint bid will also see the tournament’s first three matches played in Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay as part of a centenary celebration and ceremony “in recognition of Uruguay’s role as the host and winner of the 1930 edition”. Advertisement The 2030 bid, which like the 2034 bid from Saudi Arabia does not have a rival, will be voted on by the member nations at the FIFA Congress on December 11. Only one country can host the final, however, with three leading venues battling it out for the honour of doing so. FIFA’s bid evaluation confirmed that three venues — Estadio Santiago Bernabeu in Madrid, Camp Nou in Barcelona, and Grand Stade Hassan II in Casablanca — are in play for the opening match and the final. One thing has been very clear throughout Spain’s attempt to host the 2030 tournament, from the initial idea of an ‘Iberian bid’ with just Portugal, through the brief dalliance with the possibility Ukraine would host some games, to joining up with Morocco and, finally, the inclusion of three games in South America. Everyone in Spain has always been sure that the final would be held in Real Madrid’s Bernabeu — just as it was in 1982 when Italy beat West Germany 3-1. Given FIFA rules state the final must be held in a stadium with a capacity of at least 80,000, Barcelona’s 105,000-capacity Camp Nou could in theory be an alternative option, but its biggest ambition would most likely be a semi-final. GO DEEPER Morocco, Spain, Portugal to host 2030 WC — but opening games in South America However, neither Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez nor former Spanish Football Association (RFEF) president Pedro Rocha mentioned the final or the Bernabeu in their statements when hosting rights were settled in October 2023. Morocco, meanwhile, has the ambition to host the final in Casablanca, in a stadium that is not yet built but plans to become the world’s largest, with a capacity of 115,000. However, the Moroccan Football Association knows there are other cities and other candidate stadiums. They see it as far from certain that their new stadium in Casablanca would be chosen, but they do consider it reasonable to think it could host one of the semi-finals. Advertisement As for Portugal, three venues will feature at the tournament: Porto’s Estadio do Dragao, Sporting Lisbon’s Estadio Jose Alvalade and Benfica’s Estadio da Luz. None of these has a capacity of over 80,000; Benfica’s is the highest at around 65,000. FIFA’s decision to move ahead with the six-country idea for 2030 came as a surprise to many  — including within Spain. According to RFEF sources, who were not authorised to speak on the record, there is still a long process to go through before it is decided how many games are played in Spain, Portugal and Morocco and how many host stadiums each country gets. The bid has put forward a total of 20 stadia, exceeding the minimum of 14 required which FIFA says allows “for ample flexibility in selecting a diverse and truly memorable range of stadiums”. GO DEEPER Why 2030 World Cup is split across six countries - and all roads lead to Saudi Arabia 2034 The evidence so far is that FIFA and its president Gianni Infantino are taking a clear leading role and that the Spanish government is more significantly involved than its FA, which remains in turmoil following the departure of former president Luis Rubiales last summer. The feeling in Spain is that the Moroccan FA has been emboldened by Spain’s weakness and is making an attempt to secure as many important games as possible — hence its president Fouzi Lekjaa stating a new stadium would be built in Casablanca that could host the final. The Bernabeu remains the favourite. Sources with knowledge of institutional relations at the highest level, who declined to be named to protect relationships, acknowledged to The Athletic at the time of the announcement last year that Madrid president Florentino Perez’s closeness with Infantino would be a big factor. So it still remains unthinkable — in Spain, at least — that the final could be held anywhere other than at Madrid’s home. Advertisement However, with so much still to be decided about the tournament, the RFEF may still have to cede more than they would like. That could include reducing its number of host cities or sharing out other key games, for instance. Spain had initially intended to put forward 13 venues but FIFA regulations state a maximum of 20 stadiums can be presented. The RFEF has therefore proposed 11 stadiums to host matches at the 2030 tournament with Anoeta (Donostia-San Sebastian), Estadio La Cartuja (Seville) and San Mames (Bilbao) included. FIFA’s rules state group games must be played in stadiums that hold more than 40,000 spectators and the semi-finals be played in grounds with a capacity of at least 60,000. Atletico Madrid’s Estadio Metropolitano can accommodate more than 70,000 fans but will most likely be used for group games or early knockout rounds rather than a semi-final. Gran Canaria (Las Palmas), The Rose Garden (Malaga), New Romareda (Zaragoza), RCDE Stadium (Barcelona, ​​Cornella-El Prat) and Riazor (A Coruna) are the other proposed venues. Some of those stadiums would require redevelopment and some clubs having already put together plans to use money received through the ‘La Liga Boost’ plan funded by CVC Capital Partners to help fund upgrades.

Can the Crimson Tide right the ship against rival Auburn or will it get worse?,"Sports Betting Neither Auburn nor Alabama is playing for a spot in the SEC Championship Game, but this year’s edition of the Iron Bowl still carries plenty of significance. The Tigers need a win to become bowl eligible, while the heavily favored Crimson Tide hope to keep their College Football Playoff chances alive and avoid their first four-loss season in nearly 20 years. Advertisement Auburn (5-6, 2-5 SEC) kept its postseason hopes alive with a thrilling 43-41 four-overtime upset of Texas A&M last Saturday. Quarterback Payton Thorne (301 yards, two touchdowns) and running back Jarquez Hunter (130 yards, three touchdowns) did most of the damage as Auburn nearly doubled its season high for points in a conference game. Now the Tigers look to keep their offensive momentum against an Alabama (8-3, 4-3) defense that just got run over. The Crimson Tide surrendered 257 rushing yards in last week’s 24-3 loss at Oklahoma. That’s the most since Auburn piled up 318 on the ground in their Iron Bowl victory in 2022. Hunter is second in the SEC in rushing, averaging 6.6 yards per carry. He should get plenty of opportunities against an Alabama defense that’s giving up 160 yards on the ground per game to conference foes. The Crimson Tide’s offense also struggled last week, producing season lows in points, total yards (264) and rushing yards (70). As quarterback Jalen Milroe goes, so does Bama. Six of his nine interceptions this season have come in the team’s three losses, and he has also been a non-factor in the running game, with a total of 28 rushing yards in those games. Alabama has won four Iron Bowls in a row and eight of the last 10. The Crimson Tide also haven’t lost to the Tigers in Tuscaloosa since 2010.   Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How Packers linebacker Quay Walker is breaking out at just the right time,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5957277/2024/11/30/green-bay-packers-quay-walker-dolphins-lions/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 10:08:38 GMT",Green Bay's first of two 2022 first-round picks had arguably his two best games of the season the last two weeks.,"NFL Quay Walker had a free run at Caleb Williams, but he hesitated. The Chicago Bears faced a fourth-and-2 from the Green Bay Packers’ 23-yard line with a 10-7 lead early in the third quarter two weeks ago. Walker, Green Bay’s No. 1 linebacker, started attacking the empty B-gap but, for some reason, stopped before getting to Chicago’s quarterback. Advertisement Walker’s hesitation allowed Williams to hit running back Roschon Johnson for 8 yards and a first down. The Bears finished the drive with a field goal to take a 13-7 lead, though the Packers came back to win 20-19. Defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley said the following week, “Quay should’ve just kept going.” This season, Walker has drawn much ire from Packers fans for his lack of production. Green Bay drafted the fast, physical linebacker out of Georgia with the first-round pick it got from the Las Vegas Raiders in the Davante Adams trade in 2022. He’s flashed in spurts throughout his career, but a player of his physical skill set has left plenty to be desired. The last two games, however, have been a different story. Coming off what Hafley called Walker’s best game of the season against the San Francisco 49ers last Sunday, the 24-year-old delivered another stellar performance against the Miami Dolphins as the Packers improved to 9-3 with a 30-17 win on Thursday night. If Walker continues this ascension, Green Bay will unlock a vital piece of its Super Bowl pursuit. “Quay’s been playing his best ball,” head coach Matt LaFleur said after the game Thursday. “I don’t think anybody would dispute that. He’s got a better feel for what we’re asking him to do. … You saw it not only in the run game with Quay, but when we’re bringing him on blitzes, he’s extremely effective at setting some picks and then getting pressure on the quarterback himself. Really happy with where he’s at and he’s a resilient dude and he’s very, very critical of himself and he’s hard on himself, and sometimes you’ve got to help pick him up because he’s a really talented football player and I think his best ball is in front of him.” GO DEEPER Packers defense stifles Dolphins, awaits heavyweight bout with Lions next week Remember Walker’s costly hesitation against the Bears and compare it to his plays in the last two games. Against the 49ers, Hafley sent Walker on a simulated pressure (rushing four but replacing a defensive lineman with a linebacker or defensive back) through the A-gap. Walker muscled his way through the center and right guard and pressured quarterback Brandon Allen while defensive end Rashan Gary finished off the sack to force a punt. Advertisement Against the Dolphins on Thursday, Hafley sent Walker on another simulated pressure through the A-gap late in the fourth quarter. Walker occupied right guard Liam Eichenberg while getting pressure, forcing quarterback Tua Tagovailoa to slide right into a sack for defensive tackle Kenny Clark. That’s the version of Walker that Green Bay needs, one who trusts his instincts, doesn’t hesitate and relies on his speed and power to wreak havoc. “I think I just do too much thinking,” Walker said after the game Thursday. “Any time I have that mindset — see it, go — I can be a real, real productive player. I don’t want to give myself too much credit, but that’s how I see it.” That was the case on Miami’s fourth-and-goal from the 1-yard line in the fourth quarter. With the Packers leading by 16 but the Dolphins threatening to cut their deficit to one score, Green Bay needed a play to seize momentum back. Walker was the deepest player on the defense before the snap and even waited about two seconds before charging. Once he did, he benefited from defensive tackle T.J. Slaton collapsing the pocket and sacked Tagovailoa for a turnover on downs. “I don’t want to give away too much and say too much, but just saw daylight and went, and that was it pretty much,” Walker said. Quay Walker: “Don’t do no thinking. Just play. Whenever I see it, just go.” pic.twitter.com/h7BzLnsh3n — Matt Schneidman (@mattschneidman) November 29, 2024  Sometimes, it’s that simple. See and go. But as the middle linebacker in charge of relaying play calls from Hafley to the rest of the defense and diagnosing things pre-snap, sometimes not overthinking is easier said than done. “Just being more calm, man,” Walker said of striking that balance. “Just having better awareness pre-snap, stuff like that. Whenever I just be calm instead of just trying to think — like I said, I’m an overthinker. I just think too much. So that’s it, man. Just give myself a break, too. You know what I’m saying? Give myself a little grace. We’ll go from there. Like I said, I don’t want to do too much because I’ve played better the past two weeks. Just want to stay humble and just see where I can go from here.” Advertisement As LaFleur mentioned, Walker is extremely hard on himself, so perhaps not beating himself up so much will help him play with a clearer head. “I’ve been trying to, but I don’t know how to do that yet,” Walker said of giving himself grace. “I don’t know how to do that yet. I’m trying to get to that point, but I don’t know how to do it yet.” After beating the 49ers, Hafley said of Walker: “I was really proud of him. It was really cool to see because I think if you ask Quay, the week before, I think he would tell you he didn’t play his best game, right? … In practice, it was like he was on a mission last week, and then he went out and played like that. He was fast, he was getting downhill, he tackled well. He played with great fundamentals, he was using his hands, he had a couple TFLs (tackles for loss). You know the ball on those tosses that they were trying to get out on the perimeter like the Bears did the week before, I mean, he was just getting there, beating people to the punch. He was knocking guys back, he was setting the edge, he was really good in pass coverage (minus his dropped interception). “I think that’s the best game he’s played, at least since we’ve been together, and I hope he can build off of that.” And build off that Walker did against the Dolphins, with another jump needed next Thursday night to help take down the mighty Detroit Lions.
It’s not just on blitzes that Walker has been more effective, though, as Hafley said. Whether it was an impressive TFL against the run on the edge of Christian McCaffrey, a stonewalling of De’Von Achane up the gut for no gain (the play was negated due to a hold) or a pass breakup on Miami’s late two-point try while covering running back Raheem Mostert on an angle route, Walker’s full repertoire that has largely stayed hidden this season is now on display. It’s not far-fetched to say Walker is the X-factor to Green Bay’s championship aspirations. If he can simplify the action in his head, see and go and continue showcasing the traits that made him a first-round pick just two years ago, those dreams of a Lombardi Trophy may be more reality than fantasy. “I believe Quay’s the best middle linebacker in the league, in my opinion,” safety Xavier McKinney said. “I think he has so many different qualities that you don’t really see. He can cover well, he can tackle well, he do a lot of things, and obviously he’s still growing. Advertisement “He goes through different things because he got the mic (to relay play calls from the defensive coordinator to the team on the field) and that’s something that I completely understand because I had the mic when I was in New York for a time. I know how hard that s–t can be. So I understand him. I try to help him, just trying to call certain calls out and just try to make his job easier so he can go out there and play fast. But when he goes out there and plays fast, there ain’t a lot of people that can do what he can do.” (Photo: Brooke Sutton / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Our writers discuss Week 13.","NFL The home teams feasted on Thanksgiving while the Kansas City Chiefs spent Black Friday rebuffing another Las Vegas Raiders attempt at a road upset. So, as a result, the holidays leave Sunday’s schedule for Week 13 lighter than usual, but certainly not lacking. Our writers Mike Sando, Zak Keefer and Jeff Howe dish on Trevor Lawrence’s return, Aaron Rodgers’ future, a possible leap for second-year quarterbacks, a potential Super Bowl LIX preview in Philadelphia Eagles–Baltimore Ravens and more in this week’s roundtable. Advertisement The Panthers, who nearly beat the Chiefs in Week 12, host the Bucs on Sunday. The Titans, who knocked off the Texans, are on the road against the Commanders. Do you feel second-year quarterbacks Bryce Young and Will Levis have turned a corner or do you need to see more? Sando: Young seems to have stabilized to the point where the Panthers can leave him in the lineup and hope he develops. I would not mistake his progress for a sky-high ceiling, however. We still aren’t sure whether he can be more than a mid-tier starter. He does appear viable, however, and that’s a positive reflection on him and coach Dave Canales. In Tennessee, Levis just became the third player since 1960 to win a start while taking at least eight sacks and throwing a pick-six interception. That is not a winning formula. It was also the second time this season he had at least eight sacks and a pick-six in the same game. Definitely need to see more. Howe: They’ve definitely turned a corner, but they haven’t left the neighborhood. Young is playing well, so the time on the bench seemed to serve as a good reset for the No. 1 pick. I think it’s fair to be optimistic that Canales has helped Young elevate his game, considering his track record with past quarterbacks. But until there’s more help around Young, it’s too soon to know where his potential lies. Levis is playing better, too, though I had him ranked as the worst starter in the league for a couple of weeks before this turnaround so there was clear room for growth. Levis still has to eliminate the crucial mistakes before he can be viewed as a long-term starter in the league. GO DEEPER Bryce Young showed progress — and then the fire teammates were waiting to see Keefer: Young deserves a ton of credit — rarely has a top pick who flailed so badly early in his career, then was benched, bounced back in a more impressive way with the same team. I still believe the Panthers see him as part of the organization’s future, and that wasn’t a guarantee just a few weeks ago. As for Levis, Jeff is right — his game-breaking mistakes remain a serious flaw. I think the Titans look long and hard at adding a new starting quarterback in the offseason. Trevor Lawrence (shoulder) is trying to come back from injury and is expected to play this week against the Texans for the last-place Jaguars. Is it worth it? Should he be shut down for the season? Sando: If Lawrence is healthy, he should play. I think that’s the general standard for players and would not hold him out of games otherwise. Advertisement Howe: It’s absolutely worth it. Lawrence’s job is secure because of his contract, but plenty of other jobs in the organization are on the line and he owes it to them to be on the field. He also has to try to create optimism for 2025. If Lawrence plays well under the injury circumstances, it will carry weight in the locker room. That would be really important amid a lost season. Keefer: When you sign a $275 million contract that pays you like one of the best quarterbacks in the league, there are certain expectations that come with it. For one, if you’re healthy, you suit up. Period. Lawrence is also staring at his fourth different head coach next season if Doug Pederson is ultimately let go — including interims — which tells you how chaotic his tenure in Jacksonville has been. I still think the Jaguars have enough to pull an upset one of these weeks, and it’s not like the Texans are playing well at the moment. The Jets host the Seahawks with a chance to play spoiler, but the conversation around New York these days is about Aaron Rodgers, whose future is now in question. What’s best for the Jets at quarterback? What do you think will happen at this point? Sando: Turning the page would be best for the Jets given Rodgers’ age and all that comes along with having him on the team. Acquiring him was worth the risk because the upside was high and the team appeared ready to win, but his Achilles injury and the overall state of the team makes a reset more appealing. I’d imagine this will be it for Rodgers and the Jets. Howe: I asked three high-ranking executives who will be GM candidates how they’d handle the Rodgers situation if they ran the Jets. All three said they would release him with the post-June 1 designation, and I agree with them. Barring a significant turnaround in performance, this shouldn’t be a difficult decision, especially for a new regime that won’t wish to be anchored by the contract. GO DEEPER Stay or Go? From Aaron Rodgers to Anders Carlson, vote on which Jets should return in 2025 Keefer: It’s time to move on. This gamble has been a bust from the start, and in typical Jets fashion, none of the immense hype — hype this team welcomed — translated into any real success. The Jets need to find new leadership and a new quarterback for 2025. The Chargers and Falcons meet Sunday. Los Angeles is trying to hang on in the AFC wild-card hunt. Atlanta is trying to hang on in the NFC South race. Both teams have been exposed somewhat in the last week. What is your current confidence in them? Sando: I’ve got more confidence in the Chargers than I have in the Falcons. There’s no shame in losing to Baltimore, as the Chargers did to end a four-game winning streak. Atlanta lost to New Orleans and then got blown out by Denver, leading coach Raheem Morris to question the team’s effort. That’s much more concerning that the Chargers’ slipup Monday night. Advertisement Howe: However inconsistent the Ravens have been at times, the Chargers ran into a buzzsaw this week. I think they’re in a good spot to make the playoffs because Justin Herbert is playing well and the defense should hold steady, but I don’t view them as a threat to make a run in January. The Falcons have too many sporadic performances. There are weeks when the defense looks pretty good and others when it can’t make a stop, and the offense has dealt with similar inconsistencies. They earned the tiebreaker by sweeping the Bucs, which is significant with a one-game lead in the NFC South, but it’s going to be a nervous ride to the finish line. Keefer: I still don’t see the Chargers as a great team — certainly not on the level of Kansas City, Buffalo and perhaps even Pittsburgh in the AFC — but they remain a solid playoff contender. All four losses this season have come against a team in the thick of the postseason race. The Falcons? They remain more of a mystery — good enough to beat the Eagles early in the year and bad enough to get blown out by the Broncos the last time they played. Give me Los Angeles in this one as the NFC South race continues to get muddier. Eagles-Ravens feels like it could be a Super Bowl preview and one storyline is what Saquon Barkley and Derrick Henry have done for their respective teams this season. Has their play done enough to revitalize the running back market? Sando: Running back salaries at the top of the market already rebounded some after declining. I think those salaries at the top should continue to rebound partly because of the success these players have enjoyed. The running game in general has made a comeback and that will likely benefit running backs in the market. Howe: No, they’re viewed as exceptions because they’re elite talents who joined strong organizations with solid rosters. It would be just as easy to look at Christian McCaffrey and point out how quickly a running back could go from the best in the league to someone with potentially career-altering injury issues. That’s why teams are so reluctant to go all in on a running back. Last offseason helped to stabilize the second and third tiers of the running back market, but it’ll be rare to see teams break the bank at the position. Keefer: Not really. The running back market as a whole won’t shift all that much, but what Barkley and Henry are doing this season is reminding personnel execs how much an elite one truly matters. There’s only one or two on the market each year, but the game-changers at running back still matter. Imagine where the Eagles would be without Barkley this season? His three-year, $37.8 million contract was a steal. (Top photo of Trevor Lawrence: Jorge Lemus / NurPhoto via Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Ravens run defense hasn't been tested much, but that will change against Eagles",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5957289/2024/11/30/ravens-run-defense-eagles/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 10:00:57 GMT",One of Sunday’s most-anticipated matchups features a number of intriguing subplots.,"NFL The Baltimore Ravens have the second-stingiest run defense in the league behind the Minnesota Vikings (in terms of rushing yards allowed per game). They also are allowing a league-low 3.5 yards per carry. Yet, for a litany of reasons, from the Ravens building some big leads to teams wanting to attack Baltimore’s struggling pass defense, there’s still a sense that they haven’t been tested much in that area. Advertisement That will change Sunday afternoon when the Philadelphia Eagles, winners of seven in a row, arrive at M&T Bank Stadium with the best rushing attack in football — and the hottest running back in the league. The Eagles are the second team in NFL history with at least 150 rushing yards and multiple rushing touchdowns in six consecutive games. During that span, Saquon Barkley is averaging 179.2 yards from scrimmage per game and has seven touchdowns. “Where do you start with Saquon Barkley?” Ravens coach John Harbaugh said Wednesday. “He’s just a really hard guy to tackle. His vision is really good. … His ability to see from edge to edge and all the way across whenever there’s a gap that’s not defended, he can see it. Not only see it, but get to it. All of the other highlight stuff is there as well, but just his ability to make a defense pay for not being in the right spot is probably the thing that jumps out at me the most.” GO DEEPER AFC North Whiparound: Which players are teams in the division most thankful for? The game features several intriguing subplots. The Ravens’ top-ranked offense against the league’s top-ranked defense. The league’s top two rushers (Barkley and Derrick Henry) sharing the field, along with three legitimate MVP candidates in Barkley, Henry and Lamar Jackson. The NFL’s top two rushing attacks setting the tone. The most critical matchup might be the Ravens’ ability to slow down Barkley and the Eagles running game. The Ravens have held teams under 100 yards rushing in nine of 12 games this year. They haven’t allowed more than 125 yards on the ground in a game all season. But they haven’t faced a back like Barkley (who has rushed for a league-leading 1,392 yards), too many dual-threat quarterbacks like Jalen Hurts or an offensive line as stout as Philadelphia’s veteran group. The last time the Eagles were held under 160 yards rushing in a game was Week 6. Advertisement “We’ve played a lot of good offensive lines this year, but we have the same mentality — try to take it to them,” said Ravens outside linebacker Odafe Oweh. “We’re going to try to dictate it as much as we can and not let them do that.” The Eagles have a number of weapons, starting with the dynamic Hurts, two standout wide receivers in A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith and a quality tight end in Dallas Goedert. But for the Ravens, it will all start with containing Barkley. Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.
 Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox. During game weeks, we’ll examine some of the storylines, matchups and questions the Ravens face heading into the contest. This week’s first-and-10: 1. If Sunday’s game becomes a shootout, it may take a while to materialize. Both teams have struggled offensively early in games. For the Eagles, it’s been a season-long problem. They are averaging a league-low 1.5 points per game in the first quarter. They didn’t score their first first-quarter points until Week 9. For the Ravens, it’s a more recent issue. They scored on their opening possession in each of their first five games. In seven games since, their first possession has resulted in four punts, an interception, a lost fumble and a turnover on downs. Their 48 first-quarter points are their fewest in any quarter by a wide margin, and Jackson admitted this week that the slow starts are a concern. 2. The Eagles are in the NFC, which means there is an obligation to point out that Jackson is 23-1 in his career against the NFC. It’s the best out-of-conference winning percentage by a quarterback in league history. In those starts, Jackson has thrown 40 touchdown passes with nine interceptions and run for nine scores. Vic Fangio’s defense blitzes on only 18.6 percent of opponent dropbacks, the fourth-lowest rate in the league. This will be a game where Jackson can show his growth in seeing the field and reading defenses. 3. Nobody uses light boxes more than the Eagles, but that hasn’t stopped them from having one of the top run defenses in football. Philadelphia hasn’t allowed more than 100 yards rushing in a game since Week 4. It’s also been weeks since they faced a dynamic running game. A Henry-heavy game plan, similar to what the Ravens featured against the Los Angeles Chargers, another team that goes light in the box, would make a lot of sense. Advertisement 4. Baltimore’s converted right guard Daniel Faalele, one of the team’s biggest question marks going into the season, has shown improvement after a rocky start. On Sunday, he’ll face one of his biggest tests. Eagles second-year pro Jalen Carter has become one of the league’s most disruptive interior defensive linemen. This season, he has 3 1/2 sacks, 10 quarterback hits, seven tackles for loss and a forced fumble. According to Pro Football Focus, Carter has lined up at the left defensive tackle spot on 389 snaps. That would put him opposite Faalele. Expect Carter, the ninth overall pick in 2023, to see double-teams. 5. The Ravens have been using Kyle Hamilton primarily as a deep safety the past two games, but it will be interesting to see whether that continues Sunday. It has to be pretty tempting for Ravens defensive coordinator Zach Orr to get Hamilton closer to the line of scrimmage as often as possible. He’s one of the team’s best and most physical tacklers, and getting him forward could be part of the plan to deal with Barkley and Hurts running the ball. Of course, the ability to take away deep shots to Brown and company will also be a priority on the back end. Brown is averaging 13 yards per target this season. 6. Harbaugh and Fangio probably won’t be exchanging holiday greetings before the game. Fangio was on Harbaugh’s first coaching staff in Baltimore and then coached with John’s brother, Jim, at Stanford and with the San Francisco 49ers. So it took Harbaugh by surprise when Fangio, then the Denver Broncos head coach, blasted him after the Ravens opted to run a play, rather than take a knee, in the final seconds of Baltimore’s 16-point victory over Denver in 2021. Harbaugh wanted to extend the Ravens’ streak of 100-yard rushing games. An irate Fangio said the Broncos expected it because “that’s their mode of operation there. Player safety is secondary.” Harbaugh responded by saying that he wouldn’t give the criticism “one second of thought.” The Ravens faced Fangio’s Miami Dolphins defense last year and put up 56 points. That included backup quarterback Tyler Huntley’s touchdown pass to Charlie Kolar with 2:28 to go in a game Baltimore led by 30. 7. The Ravens wanted a cornerback in the first round of the 2024 draft, and when they were on the clock at No. 30, they had the choice of two they liked: Clemson’s Nate Wiggins and Iowa’s Cooper DeJean. The Ravens went with Wiggins, and he hasn’t disappointed. He leads all rookies with 10 pass breakups to go with 21 tackles and a forced fumble. He has allowed 22 receptions on 45 targets. His role in an evolving Ravens secondary is growing. The Eagles, meanwhile, are thrilled with how things worked out for them. They got Toledo cornerback Quinyon Mitchell at No. 22 and then traded up for the No. 40 pick to select DeJean. Both have been high-impact players. The two rookies are major reasons why the Eagles have one of the best pass defenses in football. 8. The Ravens did their own version of the “tush push” in Monday’s victory over the Chargers as tight end Mark Andrews took a direct snap on fourth-and-1 and surged forward with Henry and fullback Patrick Ricard pushing him from behind. The Eagles, however, are in a league of their own in terms of their efficiency on the play despite the retirement of center Jason Kelce. Harbaugh said the Ravens have studied the play and will have a plan for defending it. The plan should focus on not allowing many third- and fourth-and-shorts because the Eagles have been almost automatic. 9. Could this be the week the Ravens make a game-changing play on special teams? It certainly would be helpful, as would the Ravens avoiding special teams penalties that force their offense to start deep in their own territory. Eagles kicker Jake Elliott has had similar problems as Baltimore’s Justin Tucker, missing all four of his kicks from 50-plus. This week’s special teams matchup features father versus son. Ravens senior special teams coach and kicking guru Randy Brown’s son, Tyler, is an assistant special teams coach with the Eagles. Brown’s daughter, Ryan, will sing the national anthem before the game. 10. The Ravens’ one big decision before Saturday’s 4 p.m. roster deadline is whether to activate nose tackle Michael Pierce to the 53-man roster. Pierce, who has missed the last four games with a calf injury, returned to practice this week and is in the middle of a 21-day practice window. Harbaugh said Pierce has a legitimate chance to play, and the big nose tackle would be a welcome addition against the league’s best running attack. The Ravens can open a roster spot by putting Kolar, who has a broken forearm, on injured reserve. If Pierce isn’t ready, the Ravens will probably have to move nose tackle Josh Tupou from the practice squad to the 53-man roster. Tupou is out of practice squad elevations. It seems highly unlikely that the Ravens would go thin along the defensive line against a team that leads the league in rushing attempts. Advertisement Eagles 30, Ravens 24 It’s probably foolish to pick against Jackson against an NFC team these days, but it’s more a reflection of how well the Eagles are playing than a statement about the Ravens. This is an Eagles team that can beat you in myriad ways on both sides of the ball. When it comes down to it, the Eagles offensive line and defense are much easier to trust than the Ravens offensive line and defense. This one will likely go down to the wire, but the bet here is that it’s the Eagles making the big plays late. (Photo: Joe Sargent / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Where do Luke Fickell, Wisconsin football go after 5-game losing streak, loss to Minnesota?",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5957752/2024/11/30/wisconsin-football-future-luke-fickell/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 10:00:44 GMT","If Fickell’s first two years at Wisconsin have proved anything, it’s that there are no guarantees in this process.","NCAAF MADISON, Wis. — Wisconsin athletic director Chris McIntosh stood side by side with Luke Fickell two years ago this week, both men all smiles as they posed for a photo-op in a room inside Camp Randall Stadium while holding a red Badgers jersey with the last name of the football program’s newest coach stitched into the back. Advertisement It was a moment amid turbulence that felt like a victory lap of sorts, part of an evening filled with understandable platitudes after McIntosh’s hiring of one of the hottest names in coaching about what the future could hold for a program ready to aim higher. “We have the same expectations, championship-level expectations,” McIntosh said then. “It became evident that Luke and his experience and his belief system and his approach and his process, which was proven and does align with what we believe here, was the way that I thought we should go and was the way that I felt best positioned our program for long-term success.” Two years later, all the excitement surrounding Fickell’s hiring has evaporated. Forget championship-level expectations. His second team didn’t even reach .500-level expectations. The latest example of how far away McIntosh’s declaration felt came Friday afternoon when Wisconsin — playing with a trophy against a bitter rival and bowl eligibility on the line — fell flat on its face once again in a 24-7 loss to Minnesota. Thus likely concluded the worst Wisconsin football season in 23 years — the last time the Badgers finished with a losing record and failed to qualify for a bowl game.

 Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox. Fickell sat in a different room underneath the stadium this time, his smile having been replaced with a scowl and expressions that seemed to waffle between anger and perplexion. Wisconsin, which once stood at 5-2 overall and riding a three-game winning streak, closed the regular season with five consecutive losses for the first time since Barry Alvarez’s 1991 team lost six straight. Fickell is 12-13 overall and 8-10 in the Big Ten since the start of last season. He found himself answering questions after another distressing performance about why his plan at Wisconsin hasn’t worked and whether it ever will work. His message to fans who are undeniably concerned about the direction of the program was one short on actual answers — which have continued to elude Fickell all season. “Just like I told the players, those that stay will be a champion,” Fickell said. “You’ve got to have people that believe in you. I know it’s hard, having faith in things you can’t see. And right now, I’m sure they can’t see it, either. And that’s the tough part. They’ve got to believe. Obviously, seeing is believing. Advertisement “I don’t worry as much about them as I worry about those guys in that locker room. Our job is to get them to believe, is to put the product on the field. Right now, we don’t have that opportunity, and we haven’t done it. So, I would understand if (fans) are worried. It’s their prerogative. Our job is to prove it, and we haven’t done that. But we will.” Whether Wisconsin will certainly is open for debate. Players, to a man, continued to express positivity about Fickell as a leader and his ability to turn around the program. But internal optimism hasn’t yielded better results. Badgers left tackle Jack Nelson said, “There’s no doubt that right now things look dark,” while expressing his support of Fickell for the future. Since Fickell’s hiring, it has felt as though Wisconsin has been attempting to fit a round peg into a square hole by uprooting some of the basic staples that led to previous success. Fickell already publicly acknowledged one failure two weeks ago by firing offensive coordinator Phil Longo, whose Air Raid system rarely thrived. What happened Friday in the battle for Paul Bunyan’s Axe served as a microcosm of Wisconsin’s problems. Wisconsin finished with 166 yards of total offense, the fewest for the program since a 2016 loss at Michigan when the Badgers recorded 159 yards — a span of 108 games. Quarterback Braedyn Locke completed fewer than 50 percent of his passes. The Badgers carried the ball 24 times for 36 yards. Fickell noted “there’s no way in hell” to win a Big Ten game and a rivalry game when running the ball for 36 yards. Wisconsin trailed 21-0 before it scored its only touchdown in the third quarter. “This is a low for our program,” Locke said. “This is a low for myself. Something I’ve never experienced as a football player, something that a lot of guys on our team have never experienced. It’s a hard feeling.” Advertisement Wisconsin defensive coordinator Mike Tressel joked during the week that Minnesota “may not pass the ball one time.” Yet Gophers quarterback Max Brosmer was the difference in the game. He completed 17 of 26 passes for 191 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions and scored the other touchdown on a 1-yard sneak. Wisconsin’s defense used to be among the most formidable in the country, but the Badgers have slipped considerably. There were moments of near brilliance against Penn State and Oregon but disasters against Iowa and Nebraska. Those last two performances, coupled with the result against Minnesota, mean the Badgers will spend all offseason walking by an empty trophy case from those three rivalry games. Wisconsin’s 22-year bowl game streak, which was the third-longest active mark in the FBS, also figures to be over barring multiple five-win teams failing to reach bowl eligibility on the final weekend to open the door for the Badgers on the strength of their Academic Progress Rate. GO DEEPER What Wisconsin's loss to Minnesota means for Luke Fickell, Badgers Wisconsin limped to the finish line, as Fickell said the players were “beat up physically, mentally and emotionally.” Safety Hunter Wohler, one of the team’s leaders, said the late-season losing streak took a toll on the Badgers. “There’s a million different things I wish I could tell you that I could put a finger on,” Fickell said. “But I’ve been coaching for a good while and playing this game for a good while, and I don’t know that I’ve been in a position and a situation like this, to be honest with you. “We’ve got a lot of work to do. We’ve got a lot of things we’ve got to get done. We’ve got a lot of things we’ve got to fix up and correct. Unfortunately, we’ll have a lot of time to do it. But it starts with checking ourselves first and foremost. And leadership is the key to what it is that we do. I take full responsibility for that.” McIntosh pinned his hopes on Fickell, and there doesn’t seem to be any going back on that decision given the financial ramifications. Fickell’s buyout would be $40 million, significantly more than the $11 million former Wisconsin coach Paul Chryst was paid after his firing in October 2022. The next year will be critical to instill confidence, and despite recruiting at a high level, it won’t be easy. Badgers defensive lineman Ben Barten said Fickell reminded players that “this isn’t the Big Ten West anymore,” where the team could count on playing certain (beatable) foes every year. Wisconsin has a schedule in Year 3 that features road games against Alabama, Oregon, Michigan, Indiana and Minnesota, as well as home games against Ohio State and Iowa. Those are all programs Wisconsin lost to either this season or the last time the teams played. Fickell hasn’t played Michigan but is 1-7 against those other teams in two seasons at Wisconsin. Advertisement Fickell has what is without a doubt the most important offseason of his Wisconsin tenure ahead of him. He must ensure he makes the right hire with his next offensive coordinator and determine whether any other staffers should go. He must figure out the best course of action with an uncertain quarterback room. He has to recruit his players, some of whom may be worn down from another disappointing campaign, because the transfer portal opens Dec. 9. And he has to continue to find difference-makers through the portal. “The only thing we can do now is hope that we get a good amount of people to come back,” Badgers receiver Vinny Anthony said. “I hope a lot of people don’t leave and we can just build off of this and know this is the lowest we’re ever going to be, and hopefully we can come back and be better next year.” If Fickell’s first two years at Wisconsin have proved anything, it’s that there are no guarantees in this process. Championship-level aspirations haven’t aligned with reality. And, as another season concludes, it’s growing more difficult to believe.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How Georgia football pulled off 'the best win of all time' (over Georgia Tech),https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5958031/2024/11/30/georgia-football-georgia-tech-eight-overtimes/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 10:00:40 GMT","It took eight overtimes, and what it means can be debated, but perspective could wait after Georgia's win over Georgia Tech.","NCAAF ATHENS, Ga. — The wildest game many had ever seen had just ended. Players and coaches from both Georgia and Georgia Tech were lingering, shaking hands, comparing notes, celebrating and consoling. Amid all that, Mike Cavan, a 76-year-old former Georgia quarterback, assistant coach and now staff member, grabbed someone close to him by the arm. Advertisement “Best win of all time,” Cavan said. The best? Cavan won an SEC championship as a player, recruited Herschel Walker, was an assistant on the 1980 national championship team and has been on the sideline during all of Kirby Smart’s run. The best? “Best all-time win over Tech,” Cavan said. Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox.

That’s a clarification that still says plenty: Before Friday, if you told Georgia people they would need eight overtimes to get a 44-42 home win over Georgia Tech in a game they were favored to win by nearly three touchdowns, the reaction would probably have been … ugh. In the more sober light of morning, they still may end up feeling that way. But after the way this went — trailing 17-0 at halftime and 27-13 with five minutes left in regulation and then going eight overtimes, including the last six in a two-point shootout — perspective could wait. Quarterback Carson Beck called it “one of the most emotional games I’ve been a part of.” Linebacker Jalon Walker said he was nervous for his grandmother, who came to the game for the first time. Many Georgia fans left after Georgia Tech went up 14 with 5:37 left in the game. But many stopped or circled back to watch from the bridge over the west end zone. What they witnessed: • Beck hitting Dominic Lovett with a 17-yard touchdown with 3:39 left to make it 27-20. • Georgia safety Dan Jackson forcing Georgia Tech quarterback Haynes King to fumble, which was recovered by Georgia. Jackson is the one connection on defense with the 2021 unit who was on the field for Kelee Ringo’s famous pick six, then was a part of his own moment on Friday night. “That hit-fumble will be one for the ages,” Smart said. • Beck and Lovett connecting again for a 3-yard touchdown with 1:01 left, tying the score. The next minute then saw Georgia Tech try to get in field goal range, get stopped at Georgia’s 45-yard line, then Beck get sacked on a Hail-Mary try. That forced a back-and-forth of emotions. No one could know it was just beginning. Georgia had practiced the overtime rules — one drive each from the 25-yard line in the first two overtimes, then a two-point shootout after that — before the Texas game last month. But this was the first time going through it for real. GO DEEPER How does college football's overtime format work? “We go over the situation but not every single day,” tight end Ben Yurosek said. “So a couple people were probably asking around, making sure (the third overtime) it was a two-point shootout.” • In the first overtime, Beck hit London Humphreys for a touchdown. But King answered with a scoring pass for Georgia Tech. Advertisement On to the second overtime, and Georgia Tech started with King scoring on a 1-yard run, but the rules required a two-point try. It failed. Georgia got the ball, and Beck right away connected with Cash Jones on a touchdown pass. The Bulldogs could have won the game with a two-point conversion but also missed. • It was time for the two-point shootout, an ironic twist for Smart: If Georgia lost this game, his decision to go for two after Georgia’s third-quarter touchdown would have loomed large. There was still 9:53 left in the quarter when it happened, and Smart seemed to acknowledge later it was a questionable decision. “Yeah, interesting question. I’m not going to dig real deep in,” Smart said. “It is analytics, and we follow almost to a tee. It’s what our chart says. It ended up looking really interesting because you (could have kicked) an extra point to win the game.” GO DEEPER Eight OTs? No. 7 Georgia outlasts Georgia Tech after rally from 14 down in fourth But that time, it was the third overtime, and nobody had that choice. The only strategy was in which plays to call, and even then, there were no huge surprises: Georgia Tech offensive coordinator Buster Faulkner was at Georgia from 2020-22, and Smart said his coaches recognized a lot of the two-point plays the Yellow Jackets were running. But Faulkner surely knew which calls were in Georgia’s playbook and was telling his fellow coaches. Maybe that’s why there were so many failures. • The offenses both failed in the third and fourth overtimes. Then Georgia converted with Beck hitting Dillon Bell. Georgia Tech answered with King completing a pass. Then the sixth and seventh overtimes, which were both failures for each team. In all, the second team could have won the game on four of five exchanges but didn’t. “It just was weird that it seemed like every time somebody failed, they had to go again,” Smart said. “So you gotta get over that, then they would fail, and they had to go again.” Advertisement • Finally, the eighth overtime. By this time, Georgia’s defense was being aggressive, going after King on every play, just from a different place each time. Georgia linebacker CJ Allen went right at King, who heaved a pass out of the end zone. Beck and the Georgia offense took the field. So did Nate Frazier, a freshman tailback, who might have seemed like a decoy as both teams basically had been passing in overtime. Georgia offensive coordinator Mike Bobo called a run-pass option, a play the Bulldogs had used earlier. “But not in that way, if that makes sense,” Beck said. “We run the same play in a lot of different ways.” This time, Beck saw the look of the defense, and when the moment came, he gave the ball to Frazier. The hole was there, he burst through it, and the game was finally over. Walker was later asked about his reaction when Frazier scored. “I don’t know, you tell me,” he said, laughing. “My mind went blank.” It took a couple of moments for everyone to realize it was the game over. Smart went to the postgame handshake with Georgia Tech coach Brett Key, and instead, they embraced for a while. Smart and Key both coach at their alma maters and played against each other in the 1990s, and they have a healthy respect for each other, especially after this game. “Nobody knows what it’s like to sit on that sideline and go through that pain and the highs, the lows that, ‘We’re going to win, we’re going to lose, we’re going to win, we’re going to lose,’” Smart said. “I mean, he was emotionally spent, and so was I.” After a few minutes of exultation, almost all of Georgia’s team had to be called back out of the locker room for a ceremony at midfield, where Georgia governor Brian Kemp gave the state trophy to Smart and his team for the seventh straight year. The team came back out still smiling. Maybe that was part relief, but there was genuine celebration. Advertisement Still, it leaves the question: For Georgia to struggle against a team it was supposed to beat easily, on its home field — where it has not lost a night game since 2009 — what does that say? “It shows the resiliency of this team,” Yurosek said. “No matter what happens, what we’re faced with, we’re ready to put our heads down, keep working, no matter the situation. It shows a lot about this team and its character.” Whether the College Football Playoff committee sees it the same way will be reflected in the penultimate rankings on Tuesday. Either way, Georgia can make it all moot by winning the SEC championship next week against Texas or Texas A&M. The winner gets a bye into the quarterfinals. And by pulling this game out against their state rivals, the Bulldogs almost certainly will be in the field either way: A 10-2 regular season featuring wins at Texas and over Clemson and Tennessee earn some leeway to survive a game like this. Still, when asked if this win ensured at least an at-large bid, Smart said he wouldn’t answer but then seemed to acknowledge the stakes of those overtimes. “If things went the other way on one of those plays tonight, we’d be playing next week for our lives,” he said. Indeed, a spot in the Playoff was on the line, and it came down to essentially a series of coin-flip overtimes. It was a bizarre way for things to go down. There will be time to dissect and argue about what it means and should mean in the coming days and two weeks. But in the immediate aftermath, Walker, Georgia’s defensive leader, only could shake his head. “I mean,” he said, with a smile, “I haven’t ever seen anything like that.” (Top photo of Carson Beck: Todd Kirkland / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Everything to know about the PWHL: Rules, storylines and how to watch the 2024-25 season",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5957016/2024/11/30/pwhl-schedule-rules-storylines-how-to-watch/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 10:00:19 GMT","After a record-breaking inaugural season, the Professional Women's Hockey League is back. Here's what to know ahead of Year 2.","Women's Hockey After a record-breaking inaugural season, the Professional Women’s Hockey League is back. The 2024-25 PWHL season will have a whole new look: The league finally introduced team names and logos this offseason, along with proper jerseys. There will be plenty of new players from top college teams across the U.S., and from professional leagues in Europe. Plus, bigger venues, new rules and regular-season games hosted in several NHL buildings. Advertisement Year 2 officially begins on Saturday afternoon. Here’s everything you need to know in The Athletic’s comprehensive guide to the PWHL. The PWHL, which began play on Jan. 1, 2024, is the newest women’s professional hockey league in North America. It’s the third league that has launched since 2007 with the hope of creating a sustainable business model around women’s hockey. This league is backed by Mark Walter, the billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and consists of six franchises in Canada (Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa) and the United States (Boston, Minnesota and New York). Walter and his wife, Kimbra, own the league and its six teams under a single-entity ownership model; there are no individual team owners. GO DEEPER The PWHL pulled off its inaugural season. Year 2 will decide the future of women's pro hockey The PWHL’s advisory board includes Stan Kasten, the president of the LA Dodgers, tennis legend Billie Jean King and her partner Ilana Kloss. The PWHL will have a new look this season after the league unveiled its highly anticipated names, logos and jerseys. Teams have been named: the Boston Fleet, Minnesota Frost, Montreal Victoire, New York Sirens, Ottawa Charge and Toronto Sceptres. Last season, all six teams were identified by geographic location — PWHL Toronto, for example — and players wore temporary jerseys with a basic boilerplate design. Now, teams will wear jerseys made in partnership with Bauer Hockey, the league’s official jersey partner. Teams will play 30 regular-season games each this season, up from the 24 played in the inaugural year. Several teams have also moved into new venues this season. After bouncing between three game rinks and struggling to draw a crowd, New York has moved into a single primary venue — the Prudential Center in Newark, N.J., where the team played in front of its biggest crowd (5,132) last season. Advertisement While Toronto and Montreal have moved into bigger venues full-time. Toronto will play at the Coca-Cola Coliseum, which holds around 8,000 fans — a significant upgrade from last season’s 2,600-seat Mattamy Athletic Centre. Montreal has moved into Place Bell after splitting time at Verdun Auditorium last season. The PWHL will also play nine neutral-site games this season as part of the “PWHL Takeover Tour,” up from the two games played in Detroit and Pittsburgh last year. The tour will bring teams across the United States and Canada with stops in Buffalo, Detroit, Raleigh, St. Louis, Denver, Seattle, Vancouver, Quebec City and Edmonton. “It’s a reinforcement of what we perceive as widespread and growing interest around our sport,” Kasten told The Athletic. “I can’t say it enough times, these women, these world-class athletes who have been overlooked for so long, are finally seeing the recognition they should have been receiving for years and years.” The PWHL has a few rules that are unique if we compare them to the NHL. The PWHL opted for a 3-2-1 points system over the standard 2-1-0 that the NHL has used. In the PWHL, regulation wins are worth the most at three points, while overtime and shootout wins earn two points. A loss in overtime or the shootout results in one point, and a regulation loss is worth nothing. The league also introduced a “jailbreak” rule last season that means if a team scores short-handed, they get to free their player from the penalty box. 13 short-handed goals were scored last season led by Toronto’s Emma Maltais (2) and Minnesota’s Grace Zumwinkle (2). The 2024 draft order was also decided using “the Gold Plan.” Instead of a lottery system that encourages losing by awarding the best odds to the worst teams, the PWHL determines its draft order based on the number of points each team earns after being eliminated from the playoffs. New York won the lottery last season after accumulating the most points, post-elimination. GO DEEPER Explaining the Gold Plan, the PWHL’s radical solution for tanking Games last season were surprisingly physical, but it wasn’t due to a major rule change as many thought. Both the PWHL and IIHF allow body checking in women’s hockey when there is a clear intention of playing the puck or attempting to gain possession. The difference largely came down to how games were called by league officials. Advertisement The league — and players — have welcomed the more physical play, but a new rule this season will crack down on more dangerous hits. According to the rulebook, an illegal hit to the head will automatically result in a major penalty and game misconduct. There will also be a “no escape rule” this season, which means that when a team takes a penalty, players on the ice must stay out for the first penalty-kill faceoff, rather than letting coaches immediately put out their top penalty killers. The rule could also mean initial penalty kill units with three forwards and one defender, if a blueliner takes the penalty. Can the Minnesota Frost win back-to-back championships? The PWHL’s sophomore season is going to be competitive with every roster improving via the draft and free agency. But Minnesota, the defending champion, might still be the team to beat. Sixteen players from the Walter Cup champion team are returning in 2024-25, including rookie of the year Grace Zumwinkle, playoff MVP Taylor Heise, captain Kendall Coyne Schofield, defenders Sophie Jaques and Lee Stecklein, as well as the best goalie tandem in the league, Maddie Rooney and Nicole Hensley. Minnesota will be even deeper this season with Canadian defender Claire Thompson — the Olympic record holder for points by a defender — and forwards Britta Curl, Dominique Petrie, Klára Hymlárová, Katy Knoll and Brooke McQuigge. How will Natalie Spooner’s injury impact the Toronto Sceptres? League MVP Natalie Spooner will miss the start of Toronto’s season as she recovers from season-ending ACL surgery in May. The power forward led the PWHL in goals (20) and points (27) and was named MVP, Forward of the Year and IIHF Player of the Year. Spooner was a critical driver of Toronto’s offense last season, scoring 29 percent of the goals and factoring into 39 percent. Nobody in the league scored more game-winning goals (5), first goals (5) or insurance goals to put a game out of reach (4) than Spooner. Advertisement After Spooner’s knee injury in Game 3, Toronto was knocked out of the first round of the playoffs by Minnesota. Toronto is going to need to figure out how to score without Spooner and they should have enough new and returning players to do so. The team still has Sarah Nurse, who finished second in league scoring, and Emma Maltais, who had a top-10 scoring campaign of her own. The Sceptres did well at the draft, adding forward Julia Gosling and 2024 Patty Kazmaier winner Izzy Daniel. Toronto also signed the summer’s top free agent, Daryl Watts, who led Ottawa in goals (10) and finished third in points (17) last season. Can Sarah Fillier help the New York Sirens take the next step? New York finished at the bottom of the PWHL standings in its inaugural season, but in winning the draft lottery, won the right to select Sarah Fillier with the No. 1 pick. The 24-year-old forward has widely been viewed as a generational talent and the best of the incoming class of talent to the PWHL this season. Fillier is a talented center with high-end offensive tools, capable of making an immediate impact in New York. During the preseason, Fillier has been on New York’s top line on the wing beside Alex Carpenter, who led the Sirens in scoring last season and was a finalist for league MVP. Carpenter and Fillier are two elite offensive players — with high IQ, goal-scoring ability and vision of the ice — who can take turns finding one another in the slot all season if they stick together. “It’s a lot more fun to be on the same line than against her,” Carpenter said. “I think from the first day we had camp, we were firing on all cylinders. And I think that’s something that we wanted last year.” Last season, New York relied heavily on Carpenter and defender Ella Shelton to produce offense, but Fillier will add another dynamic scoring option to the top of the lineup and take some of the load off Carpenter — although they will likely be productive together on that top line. Advertisement Fillier is just one piece of a fresh start for the Sirens franchise with a new coach in Greg Fargo, the former Colgate women’s hockey coach; a new full-time home at the Prudential Center in Newark, N.J.; and other elite newcomers like defender Maja Nylén Persson. When will the PWHL be ready for expansion? Perhaps the biggest development of the offseason is that the PWHL is already looking to add up to two teams as soon as 2025-26. The league has sent out over 20 requests for proposals to interested potential expansion partners, according to Amy Scheer, the PWHL’s senior vice president of business operations. That includes markets the league has targeted, as well as groups that have approached the league expressing interest in having a PWHL team. The timeline will largely depend on the proposals — which the league hopes to finish gathering by the end of the calendar year — and the readiness and professionalism of potential markets. “We (don’t) want to make any rash decisions,” said Scheer. “And so we’ll take our time to have the proper conversations, do the proper research, and then make a decision based on what we learned. It could be next year. It could be two years. We’ll see.” The league will look at everything from the economic opportunity in potential expansion markets, population, youth hockey participation, women’s hockey history and existing infrastructure. In Canada, broadcast rights for all 90 games are split between TSN, RDS, CBC/Radio-Canada and Prime Video. CBC will broadcast 17 games on Saturday afternoons, starting with the first game of the season on Nov. 30 at 2 p.m. ET between Toronto and Boston. Prime Video will air all 16 Tuesday night games. TSN will carry 57 games throughout the season. And there will be French-language coverage of all 30 Montreal Victoire games. Sportsnet, which broadcast some games last season, is not among the streaming partners this season. Advertisement Last season, every game was broadcast on the league’s YouTube channel. This season, however, each Canadian broadcast partner holds exclusive streaming rights to PWHL games this season, which means games will no longer be available on YouTube in Canada. “The change is positive for the league because it helps us grow in terms of stability,” Scheer told The Athletic. “It helps us grow to ensure that the league is on the path to long-term health and that women’s hockey will be here for good.” Games will still be produced by the PWHL and available on YouTube in the United States and internationally. All 30 regular-season Boston Fleet games will be available on NESN and NESN+. The regional network will also air 30 additional PWHL games this season. MSG Network will also return as a regional broadcast partner and will air all 30 New York Sirens games. The Minnesota Frost season opener on Dec. 1 will be available on the local Fox affiliate (Fox 9+). A full-time Frost broadcast partner has yet to be announced. As of Saturday, the league has not announced a U.S. national broadcast rights holder for the 2024-25 season.

The Trojans hope to play spoiler.,"Sports Betting Notre Dame and USC continue one of college football’s most storied rivalries on Saturday, and the stakes are absolutely massive for the Fighting Irish. Notre Dame enters the game as more than a touchdown favorite on the road. As long as Notre Dame takes care of its business and wins, it should secure a spot in the 12-team College Football Playoff and could probably be as high as a No. 6 or 7 seed. A loss, which would be its second of the season, along with that staggering Northern Illinois defeat earlier in the year, would make the Irish sweat out the next two weeks. Advertisement While Notre Dame has not played the toughest schedule in the country, it has done its part by completely blowing out almost every team it has played. During its current nine-game winning streak, Notre Dame has won seven of those games by at least 20 points and an eighth game by 18 points. That includes massive wins over then-ranked Navy and Army. Quarterback Riley Leonard is also starting to hit his stride a bit and play better football. After throwing just six touchdown passes in his first seven games, he has eight touchdown passes (to just one interception) over the past four games. USC, meanwhile, has struggled in its first season of Big Ten football but has at least managed to win back-to-back games to get itself bowl-eligible. Also, do not be fooled too much by the pedestrian 6-5 record. All five of those losses have been by a single possession, including a three-point overtime loss to No. 4 Penn State. USC has the talent to make this game a fight, and you can never underestimate the rivalry factor or the potential for playing the role of spoiler.   Free, daily sports updates direct to your inbox.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,FIFA report: Saudi 2034 World Cup bid has 'medium' human rights risk,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5957860/2024/11/30/fifa-2034-human-rights-world-cup/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 07:14:20 GMT","According to a FIFA evaluation, Saudi Arabia's World Cup hosting bid in 2034 has ""good potential"" to spark reform","World Cup FIFA, the world governing body for football, released on Friday night its evaluation report for Saudi Arabia’s bid to host the men’s World Cup in 2034, awarding the nation a higher score for bidding requirements than it granted the successful Canadian, American and Mexican joint bid for the 2026 edition, while declaring the risk assessment for human rights to be “medium”. Advertisement FIFA also claim in their report that there is “good potential” for the competition to act as a “catalyst” for reforms within Saudi Arabia, saying it will “contribute to positive human rights outcomes”. Amnesty International described FIFA’s observations as “an astonishing whitewash” of Saudi Arabia’s human rights record. The bid report also declared the bid by oil-rich Saudi to have demonstrated a “good commitment to sustainability” while FIFA acknowledges that the Saudi bid presents an “elevated risk” in terms of timing due to the climate of the country. FIFA, which ordinarily holds men’s World Cups in June and July, says the bidder did not stipulate a proposed window for the tournament but pledged to collaborate to “ensure the tournament’s success”, implying we may see a repeat of the 2022 edition in Qatar which was shifted to the winter months to allow for the safety of participants and supporters. FIFA ranks its World Cup bids out of five and awarded the Saudi bid a score of 4.2, higher than the so-called United bid for 2026, which was rated 4.0. For the Women’s World Cup in 2027, Brazil’s successful bid was ranked 4.0, while the defeated joint bid of Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany was given a score of 3.7. FIFA released its report in an email to media at 12.33am Central European Time on Saturday morning. Almost immediately, reports emerged in Middle Eastern English-speaking outlets such as the Saudi Gazette, declaring that the Saudi bid had received the highest ever score from FIFA when bidding for a World Cup. The Saudi bid for the 2034 World Cup had already been considered a nigh-on inevitability because it was the only bidder for the tournament. This outcome developed after FIFA announced a mega-edition bid for the 2030 World Cup, which would be hosted across three continents (Africa, Europe and South America) and six countries (Morocco, Spain, Portugal, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay). Advertisement This ruled those three continents out of bidding for the following World Cup in 2034, while the joint U.S., Canada and Mexico event for 2026 ruled out a return to North America due to FIFA’s principle of confederation rotation. This left the Saudis with a clear run in the absence of a rival from elsewhere in Asia or Oceania, subject to a vote of member nations at the FIFA Congress on December 11, which was widely seen as a formality. FIFA’s report say their evaluation “consulted various sources, including the bidder’s human rights strategy, the mandated context assessment, as well as direct commitments from the host country and host cities, together with all contractual hosting documents, all of which notably contain provisions relating to respecting human rights in connection with the competition”. However, The Athletic revealed last month how 11 organisations — including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, a Saudi Arabian diaspora organisation and human rights groups specialising in the Gulf region — raised major concerns about the credibility of a report for FIFA entitled “Independent Context Assessment Prepared for the Saudi Arabian Football Federation in relation to the FIFA World Cup 2034”. The independent context assessment, produced by the Saudi arm of global law firm Clifford Chance, excluded a large number of internationally recognised human rights from its assessment, saying this was because “either Saudi Arabia has not ratified the relevant treaties or because the Saudi Football Federation did not recognise them as ‘applying’ to the assessment”. This meant it avoided delving into matters many would consider pertinent to Saudi, notably relating to freedom of expression, association and assembly, as well as LGBTQI+ discrimination, the prohibition of trade unions, the right to freedom of religion and forced evictions. Advertisement The report said that the scope of its assessment was “determined by the Saudi Arabian Football Federation in agreement with FIFA”, suggesting that FIFA itself approved the omissions. Both the Saudi Football Association and FIFA did not respond when approached by The Athletic at the time. In a press release by the rights groups, they claimed that “Saudi Arabia’s already dire human rights record has deteriorated under the de facto rule of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman” and cited a “soaring number of mass executions, torture, enforced disappearance, severe restrictions on free expression, repression of women’s rights under the male guardianship system, LGBTI+ discrimination, and the killing of hundreds of migrants at the Saudi Arabia-Yemen border”. “As expected, FIFA’s evaluation of Saudi Arabia’s World Cup bid is an astonishing whitewash of the country’s atrocious human rights record,” added Steve Cockburn, Amnesty International’s head of labour rights and sport. “There are no meaningful commitments that will prevent workers from being exploited, residents from being evicted or activists from being arrested. “By ignoring the clear evidence of severe human rights risks, FIFA is likely to bear much responsibility for the violations and abuses that will take place over the coming decade. Fundamental human rights reforms are urgently required in Saudi Arabia, or the 2034 World Cup will be inevitably tarnished by exploitation, discrimination and repression.” The FIFA bid evaluation, published on Saturday morning, leans heavily on the Clifford Chance report. It does not make any references to the terms “LGBTQI+”, “sexuality” or “sexual orientation”, while the only mention of women’s rights within Saudi Arabia can be found with references to the growth of the women’s game and women’s participation in football within Saudi. The bid evaluation says that Saudi “has made significant strides in developing interest and grassroots participation for women and girls, and at the elite level”. The bid, which ranks by low, medium or high, also gives a medium level of risk to stadiums, transport and accommodation, as well as the previously explained “event timing”. Stadiums are awarded a 4.1 rating out of five, despite eight of the proposed 15 stadiums for the tournament being new-builds. FIFA said this presented a “slightly elevated” risk profile. Advertisement The bid evaluation says the Saudi bid submitted commitments from the government to “respect, protect and fulfil internationally recognised human rights in connection with the competition, including in the areas of safety and security, labour rights (in particular fundamental labour rights and those of migrant workers), rights of children, gender equality and non-discrimination, as well as freedom of expression (including press freedom)”. FIFA says the Saudis have committed to “equitable wages”, as well as “decent working and living conditions for all individuals involved in the preparation and delivery of the FIFA World Cup, including through the establishment of a workers’ welfare system to monitor compliance with labour rights standards for tournament-related workers”. They also say the Saudis will “engage with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in relation to its commitment to upholding international labour standards in all activities associated with the competition.” The treatment and rights of migrant workers were among the biggest talking points before and during the 2022 World Cup, staged in neighbouring Qatar. GO DEEPER World Cup 2022 migrant worker diaries, one year on: Death, regret, joy and trying to return FIFA simultaneously released its report for the sole bid for the 2030 World Cup, which will be held in Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay. The 2030 bid, which does not have a rival, will also be voted on by the member nations on December 11. It also received a rating of 4.2 out of 5, with the only medium risk factors judged to be stadiums, accommodation, transport, and the legal framework of the tournament. The “sustainable event management” and “environmental protection” of a competition held across three continents was judged to be a “low” risk. The report says that the “environmental impact assessment and initial carbon footprint assessment by the bidder, together with the commitments, objectives and mitigation actions outlined, provide a good foundation for the development of effective strategies towards managing the negative impacts of the tournament on the planet and protecting the environment”.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Is Lewis Dunk no longer guaranteed his starting role at Brighton?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5957536/2024/11/30/brighton-dunk-hurzeler-england/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 06:53:15 GMT","The centre-half had started his previous 249 Premier League appearances, but he may no longer be first-choice in Fabian Hurzeler's team","EPL Fabian Hurzeler has a big call to make ahead of Thursday’s game away to Fulham over Lewis Dunk. Does the Brighton & Hove Albion head coach restore his captain to the starting line-up, or will he leave him on the bench for a second match running? Dunk made the 250th Premier League appearance of his career for the club as a second-half substitute in Friday night’s underwhelming 1-1 draw against bottom side Southampton at the Amex Stadium. The previous 249 outings, spread across Brighton’s top-flight era since 2017, had been as a starter, so it is unfamiliar territory for the central defender to be a spectator. Advertisement In the past it has been a straightforward decision to pick Dunk when he is available, such is his influence both as a player and leader in the setup. He has missed only 34 of 279 Premier League matches for his home city club — testimony both to his fitness and his rare absences through suspension. But the landscape has now shifted. There is unprecedented depth in Brighton’s squad, including at the heart of the defence. Dunk is no longer an automatic choice. He should have reached the 250-game landmark as a starter against Wolves in October, but a calf injury sustained during the warm-up ruled him out of that game. Brazilian Igor Julio took Dunk’s place at short notice in the chaotic 2-2 draw as Wolves snatched a point after going 2-0 down in the 85th minute. It was tempting to imagine two points would not have been thrown away had Dunk been marshalling affairs, but the way Igor performed subsequently alongside Dutch international Jan Paul van Hecke in 2-1 victories at home to Manchester City and away to Bournemouth — following a defeat against Liverpool by the same score at Anfield — prompted Hurzeler to maintain the status quo for Southampton’s visit. “It was not an easy one,” explained Hurzeler after the game. “He (Dunk) is my captain, so one of the most important players. But I think Igor and JP have done well. I explained it to him and he came in and showed his impact to the team, showed his role immediately. He will help us to win games next time.” Dunk came on as part of a triple substitution in the 72nd minute in place of right-back Tariq Lamptey, slotting in with Van Hecke to his right and Igor to his left. He had a chance to win the game from a corner, but showed his rustiness after five weeks out as his header flew well off target. Hurzeler is right when he says Dunk will help the team win games. Whether “next time” means against Fulham is another matter. Advertisement Hurzeler talked Dunk up to such an extent in his pre-match press conference on Thursday that it created the impression he would go straight back into the side. “He is my captain,” Hurzeler said. “And he is captain for a long time now and is a player of big quality. It is very important to also see his role and what he gives to the team. We should never underestimate this. “Of course Igor and JP, they are doing great jobs so far and that gives us competition in training. Lewis is a very important player for me. He helps the team, he helps me, he has great experience and knows what to do to be successful in the Premier League. “Now we have a lot of games and I’m sure there will be several options to change the formation and the players who are playing together. Igor and Lewis, Lewis and JP, Lewis, JP and Igor — they can all play together. “I love the way they are all back and they are all in great shape. Now we will see how fast Lewis is back in the team (and) get him reintegrated. But it is clear he is my captain and he’s one of the most important players in the team for me and he will help us to be successful.” Hurzeler changed his tune when asked by The Athletic after the game whether the situation with the central defenders would encourage the possibility of returning to the back three he employed at St Pauli on their way to the Bundesliga 2 title last season. He ruled that out, saying: “I think we have too many offensive players to go with three at the back. You have to adapt to the profiles you have here and what fits best for the team. That’s, I think, a back four.” In all probability, then, it is an intriguing straight choice at Fulham between Igor and Dunk, the recipient of a congratulatory tweet from England on his recent 33rd birthday. Wishing a very happy birthday to Lewis Dunk! 🎂 pic.twitter.com/aSAGvZLxj5 — England (@England) November 21, 2024  Dunk’s England career looks over after six caps spread across as many years. He had a watching brief in Germany last summer in the squad beaten in the final of the European Championship by Spain under Gareth Southgate, then was left out by interim coach Lee Carsley for the September, October and November internationals. It is hard to see Thomas Tuchel changing course when he replaces Carsley in January. Advertisement That leaves Dunk free to concentrate on leading Brighton’s quest to qualify for Europe for the second time in three seasons. The point against Southampton may have felt like scant reward, but it did lift them to second in the table with an identical record to Manchester City, above the reigning champions on alphabetical order ahead of the weekend fixtures. Dunk has never missed more than nine games in a single Premier League season. Yet a combination of advancing years increasing the risk of injury and the greater competition for places could see him dip below that proud record of appearances consistency.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"Payton Pritchard's impact for Celtics is huge, particularly one offensive rebound",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5957980/2024/11/30/celtics-bulls-payton-pritchard/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 06:50:25 GMT","“The key to him is he finds different ways to impact games,” Joe Mazzulla said. “He’s grown as a player over the course of his career.""","NBA CHICAGO — For all of the shots Payton Pritchard drilled while blazing down the Bulls on Friday night, Joe Mazzulla expressed more love for an offensive rebound the Celtics guard earned during his fourth-quarter takeover. Following a Jayson Tatum missed free throw with about four minutes left in Boston’s 138-129 win, Pritchard timed his jump perfectly to beat Lonzo Ball and Nikola Vucevic to the board. The smallest guy on the court should not have come down with that ball, but Pritchard has made a career of shedding every limitation his height could have placed on him. That’s why, no matter what anyone asks Mazzulla about Pritchard, the coach almost always seems to circle back to his belief that Pritchard is a complete player. Advertisement “The key to him is he finds different ways to impact games,” Mazzulla said Friday. “He’s grown as a player over the course of his career. Tonight it was his shooting, but that rebound he got was timely. And just his ball pressure and his defense. So he’s a complete player.” If Mazzulla says it enough, maybe everyone will realize it. But for as much as Pritchard impacts the Celtics in other ways, the team has also asked him to become more of a scorer. Before the season started, Pritchard said the Boston coaches informed him they wanted him to play with more freedom. After he showed off his well-rounded game in a breakout campaign last season, they wanted him to look for his own offense more aggressively. Even with every key player back from last season’s championship team, Mazzulla intended to find ways for the Celtics to evolve. Unleashing Pritchard has paid off already. Already valuable in his previous role, an even greener light has transformed him into one of the league’s most ignitable players — and, his teammates seem to agree, an early front-runner for the Sixth Man of the Year award. Pritchard’s blossoming powers crystalized again Friday as he took down the Bulls with 19 points during the first 6:35 of the fourth quarter. After slow starts to the final three quarters, the Celtics trailed by four points early in the fourth when Pritchard seized control. He started his streak by popping in a 27-foot 3-pointer from the left wing. He followed up that first bucket by scoring on each of the Celtics’ next two possessions, first with a long 3-pointer from the other wing and then with a hesitation move past Josh Giddey. Even at that point, Pritchard said he didn’t realize he had entered another hot spell in an early season full of them. “I really just thought I was just taking good shots,” Pritchard said. “I didn’t really realize I was on a heater or anything until probably I hit that deep one when they switched. Vucevic was on me, Zach LaVine dropped back and I hit it from deep after Sam (Hauser) slipped out on the screen. That’s kind of how I knew I had it going.” Advertisement Pritchard finished with a season-high 29 points, including 19 points on 7-for-8 shooting in the fourth quarter. He made five 3-pointers in the decisive period, all during a 21-10 run that turned a four-point Boston deficit into a seven-point lead. While he scored all but two of the Celtics’ points during that flurry, his teammates continued to look for him time after time. Pritchard carried the Celtics after they lost Derrick White to a sore foot. Though White did not address reporters after the game, Mazzulla said the guard told him he will be fine. White was seen walking without any wrap or brace on his foot in the Boston locker room. Only a truly confident player would command more and more responsibilities as Pritchard has on a team loaded with current and former All-Stars. Pritchard, averaging 15.6 points per game this season, doesn’t just want the ball. He has turned himself into enough of a force that his most established teammates, including Tatum and Jaylen Brown, want him to have the ball. The fourth-quarter run materialized because Brown allowed it to happen. He fed Pritchard for his first two 3-pointers during the stretch, then took a step back so Pritchard could ride out his hot hand. “JB was finding me,” Pritchard said. “I hit two 3s and then they were pressing up and I got to the rim one time. So I just knew the flow was good. They were pressing up so I was going to be able to get what I wanted.” At least publicly, Pritchard has never doubted himself. His unshakable self-belief carried him to an All-America career at Oregon. It allowed him to step into an immediate role as a rookie with the Celtics. It kept him afloat when Malcolm Brogdon took his minutes during the 2021-22 season and enabled him to bounce back the following season after Boston traded Brogdon. The Celtics did that partially because they thought Pritchard could handle the backup point guard role. He has thrived in it since — though, when trying to explain his faith in himself, he actually remembered his rocky start to last season. Advertisement “My confidence has always been there,” Pritchard said. “It’s funny, if you go back a year (ago), like, what were my stats and numbers? I think I was awful. I think I had five straight games where I didn’t score at the beginning of last year (he actually started the season by going scoreless in four of the first seven games). But it’s not like riding those lows or the highs. It’s just maintaining this balance of just a strong belief and showing up every day, working and keep getting better and better and better. Ultimately, things will turn out to be good for you. So this is, for me, it’s just maintaining that confidence.” His teammates have all seen it. Pritchard earned their trust through years of proving himself on the court, not just in games but also in the practice facility where he works as hard as anyone. Tatum said Pritchard’s tenacity stood out even when they competed against each other as teenagers. “We were in the same high school class, so I’ve been seeing that fearless, competitive nature ever since we were like 13,” Tatum said. “It’s been pretty cool to see him grow into the player that he is and being effective on a championship team. The things that he’s doing, he’s Sixth Man of the Year-worthy for me.” The benefits of Pritchard’s work ethic didn’t arrive all at once but have continued to let him progress through the ups and downs of his career. The other Celtics, who have witnessed his development throughout the years, could see this coming. “Just seeing him put in the work every day,” Tatum said. “You’ve gotta earn the respect of your teammates. We’ve all had to do it that was in the league before him. And you do that by showing up every day. Everybody does a great job of getting their treatment, getting their recovery, getting in the weight room. P’s always working out on the court. Preseason, he’s always playing one-on-one and trying to get up extra shots. We see the work that he puts in and we trust him to make the right plays.” The Celtics easily could have lost Friday, with rough stretches in every quarter but the first one forcing them to come back several times. Kristaps Porziņģis said their defense was “far from ideal” and allowed the Bulls, including Vucevic, to catch fire. The big man scored 32 points on 11-for-16 shooting, including 6-for-9 from behind the arc. Pritchard burned brighter when it mattered most. Advertisement “The way he was hooping at one point was just unbelievable to watch,” Porziņģis said. “And he’s capable of that. That’s why I think for the opposite teams it’s usually an emphasis to try to stop him. When he comes in with that second unit, he’s just so explosive and he can turn a game around. And we needed him tonight and he brought it like I haven’t seen this season yet.” Turned loose, Pritchard is consistently showing how much he deserves all of the extra freedom. These days, the Celtics trust him as much as he has always trusted himself. “I think it’s just through the hard work,” Pritchard said. “They see the hours I put in and that builds respect throughout my teammates. That’s how I get respect from other people but also how other people earn my respect is just through the work. That’s what I lean on. Every day I’m just trying to get better and better and better.” Payton Pritchard and Steph Curry are the only players in the NBA who are shooting at least 44% from distance on at least 8.0 3PA per game. pic.twitter.com/TubUkIiObQ — Marc D'Amico (@Marc_DAmico) November 30, 2024  Following the Celtics win, Sam Hauser shook his head while walking off the court partly because of the strange shot he had just made to end the game. With Boston’s NBA Cup hopes still alive, Mazzulla called a timeout with 1.4 seconds left and the Celtics ahead by six points. Under normal circumstances, Boston would have just allowed the clock to run out, but point differential matters in the NBA’s in-season tournament. So Mazzulla drew up a play that produced a corner 3-pointer for Hauser as time expired. He didn’t seem to love the idea of trying to score in a game the Celtics had already wrapped up. “It was nice to see one go through the hoop,” said Hauser, who had missed all four of his previous 3-point attempts. “Plus, it was just awkward circumstances obviously. So, a little bit of everything.” Adding to the awkward circumstances, the Celtics had some history with the Bulls in the NBA Cup. With Boston looking to increase its point differential in the final game of the group stage last season, Mazzulla decided on the highly unusual strategy of intentionally fouling Andre Drummond while ahead by 29 points, and again while ahead by 32 points, in the fourth quarter. Because the Celtics were beating Chicago by so much at the time, Billy Donovan took offense to the decision to Hack-a-Drummond. Advertisement “I thought Andre was being put into a bad situation,” Donovan remembered. “That’s all.” Even some of the Celtics players didn’t feel comfortable with their methods that night, but they were only trying to play by the rules set out for them. To advance, they needed to win by a wide margin. They just didn’t know exactly what that number would be. “It was weird,” Hauser recalled before Friday night’s game. The end of the Celtics’ win Friday brought back those memories. “It is weird that it happened to be the Bulls two years in a row and us having to win by a certain amount of points to try to get into this in-season tournament (group stage),” Hauser said. “So it’s nothing against them. They just happen to be the team that we’ve been playing for our last Cup game.” After failing to win their group, the Celtics will need some help to reach the knockout stage of the tournament this season. They will be scoreboard watching Tuesday night while other teams finish their group stage schedules. “To be honest, I still don’t know what needs to happen,” Hauser said. “So I’ll have to ask someone and then I’ll be tuned in whenever I hear.” (Photo of Payton Pritchard battling the Bulls’ Coby White for a loose ball: Luke Hales / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,"In NHL debut, Kings goalie Erik Portillo steals win over Ducks: 'Incredible feeling'",https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5957931/2024/11/30/kings-ducks-erik-portillo-nhl-debut/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 05:26:42 GMT","In a 2-1 win over the Ducks, the Kings' goalie of the future showed a glimpse of what he can one day offer in a regular role.","NHL ANAHEIM, Calif. — There are hairy moments on any night for an NHL goalie, and on this momentous embryonic one for Erik Portillo, there were two among the several faced by the Los Angeles Kings netminder that went above and beyond the standard one typically faces. Take when Portillo’s skate blade became an issue midway through the third period of a one-goal Kings lead he’s protecting against the Anaheim Ducks. The repair job by equipment manager Darren Granger took longer than both anticipated, with Portillo needing to retreat to the visiting locker room at Honda Center and David Rittich having to come in cold against a Ducks team making its push for a tie in the Black Friday matinee. Advertisement The position itself is the most stressful in hockey. Now add in a sudden exit and a delayed return in your very first NHL game, a potential victory just 9 1/2 minutes away. “But they did an incredible job to get it fixed,” Portillo said. “It’s not easy when it’s jammed up like that.” The second hairy moment was more significant. The Kings were trying to get the puck out of their end with the Ducks having pulled John Gibson for a sixth skater, and a failed clearing attempt suddenly appeared on Troy Terry’s stick in the slot with nothing between him and the 6-foot-6 Portillo with 15 seconds left. “I don’t think you have time to think,” Portillo said. “You just got to compete. Find a way to get the job done.” The lanky Swede stretched his 210-pound frame behind him and managed to get his right skate in the way of Terry’s backhand try even after the Ducks’ leading scorer drew him to the ice. Vladislav Gavrikov, in a mad rush, dove over to block a follow-up attempt by Terry. Troy Terry comes oh so close to sending the game to OT in the dying seconds 🤏 pic.twitter.com/HgbgZq9nHL — Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) November 29, 2024  “Ports played brilliant, I would say,” Gavrikov said, owning up to his failed clear. “Taking that one (away). And then I just tried to cover the rest of that part of the net. It worked out perfectly. Ports got the first win. We got a win. Everyone’s happy.” The Kings squeezed out a 2-1 Freeway Faceoff win thanks to Portillo’s efforts against the Ducks, who would have been victorious on many other days with the kind of game Los Angeles coach Jim Hiller called Anaheim’s best among all those he’s scouted this year. But in that moment and numerous before, Portillo came up big and gave L.A. consecutive wins for the first time since Nov. 4-5 at Nashville and Minnesota. Advertisement In a season where the Kings’ maddening inconsistency was reflected earlier this week in a blowout loss at San Jose and a dominating home win over Winnipeg two nights later, it was a 24-year-old potential “goalie of the future” who gave them a much-needed lift now. As Hiller began his postgame address, he playfully joked with the media throng, wondering where the Portillo questions were after being asked often about when he would play and then saying of his goalie’s mid-game removal from the net, “Well, we didn’t like him, so we thought we’d take him out and give him a drink of water. Catch a breath.” Turning more serious, Hiller said: “I thought he maybe looked a little nervous early, but boy did he get himself together in a hurry. There’s not much to say. He was fantastic. He was big. That’s the one thing I noticed. He was big. His legs are long and quick. Couldn’t have had a better debut.” The Kings left it to goalie coach Mike Buckley to decide when Portillo was ready to go under the microscope after backing up Rittich four times since his call-up from AHL Ontario while Darcy Kuemper remains out with an apparent groin injury. With another game Saturday against Ottawa immediately on deck, Hiller said Portillo was getting one or the other. Portillo, whose strong season as an AHL rookie backed up the Kings trading for the Buffalo Sabres draft pick in March 2023, did wonder when it would be his turn. “But I trust the goalie department here,” he told The Athletic on Friday. “They’re incredible at preparing for — well, they prepared me since day one for this moment and for even more. I put all my trust in them that they’re going to put me in at the right time and I’m going to be ready when it’s time.” This was not like Wednesday when the Kings’ suffocation of the NHL-leading Jets required Rittich to just make the saves expected of him. The Ducks tested Portillo. Olen Zellweger had the first Grade A chance in the opening period. Alex Killorn and Frank Vatrano had great looks. Mason McTavish could have scored down low. Trevor Zegras hit the post off the rush. None of those pucks got by Portillo, though. Advertisement Just one did, a rebound goal by Ryan Strome that opened the scoring after Strome got an initial tip on Drew Helleson’s point shot. But the Kings knew that Portillo was up to the task. That was further proved in the third when he made critical stops on Cutter Gauthier and Sam Colangelo right after Alex Laferriere snapped a 1-1 tie. Alex Laferriere puts the Kings into the lead in the third with his 10th goal of the year!#GoKingsGo pic.twitter.com/o6Faa2SB4S — Hockey Daily 365 l NHL Highlights & News (@HockeyDaily365) November 29, 2024  “He kept us in it,” said Alex Turcotte, who tied the game at 10:46 of the second off another Anaheim turnover. “He made a lot of huge saves for us. I’d say he’s the main reason we won this game. Happy to have him and we’re really happy for him.” Added Gavrikov: “He showed up right away. The first minute, he made a couple huge saves for us. He showed us he was ready to play, and he gave us that momentum that we needed.” Confidence was the word Gavrikov and Hiller used in describing what Portillo gave them. The Kings can look unbeatable some nights and eminently beatable on others, which reflects in them not winning more than two in a row at any time. But they’re also sitting with a 13-8-3 record and in playoff position after American Thanksgiving — a key landmark for teams — even with a mixed record against upper-tier teams. Portillo, who made 28 saves, delivered a rarity for them this season. The Kings were outplayed but their goalie essentially won this game for them in his first NHL start with his parents, Malin and Andrés, in the seats after they flew in from Sweden on Thursday. “Some guys get in that environment, and they freeze,” said Ducks coach Greg Cronin, who hadn’t seen the former University of Michigan standout play. “He was terrific. He’s a big kid, he was aggressive in the net, he handled the puck well. He did a heck of a job.” Like the Kings, the Ducks have been trying to generate lasting momentum. Their play has improved from a ragged start to the season in a 5-2-1 stretch before Friday’s game, with road wins at Dallas, Chicago and Seattle mixed in. Gibson took the loss, but he’s started out 4-1-1 with a .922 save percentage since recovering from a September appendectomy to form a potent tandem in net with Lukas Dostal, their star in October. Advertisement The Kings have higher expectations to meet, but the Ducks’ goal is to take a meaningful step forward after six mostly woeful seasons. “I think what’s more encouraging is that we are doing it more consistently,” Strome said. “You can look at a game-by-game basis, it could be good any given night, but I think we have strung together maybe six or seven games we are pretty happy with. So, we are starting to follow the framework of the way we are supposed to play and what makes us successful.” Back in their own rink Saturday, the Kings have a winnable contest against the equally unpredictable Senators, and Rittich will be back in net after stepping in to make two saves in 83 seconds while Portillo had his skate fixed. Hiller acknowledged that “we’ve kind of been treading water a little bit” and that his team needs to be better than it was in Anaheim, though he credited the Kings for wanting their two points in Friday’s “street fight.” Next week is a light one with just two games, though those are real litmus tests against Dallas and Minnesota. The Kings could easily continue to lean on Rittich and will get Kuemper back in the mix when he’s ready. But Portillo earned another chance with his performance, even if it’s more likely that his time comes in 2025-26 unless injury or ineffectiveness creeps further into the L.A. net. “We’ll see where Kuemps’ injury takes him,” Hiller said. “But, yeah, you’re pretty proud of what Erik did tonight. He put on as good a goaltending performance as we’ve seen this year, and so you hope that he can build on that the next time he gets out.” The Kings have cycled through several goalies since cutting ties with the iconic Jonathan Quick. While they entered the year with around-the-block veterans Kuemper and Rittich, their system now has legitimate prospects in the up-and-coming Carter George and Hampton Slukynsky. Portillo started the organization’s build-up in the crease, and his time to show he can succeed in the NHL came Friday. Advertisement “It’s an incredible feeling, to be honest,” he said. “That’s what it is. It feels great to get it done today for the team. Wasn’t pretty by goalie technique standards, I think, but we found a way to battle and that’s important, too. You got to find a way to win games.” (Photo: Gary A.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Is Tottenham's Archie Gray finally about to be given the chance to play in midfield?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5951942/2024/11/30/archie-gray-midfield-tottenham/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 05:23:34 GMT",The 18-year-old has so far only played at the back - will Rodrigo Bentancur's suspension and a gruelling run of fixtures change that?,"EPL When Tottenham Hotspur were battling Brentford for Archie Gray’s signature in the summer, the 18 year old made it clear that his favoured position was central midfield. Gray made 47 appearances for Leeds United in the Championship last season, including the play-offs, and head coach Daniel Farke primarily used him as a full-back. Across a manic weekend at the end of June, Gray completed a medical with Brentford but changed his mind the following day and decided to join Spurs — who saw him as a midfielder — on a six-year contract in a deal worth up to £40million ($50.7m). Advertisement During his first six months in north London, Gray has played in multiple different positions but minutes in his preferred role have been hard to come by. This could change over the next few weeks while Rodrigo Bentancur serves a seven-match ban for racist comments he made about his team-mate Son Heung-Min. Tottenham are appealing the length of Bentancur’s suspension but he is currently unavailable until they face Nottingham Forest on December 26. The Uruguay international can still play in the Europa League, he started in their 2-2 draw with Roma on Thursday, but is due to miss crucial Premier League fixtures against Chelsea and Liverpool as well as the Carabao Cup quarter-final tie with Manchester United. Bentancur and Yves Bissouma have shared the holding midfield role this season. Bissouma has taken ownership of the position in the league and he impressed in Saturday’s stunning 4-0 victory over Manchester City. The Mali international cannot be expected to play every single minute of Premier League action while Bentancur is banned. Has the time come for Gray to be given a chance to flourish where many believe he belongs? Brentford’s recruitment department scouted Gray extensively. They believe he possesses the potential to become one of the best English midfielders of his generation. This is why they were prepared to smash their transfer record to sign a teenager who at the time had only made 52 senior appearances. Head coach Thomas Frank was heavily involved in trying to convince Gray to move to west London along with technical director Lee Dykes and director of football Phil Giles. When Brentford present to prospective signings, they analyse a large number of their games and break them down into two separate categories — green for a good performance and red for one that could have been better. They highlight how the player’s qualities complement Frank’s tactics and speak about areas for improvement. Advertisement Brentford explained to Gray and his representatives that he would spend two years playing as a No 8 in Frank’s 4-3-3 system, effectively operating as one of their advanced central midfielders. He would learn the intricacies of being a defensive midfielder from captain Christian Norgaard, who has been capped 32 times by Denmark. After his first two seasons, Gray would be ready to replace Norgaard as the first-choice holding midfielder. The England Under-21 international was impressed by Brentford’s pitch and the opportunity to play regularly in the Premier League, but decided instead to become a part of Ange Postecoglou’s project at Spurs. Multiple people familiar with Tottenham’s proposed deal have said there is an agreement that if Gray does not play a minimum number of minutes then he will be allowed to leave for a similar fee to the one Tottenham paid for him. Tottenham dispute that such an agreement exists. Tottenham sold Oliver Skipp (to Leicester) and sent Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg out on loan (to Marseille) in the summer but Gray knew competition for places in midfield would still be fierce. What the England Under-21 international would not have anticipated was partnering Skipp, before he joined Leicester City, at centre-back on his first appearance for Tottenham in a pre-season friendly against Hearts. He featured multiple times on tour in Japan and South Korea and told reporters out there: “Wherever (Postecoglou) puts me on the pitch, I’ll do that to the best of my ability and I don’t really care where I play.” During that tour, Tottenham’s captain Son heaped praise on Gray and Lucas Bergvall, another 18-year-old who joined in the summer. “It’s a joy to watch them and they are both working really hard,” Son said. “They just want to listen and learn. That’s very important at this age because you hope those guys both have an amazing bright future. I’m always trying to help the two of them because they just came here to a new club. Every single day they impress me with their attitude. They are young but they can make a huge impact for the team.” Gray lives close to the training ground in Hampstead. He is enjoying his time at Spurs and has a close relationship with Son, Fraser Forster and Ben Davies who are all senior members of the dressing room. He has a good friendship with James Maddison and Brennan Johnson, too. Johnson’s father, David, played with Gray’s dad, Andy, at Nottingham Forest. In training, he has paid close attention to and picked up tips from Bentancur and Bissouma about how to operate as a No 6. Advertisement Gray has started five times in the Europa League and twice in the Carabao Cup. He normally provides cover for first-choice right-back Pedro Porro but featured on the left in the 3-2 defeat to Galatasaray and Thursday night’s draw with Roma. It was his sensational lofted pass for Brennan Johnson that directly led to Will Lankshear’s goal in Istanbul. It was the perfect example of what he can offer when he pushes up into advanced central areas.  Playing in multiple positions can help a player’s development, giving them a more rounded skill set while exposing them to different challenges. Gray struggled at times coming up against Matheus Nunes in Tottenham’s 2-1 victory over Man City in the Carabao Cup. He will have learned from that experience and his one-v-one defending should improve every time he comes up against a tricky winger. Steven Gerrard, who was one of the best box-to-box midfielders in the Premier League, made his first start for Liverpool at right-back in a 2-1 defeat to Spurs at the old White Hart Lane in 1998. Gerrard was responsible for marking David Ginola but was substituted after 55 minutes when Liverpool were losing 2-0. The future Liverpool captain made a couple more appearances in defence before establishing himself in central midfield the following season. It is fair to say that temporarily playing in an unfamiliar position did not impact his career too much. There are a few cautionary tales though. At the beginning of his career, Ainsley Maitland-Niles was used as a wing-back by multiple managers at Arsenal and he earned five England caps under Gareth Southgate but it meant his attempts to return to midfield were futile. During the November international break, Gray started in defence for England’s under-21s in draws against Spain and the Netherlands. When Tottenham beat Ferencvaros in the Europa League last month, Gray started at centre-back with Cristian Romero but switched to left-back at half-time. The next day, Postecoglou praised his “temperament” and how he is “constantly looking for more information”. “Last night, I played him in two different positions and both are probably the least preferred for him,” Postecoglou said. “He has played right full-back and in centre midfield, I had him at left centre-back and left-back last night and I thought he did brilliantly again. I’m not going to just put him in different positions; at the moment we are using him where we need him. I think hopefully that gives him confidence in how much I trust him. Eventually we will settle him into an area but him playing at the moment, he has played in a Carabao Cup game away, two European games (and had) exposure in the Premier League already in the first 10 games of his Tottenham career, which I think is brilliant for us.” Advertisement On Friday, before Tottenham’s game against Fulham, Postecoglou said “I’m so excited by Archie” and praised his maturity, efficiency and calmness. Gray has only played five times in the top flight for a combined total of 42 minutes, according to Opta. The longest amount of time he has had on the pitch is the final quarter of an hour of Spurs’ victory over Everton and they had a comfortable 3-0 lead at the time. However, he is clearly highly valued by his head coach. Tottenham only named a 23-man squad in the Europa League, two fewer than the maximum, because they did not have enough locally trained players. Postecoglou took the tricky decision to omit Djed Spence. If Spence, who featured at left-back and right-back during loan spells with Genoa and Leeds last season, had been included then Gray might have played more in midfield. Although Brentford liked Gray’s versatility, the reality is he would have played in defence for them too. First-choice full-backs Rico Henry and Aaron Hickey have suffered setbacks in their recovery from long-term injuries, which means central defender Sepp van den Berg and midfielder Vitaly Janelt have provided cover for them. Tottenham’s form has been like a rollercoaster this season. They recorded resounding away victories over Man City and Manchester United but lost to Crystal Palace and Ipswich Town. Postecoglou’s side recovered from conceding first to beat West Ham United and Aston Villa 4-1. Due to the chaotic nature of those games, Postecoglou might have felt more experience was needed to secure victory. They have lost five league games in total and in those situations Postecoglou is more likely to make an attacking substitution. If Bentancur’s appeal is unsuccessful, then Tottenham will have to cope without him for a run of six domestic games in three weeks. It feels like the perfect opportunity to see what Gray is capable of in midfield either in the second-half of games to give Bissouma a breather or from the start.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,‘I want to play for Crystal Palace in the Premier League and my height won’t hold me back’,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5949641/2024/11/30/whitworth-crystal-palace-exeter-england/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 05:20:48 GMT",The young loanee has kept nine clean sheets in League One and is excelling in his first full season of senior football at Exeter City,"EPL Joe Whitworth knows the question is coming. He has been asked it many times before and the issue never seems to go away. Even on Tuesday night, as he prepared to defend a penalty for Exeter City against Birmingham City, the chant from the away fans behind his goal touched upon it. “Alfie May, he’s taller than you,” they sang. Advertisement For the record, May is 5ft 9in. So the question is whether Whitworth, a goalkeeper on loan at the League One club from Crystal Palace and who is under 6ft tall himself, believes his relative lack of height has held him back. “No, not at all,” the 20-year-old tells The Athletic. “My dad said to me that you just have to make every other part of your game strengths. I’ve done that over the years. My height might have been a disadvantage, but I don’t think it is anymore. The average goalkeeper height has gone down a lot and you see a lot more shorter goalies than before. It doesn’t matter at all. My agility, speed and power help me. “People will always look at crossing but I feel like I’ve dealt with that really well and improved a lot. My height won’t hold me back.” As for the Birmingham fans’ chant, it is fair to say it tickled him. “That one was probably my favourite. When you play in big stadiums there aren’t many people near the pitch. But at these grounds, there are people right, right next to you, shouting and telling you you’re this and that. I love it, it makes me play better and I thrive on that. “Instead of getting rattled about it, if you laugh they’ll respect that and laugh back.” That is a mature attitude from a young player experiencing his first taste of regular senior football. Whitworth has risen through the academy ranks at Palace, the club he and his family support, after joining from AFC Wimbledon aged 13. Now, after waiting patiently for regular senior involvement, the loan to Exeter is offering opportunities. Before the midweek round of games, no goalkeeper across the Premier League or Football League boasted more clean sheets this season than his nine in League One. Five of those came in consecutive appearances. “I don’t really get too honed in on loads of stats, but I want more,” he says of the shut-outs. “One of the things about coming here was Exeter’s track record of bringing young players in, developing them and moving them on to bigger things — look at Jay Stansfield and Luke Harris (both now at Birmingham, the latter on loan from Fulham), and Viljami Sinisalo (now of Celtic) in goal last season. Advertisement “When I spoke to the gaffer, Gary Caldwell, I saw how much confidence he had in me and how much he thought I could bring to the team. He wanted me to come in and be a leader from the off. I feel I’ve done that. The goalkeeping coach, Kevin Miller, being an ex player was a big thing. It really helps that he played and he can give me tips when we go through clips of games. “The main thing for me is to become a leader of the group and play as many games as possible. I’ve consistently performed. I’m loving life down here; the group is good, we are really together. The gaffer and Kevin Miller have been amazing with me on and off the pitch.” That is Miller the former Palace goalkeeper who featured 76 times for the club between 1997 and 1999. Whitworth is too young to have seen him play, but says his grandad has shared his memories. “He’s told me a few times about some different games, some of the saves he’s made. No videos yet, but I’m sure that’ll come,” he says. “When he brought me in he told me he had so much confidence in me, how many times he’d watched me and how much the gaffer believes in me. When you come in and see it, hear how they speak to me… it gives me confidence from how much they believe in me. “The main thing they wanted me to bring to the team was the ‘in possession’ stuff and my personality.” How would he describe his personality? “You’ll have to ask someone else,” he says through a smile. “No, I feel like I’m energetic and a leader on and off the pitch. My willingness to win comes out. I want to drive standards, help people out, be there for people and lead. I’m quite loud and I communicate a lot. “Playing outfield as a striker for a long period of time when I was younger definitely helped me playing out from the back. The in-possession side of my game has always been very good; one of my standouts. The game is moving in a way where a lot of teams play out from the back and want the goalie to be on the ball a lot. It massively helps me. I like to show what I can do with the ball at my feet. It does give a different dimension to our team and helps us a lot. “I came here to play as many games as possible and make an impact. I want to perform consistently — to play 40 or 50 games here. We want to be in the top half of the table and push for the play-offs. That would be incredible.” Whitworth might have had to wait for his first senior loan, but he already has Premier League experience under his belt. He has made two top-flight appearances for his boyhood club. Vicente Guaita was ruled out of Palace’s match with arch rivals Brighton & Hove Albion in March 2023 through injury and, with Sam Johnstone also absent, then manager Patrick Vieira turned to Whitworth to fill in at the Amex stadium. The youngster found out only hours before kick-off that he was playing. Advertisement “To be on that pitch with the Palace badge on my chest was my dream and my family’s dream as well,” he says. “My grandma, grandads uncles, mum, dad — everyone’s been there watching since before I was born. “The only thought in my mind was to perform well for the team because I knew how big a game it was. To lose (1-0) hurt me so much. It didn’t really sink in for probably weeks. Then it came to a year after I played and that was probably when I was like: ‘Wow, I actually achieved this dream and played in the Premier League like so many young people growing up want to.’ It was amazing.” His second appearance came a few days later in a 4-1 defeat away at Arsenal, this time under his former Under-18s and Under-21s manager Paddy McCarthy after Vieira’s dismissal in the wake of that defeat at the Amex. “I just remember him saying that he was proud of me,” Whitworth says of McCarthy. “We have been through a lot together and to get to that moment was the pinnacle of anything in English football. “The Emirates stadium being so big, with 75,000 people there… that was my first real taste of playing in front of that many people. It was a tough result but I absolutely loved playing for Palace in front of the away fans. I’ll be forever grateful for it.” That evening the song from the away end was “Super Joe Whitworth in goal” as the travelling support serenaded one of their own. It has been repeated by the Exeter faithful this season, his status helped by a penalty save — something he made a habit of with Palace’s under-21s — in his first game against Yeovil Town during pre-season. “When it first started at Palace it really put a smile on my family’s face,” he says. “Then the fans at Exeter have been amazing with me and them singing that song means the world to me. To be able to hear it after I’ve made saves, before games and when I come and clap the fans is great, and I love it. Advertisement “I believe I’m going to save every penalty I face. You can watch clips of people as much as you want, but anything can happen in the moment. As a goalie unit here we will watch clips of penalties of every basically every player in the opponents’ team and see where they go. But in the moment I just go with my gut feeling. I’ve saved a few so it’s worked for me.” Whitworth has had to wait patiently as his contemporaries, in particular fellow Palace academy goalkeeper Owen Goodman and Brighton’s James Beadle, both his age, have secured loan moves of their own — to Colchester and now Wimbledon, and Oxford United and Sheffield Wednesday respectively. “I love that guy,” he says of Goodman, while he has played against Beadle on numerous occasions over the years when Palace have come up against Charlton, from whom Beadle was signed by Brighton. The pair are good friends. There is no bitterness at having to spend an extra season in academy football compared to Goodman. “Seeing Owen do really well in League Two over the past two seasons… it’s been amazing for me to speak to him and get advice off him because this is my first year in senior football,” he says. “We speak most weeks. It’s different for every goalkeeper and, for some reason, it didn’t happen with me that year. I’m not bothered at all. Seeing my mates doing well and getting experience was the important thing. Now it’s my turn.” He has aspirations to play for England, where he has also risen through the youth ranks. But further recognition will be reward for performing well domestically. And, while his priority is winning games with Exeter in the south-west, it is back in south London where his heart lies. Not far from Selhurst Park, just a five-minute walk up Whitehorse Lane, there is a street that bears his name. The stadium’s proximity to Whitworth Road adds to the sense that the family is intertwined with this club. His younger brothers, Harry and William, are also goalkeepers at the club’s academy. Palace is in their blood. Advertisement “I’ve been told about that road ever since I was young, mostly by my granddad,” he adds. “I haven’t played at Selhurst in the Premier League yet, but to do that would be the pinnacle and reward for me and my family for all the hard work we’ve put in. That will be the biggest thing I’ve done for sure. “I want to play for Palace in the Premier League. Whether that’s soon or in four or five years’ time, I’m not bothered. I want to play for them again and play for them consistently.” (Top photo: Andrew Vaughan/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How Liverpool’s Caoimhin Kelleher’s technique makes him a penalty expert,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5955056/2024/11/30/liverpool-caoimhin-kelleher-penalty-analysis/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 05:20:24 GMT",Caoimhin Kelleher made another save from a penalty kick against Real Madrid on Wednesday night,"EPL Liverpool forward Darwin Nunez wasted no time when chest-bumping his way into Caoimhin Kelleher to congratulate his goalkeeper. Kelleher had just denied Kylian Mbappe from the penalty spot in the Champions League on Wednesday night. Right-back Conor Bradley did the same in appreciation for the Republic of Ireland international. Kelleher had just helped preserve Liverpool’s clean sheet by palming away the Real Madrid forward’s spot-kick in a game Arne Slot’s team went on to win 2-0. Andy Robertson, who gave the penalty away against Madrid and in the previous game against Southampton, said he owes Kelleher dinner. Advertisement It was the third penalty stop the 26-year-old had made in the space of 13 days and only his fourth-ever penalty save in the course of a game (three for Liverpool, one for Ireland). The other six penalty saves he has pulled off for Liverpool came in three Carabao Cup shootouts — with Kelleher helping Liverpool reach the final and win the competition in 2021-22 and 2023-24. First, he kept out Dani Ceballos’s penalty as Liverpool overcame Arsenal in the fourth round of the competition in October 2019. He then stopped both Luke Thomas and Ryan Bertrand of Leicester City in a quarter-final shootout victory in December 2021. He failed to make a single stop in the 2022 final, but stepped up himself to score against Chelsea before watching counterpart Kepa Arrizabalaga send his over the bar — the 22nd penalty of a marathon shootout — to hand Liverpool the trophy. Later that year Kelleher again showed his prowess when completing a hat-trick of stops to deny Derby County trio Conor Hourihane, Craig Forsyth and Lewis Dobbin. That night was his first game for Liverpool’s first-team since the final in February. Right now Kelleher is on a roll in more ways than one. In the absence of Alisson he has continued to build on the “best No 2 in the world” tagline bestowed on him by Jurgen Klopp. And in the past fortnight, he has also proven himself to be a burgeoning expert in the field of penalties. Joel Pohjanpalo of Finland found that out during Ireland’s 1-0 win in the Nations League as Kelleher not only saved his penalty but smothered the rebound. Southampton’s Adam Armstrong managed to squeeze a rebounded effort underneath Kelleher after the Irishman initially denied the striker during Liverpool’s 3-2 win in the Premier League. Then came one of the world’s best players, in Mbappe. The World Cup winner with France looked like he wanted to be anywhere but Anfield as the cameras zoomed into him for a close-up after Kelleher firmly beat his strike, which would have levelled the game at 1-1, away to safety. Advertisement “For me, I don’t really look at the player too much,” Kelleher told TNT Sports, when asked about his process. “I felt confident. I’ve saved two in the last week or so. So yeah, I was confident and thankfully I went the right way again.” One noticeable thing is that Kelleher does not call upon the dark arts to assist him. “Every goalkeeper is different but the thing that stands out with Kelleher is how calm and patient he is in those situations,” The Athletic’s goalkeeping analyst Matt Pyzdrowski says. “He stands mostly still the entire time. He is the opposite of someone like Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa and Argentina), who dances on the line and really tries to kind of psych up the shooter with a lot of trash talking, physical movements and gestures.” Kelleher shows composure. He uses an old trick of the goalkeeping trade by placing his hands above his head to fill up his goal and make it appear smaller. “But then once the player is coming down to make their approach and shoot that’s when he gets into a more natural position where he’s leaning forward and ready to shoot himself towards the ball.” Kelleher waits until the taker has their standing leg planted and their shooting leg about to kick before picking a direction to move in.  “I know from my own experience a lot of players I played against, they want the keeper to move,” Pyzdrowski says. “A lot of offensive players today are watching the keeper to see them make a move and then when they don’t move, they panic and maybe don’t get the best hit on the ball. Kelleher’s save against Madrid and Mbappe (who pauses his run up in the below still) is a great example of that.  “Kelleher just reads Mbappe so well and is patient. He waits and waits and then finally goes as Mbappe is about to strike the ball. At that point, it’s already too late for Mbappe.” It is not just his stillness that has made Kelleher increasingly formidable, but how he stands on his toes before the taker is about to shoot and launches one foot off his line at the precise time the ball is kicked.  He also shifts his weight forward, which helps exaggerate his eventual step forward. It gives him energy and power to drive outwards towards the ball and make a stop. Against Finland he did not have to move far to deny Pohjanpalo, who struck the ball centrally. But you can clearly see Kelleher doing a Smooth Criminal-style anti-gravity lean forward to ensure his body weight is already shifting before he picks which way to dive.  “Part of it is the timing and how he’s trying to load for his dive, but also so he can get a favourable angle to save the ball,” Pyzdrowski adds. “His strength in his legs and ability to kind of push off as hard and accurate as he does is not something every goalkeeper can do. “You’ve seen some very good goalkeepers who during open play are excellent, but they never really figure out how to react to penalties. Kelleher has been put in a lot of situations in the shootouts and faced a lot of penalties. That’s how you get experience and confidence.” As seen below, he even stopped Armstrong’s penalty against Southampton, only for the striker to score from the rebound.  Most of Kelleher’s saves have been low or midriff-height, hit into the centre, left or right. Like most goalkeepers, if a player shoots into the top corners it limits the opportunity of making a stop. But his ability to get his hands far across as well as pushing out of his goal to meet the ball has proved a successful routine. “The other thing that he does very well is he often goes with both hands,” Pyzdrowski says, while reviewing Kelleher’s saves against Leicester, which included one from Luke Thomas (shown below). “And then he has a flexibility in his hands that, if he needs to extend with one, he can.”  “One of his saves against Leicester (in the Carabao Cup quarter-final shootout that Liverpool won 5-4, in December 2021) down to his left shows this brilliantly. “He goes with two hands. He’s kind of diving up and then just miraculously kind of shoots his left hand down and palms the ball out (as seen in the save from Bertrand below). Having that strength and flexibility is huge. But again, I think that’s the key to him going forward because if he does kind of a neutral dive to the side he won’t be able to keep that out.  “They are typical shots that you’ll get a hand on and the ball will still go into the net. But because he really throws himself forward every time, it’s a huge advantage. The angle where you meet the ball with the wrist and where you’re able to then flex the ball away with just a little swing of the wrist around the post is something you can only do when you go forward. Advertisement “In open play it’s important but in penalty situations where the angles have a really big impact on what happens both for the shooter and the goalkeeper, it is really important too. So I think for him to be able to make that step forward and kind of shoot his hands in front of the line is really key for him.” For Kelleher, training alongside players such as Mohamed Salah, whose penalty against Madrid hit the post, will have helped too. Pyzdrowksi says: “I know for sure that they sit in the locker room after training or after matches and talk about these things. When you have a shooter who is as lethal as Salah, I guarantee you that they talk about it and Kelleher probably asks for little tips from him on what he thinks about when he’s going to shoot. So he can obviously use that to his advantage when he faces other top strikers and opponents.” Penalties are psychological battles and each time Kelleher wins one he is building his confidence and a wider reputation. He also enters the pitch equipped like all modern-day goalkeepers with the data analysis of penalty takers imprinted on his mind. “When you save enough and you start to become known as a penalty expert, it gives you even more confidence in those situations,” Pyzdrowski adds. “And that whole psyche plays on the shooter’s mind too. And when you make a high-profile save in the Champions League like Kelleher, then it’s something that people are going to pay attention to.” (Top photo: Justin Setterfield/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Do Chelsea need to upgrade in the transfer market to become title contenders?,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5956135/2024/11/30/chelsea-transfer-premier-league-title-contenders/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 05:20:12 GMT","Chelsea are doing well in the Premier League, but do they need to add to their squad to hit elite levels again?","EPL Optimism is back in style at Chelsea. Enzo Maresca’s young team have emerged from a testing early Premier League schedule on a clear Champions League qualification trajectory, with an extended run of (theoretically) more favourable fixtures providing an opportunity to consolidate their hold on third place during what remains of 2024. Advertisement Cole Palmer is still really, really good, even if he and Chelsea are now being forced to adjust to opponents knowing just how good he is. Around him, a talented core has added greater coherence under summer appointment Maresca to the confidence cultivated last season by his predecessor Mauricio Pochettino, and results are coming despite ‘Marescaball’ still being in the developmental phase. The debilitating injury crisis that derailed a significant chunk of 2023-24 has finally eased (with the depressing exception of club captain Reece James), and co-owner Clearlake Capital’s grand strategy of assembling a young squad primed to peak in the game’s post-Pep Guardiola/Jurgen Klopp era is also being validated by outside events. Klopp is gone already and though Liverpool appear to have nailed the immediate transition to new head coach Arne Slot, contract decisions over Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold, all presently on course to be free agents come the summer, loom large. Guardiola has extended his stay as Manchester City manager by another two years but, at the very least, has a significant and complex rebuilding job on his hands. Arsenal have been the Premier League’s next great side for a while under Mikel Arteta, but the pressure for them to actually make that final transformative leap is growing. Now is a particularly good time for clubs with sky-high aspirations to think boldly. Chelsea have needed no encouragement to operate with that mindset in the first two years of this ownership group, for better and worse. The transfer market has been a key arena in which to demonstrate the scale of their ambition and that will not change, though Maresca hinted during a press conference in September that this season’s winter window and beyond at Chelsea will look very different to much of what has gone before. “The target after the last summer (window) is to try to do less things, but more specific,” he said. “This is the target for January and for next summer. Hopefully, it can be like this.” Chelsea are out of the overhaul business. The squad, contract and salary structure are now broadly where Clearlake want them to be, so from here the upgrades will be more targeted, and the desired gains inevitably more marginal. Advertisement Step one could reasonably be described as navigating the messy path from being old(er), expensive (in average-wage terms) and good to young, cheap(er) and good. Step two is figuring out how to go from good to great. Elite potential energises Chelsea’s recruitment staff, but the youthfulness coursing through the first-team squad at the club’s Cobham training base complicates many of these decisions. A burst of internal development can very quickly transform the tenor of a conversation about the need for reinforcement in a specific area of the pitch or even render it entirely obsolete. Only last summer, there was a consensus that Chelsea needed an elite No 9, and the club’s serious exploration of a deal for Victor Osimhen of Napoli highlighted that they were at least highly receptive to that line of thinking. Three months on, Nicolas Jackson is on pace to score 22 non-penalty goals in the Premier League this season, an unequivocally excellent return for any striker not named Erling Haaland. As long as he is playing as well as this and presumptive 2024-25 Conference League MVP Christopher Nkunku remains his highly over-qualified understudy, the notion of Chelsea adding another forward of Osimhen’s profile feels redundant and potentially even problematic. When the foundational pillar of your recruitment policy is projecting what a footballer might one day become rather than what they are now, it makes sense to foreground in your squad planning the possibility that the long-term solution to your problem is already in the building (or perhaps across the road, in the academy setup). Is it necessary to delve into the market again to service Maresca’s stated desire for greater “physicality” in his midfield, or might Cesare Casadei, Lesley Ugochukwu and Andrey Santos meaningfully help with that? Is it worth splashing out on a full-back with a polished technical skill set to fit a bespoke role in the Italian’s system, or is it better to back Malo Gusto to figure it out with time? Advertisement The physical frailties of James and Wesley Fofana leave space in the middle and on the right side of Chelsea’s defence for an elite defensive talent to mirror Levi Colwill’s growing value on the left of it. A smart recruitment team might well find that in a more obscure league, or it might just be Josh Acheampong, the 18-year-old Cobham-developed prospect now being monitored by several Premier League rivals and European giants while his contract situation remains unresolved. Chelsea could probably do with more final-third creation to relieve some of the burden on Palmer, given the level of defensive attention he now routinely attracts. But the Borussia Dortmund version of Jadon Sancho could certainly help with that, and within the next year, Estevao Willian and Kendry Paez will also be added to the mix. GO DEEPER Jadon Sancho offers Chelsea a timely reminder of exactly how effective he can be One position stands apart, though. Robert Sanchez turned 27 this month and is in his fifth season as a Premier League goalkeeper. There is nothing beyond infrequent flashes within that sizeable body of evidence to suggest a world-class breakthrough is in his future, and the audible lack of trust in him among the fans at Stamford Bridge provides another formidable obstacle to that outcome. Summer signing Filip Jorgensen has made a quietly encouraging start to his Chelsea career and may soon force a No 1 change, but he does not immediately come across as the kind of generational talent required to finally banish the unloved shadow of Thibaut Courtois. To fully realise his vision of football, Maresca needs a unicorn of a ’keeper, like an Alisson or Ederson, who combines spectacular fundamentals with the technical polish and temperament of an outfield player. It does not take long to realise just how rare a profile that is. Chelsea have high hopes that they may have found one in giant Belgian teenager Mike Penders, but he is just two games into his professional career with Genk back in his home country. Jorgensen might provide a capable bridge to that potential future, and a preferable one to signing yet another goalkeeper who does not tick all of the boxes; Djordje Petrovic’s situation highlighted last summer that even very solid ’keepers with more traditional skill sets can struggle to command lucrative resale value. GO DEEPER The Transfer DealSheet 2025: Delap tracked, Man Utd striker interest, Gyokeres state of play Maresca has been consistent in saying that what he and Chelsea need more than any transfer upgrade is time. He has a clear incentive to make that particular argument, but it also rings true; the average age of the Premier League champions over the past 10 seasons was 26.9 years, according to fbref.com. The average age of the Champions League’s winners over the same span has been 27. Chelsea’s average age in the league this season is 23.8. Advertisement One logical way to bring forward that time horizon — and perhaps even address Maresca’s concern about the lack of a “proper leader” in his squad” — would be to sprinkle this squad with a small number of proven elite performers still in their prime years. Chelsea are not exclusively focused on signing players aged 23 and under, but it would require something exceptional to test Clearlake’s commitment to their broader recruitment strategy and emphasis on lower base salaries with heavy incentives. Maybe something exceptional will come along. If it does not, Clearlake’s commitment to its plan for Chelsea necessarily doubles as a commitment to the kind of patience Maresca wants. After all, unlike the rivals who have dominated the top of the Premier League since the title last came to Stamford Bridge seven years ago, time is on their side.

To mark the occasion, The Athletic is running a series of pieces, celebrating the people and the moments who have helped make the club what they are today. Read more: Not Thiago, not Rafinha — the best player named Alcantara to ever grace Barcelona was Paulino. The Philippines-born striker was the main face of the ‘Golden Barcelona’ side of the 1920s, when the Catalan club won five out of 10 national championships and eight Catalan cups. Alcantara is Barca’s second-highest goalscorer — with 369, behind only Lionel Messi’s 672 (though this includes goals in non-competitive matches) — and was called “El Romperedes” (the net-breaker) for his powerful shot. He also worked as a doctor after graduating in his home country and did so while starring for Barca. He died in 1964 and was named the best Asian footballer of all time by FIFA in 2007. Advertisement The Swiss city will always be remembered by Barcelona fans for being where they won their first major European trophy of the modern era — the new-defunct Cup Winners’ Cup in May 1979. Barca beat Fortuna Dusseldorf of Germany 4-3, after extra time, in front of more than 30,000 of their travelling fans, the first mass following away from home. It was four years after the end of General Franco’s dictatorship in Spain and supporters wanted to freely express their love for the club for the first time in years. A god in Barcelona and the most transformative figure in the club’s history. Cruyff arrived as a player in 1973 and immediately helped Barca win the league again after a 13-year drought, orchestrating a historic 5-0 beating of Real Madrid at the Bernabeu along the way, and led them to the Copa del Rey in 1978. The Dutchman’s personality, daring character and unparalleled vision changed how football was perceived at Barcelona — then he did it all over again as a manager. From the dugout, he helped win four more league titles and their first European Cup title, while laying the foundations for the style of play still taught throughout the club. GO DEEPER Johan Cruyff and the incredible wallpaper drawings that explain modern football Inspired by the United States’ star-studded basketball team who won gold at the 1992 Olympics in the Catalan city, this is how the Barcelona side managed by Cruyff from 1988-96 also became known. Cruyff assembled a core of local players, trusting in graduates of their La Masia academy (such as Pep Guardiola and Guillermo Amor) and combining them with Basques (like Andoni Zubizarreta and Txiki Begiristain) and world-class talents from abroad (Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup, Hristo Stoichkov and Romario). Translated as ‘environment’, the word entorno is fundamental to understanding Barca’s identity and unique dynamics. Advertisement Cruyff used it for the first time in April 1992, after his team lost a European Cup game 1-0 against Sparta Prague, when referring to the off-field pressures at Barca — specifically his battle over decision-making with then-president Josep Lluis Nunez (of whom more later) and vice-president Anton Parera. Being president of Barca is an extremely sought-after role and one with plenty of power and public recognition attached to it — there is a case to be made it is even more important than being president of Catalonia. The club’s democratic nature means you have to win elections to become president, and to do that you have to gain votes from the socios, as members are known, who own the club. To do that, you need to win the narrative battle in the media. So the entorno can be described as being formed by the club’s board, former presidents, the manager and even the players’ agents and relatives. Its influence is still felt today. GO DEEPER Barcelona's 'entorno' - the toxic mix not even Guardiola and Xavi could avoid Barcelona’s women’s side are enjoying a glorious generation led by two-time Ballon d’Or winners Alexia Putellas and Aitana Bonmati — players who exemplify the club’s fine work and trust in this area. It arrived late, with Barca Femeni only fully established in 2002, despite their first game taking place in 1970. It then took them until 2015 to become fully professional, but that ignited their current era of European dominance. Barca have won five Spanish league titles in a row and three out of the past four Women’s Champions Leagues (finishing as runners-up in the other year), with Putellas and Bonmati winning the past four Ballons d’Or between them. The Swiss man who founded Barcelona 125 years ago today, after placing a magazine advert “wishing to organise some games” in the city. You can read all about him in Dermot Corrigan’s piece. GO DEEPER Barcelona 125: Joan Gamper, the man who built the club (thanks to a magazine advert) A trademark episode of Barcelona madness. The 1987-88 season was a difficult one for the club. After defeat in the 1986 European Cup final by Steaua Bucharest and finishing second to Real Madrid in the league for two consecutive seasons. Terry Venables had been sacked as coach by president Nunez and Luis Aragones had arrived in his place, but Barca were still going nowhere. Advertisement A team with talents such as Bernd Schuster and Gary Lineker underachieved in the league and Europe but did manage to win the Copa del Rey in March 1988. That empowered 22 first-team players to set up a press conference at the city’s Hesperia hotel, announcing a rebellion against Nunez. They felt the president had been dishonest when negotiating their contracts, with Nunez showing no willingness to speak and solve the situation. Led by their captain, Jose Ramon Alexanko, the players publicly asked Nunez to resign. He decided to stay firm, sack Aragones — who had backed the players — fire the majority of the squad and bring in a new manager who was already popular among the fans: Cruyff. Fourteen players left Barca the following season, with 12 more being signed. But that mutiny led to one of the best periods in the club’s history with Cruyff’s Dream Team (see above). Barca’s first home stadium, where they played from 1909 to 1922. Located in the heart of the city, it could hold up to 6,000 fans. But the team became so successful they outgrew the ground’s capacity, and moved to the 20,000-capacity Les Corts stadium in 1922. The Industria also gave Barca fans their ‘culers’ nickname. The word comes from ‘cul’, which means bottom in Catalan. A section of fans who went to the Industria stadium had to perch themselves on the rear edge of the stands, meaning any person walking by would see their backsides along that wall — hence culers. With 10 years and counting in charge of the club across two spells, Laporta is one of the most successful Barcelona presidents in history. Originally a lawyer, he rose to prominence as part of a socio-formed group known as Elefant Blau (Blue Elephant), created in 1997 to oppose Nunez’s presidency. Cruyff supported that platform, which partly helped Laporta win his first presidency in 2003. Laporta is remembered as the president who assembled the Ronaldinho generation in the 2000s and who oversaw Messi’s breakthrough from a La Masia academy (see below) talent to one of the greatest players in history (even if he was also president when the Argentinian left, on a free transfer, in summer 2021). He trusted figures such as Frank Rijkaard, Begiristain and Guardiola to build winning dynasties with Barca’s distinctive attacking football DNA and academy graduates. Advertisement Off the pitch, his dominant leadership has caused rifts with board members and created internal divisions — as inevitably tends to happen at this club. Arguably Barcelona’s most important player not named Lionel Messi. Kubala joined in 1950, a year after escaping his home country of Hungary following the Soviet Union’s invasion. He became the star of a team who won every trophy possible in 1951-52 and went on to spend 10 seasons with Barca, scoring 288 goals in 361 appearances. Kubala was an all-action midfielder known for his robust physique, after training as a boxer in Hungary, but also his technical ability. His impact caused the club to grow even more and even led to the construction of the Camp Nou — he started in the first game played at that stadium. Today, his legacy is honoured with a statue of him outside Barca’s iconic home ground, which is currently closed for extensive (expensive) refurbishments. Masia is a Catalan word that describes a countryside cottage or farmhouse. In FC Barcelona’s world, La Masia was an old cottage built in the year 1702, next to the area where the Camp Nou now stands. During the stadium’s construction in the 1950s, La Masia was used as a place for workers on the project to store their tools and organise themselves. Camp Nou was inaugurated in 1957 and the building next door started being used as Barca’s headquarters, but the club kept growing. In 1979, president Nunez found another use for it: as a dormitory for young players in Barcelona’s academy who would otherwise struggle to play for the club without having a place locally to live. La Masia became the site where multiple generations of Barca stars were developed and is now a brand, used to describe the club’s talent factory. In 2011, Barca moved accommodations for their youth players to bigger and modern facilities in their Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper training centre, but these newer buildings are still collectively called ‘La Masia’. The old farmhouse itself remains outside the Camp Nou, as a symbol of the club. GO DEEPER The power of Barcelona’s La Masia youth academy – and why for years it was ignored What more is there left to say about Lionel Andres Messi? The Argentinian is Barcelona’s record goalscorer with 672 in 778 appearances, and won 35 major titles and lifted six Ballons d’Or during his time at the club. Cruyff transformed Barca and Guardiola’s coaching might be unparalleled, but nobody has come close to matching Messi’s achievements for them on the pitch — and it is probable nobody ever will. Advertisement His tearful exit three years ago was a sour ending to his Barca career. But he has said he plans to return and live in Catalonia after he retires as a player, and it will surely not be long before his name is linked to Barca again. At least for a proper final tribute the fans still want to give him, seeing as he left the club while crowd restrictions related to the pandemic were still in place. Barcelona’s longest-serving president, with 22 years in charge from 1978 to 2000, and a figure who explains the club’s modern history. Born in the Basque Country of northern Spain, he moved to Barcelona with his family when he was seven, became a highly successful local businessman and founded and built up one of Catalonia’s biggest building companies during the 1970s. Nunez was a football outsider, but Barca gave him a way to the very top of Catalan society. He became one of the most influential figures across the city and country. His reign was controversial, bringing in big names such as Diego Maradona, Romario and Ronaldo by paying them generous sums but gaining a reputation for prioritising business over football success. He and Cruyff also had plenty of differences when the Dutchman was the manager, leading to ‘Nunism’ and ‘Cruyffism’ as two opposing parts of Barca’s ideology that remain today. In 2011, when he had left the club and following a long investigation, Nunez was sentenced to six years in prison for bribing tax inspectors in exchange for them favouring his building company. After a series of appeals and fines, he went to jail in 2014, with a reduced sentence of two years and two months. Two years after being released, he died in Barcelona at age 87. Barca is known for its ‘Mes que un club’ — more than a club — motto, and one thing that illustrates that is its multi-disciplinary approach. Local fans do not just support the football team but also the club’s professional basketball, handball, futsal and roller hockey sides. It also has an athletics division and has provided 230 athletes in Summer Olympics history. There were 23 athletes from Barca at the Games this year in Paris, only surpassed by the 34 they sent to the pandemic-delayed 2021 edition in Tokyo. Advertisement The manager and creator of Barcelona’s finest ever team, but above all a person who’s experienced all aspects of the club. Guardiola was a La Masia talent who caught the eye of Cruyff and won the 1992 European Cup (which became the Champions League) with the first team. He spent 11 seasons at Barcelona as a club player, but he had an even deeper impact as a manager, bringing Cruyff’s footballing idea to reality. His team won two Champions Leagues, three league titles, two Copas del Rey, three Spanish Super Cups, two European Super Cups and two Club World Cups in four years. One of the most prolific Spanish strikers in the 1970s and 1980s, his spell at the club will be remembered because he was… kidnapped. GO DEEPER Barcelona 125: When their star striker was kidnapped for 23 days It was only three years at his very best, but what a three years it was. Ronaldinho revitalised Barcelona after he joined the club in 2003, even though he was not supposed to be there! Laporta had just won his first Barcelona election and, in his mind, David Beckham was the signature signing he was planning. However, Real Madrid managed to lure the Englishman and Laporta had no other choice than switching to the next option: a promising 23-year-old Brazilian attacker from Paris Saint-Germain. Ronaldinho had an instant impact under Frank Rijkaard, turned Barcelona into a happy place and topped his spell at the club by winning the 2006 Champions League. The martyr president. Josep Sunol became president of Barcelona in 1935, but has been linked with the club’s board since 1928. Born and raised in Barcelona, Sunol came from a Catalan bourgeois background and worked throughout his life for the defence of Catalan culture. He was a lawyer, worked as a journalist and got involved in politics, opposing Francisco Franco’s insurrection. While Barca president, Sunol paid a visit to the Spanish Republican troops who were fighting in the Spanish Civil War in 1936. During that trip, their car entered an area that was controlled by Franco’s troops. Sunol was identified, detained and shot to death alongside his colleagues. On 6 August 1936, 88 years ago today, Josep Sunyol i Garriga, unanimously appointed president of FC Barcelona a year earlier, was shot by fascist troops in the Sierra de Guadarrama. His tragic death was the prelude to one of most troubled eras in club history… pic.twitter.com/d3ipaB8Cex — FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) August 6, 2024  Tenerife will always be a friendly club to Barcelona thanks to two of the most dramatic Spanish league finales. In 1992 and 1993, the fixture list meant that Real Madrid visited Tenerife for the last match of the season. In both campaigns, Cruyff’s Barcelona and their biggest rivals had a head-to-head fight for the title that lasted until the very last minute. The Catalans needed Madrid to lose in Tenerife and to win their game to get the silverware. And on both occasions, it happened. Advertisement In 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, Barcelona were offered $15,000 in cash by a Catalan businessman based in Mexico to take part in a tour to play some friendly games in America. Barca were going through a tough financial crisis, fuelled by the assassination of former president Sunol and a decrease in socios following the war. Club historians now admit there was a serious risk the club could have disappeared owing to their huge debts. A tour that was supposed to last a matter of days ended up with Barcelona extending their stay and travelling to the United States to play more games over a three-month period, effectively safeguarding the future of the club. GO DEEPER The U.S. tour that 'saved' Barcelona - and why only half their squad came back Francesc ‘Tito’ Vilanova succeeded Guardiola in taking charge of Barcelona and helped extend Barcelona’s glory while battling against Jose Mourinho’s Real Madrid. His team won the 100-points league ahead of Madrid — and he became the only Barca manager who’s ever done that. He was also in charge when Barca played the majority of a league game only with La Masia players in November 2012. A year later, he had to step down after being diagnosed with cancer. He passed away in 2014. Messi has said that, six days before Vilanova’s death, he paid him a visit in hospital and confessed he was having thoughts of leaving Barcelona to join Guardiola at Manchester City. Vilanova, it is said, told Messi he would find no place in the world like Barca. He decided to stay. The English stadium will always remain a sanctuary in Barcelona’s history. This is where the club won their first European Cup in 1992 after beating Sampdoria in extra time thanks to a free kick from Ronald Koeman. Nineteen years later, Guardiola’s Barca would return for another Champions League final to outclass Manchester United in a 3-1 win. Advertisement Xavi is the dream story for every local kid. Born and raised in Catalonia in a full Barca-supporting family, he joined the club’s youth ranks at a very young age and became the best in class at every single level. He made his debut in 1998 under Louis van Gaal and then transformed himself into one of the world’s best players in a style moulded by Barcelona’s DNA. His name is strongly linked with Andres Iniesta, his best friend and generational talent who probably deserved a better spot in this A-Z guide (I’m sorry!). To any La Masia youngster who aspires to be the perfect attacking midfielder, Xavi and Iniesta are without doubt the club’s two biggest role models. Xavi played 870 games for Barcelona — only Messi has played more — scored 97 goals and won 25 major titles. Xavi joined the club as a manager in 2021 and won another league title in 2022-23, his first full season in charge. In Yokohama in 2011, Guardiola’s Barca won their second Club World Cup, beating Neymar’s Santos 4-0 in the final. The performance is remembered as arguably the finest and most complex evolution of Guardiola’s system, and left Neymar so impressed that it convinced him to join the club a year and a half later. Guardiola played that game with a 3-7-0 formation. No striker, Cesc Fabregas as false nine, Thiago Alcantara as left winger, Dani Alves as attacking midfielder. A free-flowing system where positions didn’t matter because the players knew their game style too well. Barcelona were arguably the best team the world had ever seen at that time. Zamora is one of the most renowned goalkeepers in Spanish football history. Popularly known as El Divino, his name is on the award given to the goalkeeper who concedes the fewest goals each year in the Spanish league. He joined Barcelona from local rivals Espanyol, where he became a national legend. He spent three years at Barca, winning multiple trophies and becoming a face of the club’s golden generation in the 1920s.

The reigning Super Bowl champions entered the short week looking to tighten up after facing criticism for their offensive line play and string of one-score games. But against a fiery Raiders squad led by the returning Aidan O’Connell, Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs saw their issues continue in a matchup that came down to the last possession. Kansas City’s two-point lead appeared in jeopardy with O’Connell and company positioning kicker Daniel Carlson for a potential game-winning field goal with 15 seconds left to play. Advertisement Amazingly, a miscommunication between O’Connell and rookie center Jackson Powers-Johnson led to a botched snap that was recovered by Chiefs linebacker Nick Bolton. The Raiders were also whistled for an illegal shift on the play, which added to the drama. The play cost the Raiders a chance to play spoiler and also made the Chiefs the first team to clinch a spot in the postseason on a day when Mahomes unseated the legendary Len Dawson by completing a franchise-record 238th touchdown pass. The Raiders fumble it, the Chiefs recover it to seal the game ‼️#LVvsKC on Prime VideoAlso streaming on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/WvNvUONRM5 — NFL (@NFL) November 29, 2024  What a WILD ending on Black Friday 👀 pic.twitter.com/JtYRVva6Zy — NFL (@NFL) November 29, 2024  Early in the fourth quarter, Mahomes pounded the ball and screamed at the Chiefs sideline in the direction of coach Andy Reid and offensive coordinator Matt Nagy. Mahomes was sacked five times for the second time in five days. The Raiders, much like the Carolina Panthers this past Sunday, attacked the Chiefs’ biggest weakness: the left tackle position, the lineman responsible for protecting Mahomes’ blind side. Left tackle Wanya Morris, who has played the past month with a right knee injury, struggled mightily in pass protection. The Chiefs even replaced Morris midway through the fourth quarter, moving Joe Thuney from left guard to left tackle and inserting Mike Caliendo, a second-year player, at left guard. Although the Chiefs entered the red zone five times, they scored only one touchdown — and even that highlight included Mahomes getting hit by defensive end K’Lavon Chaisson, who beat Morris, just before releasing his pass that resulted in a 6-yard touchdown to receiver Justin Watson. Advertisement On Monday, the Chiefs signed D.J. Humphries, a move general manager Brett Veach made to ensure the team protected itself in case Morris misses time the rest of the season. It appears Humphries, an eight-year veteran, will need to be ready to start for the Chiefs next week against the Los Angeles Chargers. — Nate Taylor, Chiefs beat writer The Raiders had the ball at the Chiefs’ 32-yard line with just 14 seconds left in the game and seemed headed for a game-winning field goal attempt. While Carlson was just 1-for-4 on field goals at that point, all three of his misses were 55 yards or longer. This field goal try would be much shorter. Shockingly, Carlson would never get the chance to try it. On third-and-3, Powers-Johnson snapped the ball before O’Connell was prepared for it. O’Connell mishandled the snap, and it was recovered by Chiefs LB Nick Bolton. There was some drama in the moments that followed because a flag was thrown on the field, but the penalty was on the Raiders. It appeared that one of the officials had whistled the play dead, which could have overturned the fumble, but the play was allowed to continue. That was the correct call, Michael Signora, the NFL’s senior vice president of football and international communications, explained afterward. “Had the clock been running at the snap,” Signora said, “then by rule an illegal shift would convert to a false start. Since the clock was stopped (because of the spike on the second-down play), an illegal shift is a live ball foul.” The Chiefs were able to kneel it out from there to finish off a heartbreaking loss for the Raiders. In an instant, they went from having a chance to upset the back-to-back champions to losing their eighth straight game. — Tashan Reed, Raiders senior writer Advertisement It doesn’t matter who is wearing the jerseys, apparently, the Raiders defense just loves to show up against Mahomes and the Chiefs in Kansas City. Eleven months after beating the Chiefs 20-14 on Christmas, the Raiders defense had a season-high five sacks on a season-high 11 quarterback pressures on Friday to almost beat them again. The Raiders continually harassed Mahomes, as Chaisson had 1 1/2 of the team’s five sacks. The former first-round pick of the Jaguars was signed by the Raiders to the practice squad in September and promoted to the active roster a month later. Chaisson had 1 1/2 sacks going into Friday’s game. — Vic Tafur, Raiders senior writer (Photo: Jamie Squire / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Las Vegas had the ball at the Kansas City 32-yard line with 14 seconds left, well within field goal range, but a mistimed snap by rookie center Jackson Powers-Johnson was recovered by Chiefs linebacker Nick Bolton to secure the Kansas City win and break the Raiders' hearts.  Las Vegas actually outgained Kansas City by over 100 yards in this game, 434-329. Brock Bowers was the standout performer, reeling in 10 catches for 140 yards and a touchdown. Tre Tucker also caught a 58-yard TD pass from Aidan O'Connell.  Patrick Mahomes threw for 306 yards and a TD as the Chiefs improved to 11-1, keeping themselves in the driver's seat for the top seed in the AFC.

The Raiders signal caller finished the game 23-35 for 340 yards and two touchdowns. Mahomes finished 26-46 for 306 yards and a touchdown. Getty Images O'Connell takes full blame, said he clapped too early and that's a clear sign to hike the ball. Getty Images It's not the result he wanted, but star Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby continued putting himself in rarified air on Sunday, playing every Las Vegas defensive snap for a record sixth straight game, per NFL's Next Gen Stats. Getty Images Sure, the normally reliable Daniel Carlson had missed three field goals. But the Raiders were set up at the Chiefs' 32-yard line, putting Carlson in line for a 49-yard attempt — a shorter distance than any of his three misses — before rookie center Jackson Powers-Johnson's early snap caused a fumble that the Chiefs recovered.  It's a brutal way to end a game in which the Raiders more than held their own against the Chiefs all afternoon long. Las Vegas outgained Kansas City by more than 100 yards (434 to 329), had more first downs (20 to 18), recorded more sacks and did not commit a turnover until that final play.

Dart entered Saturday’s matchup against Mississippi State with 10,070 school career passing yards, 49 yards behind Manning’s record (10,119). After an 80-yard first half from Dart, the title was Manning’s no longer.

Earlier this season against Arkansas, Dart set the Ole Miss single-game record for total yards (562), breaking Archie Manning’s single-game record of 540, which stood since 1969. Dart’s 515 passing yards in that game also broke the Ole Miss single-game passing record. Archie, Eli’s father, had an All-American quarterback career at Ole Miss from 1968 to 1970 that saw him graduate with the SEC records for most pass completions in a game (33), most career total offense (5,576 yards), SEC Player of the Year honors as well as a plethora of Heisman votes in his final two seasons. Eli (No. 10) and Archie (No. 18) are two of four former Ole Miss football players to have their number retired by the school. Chucky Mullins (No. 38), who’s 1989 injury in a game against Vanderbilt ended his playing career and left him paralyzed, and Ben Williams (No. 74), the first Black athlete to play in a varsity football game for Ole Miss, round out the list.

Davies, 24, was stopped by police in Munich in the early hours of Thursday morning and registered a positive result when asked by officers to take a breathalyzer test. He was not arrested and a friend then drove the car home. Advertisement A source with understanding of the situation, who wasn’t authorised to speak publicly on the matter, told The Athletic Davies registered an output of 0.6 grams of alcohol per litre. The legal limit in Germany is 0.5 grams with 0.8 grams the bar for a criminal offence to have taken place. He has had his license to drive removed for a month and also been imposed with a fine and two demerit points. Bayern declined to comment when approached by The Athletic but are not expected to take any further action. He trained as normal on Thursday and should feature when Bayern travel to rivals Borussia Dortmund for Der Klassiker in the Bundesliga on Saturday. Davies has made 17 appearances in all competitions for the German club this season. He is yet to score but has added three assists. He has also played three times for the CANMNT but was withdrawn from the squad for the CONCACAF Nations League quarterfinals with Suriname in November as a “precautionary measure due to physical fatigue.” In his absence Canada advanced 4-0 on aggregate and will meet Mexico in the competition’s semifinals in March.

The Buffalo metro area is bracing for heavy lake-effect snowfall leading up to kickoff between the Bills (9-2) and 49ers (5-6) on “Sunday Night Football.” According to the National Weather Service, the greatest snow amounts in the Buffalo area are expected across the nearby Southern suburbs, where Buffalo’s Highmark Stadium is located. They could see as much as 1-to-2 feet of total snow accumulation by Sunday evening. Snow showers are expected to begin late Friday with a lake-effect snow warning in effect from 7 a.m. ET on Saturday until 7 p.m. ET on Sunday, about 90 minutes before kickoff at 8:20 p.m. ET. Advertisement The NWS warns, “Travel will be very difficult to impossible in areas of heavy lake effect snow with deep snow cover on roads and extremely poor visibility.” The Bills organization is also making preparations ahead of time, putting out a public call for show shovelers on Friday.

The people that have shown up for the years that I’ve been here at a minimum — and beyond my time here — of shoveling the stadium out. I think that’ll happen again if need be and we’ll get ready to play a football game.” Following San Francisco’s final practice of the week on Friday, 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan told reporters, “It’s part of the deal. We pay attention to it. Not necessarily how cold always, but mainly the wind, snow and stuff like that. … I know in Buffalo sometimes it can snow three feet in one spot and not snow 20 minutes away. So, you’ve really got to be ready for anything and deal with whatever it is at 8 (p.m.).” Temperatures at kickoff are expected to be in the mid-20s with winds between 5-10 mph.

Left tackle Trent Williams, who missed the recent game against the Green Bay Packers with what he’s described as a bone bruise on his heel, also will be out for the Buffalo Bills game. Meanwhile, the player who lines up next to him, left guard Aaron Banks, didn’t practice at all this week and remains in the concussion protocol. Advertisement Jaylon Moore, who got high marks against the Packers, will start at left tackle for the second straight week while Ben Bartch is the top candidate to start at left guard. If that’s the case on Sunday, it would be Bartch’s first-ever start for the 49ers. After a very light practice on Wednesday, Purdy threw more aggressively on Thursday and was full go in Friday’s practice. He’s officially listed as questionable for the game, though coach Kyle Shanahan said the plan is for Purdy to start on Sunday. “Lots of things can happen between now and then, but right now he’s playing,” Shanahan said. Unlike last Friday, Brock Purdy is throwing today. What’s more, Brandon Allen is in a scout-teamer-of-week jersey, suggesting he’s not the starter. pic.twitter.com/KQVwFjjIDA — Matt Barrows (@mattbarrows) November 29, 2024  Purdy said he hadn’t missed a start due to a medical issue since his junior year of high school when he sat out the first three games of the season with mononucleosis. He’s been injured before, but always found a way to rebound ahead of his next start. He thought that was going to be the case the Thursday before the Packers game. But when he went to throw that day, the shoulder didn’t feel right and he was shut down until the following Monday. This week went better, especially Thursday’s practice. “That’s when I practiced and felt good about it,” he said. “And (Friday) I felt really good at practice, too.” Purdy’s been sacked 20 times this season, which ranks in the middle of the league and roughly matches his sack rate from a year ago. However, he’s vacating the pocket and rushing the ball far more than he was a year ago. In 10 starts, he has 51 carries for 267 yards and four touchdowns vs. 39 carries, 144 yards and two touchdowns in 16 games last season. Purdy, for example, dove for a touchdown in his most recent game against the Seattle Seahawks. Does he need to re-think his aggressiveness given his recent injury? Advertisement “No,” said Purdy, who said he didn’t know which play against the Seahawks resulted in his shoulder injury. “That’s part of my game – being able to move around and do what it takes to get into the end zone,” he said. “And I’ve done that in high school, college and the NFL. So obviously I have to be smart and protect myself, that kind of thing. But my competitive nature — I want to make it happen if I can.” On defense, the team will be without defensive end Nick Bosa for the second straight week and also will be missing cornerback Deommodore Lenoir, who banged knees with a Packers player on Sunday and didn’t practice this week. Shanahan said Lenoir is dealing with a bruised knee but doesn’t have any ligament damage. The 49ers could see the return of cornerback Charvarius Ward, who hasn’t played since his daughter’s sudden passing last month but who practiced in full during the week. If Ward plays, he could start opposite rookie Renardo Green (neck, questionable) with Isaac Yiadom and Rock Ya-Sin serving as the third and fourth cornerbacks. Bosa (hip/oblique) said earlier in the week that he felt better than he did heading into the Packers game but that he needed to make more progress to be able to suit up in Buffalo. The 49ers also will be without one defensive tackle, Jordan Elliott (concussion), but likely will have another, Kevin Givens (groin), back for this game. Shanahan said the 49ers are not quite ready to activate Dre Greenlaw (Achilles) from injured reserve. Greenlaw has been a limited participant in practice this week. Asked when Greenlaw could return to the playing field, Shanahan noted that next week’s game against the Chicago Bears is followed by a Thursday game against the Los Angeles Rams and that the quick turnaround might be tough for a player who’s been out as long as Greenlaw. That is, the Rams game seems more realistic than the Bears game for Greenlaw’s return. (Photo: Lachlan Cunningham / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The utility man, in several ways, epitomized the kind of optionality the franchise has always coveted. Advertisement So they wasted little time ensuring the Edman would stick around. Edman and the Dodgers are in agreement on a five-year, $74 million contract extension, the club announced Friday. The deal starts next season (he was originally set to make $8.25 million) and includes a club option for 2030, with $25 million being deferred over 10 years, a league source confirmed. ESPN first reported the deal, which it said includes a $17 million signing bonus. That’s our World Series Champ and NLCSMVP! pic.twitter.com/LqEgRYhZXY — Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) November 29, 2024  Edman landing with the eventual World Series champions almost didn’t happen this summer — at least not like it did. Discussions this summer with the St. Louis Cardinals and interested clubs initially had Edman set to be dealt to the last-place Chicago White Sox and then be redirected to a contender. The Dodgers jumped into the talks themselves, sending infielder/outfielder Miguel Vargas to Chicago along with minor leaguers Alexander Albertus and Jeral Perez to acquire Edman and reliever Michael Kopech. Each emerged as critical postseason heroes for the eventual World Series champions, and remained under club control for 2025 as well. Now, the Dodgers are tacking on more time with the ultra-versatile Edman. Edman, 29, went 11-for-27 (.407) with one home run, three doubles and 11 RBI in the Dodgers’ NLCS win over the Mets and won NLCS MVP honors. And he proved to be a valuable contributor through the postseason, finishing with a .328 batting average, 20 hits, two home runs, 13 RBI and 12 runs scored in 16 games. Edman slashed .265/.319/.408 across 2,425 plate appearances in his five prior seasons as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals, for whom he debuted in 2019. He made 13 starts at shortstop and 22 starts in center field in his first season with the Dodgers. Where he plays in 2025 is not immediately clear, with the Dodgers expected to move Mookie Betts to the infield but still seeking to add a corner outfielder. Edman won the 2021 National League Gold Glove Award at second base, where he made 115 starts in addition to 35 in right field and three at shortstop. He tallied 12 Outs Above Average at second base that season. (Photo: Alex Slitz / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Cameron Archer thought he had given the visiting side to The Amex Stadium the lead when he fired home from Ryan Fraser’s cross after 68 minutes. Advertisement However, after a lengthy video assistant referee (VAR) review of more than four minutes the goal was chalked off with forward Adam Armstrong deemed to be in an offside position and interfering with play. The IFAB (The International Football Association Board) laws of the game state that a player in an offside position should be penalised for interfering if they are “preventing an opponent from playing or being able to play the ball by clearly obstructing the opponent’s line of vision; challenging an opponent for the ball; clearly attempting to play a ball which is close when this action impacts on an opponent or making an obvious action which clearly impacts on the ability of an opponent to play the ball.” The Premier League later confirmed that Armstrong was ruled to be impacting goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen’s ability to play the ball coming across the box. “The referee’s call of no goal was checked and confirmed by the VAR as Armstrong was in an offside position and deemed to be impacting Verbruggen’s ability to play the ball,” the Premier League Match Centre account posted on X. #BHASOU – 68’  The referee’s call of no goal was checked and confirmed by the VAR as Armstrong was in an offside position and deemed to be impacting Verbruggen’s ability to play the ball. pic.twitter.com/d7DXvQqTet — Premier League Match Centre (@PLMatchCentre) November 29, 2024  Martin, however, had a different view of the incident. “I’m fed up with talking about it. It’s a brilliant goal, a well-worked goal,” he told Sky Sports. “I respect how difficult the decision is for the referee and the assistant referee. It is really difficult, but I find it hard to accept. “We were told it affects Bart Verbruggen’s ability and if Adam’s run moved Verbruggen from his position then I would understand the decision, but he hasn’t moved. I cannot see how it has affected the goalkeeper. Advertisement “This is the point of VAR, I would rather the (referee) make a mistake on the pitch and we go, ‘No problem.’ “It is still human error in my opinion. The mistake is, it’s not clear and obvious enough to be corrected. The on-field decision carries weight. I am frustrated, but I am really proud of my players.” Southampton were forced to settle for a point with Flynn Downes’ first goal of the season cancelling out Kaoru Mitoma’s opener. The two managers appeared to clash at the final whistle with Brighton’s Fabian Hurzeler later accusing Martin of a lack of respect. “It’s so important to respect each other, how you talk to each other on the touchline. That’s how I got educated,” he said. Asked to expand on what Martin had said, Hurzeler replied: “You should ask him.” In response Martin said: “Respect is mutual. The amount of times in the opposition dugout they asked for a booking for one of our players, I have never known it to be to that level.” Southampton remain bottom of the Premier League table four points from safety while Brighton moved up to second above Manchester City.

After last week’s 37-21 loss at Kansas, the Buffaloes didn’t just respond Friday morning in Boulder, they obliterated the opposition. Colorado walloped Oklahoma State 52-0 inside Folsom Field to improve to 9-3 (7-2 in Big 12 play). It was Colorado’s largest margin of victory since beating Minnesota 58-0 in 1991. Advertisement More important than stampeding over the downtrodden Cowboys (3-9, 0-9), the Buffaloes kept their slim hopes for a Big 12 title game appearance alive. For the Buffaloes to earn a shot at playing for a conference crown, they need at least two of the other three teams sitting at 6-2 in the Big 12 — Arizona State, Iowa State and BYU — to lose on Saturday. Those three teams all have a leg up on Colorado. ASU faces rival Arizona on the road Saturday, while Iowa State hosts Kansas State. BYU hosts Houston on Saturday night. Of the litany of scenarios still in play for several programs to get to Arlington, Texas, for the title game, much of the potential chaos begins with a BYU loss at home.

Sanders said earlier this week that both Hunter and his son, Shedeur, will play in whatever bowl game Colorado is invited to next month. “Our kids are going to play in our bowl game,” Sanders said again Friday. “Because that’s what we signed up to do. We’re going to finish. We’re not going to tap out because that throws off the structure of next season.” GO DEEPER Travis Hunter tracker: Potential No. 1 NFL Draft pick closes regular season in style Just a few months ago, Oklahoma State was a trendy pick to not only win the Big 12 but potentially make the new 12-team College Football Playoff. Considering the way the Cowboys’ season just ended, it’s hard to fathom they were even in the conversation. The 52-0 loss at Colorado was the largest margin of defeat in the Mike Gundy era. Oklahoma State lost its last nine games of the year after starting 3-0 and was the only Big 12 team to lose every conference game in 2024. Prior to the last possession of the game, when both sides deployed the depths of their own depth chart, the Cowboys had just 61 yards of total offense. Advertisement Defensively, Oklahoma State was the worst power-conference team in the country entering Friday’s finale. The lopsided loss will only compound the many issues facing the Cowboys as they enter a crucial offseason. Before this disastrous campaign, Gundy, who is tied with Utah’s Kyle Whittingham for the second-longest-tenured head coach in college football, had just one losing season, his first back in 2005.

NYCFC, Atlanta United, Philadelphia Union and Vancouver Whitecaps are all also searching for new head coaches. Inter Miami this week named Javier Mascherano as Gerardo ‘Tata’ Martino’s successor following his own resignation earlier this month. Herdman was the head coach of the Canadian women’s team between 2011 and 2018, guiding the side to Olympic bronze medals in 2012 and 2016. The drone spying scandal uncovered at the 2024 Paris Games sparked questions over his role in creating what Canada Soccer CEO and general secretary Kevin Blue called a “deeply embedded systemic culture” while he was in charge. Herdman was not interviewed as part of a months-long investigation into the use of drones by both the women’s and men’s national teams owing to what Canada Soccer called “scheduling issues” but a “disciplinary process” is underway. Analysis from Joshua Kloke Even with the recent publication of an independent report that concluded some of the coaching staff of Canada’s women’s national soccer team spied on the New Zealand during the 2024 Paris Olympics, Herdman’s role within Canada Soccer’s spying scandal remained in question. The independent report stated a “disciplinary process” was underway to examine “potential violations of the Canada Soccer Code of Conduct and Ethics by the former head coach of the men’s national team”. Advertisement It’s believed Herdman could have been prevented from coaching in Canada Soccer-sanctioned competitions such as the Canadian Championship, which Toronto FC compete in. And so resigning from his position hardly absolves him of any guilt, but only suggests that Herdman and Toronto FC knew questions about his role in the scandal and possible repercussions would continue. The reality as well is that Herdman didn’t necessarily have the full backing from Toronto FC ownership as part of a full rebuild. Herdman inspired TFC to more energetic play early in the 2024 season but he looked unable to get the most out of the team’s stars as the season wore on. If you’re TFC and you’re looking to take this rebuild seriously, that includes taking a hard look at the coaching staff. The issue of the club’s poor culture was front and centre to end the season. If there were any questions from within TFC management and ownership about whether Herdman would have been able to inspire a healthier culture within the team, it’s possible he might have been dismissed before the season anyway.

Center Tanor Bortolini, right tackle Braden Smith and wide receiver Ashton Dulin were also ruled out. All four players did not practice this week. Steichen also said left tackle Bernhard Raimann will return after missing two games with a left knee injury.

Bortolini suffered a concussion in Indianapolis’ loss against Detroit last week, Dulin injured his left ankle and Downs sustained a right shoulder injury. Downs said Friday his shoulder is “fine,” and he’s considered week to week. “Just comes down to what the coaches and the trainers think (is) best,” Downs said of being ruled out. Sunday will mark Downs’ third missed game of the season. He sat the Colts’ first two games of the season due to a right high ankle sprain. His absence is a significant development for quarterback Anthony Richardson and the offense. Downs has emerged as Indianapolis’ top receiver this season, leading the team in targets (78), receptions (53), first-down catches (31) and receiving yards per game (59.4). He’s also tied with fellow wideout Alec Pierce with a team-high four receiving touchdowns. The Colts will likely lean more on Pierce, veteran Michael Pittman Jr. and rookie AD Mitchell since Downs and Dulin are sidelined. Mitchell, whom the Colts selected in the second round of the draft, has 20 catches for 254 yards in 12 games. Pittman has been the team’s top receiver in recent years. He’s had an up-and-down campaign due to a nagging back injury, but is coming off one of his best performances of the season with six catches for 96 yards against the Lions. Pierce returned to practice Friday, after missing a couple of days due to a foot injury, and is questionable to play Sunday. He leads the NFL with 23.3 yards per catch. “We’ve had different situations this year where different guys have been up or down, or maybe even just within the flow of a game, where a guy has been down for a drive or he’s back in the locker room for a little bit,” Colts offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter said Tuesday. “There’s no shortage of guys in that receiver room that are ready to answer the bell when their number is called.” Advertisement Despite Raimann’s return, Indianapolis’ offensive line is even more banged up than its wide receivers. The Colts will turn to their third different starting center this season as rookie fourth-round pick Bortolini remains in concussion protocol and veteran starter Ryan Kelly remains on injured reserve due to a knee injury. Bortolini had started the last three games in Kelly’s absence. Steichen said Monday that the team was “looking at Danny (Pinter)” to replace Bortolini if the rookie was unavailable against the Patriots. Pinter, a fifth-round pick by the Colts in 2020, has started just seven games in his career. Matt Goncalves appears to be the most likely replacement for Smith at right tackle. The rookie third-round pick started three games at left tackle earlier this season, but he started 13 games at right tackle during his collegiate career at Pittsburgh. The Colts’ offensive line changes may not stop there. Undrafted rookie Dalton Tucker has started seven straight games since replacing starter Will Fries, who broke his right tibia in Week 5. However, Tucker has allowed the third-most pressures (23) of any offensive lineman in the NFL during that span, per TruMedia. Asked Friday if he’ll make a move at right guard, Steichen simply said, “we’ll see.” If the Colts do make a change, veteran guard Mark Glowinski would probably be next in line. Glowinski signed with Indianapolis’ practice squad last week, and he started 55 games for the franchise from 2018 to 2021. He last played in an NFL game when he started for the Giants in their regular-season finale last year. “In this league, obviously, it’s next man up,” Steichen said of his depleted offensive line. “We got a lot of confidence in whoever’s out there that we can go out and perform at a high level.” (Photo: Andy Lyons / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

He didn't disappoint.,"NFL With Colorado’s College Football Playoff hopes hanging by a thread, Friday afternoon may have been Travis Hunter’s last opportunity to impress Heisman voters and NFL scouts. Needless to say, he didn’t disappoint. Playing in his final regular-season game, Hunter — who’s already confirmed, to no one’s surprise, that he’ll enter the 2025 NFL Draft — delivered his fourth interception and fourth multi-touchdown performance of the season in a 52-0 blowout win over Oklahoma State. Hunter has scored in every game in which he’s picked off a pass this season, which is mind-blowing and rather unprecedented production. Advertisement Colorado will need help from Arizona, Houston, Kansas State and possibly even West Virginia this weekend to play in the conference title game. But Deion Sanders insisted this week that both Hunter and QB Shedeur Sanders will play in a bowl game, whether it’s part of the College Football Playoff or not. More on Hunter’s latest performance … GO DEEPER College Football Playoff 2024 projections: Indiana hangs on as Alabama, Ole Miss fall out Ten receptions for 116 yards and three TDs; one tackle, one INT, two pass breakups While once again playing more than 100 snaps, Hunter delivered an epic performance.

But check out the dance — a nod to Deion Sanders’ “Prime Time” celebration from his playing days. TRAVIS HUNTER DOING TRAVIS HUNTER THINGS 🔥 Colorado up 21-0 in the first quarter 😳 pic.twitter.com/wpEZUnbLYb — ESPN (@espn) November 29, 2024  They say that if you had to explain college football to an extra terrestrial, you might need a decade. There’s a lot that doesn’t make sense. Take Jim Thorpe. The legendary multi-sport icon truly made a name for himself on the gridiron as a running back — but has his name attached to a trophy (the Thorpe Award) given annually to college football’s best defensive back. Thorpe also played in the secondary, of course, and was outstanding. His true legacy, though, is that he was able to wear (and master) many hats. Advertisement Consider Hunter, too. He’s perhaps the closest thing the sport has seen to Thorpe’s skill set in decades, but apparently that wasn’t good enough to make the final cut for this year’s Thorpe Award — Georgia’s Malaki Starks, Texas’ Jahdae Barron and Ohio State’s Caleb Downs were named as finalists. An absurdly college football premise. Despite the Thorpe snub, Hunter’s sensational Heisman campaign rolled on in full force during Colorado’s thrashing of Oklahoma State. The 52-point blowout also marked Hunter’s final home game in Boulder, Colo., and it’s fair to wonder if it was Hunter’s final college football game period. The answer may depend on how things shake out for the Buffaloes in the Big 12 title race. On Colorado’s Senior Day, Hunter got his own party started in the first half with his fourth interception of the season — and the ninth of his career, putting him in rare air again. ESPN flashed a graphic during the game that Hunter is now the first college football player in “30-plus years” to record at least nine interceptions and 20 touchdown catches in a career. Not even legendary Holy Cross running back/defensive back Gordie Lockbaum — a College Football Hall of Fame inductee and one of the sport’s last true two-way ironmen — pulled that off. If Colorado doesn’t make the Big 12 title game (thus, also effectively ending any type of Playoff bid), the Buffaloes could be headed for a second-tier bowl game. Beyond the question of whether or not Hunter will play for Colorado in a non-championship game, though, it’s also fair to wonder how much he’ll show NFL teams during the upcoming pre-draft process. As of today, six Colorado players have accepted invitations to the 2025 Shrine Bowl, including Shedeur Sanders, WR Will Sheppard and WR LaJohntay Wester. A recent NFL rule change now allows non-seniors to participate in postseason all-star games, which means Hunter could join his teammates at the Shrine Bowl or head to the Senior Bowl. Advertisement More likely? He’ll not only skip both, but teams will count themselves fortunate if Hunter does anything at the NFL combine — including medical evaluations. Not unlike Caleb Williams a year ago, Hunter is pretty clearly the best college player in America, and his value for NFL teams has been obvious for some time. Williams elected to skip medical evaluations in Indianapolis, instead holding them separately for interested teams only. Hunter should have that type of clout, if he wants to utilize it. Either way, Friday afternoon may well have been the last time we get to see Hunter play football for a while. Hope you didn’t blink. — Nick Baumgardner (Top photo: Dustin Bradford / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Daniel Moskos left to be the lead pitching coach for the Miami Marlins under new manager Clayton McCullough, team sources confirmed. But Counsell moved quickly to replace Moskos, promoting from within and adding Casey Jacobson to his staff. Jacobson just wrapped up his fifth season with the organization and his second as minor-league senior coordinator of pitching development. Advertisement Jacobson is a former instructor at Driveline Baseball, a well-known player development academy in Washington, and spent six years coaching in the college ranks. Those within the organization laud Jacobson for his interpersonal skills and ability to connect with young pitchers by earning their trust by clearly delivering messages and tying it into what the player actually values. Multiple people in the organization noted his empathy with players and staff as he works to know who the human is in order to ensure that it’s clear he cares about a player’s development over his own self interests, which has helped with buy-in. From a technical aspect, Jacobson is strong with pitch design and has a keen understanding of what delivery traits lead to release characteristics, an essential part of figuring out avenues for improvement. Jacobson impacted the development of several young pitchers in the Cubs organization, including Porter Hodge (emphasized the elite characteristics of his four-seamer early in his professional career leading to an uptick in usage), Daniel Palencia (helped with pitch design of his breaking ball and overall development) and Jordan Wicks (breaking ball design and velocity training). Young pitching will be a big part of the Cubs’ future as the trio above, along with pitchers like Cade Horton, Ben Brown and Hayden Wesneski, are all going to be needed for the team to win more games in 2025 and beyond. Former manager David Ross added Moskos to his staff prior to the 2021 season as pitching coach Tommy Hottovy’s assistant. Moskos, a left-handed pitcher who was a high draft pick by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2007, spent the previous two seasons as a minor-league pitching coach with the New York Yankees. Moskos departs with high praise for his intelligence and acumen on biomechanics along with insight on pitch grip and pitch usage. Advertisement Soon after the final game of the season, Counsell let go of first-base coach Mike Napoli, bullpen coach Darren Holmes and assistant hitting coach Jim Adduci along with the entire MLB strength and conditioning staff. Third-base coach Willie Harris eventually departed as well and was replaced by former Milwaukee Brewers baserunning guru Quentin Berry. Holmes’ position was filled by Mark Strittmatter, who spent last season as Counsell’s major-league field coordinator, and the Cubs promoted Mark Weisman and Kevin Poppe from the minor-league staff to lead strength and conditioning at the MLB level. The expectation is that an announcement for Counsell’s entire staff, including a first-base coach, will be coming shortly. (Photo: Nuccio DiNuzzo / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is seeking a “period of ineligibility of one or two years” after an independent tribunal convened by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) found the Italian bore “no fault or negligence” for two separate adverse analytical findings. Advertisement Sinner tested positive for the banned anabolic steroid clostebol on two occasions in March of this year, in-competition at the BNP Paribas Open held in Indian Wells and out of competition eight days later. Sinner was stripped of the ranking points and prize money he won for taking victory in Indian Wells but was allowed to continue competing. Any overturning of the initial verdict could see the 23-year-old barred from competing in the sport at all levels. The world No. 1, who said he was “surprised” by WADA’s decision to appeal, has continued playing with the doping allegations hanging over him since and is set to do so again in Melbourne. CAS published its latest list of hearings on Thursday with Sinner’s not listed to be heard between now and February 11. The Australian Open is scheduled to take place between January 12 and 26. “Obviously I’m very disappointed and also surprised of this appeal, to be honest, because we had three hearings. All three hearings came out very positively for me,” Sinner said in September following confirmation of WADA’s decision. “We always talk about the same thing. Maybe they just want to make sure that everything is in the right position.” An independent tribunal convened by the ITIA and conducted by Sports Resolutions ruled that Sinner bore “no fault or negligence” for the positive tests in a hearing on August 15, but still found Sinner committed two anti-doping violations. It accepted Sinner’s explanation that his physiotherapist, Umberto Ferrara, had brought an over-the-counter healing spray containing clostebol to Indian Wells. His trainer, physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi, cut his hand, and then used the spray on that cut. Naldi then conducted massages on Sinner, which led to transdermal contamination with the clostebol from the healing spray. WADA is challenging the decision that Sinner was not at fault for his violation. Sinner parted company with both Naldi and Ferrara on the eve of the U.S. Open, which he went on to win by beating Taylor Fritz in the final.

On Thursday, third-year linebacker Malcolm Rodriguez tore his ACL during the fourth quarter of Detroit’s 23-20 win over the Chicago Bears, a league source said. He will miss the remainder of the 2024 season. Advertisement The Lions entered Week 1 with seven linebackers on the roster, which felt high at the time. The room was praised for its depth and versatility. It was viewed as one of the strongest positions on the team. That’s not the case anymore. Rodriguez will be the fourth of those linebackers to be placed on injured reserve — once he officially lands there. He’ll join Derrick Barnes (knee), Jalen Reeves-Maybin (neck) and Alex Anzalone (forearm), all of whom have or will miss significant time with injuries. Rodriguez was filling in for the injured Anzalone, placed on injured reserve after the Jaguars game, and was a trusted, dependable player for this defense. Anzalone is expected back in late December or early January, but the Lions will be thin until then. Jack Campbell is the only linebacker left standing among Detroit’s top five at the position. Expect the Lions to lean on Ben Niemann, David Long Jr., Ezekiel Turner and now, Alexander. The Lions moved quickly to add Alexander to the mix, with Campbell hinting that Rodriguez’s injury was serious after Thursday’s win over the Bears. Alexander, 30, played in three games for Denver this season, including two starts in Weeks 7 and 9. A former Pro Bowler in 2017, the 10th-year veteran has racked up 639 tackles, 13.5 sacks, 13 forced fumbles and nine interceptions across 107 career games (90 starts). Alexander now joins his seventh NFL team, one that is trying to pick up the pieces after its defense was shattered by injuries. More than just the linebacker room, the entire Lions defense has been hit hard. Marcus Davenport and Aidan Hutchinson are done for the regular season. Starting corners Terrion Arnold and Carlton Davis have each sat out with injuries. Reserve corners Ennis Rakestraw Jr. and Emmanuel Moseley have spent time on IR. Reserve defensive linemen like John Cominsky and Kyle Peko are currently shelved. Josh Paschal (knee) and Levi Onwuzurike (hamstring) left Thursday’s game and did not return. It’s been one thing after another. The Lions won 10 games in a row and are 11-1 for the first time in franchise history, but this isn’t the same team it was even a month ago. They might need to grind out victories, like the one on Thanksgiving. (Photo: Cooper Neill / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

He won three of those four matches — two of those against Cooper’s Leicester — and drew the other 1-1 at home against Chelsea. It is his first permanent managerial job since leaving PSV Eindhoven at the end of the 2022-23 season, when he cited a lack of support from the Dutch club’s hierarchy. Van Nistelrooy joined Ten Hag’s coaching staff at Old Trafford at the beginning of this season but was not kept on by new head coach Ruben Amorim. Former Brighton & Hove Albion head coach Graham Potter and David Moyes, most recently of West Ham United, were ruled out before the club moved for Van Nistelrooy, who did not cost any compensation, a key factor for the club given ongoing PSR concerns. Van Nistelrooy previously held talks with Burnley over replacing Vincent Kompany before he joined Ten Hag’s coaching staff. His only managerial job to date was at PSV, where he won the Dutch Cup in his sole season at the helm. Before that, he had two separate stints as assistant coach of the Netherlands national team under Guus Hiddink and later Frank de Boer. GO DEEPER Van Nistelrooy's attacking approach might be just what this Leicester team needs The news of Van Nistelrooy’s appointment brings a much-needed morale boost to the Leicester fanbase at a time when they are 16th in the Premier League and just a point above the relegation zone. While their knowledge of the former United striker’s coaching prowess is limited, this appointment provides significantly more optimism to those supporters than the one that brought Cooper to the club in the summer. Advertisement Despite lasting a little over a year as PSV manager, Van Nistelrooy did enjoy some success with the Dutch side. He led them to a second-place finish in the Eredivisie and got his hands on two trophies. The first was the Johan Cruyff Shield, the equivalent of the Community Shield, in which PSV beat Ajax 5-3 and the other was the KNVB Cup, Dutch football’s only cup competition. Despite PSV’s position in the Eredivisie being very different to Leicester’s in the Premier League, fans will be glad to hear Van Nistelrooy favoured a direct, attacking style during his time in the Netherlands that focused on building from the back and utilising the club’s threats in the wide areas. PSV were among the best sides in Europe at creating chances during his tenure. The appointment of Van Nistelrooy is far from a guarantee of Premier League survival, but the main thing that the supporters will want to see in the short term is a clear identity, something that Cooper failed to establish across 12 league games. Van Nistelrooy inherits one of the more limited squads in the division — further weakened by long-term injuries to Ricardo Pereira and Abdul Fatawu — but one with enough quality to stave off the threat of relegation.

Hronek appeared to get hurt at the end of Wednesday night’s game against the Pittsburgh Penguins when he was hit awkwardly into the boards. Looks like Hronek got injured on this play late in the third period last night. 🎥: Sportsnet | NHL https://t.co/Nlc7dtFIiO pic.twitter.com/xSTqOxupIN — CanucksArmy (@CanucksArmy) November 28, 2024  Canucks coach Rick Tocchet said before Friday’s game that Hronek was still being evaluated and he couldn’t declare how long the 26-year-old would be sidelined. The Athletic contributor Rick Dhaliwal reported the possibility of a separated shoulder. The Canucks were remarkably fortunate with injuries last season. All seven of their top point producers suited up for at least 80 games. Carson Soucy was the only notable defender who missed an extended run of games on the blue line. Advertisement That luck has turned against them in a hurry as the Canucks have been challenged with several key absences in 2024-25. Thatcher Demko has yet to make his season debut. Dakota Joshua missed the team’s first 14 games following an offseason testicular cancer diagnosis. Brock Boeser was recently out for seven games because of a concussion. J.T. Miller was banged up through training camp and preseason and didn’t appear to be at 100 percent health when he was in the lineup. He’s missed the last four games while on leave from the club for personal reasons and there’s no timeline for his return. Hronek’s loss is a massive blow for a Canucks blue line that was already struggling beyond the top pair. He has racked up 57 points in 102 games for Vancouver and most importantly, he’s been the perfect stylistic fit for Quinn Hughes, who has reached a new superstar, Norris Trophy-winning level since Hronek’s arrival. Logging nearly 24 minutes per game, Hronek’s offensive IQ, puck skills and passing add nitrous to Hughes’ ability to dominate possession and drive offense. Hughes and Hronek are one of only four defense pairs in the NHL this season that are controlling more than 60 percent of the expected and actual goal share at five-on-five. With Hronek out of the lineup, the Canuck have Hughes and five blueliners performing at a bottom-pair level. Erik Brännström can play the right side and would be the closest stylistic match to replacing Hronek’s mobility and offensive upside. But would Tocchet feel comfortable stacking two 5-foot-10 defenders on the same pair considering the monstrous workload Hughes will be taking on? Hughes defends at a high level despite his undersized frame, but Brännström’s own zone play is still a major question mark despite the promising start to his Canucks tenure. The bigger concern, however, might be whether the Canucks’ bottom four can afford to lose Brännström’s speed and puck-moving. Is it wise for the club to stack its only two capable puck movers together or does Vancouver need those two to drive their own pairs? Advertisement Tyler Myers could also be elevated to that top pair role. He’s mistake-prone and has struggled this year, but he unquestionably has the most experience eating big minutes. Vincent Desharnais and Noah Juulsen are candidates to get spot duty next to Hughes as well. Frankly, none of these options are particularly appealing. The Canucks are either going to need to make an early trade like they did last season for Nikita Zadorov, or they’ll need Myers and Soucy to bounce back to last year’s level to stabilize the blue line. • Did Arturs Šilovs’ brutal performance cost the Canucks?

Offensive coordinator Thomas Brown will serve as the interim head coach. “We understand how imperative the head coaching role is for building and maintaining a championship-caliber team, leading our players and our organization,” Bears president and CEO Kevin Warren said in a statement. “Our fans have stood by us and persevered through every challenge, and they deserve better results. Our organizational and operational structure is strong, focused, aligned and energized for the future.” News of the firing broke less than three hours after Eberflus held his day-after-game news conference Friday. At that time, Eberflus said he was “confident” he would be leading the Bears into next week’s game against the San Francisco 49ers. He added he had a typical postgame meeting with Warren and general manager Ryan Poles, and was going to meet with them again Friday.  He also addressed Chicago’s end-of-game clock management Thursday, when the Bears ran just one play in the final 32 seconds despite having a timeout remaining as they attempted to tie or win the game, saying “the operation wasn’t fast enough” on the final play. Eberflus is the fourth head coach to be let go by the Bears in the past 11 seasons.  A defensive coordinator for the Indianapolis Colts and former linebackers coach for the Dallas Cowboys, Eberflus took the Bears’ job in 2022 after Matt Nagy was fired. He brought his “HITS” philosophy to Halas Hall — hustle, intensity, take the ball away and play smart. In his final season as head coach, his basic tenets weren’t reflected on the field, especially during a six-game losing streak that began when the Bears lost on a Hail Mary against the Washington Commanders in Week 8. GO DEEPER Matt Eberflus explains why Bears didn't use TO at end of game vs. Lions That moment — when cornerback Tyrique Stevenson was talking and gesturing toward fans while the play began and then tipped the ball into Commanders receiver Noah Brown’s hands — seemed to break the team. Stevenson’s job was to cover Brown. After the game, Eberflus received criticism inside and outside the building for allowing a 12-yard pass before the Hail Mary, not calling a timeout before the game-winning play and not taking accountability for those errors. He defended offensive coordinator Shane Waldron’s decision earlier in the game to hand the ball off to backup center Doug Kramer at the goal line. Kramer fumbled. Advertisement That night against the Commanders was the beginning of the end for Eberflus. He fired Waldron 16 days later and after two more frustrating losses. Waldron’s offense floundered against the New England Patriots, who had one of the worst defenses in the league, in a 19-3 loss. During his Bears tenure, Eberflus went through three play callers, firing Luke Getsy after the 2023 season and then letting Waldron go after only nine games this season. The red flags that showed up earlier in the season on offense with Waldron transformed into real concerns that needed to be addressed internally and beyond meetings with the team’s leadership. Rookie quarterback Caleb Williams’ development looked in trouble — and nothing mattered more this season. The Bears promoted Brown to offensive coordinator. An instant spark followed. Williams and other offensive players, especially the veterans, bought into Brown. But while the offense improved with Brown’s play calling, the Bears’ once-proud defense regressed under Eberflus this season. He was an offshoot of the Lovie Smith/Rod Marinelli tree of defensive coaching. But his HITS philosophy failed to produce a winning record. GO DEEPER Very different stories are unfolding for the Bears on defense and offense Chairman George McCaskey, Warren and Poles had an opportunity to line up the selection of Williams with a new coach but chose to stick with Eberflus. He had impressed them with how he “steadied the ship,” per Poles, during a losing streak and multiple coach removals in 2023. Eberflus’ defensive coordinator Alan Williams resigned and the team fired running backs coach David Walker. Both decisions involved the human resources department. This season began with higher expectations than the Bears had seen since 2019. With No. 1 pick Williams in the fold, along with the team’s best trio of receivers in more than a decade and a talented defense, there was more attention on Chicago. That increased with HBO’s “Hard Knocks,” which put Eberflus in the national spotlight. Advertisement A dominant victory in London over the Jacksonville Jaguars, the team’s third win in a row, seemed to set the Bears on the right path. They were 4-2, and a fourth-quarter comeback in Washington in Week 8 put them in position to go 5-2. Then the Hail Mary happened. McCaskey took over as team chairman in 2011. The team has fired Smith, Marc Trestman, John Fox, Nagy and now Eberflus during that time. They have not won a playoff game and have had at least a five-game losing streak in four of the past five seasons. (Photo: Quinn Harris / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The France international appeared to hurt his knee in the closing stages of the 2-0 victory over Real Madrid in the Champions League. The 25-year-old limped off the pitch after full time following a coming together involving team-mate Virgil van Dijk and Madrid striker Endrick. Advertisement Head coach Arne Slot told reporters at his pre-Manchester City press conference on Thursday that Konate was still being assessed, but the player took to Instagram a day later to address his situation. “So frustrating to pick up this injury right at the end of a great game on Wednesday,” he wrote. “Now we start the recovery process but one thing I promise is I will come back and be the best I can be once again.”     A post shared by @ibrahimakonate  Konate had been in impressive form as part of a Liverpool backline which boasts the best defensive record in the Premier League, conceding only eight goals in 12 matches. It is a significant blow for Slot who will now decide whether Joe Gomez or Jarell Quansah lines up alongside Van Dijk for the visit of City on Sunday. That game kicks off a run of seven Premier League matches before the new year. They also face Girona in the Champions League and have an EFL Cup quarter-final with Southampton in December. Konate’s absence is a significant blow. He has been in the form of his Liverpool career and his partnership with Van Dijk has been so important to Liverpool winning 16 of their opening 18 matches in all competitions, and topping both the Premier League and Champions League tables. It is likely Slot will select Gomez to partner Van Dijk against Manchester City. The 27-year-old has only started at centre-back in Liverpool’s two Carabao Cup matches but has performed well and barely put a foot wrong. His display when called upon at half time against Brighton & Hove Albion after Konate was taken off at half time due to injury was also excellent. In 2022-23, Gomez was excellent up against Erling Haaland in Liverpool’s 1-0 victory over Manchester City, which may also play into Slot’s thinking. Quansah has had a tougher start to the season. After a strong pre-season he began the campaign as Van Dijk’s first choice partner, but he was substituted at half time against Ipswich Town on the opening day of the season and since lost his place. He has also started both Carabao Cup matches against West Ham and Brighton. While his general performance was positive, he scored an unfortunate own goal against the former. Against Brighton he lost possession for their first and their second deflected in off him.

Hayes’ team will face England at Wembley on Saturday, November 30 and then will travel to face the Netherlands on Tuesday, December 3. Advertisement When asked whether there had been time in camp to discuss the election since the players gathered, Hayes said: “No, we don’t. We definitely do not have time for conversations like elections. “I’m sat next to one of the most competitive people I’ve ever met (Lindsey Horan).

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Bears coach Matt Eberflus explains why Chicago didn't use timeout at end of game vs. Lions,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5955902/2024/11/29/bears-lions-timeout-matt-eberflus/,"Fri, 29 Nov 2024 15:48:28 GMT",Chicago ran one play in the final 32 seconds — despite having one timeout left to use.,"NFL The Chicago Bears fired head coach Matt Eberflus on Nov. 29. Chicago Bears coach Matt Eberflus addressed the clock management that saw his team run one play — despite having a timeout in hand — in the final 32 seconds of a Thanksgiving 23-20 loss to the Detroit Lions. “Our hope was that we’d re-rack that play at 18 seconds, throw it inbounds, get it into field goal range and then call the timeout,” Eberflus told reporters after the game. “That’s where it was and that was our decision-making process on that. Advertisement “We were outside of field goal range and needed to get a few more yards in there as close as we can get and then we were going to call timeout and that’s why we held that last timeout at the end of the game. Disappointed for the players. They put a lot of work in on a short week and put themselves in position to win that game.” On Friday, as speculation grew that Eberflus would be fired, the coach appeared as scheduled for a video news conference. “It’s been normal operation” at Halas Hall, he said, as coaches watched film and began preparations for the 49ers in Week 14. Eberflus said he had several conversations with general manager Ryan Poles and team president/CEO Kevin Warren as part of his typical “debrief” after the game. But he said he would also be talking to them again later in the day. GO DEEPER Greenberg: Bears GM Ryan Poles should fire Matt Eberflus for his own sake after latest debacle With 3:31 left in the fourth quarter and trailing by a field goal on Thursday, Chicago got the ball back at its own 1-yard line and Caleb Williams drove the team to the Lions’ 25 before the drive stalled. Williams was sacked at the Lions’ 41-yard line with 32 seconds left. The Bears elected not to use their final timeout as time ticked off and Williams got the final play off with six seconds left — an incomplete pass down the field to Rome Odunze. A wild end to this one. #CHIvsDET pic.twitter.com/zwR7g1Efv9 — NFL (@NFL) November 28, 2024  Eberflus noted that with the team facing third down, he wanted to have the timeout to use for the kick on fourth down. “It’s a situation where you get the play in, snap the ball, get it off and call timeout,” Eberflus said. “We were all on the same page there. We just got to do it a little bit better.” Williams offered his perspective and explained why he made an adjustment at the line as time was ticking down. “I don’t have a microphone to speak to coach or anything like that,” Williams said. “There wasn’t any huge communication. In that situation you get a call at that time, you got to try and get the guys back, get everyone lined up so you can go run a play. Advertisement “We got lined up, got the play and I made an adjustment because I saw the clock running down knowing that if we complete a ball inbounds or anything like that, we won’t have time to kick a field goal. I made an adjustment and knew Rome (Odunze) was either going to be one-on-one or he was going to beat the safety and be one-on-one there and try to give him a shot. We got the shot and missed.” GO DEEPER Fire Matt Eberflus right now? Why it's time for Bears brass to have that tough conversation Tight end Cole Kmet added, “All of a sudden, I see everybody come on the field and the game’s over. So I was kind of like, ‘What the (expletive) had just happened?’ … I’m sure the thought process was then to be able to get some yardage and then take the timeout and then kick the field goal. But we were just a little too late on that. And then that ended up being the final play.”   Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.

The loss was also the third in a row in the NFC North — with the three divisional losses happening by a total of seven points. “We got to find a way to win,” wide receiver DJ Moore said, who added he was not sure why a timeout wasn’t called. “We keep coming back in these games and we have time to actually win the game and we just s–t the bed.” GO DEEPER How the Bears wasted the final 32 seconds in their sixth consecutive loss Eberflus, who is in his third season as the head coach, has a 14-32 record leading the team. Earlier this month, the team changed offensive coordinators to help spark a unit that had struggled for much of the season. That said, he knows the buck stops with him.
 “I’m the head football coach, so I’m taking the blame of course,” Eberflus said of the defeat. “That’s what you do. We didn’t get it done. That starts at the top and it starts right here. Accountability is right here with me. We got to do it better. I got to do it better. I was proud of the guys and the way they fought. They did a good job putting themselves in position.” When asked if he was worried that he might be let go following this loss, Eberflus said, “I’m just going to keep grinding and working.

Miami once trailed 27-3 but was marching with ease down 27-11, threatening to cut its deficit to one score with plenty of time remaining.  Tagovailoa’s completions weren’t difficult, either. Guys were running wide open. Tagovailoa wasn’t taking deep shots, but rather finding intermediate completions to consistently move the chains. Miami faced a second-and-goal from the 1 with about 11 minutes left in the game, but Green Bay’s goal-line defense stood firm. Defensive end Rashan Gary ripped down running back De’Von Achane on second down. Cornerback Keisean Nixon broke up a pass for tight end Jonnu Smith in the flat on third down. Linebacker Quay Walker sacked Tagovailoa on a delayed blitz on fourth down. Green Bay’s offense followed that sequence up with a nine-play, 78-yard drive for a field goal that consumed four minutes and 31 seconds to take a 30-11 lead and all but seal the game.

Tyreek Hill’s touchdown catch gives the Dolphins three players with 20+ PPR points. The list includes Tua Tagovailoa (23.8), De’Von Achane (21.0) and Hill (20.3). Jonnu Smith has also added 15.7 PPR points and Jaylen Waddle 11.3 Advertisement The 49-yard reception by Josh Jacobs has vaulted him to 21.3 PPR points tonight. That’s the third straight game Jacobs has scored 20 or more fantasy points. That streak is tied with Joe Burrow for the longest current fantasy scoring streak of that caliber. Elgton Jenkins' unnecessary roughness penalty means the Packers don't go for it on fourth and goal from the half-yard line. McManus hits the 33-yarder instead. Packers 30, Dolphins 11 Josh Jacobs owes Jordyn Brooks a new pair of ankles.  Quay Walker sacks Tua on fourth and goal. Second and goal from the 1 and Miami comes away with no points. A long drive here should do the trick. Packers still lead 27-11.  The Dolphins had a terrible first half in fantasy scoring. That last drive has helped turned things around for Miami. De’Von Achane (15.7 PPR points), Tua Tagovailoa (14.28) and Jonnu Smith (13.2) all have notched much better point totals and are now in range to have true fantasy scoring impacts with a strong fourth quarter. Advertisement That was a strong drive from the Dolphins and they'll need much more of it to get back into this game. That one went for eight plays and 70 yards and included a fourth-down conversion and two-point conversion.     Christian Watson atoned for his dropped 49-yard TD last Sunday with a diving grab for 46 down the right sideline. That was a nice drive for the Packers but it stops short of the end zone. Brandon McManus' 24-yard field goal extends the Packers lead to 27-3.   Corey Ballentine (knee) ruled out.  Many fantasy managers who started Green Bay players in their lineups have been rewarded with strong performances. Topping this list is Jayden Reed. His 17.8 PPR points mark the fourth time this year that he has scored 16+ PPR points in a game. Josh Jacobs also had a strong first half with 12.3 PPR points. Jordan Love wasn’t far behind that pace with 12.08 points. Tucker Kraft also weighed in with 7.3 PPR points. It wasn’t anywhere near as good on the Miami side of this ledger. Jonnu Smith tallied 8.3 PPR points and thus should be able to rack up his third straight game with 10+ PPR points. De’Von Achane has a solid first half with 7.3 PPR points. Tua Tagovailoa had a meager 5.32 points. The biggest disappointments so far have to Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle. Hill tallied only 1.2 PPR points in the first half and Waddle generated 2.6 points. Advertisement Green Bay is up 24-3 on the scoreboard and that has carried over to the point spread. BetMGM has the Packers listed at -18.5 points. Green Bay also has -10000 odds on the moneyline. The over/under is pushing towards 50 points, as it currently stands at 48.5 points.  The Packers are trouncing the Dolphins through 30 minutes here at Lambeau Field, breezing to a 24-3 halftime lead. Head coach Matt LaFleur moved on from former defensive coordinator Joe Barry after last season and Barry is now the Dolphins' defensive run game coordinator. In the first half, the Packers ran 16 times for 102 yards on Miami (6.4 yards per carry), which ranked No. 8 in the NFL in rushing yards allowed per game entering Week 13.  Quarterback Jordan Love is 11-for-15 with 111 passing yards and two touchdowns, both to wide receiver Jayden Reed. Punter Daniel Whelan forced a muff that turned into seven Packers points and the defense has bent but not broken, with the pass rush even showing up more so than it has most of this season. Just about everything went right for the Packers, who are 30 minutes away from entering Detroit next Thursday at 9-3. (edited)   Rebuilding since 1972 — Manuel S. Why am I watching this? — Robert R. Defense decided not to show up. Lack of hustle and poor tackling. Might as well rush 5+ guys every time to try to get some pressure. Armstead needs to retire, way too slow off the ball. Need to draft some OL players with attitude to get a run game going and some tougher DL players. — Stephen K. Join the discussion here.     Jayden Reed’s touchdown gives him 17.8 PPR points on the night. It’s the fourth game this year that Reed has scored 16 or more PPR points.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Audi sells stake in Formula One team to Qatar sovereign wealth fund,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5956798/2024/11/29/audi-formula-one-stake-qatar/,"Fri, 29 Nov 2024 15:12:43 GMT","The deal marks the Qatar sovereign fund’s first significant investment in F1, and is a deepening of roots for the Gulf region in the sport.","Formula 1 LUSAIL, Qatar — Audi has sold a stake in its Formula One team to Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund ahead of the German manufacturer’s entry to the sport in 2026. Audi announced on Friday, ahead of this weekend’s Qatar Grand Prix, that the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) had acquired a “significant minority stake” in the team, which currently races as Sauber. Sauber will evolve into Audi’s works F1 squad from 2026, racing with Audi engines. Advertisement Audi said in a statement that the sovereign wealth fund would join its F1 project as a “long-term investor and partner,” and the investment would provide a “substantial capital injection and pave the way for increasing infrastructure and team buildout.” The deal marks the Qatar sovereign fund’s first significant investment in F1, deepening the Gulf region’s roots in the sport. Bahrain’s sovereign wealth fund, Mumtalakat, owns the McLaren Group, while Saudi Arabia’s state oil company, Aramco, is a partner of both F1 and the Aston Martin team. QIA already has a stake in the Volkswagen Group, of which Audi is a part. “The investment by QIA reflects the trust and confidence the Audi F1 Project has already garnered, underscoring unwavering commitment of Audi to the initiative,” said Gernot Dollner, the CEO of Audi. “This additional capital will accelerate the team’s growth and is yet another milestone on our long-term strategy. QIA’s involvement further energizes the dedicated efforts at both the Hinwil and Neuburg facilities as they work towards the entry of Audi in 2026.” Qatar hosted its first F1 grand prix in 2021 before taking 2022 off to focus on hosting the FIFA World Cup. The Lusail International Circuit has a long-term contract to host F1 until 2033 and is one of four grands prix in the region, along with Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi. “Audi is a premium partner of choice with a rich motorsport legacy. As a long-standing investor in the Volkswagen Group, we believe in Audi’s vision and direction when entering Formula One and our investment will support the realization of this goal,” said Mohammed Al-Sowaidi, the CEO of QIA. Audi announced in 2022 that it would enter F1 upon the FIA World Motor Sport Council introducing new engine regulations in 2026, taking a majority shareholding in the Sauber team before opting for a total takeover completed earlier this year. Advertisement The Audi F1 project has undergone a number of changes through 2024, including a change in the senior management of the team. Ex-McLaren F1 boss Andreas Seidl was replaced by former Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto, while Red Bull sporting director Jonathan Wheatley will join in 2025 as team principal. The changes are intended to bring a fresh boost to the project. Sauber currently sits at the foot of F1’s constructors’ championship after failing to score any points through the first 22 races of the season. Drivers Valtteri Bottas and Zhou Guanyu will leave the team at the end of the season, with Haas racer Nico Hülkenberg and Formula Two championship leader Gabriel Bortoleto replacing them. Hülkenberg and Bortoleto have been signed to multi-year contracts, meaning they will be racing for the team when it becomes Audi for the 2026 season. The decision to sell a stake in the project comes amid a significant rise in F1 team valuations amid the ongoing boom for the sport. Al-Sowaidi said in a statement that F1 offered “significant untapped investment potential.” It is also not unusual for a manufacturer to not own all the shares of its F1 team. Mercedes only has a one-third stake in its F1 squad, having equal ownership with INEOS and Toto Wolff, the CEO and team principal. Meanwhile, Aston Martin and Alpine (Renault’s F1 team) have also attracted outside investment in recent years.

In January 2021, the Mets fired Porter within nine hours of an ESPN report that revealed he had sent dozens of inappropriate text messages to a female journalist. Advertisement “It was an inappropriate relationship for a lot of reasons,” Porter said while appearing on the podcast “Baseball Isn’t Boring.” “I put myself in that situation,” he continued. “I made the decision to send the text message that I sent. And I certainly shouldn’t have done it.” Porter sent the texts to a journalist in 2016, when he worked for the Chicago Cubs. According to ESPN’s initial report, after a brief exchange, the texts from Porter included lewd and explicit photos even as they went unanswered for weeks. In total, Porter sent 62 messages between answers over three weeks before the journalist requested him to stop. She ultimately left journalism, in part because of the harassment. After he was fired, Porter said he went to an inpatient center in a behavioral healthcare facility in Arizona called The Meadows for a week. He then transferred to an outpatient center and went there five days a week for eight weeks. He said he lacked awareness and didn’t have boundaries. Porter said, “It took a major incident like this to kind of wake me up.” Porter said that he still sees a therapist and has attended mental wellness retreat centers with his wife. Porter’s tenure with the Mets lasted just 37 days. With so much business conducted over video calls due to the COVID-19 pandemic at the time, Porter said he never saw his office at Citi Field or even met Mets owner Steve Cohen in person. “They had to make the best decision for the New York Mets when the article came out, and I knew they would,” Porter said. “I hold zero ill will toward them whatsoever. I do think they made the best decision for the Mets. It’s unfortunate that I put myself and put them in that situation.” (Photo: Rob Schumacher / USA Today) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

The squad is in a healthier position now — and the Arsenal manager has explained that the club will interrogate the situation to try and ensure that remains the case. “We do research not only when we have injuries, but when we don’t,” Arteta said. “Because people tend to look very deep at things when there is a problem. (But) while everything is going very good, dig in there because maybe you are doing things that are actually impacting what has actually happened. We’ve done a lot.” Arsenal are currently without defenders Ben White and Takehiro Tomiyasu due to respective knee injuries, while first-team players including Martin Odegaard, Jurrien Timber, Mikel Merino, Riccardo Calafiori and Bukayo Saka have all had spells on the sideline this season. Arsenal believe that much of the recent injury crisis has been outside of their control. “It’s true that certainly players obviously come from a position where they have played over 130 games in two seasons, but a lot of things they’ve been impact (injuries) and they’ve been joints, which is not related to muscle injuries and things that you can treat more easily,” Arteta added. Arteta held his cards close to his chest when it came to Arsenal’s immediate team news. “We have another training session today, we have to see how the boys are today. (There are) a few that weren’t able to train yesterday but hopefully yes today.

Advertisement The stand was being blocked by staging for a gig headlined by Brazilian singer-songwriter Roberto Carlos, which was taking place the following day. The tour date had been arranged before the Brazilian Football Federation (CBF) scheduled the Serie A fixture between Palmeiras and Botafogo. Allianz Parque, the 44,000-capacity stadium in Sao Paulo, has been staging concerts since 2014 with Paul McCartney the first musician to play at the venue. It hosted three dates of Taylor Swift’s Eras tour in 2023, and Iron Maiden and Bring Me the Horizon are scheduled to play at the venue before the end of 2024.  When the stadium hosts concerts during the football season, one of the stands behind the goal is usually closed to accommodate the staging. However, due to the magnitude of the fixture and demand for tickets, with Palmeiras and Botafogo level on points at the top of Serie A ahead of the game, Palmeiras opted to install a big screen attached to the back of the staging to allow more supporters to experience the match in some form. The section behind the goal was only open to members of Palmeiras’ Avanti club membership group. It is not the first time the club has done this for an important fixture. In 2022, a similar experience was provided for both the Campeonato Paulista final against Sao Paulo, and the Serie A fixture against Fortaleza which guaranteed the club the league title.

Fellow turkey leg recipients Jordan Love and Isaiah McDuffie weren’t far behind, waving their winning meal in the air to show fans who braved the chilly temperatures.

The Dolphins managed only 39 yards on the ground and didn’t shake off the narrative that they freeze up when playing in cold-weather conditions. If you wanted an example of a bend-but-don’t-break defense, watch the Packers early in the fourth quarter against the Dolphins. Miami once trailed 27-3 but was marching with ease down 27-11, threatening to cut its deficit to one score with plenty of time remaining. Tagovailoa’s completions weren’t difficult, either. Guys were running wide open. Tagovailoa wasn’t taking deep shots, but rather finding intermediate completions to consistently move the chains. Miami faced a second-and-goal from the 1 with about 11 minutes left in the game, but Green Bay’s goal-line defense stood firm. Defensive end Rashan Gary ripped down running back De’Von Achane on second down. Cornerback Keisean Nixon broke up a pass for tight end Jonnu Smith in the flat on third down. Linebacker Quay Walker sacked Tagovailoa on a delayed blitz on fourth down. Green Bay’s offense followed that sequence up with a nine-play, 78-yard drive for a field goal that consumed four minutes and 31 seconds to take a 30-11 lead and all but seal the game. — Matt Schneidman, Packers beat writer  The Packers seem to have finally found a kicker. After enduring six Brayden Narveson misses in the first six games, general manager Brian Gutekunst swapped the undrafted rookie with veteran Brandon McManus. Gutekunst wanted someone who had been through ups and downs in the NFL already and made it out the other side, not a young kicker struggling on the fly since the Packers couldn’t afford to let their talent go to waste with an inconsistent kicker. With makes from 46, 24 and 33 yards on Thursday, McManus is now 10-for-11 this season on field goals and hasn’t missed any of his 16 extra-point attempts. — Schneidman Advertisement Tagovailoa said after Sunday’s win over the Patriots that he wanted to kill any narratives about his struggles in the cold. Tagovailoa actually played well in his first game at Lambeau Field, completing 37-of-46 passes for 364 yards and two touchdowns, chunks of that coming against a Packers defense seemingly happy to keep easy completions in front. Tagovailoa’s only glaring miscue was a fourth-down pass that sailed over Achane’s head late in the first half and allowed the Packers to tack on three points before the break. Despite Tagovailoa’s impressive performance in adverse conditions, it wasn’t nearly enough to knock off the Packers, winners of three straight. — Schneidman (Photo: Patrick McDermott / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

Latest Headlines - The Athletic,Cowboys hold on to defeat Giants in NFL Thanksgiving Day game: Live reaction and updates,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/live-blogs/giants-vs-cowboys-live-score-updates-nfl-result/f2aeWdR77loG/,"Fri, 29 Nov 2024 02:11:12 GMT",The Cowboys improve to 5-7 with their dominant win over the Giants on Thanksgiving,"NFL Advertisement The Dallas Cowboys rode a standout defensive performance and Rico Dowdle’s first career 100-yard rushing game to a 27-20 win over the New York Giants. The Cowboys (5-7) break their six-game home losing streak while the Giants (2-10) fail to find any offensive momentum after yet another quarterback change. The Giants offense continued to struggle under their third quarterback in three weeks. After a 13-play, 70-yard opening drive touchdown led to the Giants’ first first-quarter touchdown since Week 3, just two of New York’s next 11 drives were longer than 20 yards.

GO FURTHER Cowboys run game, defense shine in first home win of season vs. Giants: Key takeaways With three different starting quarterbacks in three straight games, the Giants offense could not find enough sustained success under Lock. The Giants backup started after Tommy DeVito was injured in Sunday’s loss to the Buccaneers. It looked like Lock might provide a little bit of a spark after a 28-yard rush just short of the end zone and a touchdown shortly after but the Giants offense sputtered. Penalties proved crushing too, with the Giants tallying 12 as a team. After 70 total offensive yards on that possession, the Giants finished with 247 offensive yards thanks to a late drive in the final minutes. Lock faced a ton of pressure, throwing one interception and then fumbling and turning over the ball on another possession. He was sacked six times. Advertisement The home losing streak has finally come to an end. With some help from arguably the NFL’s worst team, Dallas now has won two in a row. Playoff talk is still not worth discussing, but it’s clear that the Cowboys are still fighting. The biggest positives: Overshown looks like a star, KaVontae Turpin got more offensive touches and Dowdle continues to play like he deserves to be part of the future. Collectively, the team did a nice job taking the ball away on defense and taking care of it on offense. There’s still a lot of ugly, but it buys them another week where the window has not completely closed on the season. Giants superstar defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence told reporters after Thursday's 27-20 loss to the Cowboys that he suffered a dislocated elbow and is unsure how much time he'll miss recovering from the injury. Lawrence was seen wearing a sling after the game. Any amount of time Lawrence misses would be a devastating blow to a Giants defense that is already one of the league's worst against the run. Especially because fellow defensive tackle Rakeem Nunez-Roches also left Thursday's game with an injury (stinger). Lawrence has slowed down after a torrid start to the season, but his nine sacks still rank sixth in the NFL and No. 1 among interior linemen. He was most certainly on his way to another All-Pro season. The Athletic  Above are the latest NFC wild card standings.

Getty Images Tonight's 27-20 loss to the Cowboys wasn't an embarrassing loss like last Sunday (30-7 to the Buccaneers). This was just the standard bad team loss. Still, the Giants' seventh loss in a row drops them to 2-10. This is their ninth double-digit loss season in the past 12 years.

It marked the third time in the past five games that Lamb recorded 50 yards or fewer.  While the 25-year-old is still on pace to record over 1,000 receiving yards this season, it's been a frustrating run of late for him.   Arthur Z: 3 years of Schoen & Daboll and is this roster better?

Join the conversation by clicking the 'Discuss' tab at the top of this page or by clicking here. In a battle of backup quarterbacks, Cooper Rush outlasted Drew Lock on Thanksgiving. Rush didn’t have a spectacular game and was aided heavily by a strong running game but after a tough start filling in for Dak Prescott, Rush has started to look more comfortable the past couple of weeks, on the road against the Washington Commanders and Thursday at home against the Giants.  This version of Rush looks a lot more like the guy who helped the Cowboys to a 4-1 record in five games without Prescott in 2022. Rush doesn’t make many spectacular plays but he’s fairly efficient, doesn’t throw many dangerous passes and usually avoids the big mistake. His play was especially magnified on a day that Lock had a decent game but made a killer error by throwing a pick-six on a screen play in the first half.  Those are the types of plays Rush has done a good job of avoiding, at least in the passing game. On Thursday, he was also able to overcome some bad drops from his top target, CeeDee Lamb, and found Brandin Cooks in some big moments in the clutch.

GO FURTHER Tottenham 2 Roma 2: Late Hummels equaliser denies Spurs victory in wildly open Europa League clash – The Briefing Alexis Saelemaekers was a second-half substitute for Roma and he was happy with the attitude shown by his team-mates throughout. ""It was a really important point for us,"" he told UEFA.com. ""We fought until the end of the game and we will go forward now. At half-time the coach said we had to continue playing as we had been. ""We came back with the same mentality, we knew if we kept pushing we could score an equaliser and that's what happened."" Advertisement Getty Images Mats Hummels played the hero for AS Roma with a last-minute equaliser to avenge his early penalty giveaway. Tottenham narrowly fumble three points at home in a thrilling 2-2 draw. Ange Postecoglou was then asked if he was shocked by the attacking threat posed by Roma. ""No, they're a good side, that's the reason they're in the Europa League,"" he said.  ""They obviously did well last year, they've had a tough time this year but they've got some quality players. But we still had enough chances to win the game."" Then, he was asked about Fraser Forster who deputised nicely for Guglielmo Vicario. ""Fraser did well, we expect that from him,"" said Postecoglou. ""He's a very experienced goalkeeper, he did his part."" Getty Images Spurs can be very good on the break thanks to Dejan Kulusevski's running power.  We saw that again before the second Tottenham goal.  It was a great run from Kulusevski onto Pape Sarr's pass, matched by the cross for Johnson to make it 2-1.  Getty Images It was briefly 2-1 to Roma after a Stephan El Shaarawy volley. But it was disallowed by VAR.  Roma had playing the better football at that point but it remained 1-1 after the offside was revealed.  Getty Images Roma had been growing into this encounter and they got themselves level.  Evan Ndicka flicked on a free-kick at the near post and the ball did enough to beat Fraser Forster. The goalkeeper stretched to get a hand on it but could not keep it out.  Advertisement Let's look back at the goals! For Tottenham's opener, was a very good advantage played from the referee Glenn Nyberg, who I thought was very sharp tonight. Son wanted a foul, and would have got one, but the Swede played on. Seconds later, Johnson worked a cross into the box, Sarr got a toe to it before Hummels, who made contact with his calf in an impatient kick out for the ball. Definite penalty, and Son slammed it home confidently. Getty Images Not the post-match interview Ange Postecoglou would have wanted to be doing when his side had the lead going into stoppage time. ""It's obviously frustrating, particularly when they score so late,"" he told TNT Sports.  ""It was a good game, we probably should have put it to bed a lot earlier. ""We missed some big chances and at 2-1, you're always keeping them in the game. So it's disappointing not to see it out."" Getty Images Tottenham's Archie Gray was keen to take the positives from the performance when he spoke to TNT Sports after the match. ""It was a tough game. The first 20 and last 20 minutes were tough,"" he said.  ""We had to dig deep but, apart from that, I thought we were good. We played our football and we were good on the counter attack. ""It's just that last moment that cost us and we've got to do better than that. It was a good performance and we'll learn from the mistakes.""  I can only imagine the criticism being aimed at Mats Hummels after he was really sloppy in conceding that early penalty. But the 35-year-old dusted himself down superbly and defended resolutely from there while also contributing with some great passing into midfield and out wide. And then he took it upon himself to decide the match with great reactions to turn Angelino's rocket of a cross into the back of the net. Life in the old dog yet... We know Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou is pretty dogmatic about his style of play. And that swashbuckling style saw them take 24 shots on goal. But it also saw them concede 18 shots. And one of them saw Mats Hummels equalise. What's that phrase about living by the sword and dying by the sword? Advertisement Getty Images The points were shared and there was a lovely, warm embrace between Ange Postecoglou and Claudio Ranieri at full time. Great to see! The Athletic Lazio, Athletic Club, and Eintracht Frankfurt are near the top of the standings with 13 points from their five matches. Tottenham drop out of the automatic qualification places, overtaken by fellow British side Rangers, who won 4-1 in Nice tonight. Manchester United are a point back on nine after their win against Bodo/Glimt. The Athletic's Jay Harris, Jack Pitt-Brooke and Liam Tharme were on hand to deliver The Briefing from the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium — check it out below. GO FURTHER Tottenham 2 Roma 2: Late Hummels equaliser denies Spurs victory in wildly open Europa League clash – The Briefing Getty Images A winning start at Old Trafford for Ruben Amorim, but not a convincing victory by any means. They scraped past Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt thanks to Rasmus Hojlund's winner. Elsewhere, there was a massive win for Rangers in France and Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce won late in the Czech Republic. The second half had everything, even though we had to wait more than 45 minutes for a goal. There were big chances at both ends, saves from both goalkeepers, crunching tackles, and four shots that cannoned back off the crossbar. It was everything we have come to expect from matches involving Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham. On another night, Spurs would have won handsomely but they also had to heed plenty of warnings, including three Roma goals that were denied by the offside flag. A superb game of Europa League football! Advertisement It is kicking off in the away end following the full-time whistle and I can see a lot missiles being thrown. Getty Images Tottenham finally punished for their lack of efficiency in both boxes and concede an added time equaliser to Hummels.  Have to say that result is probably fair enough given everything.  Spurs should have put the game to bed a lot earlier. What a match. It ends 2-2!"

Detroit (11-1) continues to lead the NFC North and hold the top seed in the NFC. An annual participant in Thanksgiving football, the Lions notched their first win on the holiday in eight years.

GO FURTHER Lions hold off Bears in wild ending for first Thanksgiving win in 8 years: Key takeaways Chicago Bears coach Matt Eberflus addressed the clock management that saw his team run one play — despite having a timeout in hand — in the final 36 seconds of a Thanksgiving 23-20 loss to the Detroit Lions. “We’re at 36 seconds right there (after the sack),” Eberflus told reporters after the game. “Our hope was that we’d re-rack that play at 18 seconds, throw it inbounds, get it into field goal range and then call the timeout. That’s where it was and that was our decision-making process on that. “We were outside of field goal range and needed to get a few more yards in there as close as we can get and then we were going to call timeout and that’s why we held that last timeout at the end of the game. Disappointed for the players. They put a lot of work in on a short week and put themselves in position to win that game.” Read more about Eberflus' decision below.  GO FURTHER Bears coach Matt Eberflus explains why Chicago didn’t use timeout at end of game vs. Lions Advertisement Getty Images After the game, Bears cornerback Kyler Gordon did not hold back his comments regarding the end of the game.  ""I thought we were at least going to kick a field goal,"" Gordon said, as he watched from the sidelines as the Bears were in field goal range.  Asked if there's an underlying reason for the close losses, Gordon responded: ""Next question. No comment.""  The Lions’ dream season continues, even though it’s hard to feel too good about this one. Injuries continued to pile up, with Levi Onwuzurike, Josh Paschal and Malcolm Rodriguez all leaving this game without returning. Others like DJ Reader, Za’Darius Smith and Mekhi Wingo all left the game before coming back. It feels like injuries are the only thing that can derail this team right now. They won’t have much time to rest after this one, either, with the Packers coming to town in Week 14 for “Thursday Night Football.” The Lions escaped with a win, but the injury bug continues to bite. Three straight games against teams in the NFC North have resulted in three wild finishes for the Bears — and three losses. The Bears lost to the Packers on a blocked field goal, to the Vikings in overtime after erasing an 11-point deficit and to the Lions on Thanksgiving on a heave to the end zone as time expired in a three-point game. If there’s one positive, it’s that Caleb Williams can excel against tough opponents. He just needs to prove he can beat them. He’s not there yet, but the rookie quarterback definitely is close. Williams was 20-for-39 passing for 256 yards and three touchdowns for a 97.8 passer rating. The Lions entered the game leading the league in opposing QB passer rating at 72.7.  Getty Images The Bears had all the momentum, shrinking a 16-point Lions lead to 3 in the final frame. Detroit had issues in the red zone. Its defense was shorthanded. This was the time to get them. The Bears had every opportunity to hand the Lions their second loss of the season — getting into field goal range on their final possession. Yet, a series of penalties and a decision to go for the end zone with a timeout left thwarted the opportunity. At the end of the day, the Lions will take it — but this was far from their best performance. They didn’t close out the game like they normally do, but sometimes, that’s just the NFL. They’re fortunate to win the game, improving to 11-1 for the first time in franchise history. They’ve won 10 games in a row, and continue to maintain the NFC’s No. 1 seed. That’s enough for a Happy Thanksgiving. Getty Images The Bears keep finding new ways to lose one-score games. They looked like they were going to lose in a rout in Detroit, came all the way back, had the ball in field goal range but a cacophony of errors at the end led to Williams’ pass falling incomplete as time expired. They had one timeout left after Williams was sacked on what appeared to be a broken play. We’ll have a lot of questions, again, for coach Matt Eberflus about how that happened. It’s another head-scratcher for a team that has had too many this season, and during this six-game losing streak, they’ve never been on the right side of a coin-flip game.  Advertisement Getty Images After the QB Draw call on second-and-20, you can call timeout and get the perfect play called on third down to get back into field goal range.  You can then easily have enough time left in the game to run your field goal unit onto the field for “fast FG” on fourth down. The Lions are back on ""Thursday Night Football"" next week, hosting the Green Bay Packers in another NFC North divisional matchup.   Todd S: As soon as the Bears flight lands in Chicago… fire Eberflus!!!! Kevin C: The Bears are who we thought they were. Edward S: Never, ever EVER apologize for a win.

Aaron Glenn's defense recorded five sacks, which was more than double what they average per game (2.3 sacks per game).

Alexis Mac Allister put the hosts ahead early into the second half with a low finish across the excellent Thibaut Courtois, in front of the Kop. Real Madrid had the chance to level shortly after, only for Kylian Mbappe to see his penalty saved by Caoimhin Kelleher. Minutes later Mohamed Salah also fluffed his lines from the spot, shooting wide. But second-half substitute Cody Gakpo made sure of the win with a header late on.

Much deserved standing ovation. Bradley has been incredible. His energy levels are remarkable, combined with no little quality. 💬 Maxwell K: Liverpool miles better on the day. For some reason it is easier to stomach losing to a club with the history and support of Liverpool, rather than a plastic club. 💬 Daniel L: Endrick came on and all he did was assault Konate several times, get a yellow for his trouble, and then maybe injure him right at the end. 💬 Kj M: Conor Bradley, that’s a tackle! 🔴 🔴 Advertisement And with that, matchday five of this season’s Champions League mega group phase is over — three more to go. Here’s the picture it leaves ahead of the next round of fixtures in a fortnight’s time… The Athletic  As for Kylian Mbappe, there are simply not enough arrows on the pitch graphic — meaning the French forward just wasn’t involved enough, nor in dangerous enough areas for Real Madrid. The positions of Arda Guler and Jude Bellingham in that passing network also helps explain why Mbappe’s impact tonight only ever felt on the periphery of the game bar the odd spark.

Liverpool have a good dynamic, they are on fire, they play with intensity... We defended well in the first half but we failed in some decisions in the last pass.” And on Kylian Mbappe’s penalty miss and difficult start to Madrid life: 💬 “It has happened to me many times, especially with strikers when they struggle to score. There is a medicine, which is to be patient. It’s a moment for him, especially after this missed penalty, everyone has to support him. “It could be he lacks a bit of confidence. When things aren’t going your way, you have to play simply but sometimes you complicate things more. But you can’t judge a player for a missed penalty.” Advertisement Getty Images It was more wisdom from Arne Slot at half-time that helped his Liverpool team get over the line against Real Madrid. Here’s a snippet of what he told TNT Sports:  💬 “It’s not the same as any other one (game). They are the reigning champions and have dominated Europe recently. They are a pain in the arse for Liverpool many times as well!   “But it’s not just the result, it’s the way we played. “We were a bit impatient (in the first half). Every time they threatened us it was from us being sloppy or forcing it. I said we could play with more intensity so forget the shirt you face, do what you always do, and we can create more chances even than we did in the first half.” Getty Images That was not the night Jude Bellingham was hoping for on his return to England with Real Madrid. Here is his reaction to TNT Sports:  💬 “They just took control of the game. We never really maximised the spells we had in possession. When we got the ball back, we tried to force the counter-attack a few too many times and turned it over so much. “They kept us in a place where we couldn’t really harm them and I just think they were more up for it than us to be honest, which is really disappointing to say. “The penalty (miss) is not the reason we lost. As a collective, we weren’t good enough on a night they performed better than us, and it’s as simple as that.” Getty Images You can tell from the smile plastered over the face of Alexis Mac Allister that this was one of the good nights at Liverpool. Here he is, speaking to TNT Sports: 💬 “When you play against teams like Real Madrid, it is always nice to score but the most important thing is that we won it and in a really good way.  “We dominated the game, and we needed this guy (Caoimhin Kelleher) a couple of times. But thank god he was there and he really played well again tonight.” Getty Images What an emergence from Caoimhin Kelleher this season, especially when facing penalties. The Liverpool goalkeeper, stepping in for the injured Alisson, has faced four penalties in 2024-25 for club and country — and he has saved three of them. Harry Kane for England against Ireland in this month’s international break at Wembley has been the only player to score against him from 12 yards. Finland’s Joel Pohjanpalo (vs Ireland) and then Southampton striker Adam Armstrong, plus Mbappe tonight, complete the list of Kelleher’s spot-kick successes.

The good news is that Liverpool will be heavily favored in each of their next three matches in Europe — against Girona, LOSC Lille and PSV. The more concerning development is how serious Ibrahima Konate's late injury will turn out to be…  Getty Images Here’s something no one expected, new format or not: Real Madrid are in danger of falling out of the top 24 and failing to advance past the Champions League group stage. Madrid are reeling — this was their first loss to Liverpool in 15 years and first time ever losing three group stage games in the Champions League. Next up is a rematch against one of the more surprising success stories of this year’s Champions League: defending Europa League winner Atalanta.  Real Madrid defeated the Italian side 2-0 in the UEFA Super Cup in August, a game which also marked Kylian Mbappe's club debut (and first club goal). What a night for Liverpool, and it was deserved too. If you take Real Madrid’s penalty out of the full-time numbers below — for example, 0.80 of their expected goals created — then you can see how little Madrid created. Those numbers are below… FT: Liverpool 2-0 Real Madrid Real Madrid were missing some key figures, but this was a statement performance — and result — from the Premier League leaders.  Getty Images There were six other Champions League matches taking place at the same time around the continent. Here are the full-time results: Those six results join the two from earlier:  Getty Images Arne Slot’s decision to task Conor Bradley — a young player with very little Champions League experience — with keeping Kylian Mbappe quiet was another stroke of genius for the first-year Liverpool boss.  Bradley stymied Mbappe and the loaded Madrid attack throughout the 90 minutes at Anfield. He set the tone early with a perfectly timed tackle on an Mbappe breakaway chance that electrified the Anfield crowd, and never looked back from there, refusing to let the superstar get a quality chance at goal and winning balls all night long regardless of who he was matched up with. As if that was not enough, Bradley also had the assist on a give-and-go with Alexis Mac Allister for Liverpool's opening goal.

That’s a worry for Slot ahead of Sunday’s Premier League showdown with Manchester City here. Getty Images What a moment for Caoimhin Kelleher. Liverpool’s No. 2 goalkeeper was picked to start in place of the injured Alisson and got his star turn in the 61st minute, guessing right on a Kylian Mbappe penalty to keep Real Madrid from equalising. While Kelleher deserves credit, it was also an extremely poor strike from someone of the quality and stature of Mbappe as the Frenchman continues his rocky first season with Real Madrid. Getty Images Both Liverpool and Real Madrid have lived up to pre-match expectations.  One is the most in-form team in Europe and the other is struggling to perform at a top level and had a lot of absentees. Mbappe is singled out as he was signed for this type of game, and he was probably the worst player tonight."
Latest Headlines - The Athletic,How Aston Villa and Morgan Rogers were denied a late winner in their Champions League draw against Juventus,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/live-blogs/aston-villa-juventus-live-updates-champions-league-score-result/MrMc6Cp5A1ll/,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 23:01:30 GMT",Rogers thought he scored with the last kick of the game but the goal was controversially ruled out for a foul on goalkeeper Michele Di Gregorio,"UCL Advertisement live Updated 3m ago GO FURTHER Aston Villa 0 Juventus 0: Last-minute VAR drama, Kamara’s return and Weah’s central role  We are at that stage of the year where the games come thick and fast. No time for either of these two teams to rest on their laurels as they are back in domestic action in a few days' time. Aston Villa face a tough trip to Stamford Bridge on Sunday where they face Chelsea while, later in the day, Juventus go to Lecce looking to end a run of successive goalless draws.

GO FURTHER Champions League briefing: Liverpool prodigy wins Mbappe battle, Bellingham booed, USMNT pair shine Opta/X A look at this snazzy graphic from our friends at Opta shows that Villa were consistently ahead of Juventus tonight in terms of the expected goals total (xG), which values chances depending on the position shots were taken. Neither side did enough to score, though! Getty Images Jesus Gil Manzano was not a popular man as he walked off the field this evening. Several of his decisions during the match were a little questionable, including a very harsh yellow card for Tim Weah, for example. But the officiating team got the big calls right, for me. The Juventus penalty shout after the ball hit Pau Torres' hand was rightly waved away, and frankly, the big call at the end for the foul on the goalkeeper was correct too, for me. Diego Carlos is a big, strapping lad and goalkeeper Michele Di Gregorio was well set to catch the cross before his body is noticeably shunted to the side by Carlos bumping into him. That puts him off balance and means he can't grab the ball.  Is it on the softer side? Sure. Would players have got away with that 20 years ago? Definitely. Did Di Gregorio sell it a bit? Yes. None of those preclude the referee giving a foul. And imagine the histrionics from Emi Martinez if it were the other way around...  For about 30 seconds, the Aston Villa players and fans thought they had stolen all three points with the last kick of the game.  Getty Images Casting our minds away from the late frustration briefly, that was a really important clean sheet for Unai Emery's men. The fact they have kept more shutouts against Bayern Munich and Juventus than they have in all of their Premier League matches this season is... fun. While Digne was put through the wringer by the fleet-footed Conceicao, Torres and Carlos were very good in the heart of the defence. And any backline supported by Emi Martinez is onto a winner. Emery was clearly very happy with that clean sheet. Advertisement Getty Images After sharing praise for the performance of his players, Unai Emery was not drawn into any controversial comments about the referee's late decision. ""(I'm) very happy. We got one point but we were very competitive and very serious,"" he told TNT Sports. ""We respected the opponent as well, we dominated parts of the match and the last action is clear. ""It's the interpretation of the referee. We know here in England, 80 per cent (of the time) it's not a foul. But maybe in Europe, it's a foul."" Getty Images Over on our discussion page, Aston Villa fans are unsurprisingly furious with the referee's decision to deny Morgan Rogers a late winner.  Jim M.: Not a foul. Mic P.: Poor refereeing all game, letting things go. And makes himself the center of the game by making that call. What a disgrace.  Michael H.: Scandalous decision. Got jumped into. Tomos H.: Frustrating all around. Seen better refs in the National League. The rare Juventus fan in our discussion took a more even-keeled approach. Thomas A.: Feels like we got away with one. Keepers are protected but we really defended well and deserved the point all in all. We definitely had our chances to win the game and more or less gave as good as we got.  A fascinating game that one, particularly in the second half. The statistics don't quite tell the tale of the match but, for all their possession, Juventus never looked much of a threat.

Check out that graphic... Advertisement Getty Images Before the match, Aston Villa's fans were serenading their goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, officially the best in the world after winning the Yashin Trophy at the Ballon d'Or awards for the second year running. And you could see why after this glorious save from Francisco Conceicao's header, described so eloquently by Ed here. What made the save so good is the fact he was coming across his goal, and must have only seen the ball late after his eyes tracked across the throng of players cluttering his eyeline in the middle of the penalty area. Once he did see the ball, it was pure instinct and physicality. The dexterity, agility, and reactions were incredibly impressive. Say what you like about some of his antics but he's a heck of a goalie. Getty Images ...to some of the other players to impress tonight. For Villa, Emi Martinez made that super stop, and Pau Torres was nerveless in playing out from the back under, at times, highly intense Juventus pressure. Boubacar Kamara broke up play nicely too. For the visitors, Federico Gatti was a rock at the back, while midfielder Manuel Locatelli moved the ball nicely too and Tim Weah did a decent job up front considering the lack of service and that he was playing out of position. Getty Images That's right, the player of the first half is also the player of the match. It might seem odd to nominate an attacker in what ended a 0-0 draw, but the 21-year-old winger was a constant threat, an omnipresent thorn in the side of poor Lucas Digne and the host of other players that tried to stop him. Despite being one of the smallest players on the park, his stooping header was inches away from crossing the line before Martinez's fantastic save, before he turned this way and that dizzyingly to win the free kick from Morgan Rogers, who must have had stars in his eyes. Diligent in defence too, it was an electric all-court performance from the Portuguese. Only on loan at the moment with the Turin side from Porto, there's a gentleman's agreement to give Juve a headstart in signing him permanently. Some showing. Getty Images There were six other Champions League matches taking place at the same around the continent. Here are the full-time results: Those six results join the two from earlier: Crvena Zvezda 5-1 Stuttgart, plus Sturm Graz 1-0 Girona. *Live on The Athletic — follow live reaction with our blog here. Watkins clearly wasn't happy with the performance of Spanish referee Jesus Gil Manzano, but stayed very calm in his post-match interview with TNT Sports. ""I've got to be careful what I say about the referees,"" he said. ""Like I said, the refereeing is a little bit different in this competition, they don't let things go as much. We're used to that now. ""Sometimes the decisions go against you and sometimes they go with you, but it's out of our control."" Advertisement Getty Images A very magnanimous Ollie Watkins spoke to TNT Sports immediately after the full-time whistle. The late controversy was, of course, the first topic of discussion. ""I think it's soft. Maybe in the Premier League, that's a goal,"" said the Villa striker. ""In Europe, the goalkeepers are protected a lot by the referees. It's one of those. ""To be fair, I think it was a 0-0 game so we'd have been lucky if we'd taken that (win) there."" Getty Images The mood inside Villa Park is not a happy one. The fans are fuming that their wild late celebrations were ruined by a very questionable decision. We can definitely file Juventus under lucky to get away with that one. The home supporters make their feelings towards the officials known as they leave the pitch before dishing out strong ovations for their players. In the end, that was a really fun second half despite the lack of a goal. Getty Images Di Gregorio has got away with one there — I'm not sure that's a foul.  Villa thought they had snatched it at the death."
MLB News,What does Soto's future hold? Let's look to the past to find out,https://www.mlb.com/news/juan-soto-projection-scenarios-for-new-deal,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 03:08:48 GMT",,"Thomas Harrigan Juan Soto is headed for one of the largest contracts in baseball history, perhaps even approaching the $700 million in guaranteed money that Shohei Ohtani got from the Dodgers last offseason, if some projections are to be believed. Ohtani, you might remember, is both a hitter and a pitcher. Soto just hits. But hitters this young and this good simply don’t hit the open market very often, if ever. In fact, there haven’t been many hitters with this statistical résumé through the age of 25, period. MLB offseason signings and trades• Latest free-agent and trade rumors• Top 25 free agents | Every free agent, by position• Tracking every team's offseason moves• FA guides: Soto | Burnes | Alonso | Bregman | Fried | Santander• Offseason dates, rules & terms explained Here are some of Soto’s key offensive stats during his seven-year career, which has included four All-Star selections, five Silver Sluggers, a World Series championship, a batting title and four top-six finishes in his league’s MVP voting: 936 games4,088 plate appearances.285/.421/.532 slash160 OPS+201 HR769 BB Even having that much big-league experience through an age-25 season is a rarity. Only 16 players have amassed at least 4,000 PAs by that point. When you actually factor in his performance, the list of comps gets even smaller. Just nine players have reached the 200 homer plateau by the end of their age-25 season. Five of those players did so with an OPS+ of 160 or higher: Soto, Mickey Mantle, Mike Trout, Jimmie Foxx and Albert Pujols. The number of players with at least 200 homers and 700 walks through the age of 25? Just one. Soto. In other words, direct comps for a hitter of this age and caliber are hard to come by. However, if we loosen the criteria just a bit, we can find some hints that might help in determining how Soto’s bat will age. THE PLAYER POOL We wanted to find players with a similar statistical profile to Soto who also achieved success at a young age, prioritizing power (HR), patience (BB) and overall performance at the plate (OPS+). It’s not an exact science, but it’s not meant to be. The point here is to look to the past for some rough context about what the future might hold for Soto. To that end, we turned to Baseball-Reference’s Stathead for a list of retired hitters who debuted after integration (1947) and reached each of the following thresholds through their age-25 seasons: 100 HR200 BB140 OPS+ Given those parameters, there are 18 potential comps, and the stature of the players on this list lets us know we’re on the right track. Of the 18 players, nine are in the Hall of Fame: Mantle, Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Frank Robinson, Ken Griffey Jr., Frank Thomas, Reggie Jackson, Eddie Mathews and Orlando Cepeda. Two others -- Pujols and Miguel Cabrera -- are likely to be first-ballot inductees when they’re eligible. Another, Dick Allen, has a chance to make it on this year’s Classic Era Ballot. And three more would be surefire Hall of Famers if not for their connection to PEDs: Alex Rodriguez, Mark McGwire and Manny Ramirez. Rounding out the group are Prince Fielder, Darryl Strawberry and Rocky Colavito, each of whom earned at least six All-Star selections. Every one of these 18 players continued to perform at a high level through their age-29 season. All but one had an OPS+ of 143 or higher from the ages of 26-29, and the lone exception still posted a 130 OPS+. Looking at the group’s median value, here is how these players fared on a per-season basis in that span: 664 PA, 37 HR, 155 OPS+, 6.6 WAR Unsurprisingly, there was some level of decline as these players moved into their 30s. Overall, though, the group’s performance remained strong from the ages of 30-33. Its median performance per season in that span looked like this: 620 PA, 29 HR, 153 OPS+, 5.1 WAR The ages of 33-35 is where we begin to see a steeper dropoff, not just in performance but also availability. Only seven of our 18 players averaged at least 550 plate appearances per season from the ages of 33-35. Five averaged fewer than 400 PAs, and one didn’t play after his age-32 campaign due to injury. Here’s how the group performed on a per-season basis in that span, once again looking at its median value: 507 PA, 25 HR, 131 OPS+, 3.1 WAR Of course, there’s a lot of variation here. Below, we’ll break up these 18 hitters into four general categories, based on how they performed from the ages of 26-35. Soto’s new contract is expected to be longer than 10 years, but we’re focusing on that timeframe. If Soto’s next 10 years look anything like his first seven, any value he provides beyond his age-35 season will be an added bonus. The dream scenario: Mays (390 HR, 166 OPS+ from ages 26-35), Aaron (375 HR, 162 OPS+), Robinson (301 HR, 163 OPS+), Ramirez (381 HR, 160 OPS+) The first two names in this group speak for themselves, with Mays and Aaron undoubtedly deserving mention in any conversation about the top five players in MLB history, thanks to their incredible combination of skill, consistency and longevity. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. As a contemporary of Mays and Aaron, Robinson tends to fly under the radar a bit among the legends of the sport, but he had a remarkable career in his own right. The right-handed slugger was the first player to win an MVP Award in both leagues, with the second of those coming after he earned the AL Triple Crown at age 30 in 1966. That was one of five top-four finishes Robinson logged in his league’s MVP voting during the timeframe in question, doing so in his age-26, -28, -30, -33 and -35 seasons. While Mays, Aaron and Robinson all made the Hall of Fame on their first ballot, Cooperstown has thus far eluded Ramirez due to a pair of positive PED tests late in his career. On a statistical level, though, he ranks among greatest right-handed hitters ever. Ramirez recorded at least 33 homers, 102 RBIs and a .976 OPS in every season from the ages of 26-34. The very good scenario: Mantle (311 HR, 173 OPS+ from ages 26-35), McGwire (405 HR, 173 OPS+), Cabrera (290 HR, 158 OPS+), Thomas (314 HR, 156 OPS+), Pujols (359 HR, 155 OPS+), Jackson (293 HR, 151 OPS+), Rodriguez (388 HR, 147 OPS+) On a rate-stats basis, Mantle remained one of the most productive hitters in the game as he aged, posting a 165 OPS+ in his final seven seasons. However, he missed a lot of time due to injuries once he hit his 30s, averaging just 118 games played with 24 homers per season from 30-35 and retiring after his age-36 campaign. Cabrera, Pujols and A-Rod each followed a similar trajectory, stacking up outstanding seasons in their late 20s and early 30s before beginning to decline. From the ages of 26-32, the average season among those three players was 39 homers with a 163 OPS+, and they combined to win seven MVPs in that time. From 33-35? An average of 24 homers per year with a 125 OPS+. It appeared to be going the same way for Thomas, who played just 20 games in his age-33 season and produced 28 homers with a 119 OPS+ the following year, a far cry from his average of 34 home runs with a 164 OPS+ from 26-32. But Thomas rebounded in his age-35 campaign, recording 42 homers, 105 RBIs and a 146 OPS+ over 153 games. Jackson's production from 26-32 was a level below those four, as he averaged 30 homers per year with a 151 OPS+ in that span, but he also didn’t experience a steep decline as he approached his mid-30s. In fact, his OPS+ from the ages of 33-35 held steady at 151. McGwire is a unique case in this group, as he actually had his best seasons after turning 30. The imposing slugger went deep 245 times (61 HR per year) with a 189 OPS+ from 32-35, including a then-record 70 dingers in 1998. McGwire notched a stellar 154 OPS+ from 26-31, though he averaged just 27 home runs per season in that time, missing significant time due to injuries from 1993-95. The mixed-bag scenario: Allen (257 HR, 157 OPS+ from ages 26-35), Griffey (347 HR, 142 OPS+), Mathews (287 HR, 137 OPS+) Although his lifetime 156 OPS+ puts him on par with many of the greats mentioned above, Allen has continued to fall short of the Hall of Fame due to his deficit in the counting-stats department, producing 1,848 hits and 351 homers. Allen averaged 32 homers and 97 RBIs per year with a 164 OPS+ from the ages of 26-30, a stretch that concluded with an AL MVP season in 1972. However, he played just 458 games and recorded 80 homers over the rest of his career, dealing with frequent injuries in that time. He retired after his age-35 campaign in 1977. The late slugger will have another opportunity to make the Hall as part of the 2025 Classic Era Ballot. Griffey was a first-ballot Hall of Famer who finished with 630 homers, but he’s still considered one of baseball’s greatest “what-ifs,” with injuries undermining what could have been an even more prolific career. Griffey had 40 or more home runs in every season from age 26-30, but he produced 98 homers combined over 445 games from 31-35. Similarly, Mathews’ best years came before his 30th birthday, and his offensive production sharply declined from 32-35 (115 OPS+). The Hall of Fame third baseman reached the 30-homer plateau in nine straight years from the ages of 21-29, but did so just once after that. The disappointing scenario: Strawberry (161 HR, 131 OPS+ from ages 26-35), Fielder (129 HR, 131 OPS+), Cepeda (187 HR, 129 OPS+), Colavito (245 HR, 127 OPS+) It’s tough to compare Soto to Strawberry, whose career was derailed by substance-abuse issues. Strawberry appeared in just 335 games after his 30th birthday. Ditto for Soto and Fielder, who retired after his age-32 season due to a neck injury. Cepeda played until he was 37 years old and was voted into the Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1999, but his candidacy largely hinged on what he did in his 20s. The Puerto Rico native’s production took a downward turn following his NL MVP Award-winning season at age 29, as the knee problems that he dealt with off and on throughout his career began to take their toll. He averaged just 18 home runs per year with a 118 OPS+ from 30-35. Colavito had some huge seasons early in his career, averaging 35 homers annually with a 138 OPS+ from the ages of 24-31, a stretch that included a trio of 40-homer campaigns. However, the end of the line came quickly for the outfielder, who played just two more years (101 OPS+) after his final All-Star season at age 32. Overall: While no two players are the same, it bodes well for Soto’s future outlook that we can count 11 of the 18 comps as successes. Even the players that would be categorized as question marks still had their moments -- especially before turning 30 -- with three winning an MVP Award during the timeframe in question. It should also be noted that injuries (or other off-the-field circumstances) were a prevailing theme among the players in the latter two groups. If Soto stays healthy, it's not hard to imagine his next contract going down as a free-agent success story, no matter how large it ends up being."
MLB News,Playoff hero Edman re-ups with Dodgers for five years,https://www.mlb.com/news/tommy-edman-dodgers-deal,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 01:18:00 GMT",,"Juan Toribio LOS ANGELES -- Before acquiring Tommy Edman in a three-team deal in July, the Dodgers had been pursuing the superutility man for years. Now, they made sure Edman won’t get away for the foreseeable future. Edman and the Dodgers agreed to a five-year, $74 million extension, the club announced on Friday. Multiple sources confirmed to MLB.com that the deal runs through the 2029 season with a club option in '30. Edman, who had been signed through 2025 with a two-year, $16.5 million deal from the Cardinals, will receive a $17 million signing bonus. Over the last couple months of the 2024 season, Edman quickly inserted himself as an integral part of the Dodgers’ World Series team. Edman’s versatility proved beneficial, slotting in at center field and shortstop when needed. Dodgers, UTIL Tommy Edman reportedly agree to five-year extension with a sixth-year club option, per multiple reports including https://t.co/Z3s2EpgF39's @juanctoribio. pic.twitter.com/466nyPr5FC Offensively, Edman also surpassed expectations. With some mechanical changes, the switch-hitter posted an .829 OPS with six home runs and six stolen bases in the first 29 games with Los Angeles. That only got better in the postseason, where he hit .328 with two homers and five stolen bases. Edman had a 1.022 OPS in the National League Championship Series against the Mets, earning him Most Valuable Player honors in the NLCS. After winning a World Series, the Dodgers are now committed to put together a core group of players that can help them continue their success. The Dodgers wasted no time this offseason, landing top free-agent target Blake Snell to a five-year, $182 million deal on Monday and now extending Edman to a long-term deal. With Mookie Betts and Gavin Lux in the infield, Edman will likely see the majority of his time in center field next season. Of course, if the Dodgers have some injuries, Edman is more than capable of sliding in as the everyday shortstop, which turned out to be the case down the stretch last season. The Dodgers have leaned on utilitymen in the past, as Chris Taylor and Kiké Hernández were both key pieces of the roster for multiple seasons. But with Taylor on the last year of his current contract and Hernández a free agent, the Dodgers were able to lock up their newest utilityman on Friday."
MLB News,The two skills that make Adames a top free-agent target,https://www.mlb.com/news/willy-adames-power-and-defense-make-him-a-top-free-agent,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 01:38:02 GMT",,"David Adler Willy Adames is the MLB version of a 3-and-D player in the NBA. That's a good thing. It's what makes Adames the most valuable shortstop in the 2024-25 free agent class. The 29-year-old is a homer-and-glove star. Adames has an important two-pronged skill set -- he belts home runs in the middle of the order, and he's a strong fielder at shortstop. It's the same principle that makes 3-and-D players so valuable in basketball: They hit the most valuable shots, three-pointers, and they provide high-level defense on the other end. Adames provides the most valuable kind of hits, home runs, and plays a high-level shortstop, a premier defensive position. Every MLB team needs players like that. That's why you shouldn't worry that Adames is only around a .250 career hitter. Adames' power/defense profile is what made him a key cog on multiple Brewers playoff teams during his Milwaukee tenure, and it's what's going to generate the demand for him this winter. Adames' emergence as a home run-and-defense player began with his first full season with the Brewers in 2022, and has continued through 2024. He's established a track record. Over these last three seasons, Adames has hit 87 home runs, and he has a +20 Fielding Run Value -- that's Statcast's overall measure of how many runs he's prevented with his fielding. He's been one of the top shortstops in the Majors in both categories. It's not just that Adames stands out among shortstops, though. He's in the top tier of power-and-glove players in the big leagues, regardless of position. Let's take a look at Adames' combination of those two tools, using Statcast's flagship metric for each: Barrels for power, and Outs Above Average for glove. At the plate, Adames has 154 barrels over the last three seasons. Barrels are balls hit with both ideal exit velocity and ideal launch angle, the type of contact most likely to be a home run, or at least an extra-base hit. Adames is one of only 22 hitters with at least 150 barrels since 2022, and he has out-barreled a lot of MLB's superstar sluggers over that time. In the field, Adames has been worth +26 Outs Above Average over the last three seasons. OAA measures how many outs an infielder or outfielder saves for his defense, based on the difficulty of all the plays he converts (or misses). Adames is one of only 25 fielders with at least +25 Outs Above Average since 2022, a group that includes plenty of Gold Glovers. And when you combine those two sides of Adames' game, the list of players who can match him is short. Players with 150+ barrels and 25+ OAA since 2022 Julio Rodríguez is close, with 147 barrels and a +28 OAA. Bobby Witt Jr. could have been there (he has 178 barrels and a +18 OAA), if he hadn't struggled so badly in the field as a rookie in 2022. But with those criteria, it's Adames, Lindor and Walker, and that's it. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Even if you lower the thresholds -- let's say, a minimum of 100 barrels and +10 Outs Above Average -- the group is still small. And it's still a select group of the best power-glove players. There are 17 players in that 100 barrel/+10 OAA group over the last three seasons. Here's how they break down by position. First basemen Second basemen Third basemen Shortstops Outfielders All of those players are worth having on your team. They're worth having in the lineup, and they're worth having in the field. But only two are free agents -- Adames and Walker. And those two aren't just free agents, they're two of the top free-agent position players, because of the specific phases of the game where they excel. The team that signs Adames is going to get homers, and it's going to get solid up-the-middle infield defense. Adames is a specialist in his two key areas. And he's the type of specialist plenty of teams will want."
MLB News,5 Black Friday blockbuster trades that need to happen,https://www.mlb.com/news/proposing-blockbuster-black-friday-trades-2024,"Fri, 29 Nov 2024 01:26:38 GMT",,"Anthony Castrovince This is not a time for small helpings, folks. If you’re like me and went for that second, third or fourth(?) plate loaded with turkey and stuffing (no vegetables, that’s gross), then surely you can join me in appreciating an unhealthy helping of fake trade ideas. Every year on this day, I dream up blockbuster deals. Which means every year on this day, I am flooded with e-mails and social media reactions about how moronic I am. That’s the cost of dreaming big, and it’s one I’m willing to pay (thank you, mute button). What follows are not small swap proposals. These are bigger barters involving Major Leaguers going both ways. Because that’s where the fun is. So let’s once again fake a deal! (All prospect rankings come from MLB Pipeline.) 1) From north of the border to the North SideCubs get: 1B Vladimir Guerrero Jr., RHP Kevin GausmanBlue Jays get: 1B Michael Busch, OF Cody Bellinger, RHP Cade Horton (Cubs’ No. 3 prospect), RHP Jaxon Wiggins (Cubs’ No. 10 prospect), cash After the Blue Jays missed out on Shohei Ohtani last winter and had yet another disappointing season, your guess is as good as mine what happens next. Do they actually get Juan Soto to take their Canadian dollars? And if not, do they get Guerrero to sign an extension? Or do they do both? Or do they do neither? Guerrero is essentially the same age as Soto and might be every bit as keen on testing the open market next winter, especially after unlocking his potential in the second half of 2024. My job here is to trade people, so let’s just assume for a moment that Toronto’s best course of action is to make the most of Guerrero’s value before he possibly bolts. This trade sends him to a Cubs club that lacks star power and offensive thump in the middle of the order and will have the ability to retain him long-term. Manager Craig Counsell said late last season that the Cubs “should be trying to build 90-win teams here,” and Guerrero helps them do exactly that. In this trade, Chicago would also net Gausman, who is coming off a down year but is an All-Star-caliber arm who had a 2.90 ERA from July through the end of the season and is under contract for another two years. The Blue Jays get back two immediate lineup pieces and a top pitching prospect with the potential to reach the bigs in 2025. Busch was one of the few positives from a frustrating 2024 (118 OPS+ and 2.8 bWAR after coming over from the Dodgers). The Blue Jays would enjoy his positional flexibility (he’s played first, second, third and left field in the big leagues) and long-term contractual control (he’s not arbitration eligible until after 2026). Taking on Bellinger’s $27.5 million salary while sending Guerrero’s arbitration cost to Chicago is essentially a wash, though I think the Cubs would have to fork over some of that Bellinger money in this particular deal. The Jays also get Horton, the No. 42 prospect in all of MLB and seventh overall pick in the 2022 Draft. His 2024 was cut short by a lat strain, but he could be knocking on the door after dominating at the Double-A level early this year. Wiggins pads out the package for Toronto as a high-upside arm whose command issues eventually lead to the bullpen. 2) Knitting together a Crochet tradeRed Sox get: LHP Garrett CrochetWhite Sox get: 1B Triston Casas, OF Braden Montgomery (Boston’s No. 5 prospect), SS Yoeilin Cespedes (No. 7), RHP David Sandlin (No. 10) There’s just something so satisfying about Sox swaps. And though a trade between a contender and a rebuilder is typically built entirely around prospects, Casas is young (24) enough and far enough away from free agency (eligible after 2028), while still having displayed verifiable big league ability, that he would make sense as a centerpiece of Chicago’s trade return for their ace Crochet. Casas missed much of last season with a rib cartilage tear, but he’s shown 40-homer potential, and the Sox could sure use that (among other things). This trade also nets them three of Boston’s top 10 prospects (including Montgomery, who ranks No. 54 overall on MLB Pipeline’s Top 100) to amplify a system in need and a Cespedes for the rest of us (no relation to that other Cespedes who once played for the Red Sox). As for the Red Sox, with Crochet they fill an obvious need for an ace while protecting their absolute best prospects, and they can find a shorter-term solution at first base before eventually shifting star Rafael Devers there in the not-too-distant future. It was just eight years ago that the Red Sox acquired a hard-throwing lanky lefty from the White Sox for a package of prospects around this time of year. And two years later, Chris Sale helped Boston win a World Series. Could history repeat itself? 3) Nayl’d it!D-backs get: 1B Josh NaylorGuardians get: LHP Jordan Montgomery, 3B Gino Groover (D-backs’ No. 9 prospect), cash Naylor, an All-Star in 2024 who cranked out 31 homers and 27 doubles, is a free agent at season’s end and might not fit Cleveland’s long-term plans now that Kyle Manzardo is up. Montgomery, a very good pitcher coming off a very bad year, will also be a free agent post-2025 after picking up the $22.5 million player option on a contract that D-backs owner Ken Kendrick called “horrible.” The awkwardness in Arizona could be an opportunity for a club to buy low on Montgomery, and, as we’ve seen time and again, Cleveland is as good a landing spot as any for a pitcher looking to maximize his talents. So in this trade, the D-backs get a replacement for Christian Walker, who might leave in free agency. They eat some of that Montgomery contract, throw in a prospect (I picked Groover only because that’s too awesome a name to not include in this column) and -- boom -- the awkwardness is over!

So let’s talk trade, because the White Sox are certainly open to that. Robert is coming off a blah 2024 (87 OPS+, 1.4 bWAR) but in his defense, he was out with a hip issue for a good chunk of it and, ultimately, he was a member of the 2024 White Sox. That could bring anybody down. He’s still a high-impact talent in his prime years (entering his age-27 season). And he’s got pop, which the Yankees could use … all the more if they don’t re-sign Soto. Robert is guaranteed $15 million in 2025, with separate $20 million team options for 2026 and 2027. If Soto’s gone, this trade allows Judge to return to right, and the Yankees are in the market for a left fielder (Alex Verdugo again?). If Soto returns, maybe he goes to left (though I don’t love that in Yankee Stadium)? Maybe Judge goes to first base? Look, I’m not here to answer every question, I’m just trying to solve the obvious issue of having your soon-to-be-33-year-old, 6-foot-7, 282-pound MVP beating himself up in center field. The Sox give up a star to bring in “The Martian,” who technically meets my “big league requirement in these deals by having seen time in the Majors in both 2023 and ’24."" The Domínguez Hype Machine took a bit of a hit after he sustained an elbow injury that required Tommy John surgery in 2023, then had an unremarkable (and very brief) 18-game sample with the Yanks last season. That New York opted to play the struggling Verdugo over him in October perhaps says a lot. But for the White Sox, who probably aren’t going to be very good in the time remaining on the Robert contract, the toolsy talent is absolutely a worthwhile long-term gamble. Frankly, it’s hard to know if Domínguez is enough for Robert or if Robert is enough for Domínguez. Because of the longer-term control of The Martian, in this trade I’m also sending the Yankees a long-term pitching piece in Eder, who debuted last season and could potentially help in the rotation or bullpen in 2025. But as with all of these trades, I’m focused primarily on the centerpieces. 5) Dealing the Cards (a three-team Bohm-nanza!)Phillies get: 3B Nolan Arenado and RHP Ryan Helsley (from Cardinals), RHP Emerson Hancock (from Mariners), cashMariners get: 3B Alec Bohm (from Phillies)Cardinals get: OF Justin Crawford (Phillies’ No. 3 prospect), RHP Mick Abel (Phillies’ No. 6 prospect), OF Lazaro Montes (Mariners’ No. 3 prospect) As the Cardinals try to get younger, the Phillies try to get over that last hump separating them from a World Series trophy and the Mariners try to bounce back from last season’s letdown, all three could all serve one another's needs. Bohm reached All-Star status in 2024 but slumped down the stretch and was even benched for a game in the playoffs. The Phillies have reportedly indicated an openness to moving him. If they did, they would be an interesting home for Arenado, who would certainly fit right in with their cast of 30-something stars. But more important, his right-handed pull tendencies would play up at the Bank. Philly might be the perfect place for him to enjoy a resurgence. Maybe there’s an Arenado deal to be made that sends the 28-year-old Bohm to St. Louis, but the Cards might be more intent on getting middle-infield prospect Thomas Saggese to the bigs sooner than later, which would allow Nolan Gorman to move to his natural position at third. That’s why I’m roping in a third team in the Mariners, who need to lock in an everyday option at the hot corner and would benefit from Bohm’s reasonable contractual control for the next two years while dealing from an area of strength in shipping Hancock -- a 25-year-old starter who is blocked in Seattle’s elite rotation -- to Philly. The complicating factor in this or any Arenado deal is the big contract that pays him another $74 million total through 2027 (with $10 million of that paid by the Rockies, as if this isn’t all confusing enough). That’s why I’m “tacking on” the not-so-small factor that is one season of control of Helsley, the reigning NL Relief Pitcher of the Year. From the Phillies’ perspective, that’s a pretty good get in exchange for absorbing -- some(?), most(?), all(?) -- of the Arenado money. Ultimately, how much the Cardinals eat would affect the quality of their prospect return. Perhaps (likely) what I’ve proposed falls short for all parties. But I happen to think we have the seeds of something here. So I’ll let the esteemed execs involved round out the finer details. My work is done."
MLB News,Reasons to believe in 5 free agents who underperformed in '24,https://www.mlb.com/news/2024-2025-mlb-free-agents-rebound-candidates,"Fri, 29 Nov 2024 01:26:20 GMT",,"Thomas Harrigan While many free agents absolutely aced their walk years in 2024, others were not so fortunate. For every player who boosted their market value with a standout season, there were those whose struggles or injuries dampened their stock. MLB offseason signings and trades• Latest free-agent and trade rumors• Top 25 free agents | Every free agent, by position• Tracking every team's offseason moves• FA guides: Soto | Burnes | Alonso | Bregman | Fried | Santander• Offseason dates, rules & terms explained Though not ideal for the player’s bottom line, a poor platform season can present an opportunity for a savvy team to uncover a hidden gem in free agency and reap the rewards of a rebound. With this in mind, here are five free agents who offer intriguing upside despite underperforming in 2024. Walker Buehler, SP What happened in 2024: After missing part of 2022 and all of 2023 while recovering from his second Tommy John surgery, Buehler returned in May and went on to post a 5.38 ERA over 16 starts, spending time on the IL with right hip inflammation along the way. He finished with a 19.4% whiff rate, a 24.5% chase rate, an 18.6% strikeout rate and an 8.1% walk rate, all of which were considerably worse than his marks in 2021, his last healthy season. Reasons for optimism: Buehler’s track record is perhaps the biggest reason teams will be willing to overlook his 2024 struggles as they pursue him in free agency. Simply put, there aren’t many pitchers available who have been as good as Buehler was at his best. But we don’t have to look all the way back to 2021 to find something positive to say about the 30-year-old, who boosted his stock with a strong performance under the bright lights of October. Buehler threw 10 straight scoreless innings with 13 K's over his final three postseason games, including a perfect frame to close out the Dodgers’ World Series title. Although it wasn’t a large sample, the righty made some encouraging strides with his arsenal in the playoffs, adding more “rise” to his four-seamer, sharpening up his knuckle-curve and showing glimpses of a nasty sweeper, as MLB.com’s David Adler recently detailed. Max Kepler, RF What happened in 2024: Kepler battled injuries and finished the season with just eight homers and a .682 OPS (91 OPS+) over 105 games, as his barrel rate (6.2%) and hard-hit rate (36.8%) both plummeted from his career-high marks in 2023 (12.2% barrel rate, 47.9% hard-hit rate). Reasons for optimism: If Kepler hit the free-agent market last offseason, he would have been one of the top corner outfielders available. Now, he might be flying under the radar in a market that features Juan Soto, Anthony Santander, Teoscar Hernández, Tyler O’Neill and Jurickson Profar. The 31-year-old Kepler is a plus defender in right field, leading the position by a wide margin in Outs Above Average (+27) over the past four years. He also has six seasons on his résumé with at least 17 homers, including 24 dingers as recently as 2023, when he ranked in the 89th percentile in expected SLG (.503). J.D. Martinez, DH What happened in 2024: Martinez had an uneven season with the Mets after lingering on the free-agent market until late March and spending several weeks ramping up against Minor League pitching. The veteran DH ended up with just 16 homers and a .406 slugging percentage, his lowest in a non-shortened season since 2013 (.378). Reasons for optimism: Martinez may be 37, but he isn’t far removed from ranking among baseball’s most productive power bats. He finished 2023 with 33 homers over 113 games for the Dodgers, notching the eighth-highest slugging percentage (.572) among hitters with at least 450 plate appearances. While Martinez certainly showed signs of decline in 2024, his underlying metrics suggest he still has some pop left in his bat. The right-handed slugger ended 2024 with a 14.9% barrel rate, a 39.3% sweet-spot rate and a .472 expected SLG, placing in the 87th percentile or higher in all three metrics. Martinez was also on track for a much better season before going into a dreadful slump (6-for-59, 0 HR) over his final 17 games. He had a .785 OPS over 103 games prior to that season-ending cold spell. Jorge Polanco, 2B What happened in 2024: Looking to address their long-standing woes at second base, the Mariners swung an offseason trade with the Twins for Polanco. However, the veteran sharply regressed, hitting just .213 with a .651 OPS over 118 games while striking out in 29.2% of his plate appearances (a career worst). Seattle declined his $12 million club option at the end of the year, making him a free agent. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Reasons for optimism: Polanco rediscovered his power stroke in the second half of the season, more closely resembling the player who produced 89 homers with a .796 OPS (117 OPS+) over 544 games for the Twins from 2019-23. The second baseman went deep 11 times and had a .203 ISO over his final 55 games. Further improvement could be on the horizon as Polanco moves on from pitcher-friendly T-Mobile Park in Seattle, where he slashed .193/.284/.322 with a 31.9% K-rate in 2024. Gleyber Torres, 2B What happened in 2024: Torres experienced a curious decline in his age-27 season, producing just 15 homers with a .709 OPS -- barely north of league average (101 OPS+) -- over 154 games. The second baseman’s hard-hit rate dropped nearly five points to 35.4%, and his strikeout rate climbed back over 20% after tumbling to a career-best 14.6% in 2023. Reasons for optimism: Torres has never returned to the lofty heights of his breakout 2019 season, when he swatted 38 homers with an .871 OPS (128 OPS+), but he was one of the most powerful players at his position across 2022-23. He went deep 49 times in that span, ranking second among primary second basemen. Although he had a disappointing 2024 season on the whole, Torres excelled after moving to the leadoff spot in mid-August, slashing .294/.375/.439 with a 40.4% hard-hit rate, a 15.8% strikeout rate and an 11.9% walk rate over his final 53 games (postseason included). One of the youngest free agents on the market, Torres is a good bet to improve in 2025."
MLB News,The wild story of Bo Jackson leaving an Auburn dive team speechless,https://www.mlb.com/news/bo-jackson-dove-with-auburn-diving-team,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 02:59:00 GMT",The wild story of Bo Jackson leaving an Auburn dive team speechless,"Matt Monagan A version of this story originally ran in June 2021 and is revisited today for his birthday. Bo Jackson could seemingly do it all. He was a star at Alabama's McAdory High School -- hitting a mythical 20 homers in 25 games one year, while averaging 11 yards per carry on the football field. At Auburn, he was called the ""best pure athlete in America"" -- winning the Heisman Trophy as a senior, hitting .401 with 17 homers as a junior and qualifying for the 100-meter dash during both his freshman and sophomore seasons. He went on to become an All-Star in MLB and All-Pro in the NFL. His Nike commercials had fun with his multi-sport talents, showing him ready to play polo, golf, basketball and any number of sports that he came into contact with. But could he really excel at any of those other pursuits without much experience? Sports you wouldn't expect a 6-foot-1, 220-pound muscle-bound athlete to be able to pull off? Sports like, say, diving? ""Oh yeah, the story that you're talking about is essentially true,"" former Auburn dive coach Rick Theobald told me over the phone. ""All the divers who were there at the time, they still talk about it whenever we have a reunion."" It was the Fall of 1989, at least as far as Theobald recalls, and 26-year-old Bo Jackson was back at Auburn filming his aforementioned ""Bo Knows"" Nike ads. He was throwing down dunks in the auxiliary gym for the basketball version of the segment, and, during a break, he saw a place down the hall that his two toddler sons might enjoy: the university pool. The Tigers' diving team was holding a practice, and Bo poked his head in to ask if his kids could swim at the other end. As Theobald told me, you don't really say no to somebody like Bo Jackson, so the kids went down to the shallow part of the pool, followed by their dad. After some time watching the divers, Bo asked if he could try it out. Bo wanted to dive. The entire team, including Coach Theobald, were excited that Bo wanted to try out their sport. ""Everyone going to Auburn at that time was always waiting to see the next miracle that Bo was gonna pull off,"" Theobald said. So, the answer again, was yes. Bo left the pool area, pulled on some shorts and walked back in toward the 1 meter board. He was, of course, much bigger than most divers -- especially back in the 1980s. ""He was probably about 220 and the amount of muscle on him -- it was a ridiculous amount for one person,"" Theobald recalled. ""... When I was coaching Auburn, the largest guy I had was a guy named Mike Smith. He was 5-foot-10, 5-foot-11 and probably weighed about 170 pounds. A solid rock stomp of muscle. The NCAA champion Jose Roach was about 150 pounds and he was 5-foot-7 or 5-foot-8. The other guys in the pool who I think were there probably weighed about 130?"" Bo had about 100 pounds on the average diver. As Auburn's most famous alum walked out to the edge of the board, the divers were eager to see him, but honestly, not expecting too much. I mean, had Bo ever tried this before? A giant professional football and baseball player ... diving? ""Let's just say there was a healthy dose of skepticism floating around the pool,"" Theobald said. Bo proceeded to the end of the plank and, as Theobald recalled, jumped into the air about a foot higher than most divers would -- maybe 3 1/2 or four feet. A ""ginormous hurdle."" It was a bit out of control. But when he came back down on the board to execute his dive, he had settled his body. Then came a sight Theobald had never seen before in his decades of coaching at a competitive level. ""I was the most shocked I'd ever been by watching a non-diver,"" Theobald told me. ""He hit the end of the board and bent it all the way downward where the tip of the board went in the water. Probably six inches. He was in the water up to his ankles."" Bo shot back out of the pool and flew up into the air, doing a 2 1/2 tuck. Two full front flips! And he landed in a dive! Basically this, but from a bouncing board lower to the water. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. ""My jaw must've hit the floor,"" Theobald said. ""And all the divers, all the kids that were there, clapping and saying. 'Oh my god!' They were all just as shocked and impressed as I was."" Any thought that this would be a silly, entertaining moment dissipated quickly. ""The element of funny went right out the window,"" Theobald told me. ""The awe went right up to the roof."" One story (actually, the only story that talks about this ever happening) mentions Bo then going up to the 3 meter board and doing the same thing. Theobald only remembered this one dive but said he did ask Bo if he wanted to get up and try it from a greater height. Bo said something like, ""No, man, I'm not crazy."" ""I think when you do that good the first time, I think Bo knows the moment,"" Theobald said. ""He stepped away and went back to the other end of the pool and started playing with his kids again."" That's it. That's the story of Royals All-Star outfielder Bo Jackson taking a break from dunking basketballs -- for a commercial about him being able to play every sport -- and then casually pulling off a double-front flip at an NCAA Division I collegiate dive practice. Theobald guessed it probably wasn't the first time Bo had ever tried out diving, but he had never seen him around the pool during his time in school as a player or coach. Either way, one thing was now officially clear: Bo knew diving."
MLB News,Soto isn't the only elite FA the Blue Jays are reportedly pursuing,https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-rumors-trades-and-signings,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 16:17:00 GMT",LATEST FREE AGENT & TRADE RUMORS,"MLB.com We're keeping track of all the latest free agent and trade rumors. The Blue Jays are reportedly one of five teams that have made an offer to superstar free agent Juan Soto, but they clearly aren’t putting all of their eggs in the Soto basket this offseason. With Toronto seen as a “dark horse, at best,” in the Soto sweepstakes, SportsNet’s Ben Nicholson-Smith reports that the club is showing interest in third baseman Alex Bregman, outfielder Anthony Santander, left-hander Max Fried and right-hander Luis Severino. This is a pivotal offseason for the Blue Jays, who are coming off a disappointing 2024 campaign. While Toronto moved a number of players at the Trade Deadline, the club opted to hold onto most of its top trade candidates with an eye on contending in 2025 -- the final year Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette are under club control. However, the team is likely going to need an influx of talent to do so after posting the fourth-worst record (74-88) in the American League last season. Blue Jays president Mark Shapiro said in early October that he was expecting the team’s 2025 payroll to be similar to what it was in 2024, when Toronto had an estimated Opening Day payroll of $225 million (per Cot’s Baseball Contracts). Including projected salaries for arbitration-eligible players, Cot’s puts Toronto’s current payroll at roughly $184 million, which could leave the team with around $41 million to spend. According to Nicholson-Smith, the Blue Jays could stretch beyond their budget “for a special or unique opportunity” such as Soto. Losing Blake Snell is tough for the Giants, but losing him to the Dodgers? That has to sting L.A.'s longtime rival. San Francisco now has a massive void to fill in its rotation. There are a handful of high-quality starting pitchers left on the free-agent market, and the Giants might look toward the very top of it to find their Snell replacement. According to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, the Giants ""are believed to have significant interest"" in Corbin Burnes. More > The Yankees increased their initial offer to Juan Soto in recent days, per a report from MLB Network insider Jon Heyman -- but they've also checked in on some other top free agents. Heyman wrote for the New York Post that the Yanks have also touched base with Corbin Burnes and Max Fried, though the club has not yet extended an offer to either player. More > The Red Sox are one of the five teams that have made a contract offer to Juan Soto, a source told MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi. No one knows the value of that offer, but it shouldn't be taken lightly as it seems like Boston means business in its pursuit of the offseason's No. 1 free agent. Writing in the New York Post on Tuesday, Mark W. Sanchez and MLB Network insider Jon Heyman said the Red Sox ""are increasingly seen as a legitimate contender in the sweepstakes for the generational slugger as word is they are stepping up efforts to lure the superstar hitter away from their historic AL East nemesis."" The Red Sox are also continuing their search for a frontline starter. Per a report from the Boston Globe (subscription required), the Red Sox are looking to add one even if they can seal the deal with Soto. According to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, the Red Sox were in on Blake Snell before he reached a five-year deal (per sources) with the Dodgers on Tuesday. Boston is believed to be seeking a left-handed starter, so it could turn its focus to Max Fried now that Snell is off the market. The Red Sox are also a team to watch in the trade market for White Sox lefty Garrett Crochet. More > The Yankees and Red Sox are two of the top contenders in the Juan Soto sweepstakes, but might the two storied rivals also find themselves embroiled in a bidding war for another big-name free agent? MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand hears that the Yankees and Red Sox are both looking for a left-handed starter and were interested in Blake Snell before he reached a five-year, $182 million deal with the Dodgers (per sources) on Tuesday. Feinsand suggests that New York and Boston could now zero in on Max Fried, the top remaining southpaw on the free-agent market. However, there's a lot of competition for Fried, especially now that Snell is off the board. Three of the Yankees' AL East rivals -- the Red Sox, Orioles and Blue Jays -- have also been connected to Fried, but they are far from the only teams looking for starters. The Dodgers have been considered the favorite by many to sign Sasaki once he is posted for MLB clubs. Even with Blake Snell joining the Dodgers (per sources), L.A.'s interest in the 23-year-old Japanese right-hander seemingly hasn't waned. During his Wednesday chat on Bleacher Report, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman indicated that the Dodgers remain involved for Sasaki. Yet there is one other team that has ""a true shot"" of signing him, according to Heyman: the Padres. More > Few contenders have a greater need for a top starting pitcher than the Orioles, who are at risk of losing Corbin Burnes to free agency. O’s general manager Mike Elias made it clear at the beginning of the offseason that the team’s new ownership group was enabling him to explore the market for frontline arms, though Burnes may wind up being out of the club’s price range. The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required) reported on Nov. 21 that the Orioles appeared “more focused” on other options than they were on bringing back Burnes. However, one of their reported targets, Blake Snell, is now off the market after reaching a five-year, $182 million deal (per sources) with the Dodgers on Tuesday. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. While it’s possible Baltimore will pivot to the next best southpaw on the free-agent market, Max Fried, the club is also in the mix for some lower-cost alternatives. MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi reports that Baltimore is interested in free agent Nathan Eovaldi, who is a tier below Fried but has performed like a frontline starter in the postseason and can likely be had on a shorter-term deal as he heads into his age-35 season. MLB Trade Rumors projects Eovaldi for a two-year, $44 million contract. Right-hander Jack Flaherty, who won the World Series with the Dodgers this year, could be another possible avenue for Baltimore. The Orioles could face competition for Eovaldi from Fried’s former team, the Braves. MLB.com’s Mark Bowman reported on Nov. 5 that the Braves had Eovaldi near the top of their offseason wish list, and Morosi hears that Atlanta still has interest in him. If the Orioles strike out in free agency, they could also look to the trade market to fill their need for an ace, with White Sox lefty Garrett Crochet a potential option. In the opinion of one National League executive who spoke to MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand, the Orioles are ""the team to watch on [Crochet], for sure."" Jack Flaherty was born and raised in Southern California. He grew up a Dodgers fan. He said during the team's 2024 World Series championship parade that he never wants to leave Los Angeles. But after the Dodgers agreed to a five-year deal with Blake Snell on Tuesday night, per source, is re-signing Flaherty no longer an option for the reigning champs? MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi said Wednesday that the Snell move ""probably"" means Flaherty ""won't be back"" with the club in 2025. More > According to a report from The Athletic's Katie Woo (subscription required), the Cardinals have been exploring the potential trade market for third baseman Nolan Arenado over the past few weeks. Multiple teams have expressed interest thus far, and while talks haven’t yielded any substantive progress, there’s a “growing sense throughout the industry” that the 33-year-old will eventually be dealt. Discussions are likely to intensify as the Winter Meetings approach. Per Woo, Arenado is even open to playing more at first base to create roster flexibility for a potential new team, though it’s believed he would only be willing to waive his full no-trade clause to join a club set up to contend for multiple seasons. Arenado is coming off a down season with the bat (16 homers, 101 OPS+), but he was still worth 3.1 WAR (per FanGraphs) thanks in part to his plus defense at the hot corner. Arenado could be an attractive alternative to the top third-base options on the free-agent market -- Alex Bregman and Willy Adames, both of whom are expected to command a nine-figure deal and are tied to Draft compensation after declining a qualifying offer. Arenado has three years and $74 million left on his contract, but $10 million of that will be paid by the Rockies. Blake Snell is the first elite free agent to come off the board this offseason. The two-time Cy Young Award winner has agreed to a five-year, $182 million deal with the World Series champion Dodgers, a source told MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. Feinsand also reported that the Yankees, Red Sox and Orioles were in on Snell before he agreed to join the Dodgers. The left-hander had also been linked to the Blue Jays and the Giants, for whom he pitched this past season. The good news for those teams? There are still a good number of impactful starting pitchers still available. That list is topped by Corbin Burnes and Max Fried, with many of the aforementioned clubs also interested in those two hurlers. Snell's addition may hint that the Dodgers are moving on from Jack Flaherty, but MLB Network insider Jon Morosi recently identified teams such as the Yankees, Padres and Angels as other possible landing spots for the 2024 world champion. Granted, Morosi's report came before the Angels reportedly came to terms on a three-year deal with lefty Yusei Kikuchi. A couple of Japanese pitchers -- 35-year-old Tomoyuki Sugano and 23-year-old Roki Sasaki -- are on many teams' radars. The Dodgers have long been considered one of the favorites to get Sasaki, although he isn't expected to sign with an MLB club until Jan. 15, when the 2025 international signing period begins. There are also trade possibilities out there for teams looking to upgrade their rotation. The most talked about candidate is White Sox left-hander Garrett Crochet, who has been linked to a bunch of clubs, including the Phillies, Dodgers, Orioles and Red Sox. To this point, Juan Soto's free agency has been about meeting with teams and hearing their general pitches -- but that has changed according to MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi, who reports that five teams have submitted contract offers to the 26-year-old superstar. Those teams are the Dodgers, Mets, Yankees and Blue Jays as well as the Red Sox, who are reportedly ""stepping up efforts"" to sign Soto. That is obviously a significant step in the process, especially since MLB.com's Mark Feinsand has said that ""the feeling around the industry"" is that Soto's decision could be made before the annual Winter Meetings get underway on Dec. 9 in Dallas. On Tuesday, Sean McAdam of MassLive.com also reported that there is a ""very good"" chance Soto's decision comes before the Meetings begin. More > The Phillies are among the teams interested in acquiring White Sox ace Garrett Crochet, and Alec Bohm could be one of the players heading to Chicago if a deal is struck, according to USA Today's Bob Nightengale. If the Phillies trade Bohm and create a void at third base, Nightengale adds that Philadelphia ""is expected to make a strong play"" for Alex Bregman or Willy Adames. Bregman has also drawn interest from the Tigers and Red Sox. Adames has spent his entire seven-year Major League career at shortstop and hasn't played third base since 2013, his first year as a pro. However, he is reportedly open to moving to the hot corner ""for the right deal and the right team,"" according to MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi. Morosi said Tuesday that the Astros are also interested in Adames as a third baseman. Houston would have a clear need at the position if it can't re-sign Bregman. Adames, who received some down-ballot MVP votes this year, has been a plus defender at shortstop over each of the past three seasons, judging by outs above average. His talent on both sides of the ball and apparent willingness to accommodate a team by moving to third base has created ""broad"" interest in the 29-year-old, per Morosi. The Angels have been the most aggressive club in free agency this offseason and kept it up with their first big splash, agreeing to terms with lefty Yusei Kikuchi early Monday on a three-year, $63 million deal, a source told MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. Here is a breakdown of this move from all angles, via MLB.com experts. More > The Phillies and White Sox have discussed potential trade packages for left-handed ace Garrett Crochet that include Phillies All-Star third baseman Alec Bohm and highly touted outfield prospect Justin Crawford, per a report from USA Today's Bob Nightengale. More > The Braves could look to add an outfielder in free agency after non-tendering Ramón Laureano last week, Ken Rosenthal reports for The Athletic (subscription required). According to Rosenthal, the Braves would prefer a left-handed hitting outfielder, because their only current lefty bats are Michael Harris II, Jarred Kelenic, Matt Olson and switch-hitter Ozzie Albies. But they would also be willing to pursue a right-handed hitter. Even though Atlanta's outfield depth is currently thin, Rosenthal writes that the Braves don't necessarily need to go after one of the top-of-the-market outfielders -- Juan Soto, Anthony Santander, Teoscar Hernández and Jurickson Profar -- because Ronald Acuña Jr. is expected to return from his torn ACL a month or two into the 2025 season. The next tier of left-handed-hitting free-agent outfielders that the Braves could pursue includes Michael Conforto, Ben Gamel, Jason Heyward, Travis Jankowski, Max Kepler, David Peralta, Mike Tauchman, Alex Verdugo and Jesse Winker. Right-handed-hitting free-agent outfielders include Mark Canha, Randal Grichuk, Austin Hays, Connor Joe, Manuel Margot, Andrew McCutchen, Tyler O'Neill, Tommy Pham and Michael A. Taylor. The veteran first basemen on the free-agent market could be in demand among teams looking for a more affordable option than Pete Alonso or Christian Walker. The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal reports (subscription required) that the Pirates, Mariners, D-backs and Tigers all could be looking to upgrade at first base, but not for the price tag that Alonso and Walker will likely command. The Nationals could also join that list, although they still might pursue Alonso or Walker. Rosenthal believes that means there could be plenty of demand for first basemen like Paul Goldschmidt, Carlos Santana, Anthony Rizzo, Josh Bell and Justin Turner. The Tigers are interested in free-agent third baseman Alex Bregman, according to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman in an article for the New York Post. Heyman adds that the only club Bregman has played for in the Major Leagues, the Astros, have submitted a contract offer in an effort to re-sign the two-time All-Star, and that the Red Sox have ""inquired and could be a fit for Bregman if they move Rafael Devers to first."" If Bregman was to sign with Detroit, it would reunite him with his former manager in Houston, A.J. Hinch. Hinch was the manager when Bregman and the Astros won the franchise's first World Series title in 2017. With Garrett Crochet headlining the list of potential trade candidates this offseason, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reports in the New York Post that four clubs -- the Orioles, Red Sox, Dodgers and Phillies -- are showing the most interest in acquiring the White Sox left-hander. More > Dodgers right-hander Walker Buehler threw the final pitch of this season at Yankee Stadium, closing out Game 5 of the World Series in the Bronx. Might Yankee Stadium also be where Buehler throws his first pitch in 2025? MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi has been told that there is ""some mutual interest"" between Buehler and the Yankees, who are looking to augment their starting rotation this offseason. More > The Royals and Reds completed a trade Friday headlined by former college teammates, right-handed pitcher Brady Singer and second baseman Jonathan India, heading in opposite directions. The Reds bolster their rotation with Singer, who pitched to a 3.71 ERA over a career-high 179 2/3 innings this season. India, the 2021 National League Rookie of the Year, addresses one of Kansas City's top priorities for this offseason: adding more offense. The Royals also received 25-year-old outfielder Joey Wiemer, who hasn't hit much in his limited time in the big leagues but did record eight outs above average while playing for the Brewers in 2023. The Red Sox are definitely one of the teams vying for Juan Soto. However, will this year's No. 1 free agent actually end up with Boston? MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi said Friday that he will be ""surprised"" if that happens. If Soto does sign elsewhere, the Red Sox will have to pivot to some of the other big bats on the market, and Morosi considers Boston to be one of the top candidates to sign Teoscar Hernández. More > Roki Sasaki isn't the only marquee Japanese pitcher who is expected to make the jump to the Majors this offseason. The 35-year-old Tomoyuki Sugano doesn't possess Sasaki's top-notch velocity, but as a two-time winner of the Sawamura Award -- the Japanese equivalent to the Cy Young Award -- Sugano should have his fair share of suitors. MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi has identified two of them this week: the Angels and the Giants. More > Although outfielder/first baseman Cody Bellinger exercised his player option for 2025, it’s not a guarantee that he’ll be with the Cubs on Opening Day. According to The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal (subscription required), rival executives say that the Cubs want to trade the 29-year-old. More > MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said Wednesday that Sasaki is expected to be part of the 2025 international amateur signing class, which means the Japanese right-hander likely won't sign with a club before Jan. 15. ""It looks like ... the signing will happen in the new pool period,"" Manfred said via The Athletic's Evan Drelich. More > Thirteen players were tendered a qualifying offer (a one-year, $21.05 million deal for 2025) this offseason, but Reds right-hander Nick Martinez was the only one who accepted prior to Tuesday's 4 p.m. ET deadline. The following 12 players rejected the qualifying offer and will remain free agents: Since the system was implemented in 2012, only 14 players to receive a QO have accepted it.

MLB News,Snell agrees to 5-year deal with Dodgers,https://www.mlb.com/news/blake-snell-dodgers-deal,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 22:03:00 GMT",,"Juan Toribio LOS ANGELES -- The Dodgers’ priority this winter was to add an ace to their starting rotation. They got their man on Tuesday. Blake Snell, a two-time Cy Young Award winner and one of the top free-agent pitchers on the market this offseason, has agreed to a five-year, $182 million deal with the World Series champions, the club formally announced Saturday. A post shared by Blake Snell (@snellzilla4) Before Snell signed a two-year, $62 million deal with the Giants with an opt-out clause in March, the Dodgers were one of the teams to make a last-minute effort to acquire the star left-hander. Los Angeles checked in on Snell again before the Trade Deadline as San Francisco fell out of postseason contention. Since then, the Dodgers identified Snell as their top target this winter. The two sides engaged in discussions once free agency opened this month. The deal features a hefty $52 million signing bonus and includes deferred money, something that has become more common throughout the game, especially with the Dodgers. By joining Los Angeles, Snell is reunited with president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman, who was the executive vice president of baseball operations for the Rays when the lefty was drafted in the first round by Tampa Bay in 2011. Snell joins a starting rotation that will feature Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Tyler Glasnow and Shohei Ohtani. The Dodgers look to add another starter this winter, with Japanese phenom Roki Sasaki among the many targets. It’s a starting rotation that is expected to be much improved from last season. Since the 2018 season, not many pitchers have been more dominant at times than Snell. The left-hander reached free agency for the first time a year ago after posting an MLB-leading 2.25 ERA with 234 strikeouts over 180 innings as a member of the Padres in 2023. He was recognized as the National League’s top arm, earning his second career Cy Young Award and becoming just the seventh pitcher in Major League history to win the award in both leagues. He also won with the Rays in 2018. Snell’s 11.2 career strikeouts per nine innings is the highest in MLB history. After signing well into March and feeling rushed to start the season, Snell struggled at the start of 2024. Without a regular Spring Training buildup, Snell posted a 9.51 ERA over his first six starts and made two trips to the injured list. But once he got a proper buildup following his second IL stint, Snell continued to dominate on the mound. He put together a remarkable stretch with a 1.23 ERA and 114 strikeouts, 30 walks and a .123 batting average in 80 1/3 innings over his final 14 starts. His season peaked on Aug. 2, when he struck out 11 in a no-hitter against the Reds that was also the first complete game of his career. Perhaps most importantly for Los Angeles, Snell has proven that his stuff plays in October. Snell’s most famous postseason start came against the Dodgers in Game 6 of the 2020 World Series when he was pulled after 5 1/3 dominant innings. The Dodgers rallied for a 3-1 victory once Snell came out of the game en route to their first title since 1988. Now, with Snell in the mix, the Dodgers put themselves in position to become the first repeat World Series champions in more than two decades."
MLB News,"Bregman, pasteles among topics at Espada's Thanksgiving dinner",https://www.mlb.com/news/joe-espada-thanksgiving-traditions-alex-bregman,"Fri, 29 Nov 2024 16:14:32 GMT",,"Brian McTaggart This story was excerpted from Brian McTaggart’s Astros Beat newsletter.

HOUSTON -- The favorite meals and desserts typically associated with Thanksgiving and some traditional dishes from Puerto Rico help make for a memorable holiday season each year for Astros manager Joe Espada. The blending of food, music and traditions while spending time with his family give him plenty of reasons to be thankful. This year, Espada along with his wife, Pam, and daughters -- 13-year-old Eliana and 9-year-old Viviana -- made the long drive from their Houston area home to Dallas, where they spent Thanksgiving with Espada’s parents -- his mother Miriam and father Dolores. Joe’s sister, Rebecca, lives in Dallas and helps care for their parents. Espada said the family typically alternates holidays each year, spending Thanksgiving with his family one year and Christmas with his wife’s family the next. They switch it up the following year. “It means a lot, because my parents are getting older and it’s hard for them to travel,” Espada said. “We make time to drive up and see them and the grandkids come and spend some time with them. We make the effort, so we can spend time with them.” Any time Espada can spend with his parents is special these days, especially at the holidays. His father hasn’t been in the best of health the last few years. His parents were at Minute Maid Park last March to see him manage the first game of his career when the Astros took on the Yankees, which was the most memorable moment of his managerial debut. Thankful for you, Astros fans! 🧡Happy #Thanksgiving pic.twitter.com/i4VjPk62xg Miriam and Dolores raised three kids in Puerto Rico, where Thanksgiving is celebrated. Espada’s wife is from Florida, so when both sides of the family get together, it’s a mixture of culture and influences. “We keep some of the Puerto Rican traditions, obviously, when it comes to the food,” Joe said. “We have some of the American-style plates. Pam will do a sweet potato casserole, a green bean casserole, which my family really enjoys. We also have your typical Puerto Rico meals for Thanksgiving, so it’s a combination of both. It’s very typical. There’s a lot of people, there’s a lot of music, we have a good time during this time.” One of the most popular holiday dishes in Puerto Rico is pasteles, which is similar to tamales, but has ingredients wrapped in plantains instead of corn husks. “It’s like a plantain mash and we put meat in it and olives and stuff like that,” Joe said. “We’ll have a ton of desserts, you name it -- cheesecakes and we usually have tres leches. We’ll have leftovers, of course. We’ll be eating this for the next three or four days after Thanksgiving. It’s fun. We start decorating some Christmas stuff during these days. We all do it together.” In addition to food and music, football is on the television. The adults gather to watch the Dallas Cowboys play their traditional Thanksgiving home game, while the children are in front of another television watching the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Of course, baseball remains a big talking point over Thanksgiving dinner, as well. Baseball’s hot stove is just starting to heat up, and Joe can’t escape members of his family peppering him with questions about the Astros. Of course, the future of free-agent third baseman Alex Bregman is at the top of everyone’s mind, even over turkey and dressing. “It’s hard not to talk baseball with my dad,” Joe said. “He wants to know the same questions I get asked from the fans. He wants to know, ‘Are we signing Breggy? Are we getting any starting pitching?’ It’s baseball [talk] for the first day and after that things kind of settle down.” Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Baseball has always been at the heart of the family. Dolores had a hip replacement at a young age and couldn’t work, so Miriam worked long hours while Dolores took Joe to his practices in Puerto Rico. As a young kid, Joe watched baseball at home with his father, who was a fan of the Yankees, Mets and Braves. Espada’s parents put family first, and being with them for Thanksgiving is a reminder for Joe how much that has meant to him. “It’s important for me to take time and make time,” he said."
MLB News,Artwork commemorating Jeter's greatest moments unveiled at Art Miami,https://www.mlb.com/news/derek-jeter-art-collection-unveiled-at-art-miami,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 22:28:43 GMT",,"Christina De Nicola MIAMI -- “The Swing” and “The Jump” are synonymous with Hall of Famer Derek Jeter, and now they’ve been immortalized in a collection of artworks titled JETER. Jeter and artist Russell Young hand-selected and reimagined the two images into 12 large-scale paintings -- six of each portrait -- to go along with a variety of works hand-signed by Jeter and created in Young’s signature style of screen printing finished with “Diamond Dust.” First featured on Oct. 24 at Taglialatella Galleries in New York, the collection will be displayed from Dec. 3-8 at Art Miami. A portion of the proceeds generated from the artworks will be donated to Jeter’s Turn 2 Foundation and to the Perry J. Cohen Foundation. “When we look at the overall sports world, all the great legends and champions have dabbled in the art world a little bit with their image being utilized, but not everyone has had their image commemorated with a real artist, so to speak,” said Nick Korniloff, the executive vice president and director of Art Miami. “These works are unique in the sense that each one is an individual piece of art that has their own color on distinction hand touched by the artist, signed by the athlete, Derek, and also the artist, and they're also authenticated by MLB.” Earlier this year, MLB wanted to pursue the project but didn't know which artist to choose. It was the relationship between Daniel Crosby and MLB front office members, executives and staffers that put the idea in motion. Crosby got into the sport art and collectible memorabilia market in Los Angeles in the mid-1990s, even opening galleries in both the Dodgers’ and Angels’ ballparks. So late this spring, Crosby invited them to Young’s exhibit. “‘You want it to become art and not fan prints, right?’” Young recalled his manager Crosby telling MLB. “‘You want to elevate it into the art world. This elevates it into being art.’” Young began his career as a photographer and visual artist before directing music videos and photographing musicians like Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan and George Michael. He then applied his skills to silkscreen printing on paper, canvas and linen, harnessing the “Diamond Dust” technique originally invented by Andy Warhol in the 1980s, and becoming a household name in pop art. MLB was convinced, but Crosby died over the summer from a massive heart attack and the project nearly fell apart. His tragic passing motivated the group to see it through. A day after returning from his honeymoon, Young flew to New York to meet Jeter and gifted him a similar piece of art he had done of legendary soccer player Pelé. Though Young is from Northern England and Jeter grew up in Kalamazoo, Mich., they bonded over their humble beginnings and love of their three children. Young’s move across the pond overlapped with the Yankees’ Jeter-led dynasty that birthed five World Series championships. As fate would have it, Young experienced the 2000 Subway Series’ postgame celebrations because of his friendships with actor Mark Consuelos and then-Yankees third-base coach Willie Randolph. Over the course of an hour, Young and Jeter settled on the two images for the collection: His home run swing from Game 4 of the 2000 World Series and his signature jump throw. “We were both laser sharp on the images we wanted to do, and he trusted me, trusted me 100 percent,” Young said. “He wasn't second-guessing me or anything.” A post shared by TAG NYC (@taglialatellagalleries) After that meeting, Young and Brian Swarts from Taglialatella collaborated on the names for the custom-mixed colors, incorporating Jeter’s background with titles like “Kalamazoo Blue” and “November Blue.” Upwards of nine people assisted Young in the studio for the process of hand pulling the “Diamond Dust” while crawling across the floor. He calls it no different from what people do with T-shirts but on a bigger scale. Young would return to New York three times for a month’s worth of work before the art was finished. Then last month, the collection debuted. The response was palpable. “What's great is, you see people's eyes, and you watch them look at the work,” Young said. “It only takes one person like that for it all to be worth it. Just their eyes light up. They can't believe what they're seeing, and then people come up with stories: ‘Oh, my dad took me when … Oh, I went here … I was at that game.’ It was a really nice connection.” Even more baseball and art lovers will get a chance to see the collection at Art Miami, which is the leading international contemporary and modern art fair showcasing artworks of the 20th and 21st centuries in collaboration with a selection of the world's most-respected galleries. Anywhere from 70,000-80,000 people travel from across the globe to attend. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. “To recognize Derek for his achievements on and off the field, I think he's widely recognized nationally for his talents as a professional baseball player, now a broadcaster, but also all the good work he does for charity through his foundation with kids,” Korniloff said. “That's something we always will support at the Art Fair level. We're a very community-based organization. Derek's a resident of South Florida, which even makes it more important to highlight someone who's in the community raising his family out and about. “Miami has a wonderful way of embracing those who come to live and be a part of our community. So that's super important to us being the hometown fair that we would not only embrace an important project from a well-respected artist but our gallery partner with Major League Baseball, and then highlight both the Turn 2 Foundation and the Perry J. Cohen Foundation.”"
MLB News,1 reason for every team to be thankful,https://www.mlb.com/news/reasons-for-every-mlb-team-to-give-thanks,"Thu, 28 Nov 2024 02:20:45 GMT",,"Will Leitch Happy Thanksgiving, everyone. In the words of a great bird I once met, “Gobble, gobble.” Thanksgiving is not a holiday traditionally associated with baseball, but if you’re reading a baseball site on Thanksgiving Day, you know that in a just world, every holiday is one associated with baseball. So, today, on Turkey Day, we provide you with an old Thanksgiving staple: We give you something for every team’s fanbase to be thankful for. Even if the season didn’t go how you wanted it to, there’s still something you feel lucky to have. Here’s one thing for everyone to give thanks for. Enjoy the yams. AL EAST Blue Jays Last year was an absolute mess, and the sort of year that often leads to a reckoning. But if you are a Jays fan, you have been able to follow players such as Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette from their time as highly touted prospects through their maturation as big league stars. Both are scheduled to reach free agency next offseason, but rather than starting a rebuild, the Blue Jays are keeping the band together to make one last run at the playoffs. Orioles The playoffs have been frustrating the last two years, but this is still a team that’s the envy of baseball. Baltimore is packed with young talent, backed by a fanbase desperate to win, and has clear opportunities to upgrade in its first offseason under new ownership. It was a very rough decade for the Orioles faithful. These are now the good times. There are even better times coming. Rays First off, everyone’s grateful that the Rays are going to have a place to play in 2025, in a stadium that should actually prove a pretty terrific environment for the next year. This is a team with its usual share of young talent, and this could be the year Junior Caminero firmly establishes himself as the next big thing. Red Sox There are all sorts of signs that the Red Sox might be ready to spend big this offseason, and that’s coming off a year that was a lot more successful than many people thought it was going to be. The Red Sox have idled for a while now, but there’s a foundation of talent here, with the opportunity to grow, and a fanbase that is ready to, at last, get moving. Yankees Hey, you finally made that World Series you’d been waiting 15 years for. Sure, it didn’t end with a 28th championship, which means it’s somewhat disappointing. But the Yankees still have Aaron Judge and the money to bring back Juan Soto … if they can make it happen. And again, even though you didn’t win it, no one should be shaking their head at a World Series appearance. AL CENTRAL Guardians The Guardians have reached the playoffs six of the last nine seasons and won their division five times during that time. That is, essentially, the second-best stretch in franchise history, behind only those 1990s teams. There has been some playoff frustration, but these are in many ways the best of times for Guardians fans. Royals Royals fans get to watch Bobby Witt Jr. every day, which is pretty much the best possible gift, all told, especially when you consider that they’re locked into doing so for the next decade. He made his first playoff appearance this year. It won’t be his last. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Tigers That glorious September run didn’t just electrify the fanbase -- it served as a proof of concept for everything this franchise has been trying to do for a decade now. They look primed to add this offseason, and maybe make this the AL Central juggernaut moving forward. It’s a very good time in Detroit sports right now! Twins This year was disappointing, but this is still as stalwart of a franchise as this division has, with stars like Carlos Correa and Byron Buxton that would be the envy of any team. The question, as always, is health. And we should always try to be thankful for whatever health we have, every Thanksgiving. White Sox A trying 2024 is almost over. That’s something to be thankful for, and they also have a highly regarded new manager to help them turn the page. AL WEST Angels The Angels have already made some moves this offseason, making it clear that they’re not slinking away after some rough seasons. They’ve got more young talent than you might think, and you may have vague memories of a Mike Trout fellow who will be back for Opening Day. Astros Their incredible ALCS streak finally ended, but they proved in 2024, after a rough start, that they aren’t going anywhere. The Astros have been the team of the AL over the last decade, and there’s no reason to think that won’t remain the case for at least one more year. Athletics After an emotional goodbye to Oakland, the A’s will start a new adventure in Sacramento, and they’re hardly doing so with a bare cupboard: Who would have thought we’d have a second coming of the Bash Brothers with Brent Rooker and Lawrence Butler? Mariners That starting rotation, combined with Julio Rodríguez, gives them a high floor. One of these years, it’s all going to come together perfectly -- maybe it’s this one. Rangers The title defense was a bit of a dud, but a healthy Corey Seager (and a healthy Jacob deGrom?) would get them right back in the mix in 2025. And all that 2023 World Series champions merchandise you bought still looks pretty, doesn’t it? NL EAST Braves Just about everything other than Chris Sale went wrong for the Braves in 2024 … and they still made the playoffs. They’ll get just about everybody back for 2025, and their luck should improve. Thus, they may well be the NL favorites again. Marlins Every single member of the Marlins rotation and everyday lineup is currently under 30 years old. That sort of youth movement has sometimes worked out quite excellently for the Marlins in the past. Mets The Mets gave their fans the ride of a lifetime this October, and remember, they actually did it a year earlier than anyone expected. Now that we’ve seen where this team seems to be going, Mets fans have a whole offseason to watch their owner and front office add to it. This could get exciting. Nationals The last time we saw all this young talent in one place in a Nationals uniform, they were about to start a run of postseason appearances that would culminate with the 2019 World Series title. Phillies The recent run of frustrating postseason exits shouldn’t distract from the fact that the Phillies have a core that’s probably better than anyone else’s in baseball … a core they may well add to this offseason. Sure, they’re getting older. But hey, aren’t we all. NL CENTRAL Brewers Remember when everyone wrote off the Brewers because they lost their manager and their ace heading into the 2024 season? Well, they ended up sprinting away with the division anyway. Pat Murphy stepped in for Craig Counsell to win the NL Manager of the Year Award, and the team made its sixth postseason appearance in seven years. Cardinals The Cardinals look to be taking a step back this year, but it may just look that way, as they focus on young players such as Jordan Walker, Nolan Gorman and Masyn Winn. That should give them, and Cardinals fans, a concrete answer as to what the future of this franchise is really going to look like. Cubs The Cubs haven’t lived up to expectations the last couple of years, but they’re hardly shrinking from those expectations moving forward. This is still going to be a team worth coming out to see at glorious Wrigley Field anytime you have the opportunity to do so. Pirates Paul Skenes is reason enough to be thankful, of course, but don’t forget Jared Jones and Mitch Keller. If the Pirates are ever able to sneak in the playoffs -- and they just might in 2025 -- that’s a triumvirate no one will want to deal with. Reds Elly De La Cruz finished in the top five of NL MVP voting, and it still feels like he’s only scratching the surface of what he’s capable of accomplishing. And with Terry Francona now in charge, the Reds clearly have an arrow pointing up. NL WEST Diamondbacks The Diamondbacks reached the World Series in 2023 and were still probably a better team in 2024. Ketel Marte has officially reached full-on star status; Corbin Carroll may well be next. Dodgers They just won the World Series. Better yet, both the team and the fans got to enjoy the full-on celebration that the pandemic made impossible in 2020. Giants After years of frustration, the Giants have a True Giant in charge of baseball operations now, with Buster Posey providing much-needed direction for the whole enterprise. The Giants are doing everything they can to bring back those good old days. Padres Last year may in fact have been the best Padres team ever, one that came this close to beating those blasted Dodgers. The ascension of Jackson Merrill has elevated this whole franchise to a brand new level. Rockies The Rockies are always looking for someone to build around, and Ezequiel Tovar is sure starting to look like that guy, as a 23-year-old Gold Glove Award-winning shortstop."
MLB News,How a career in professional baseball saved this Minor League manager,https://www.mlb.com/news/athletics-milb-manager-conklin-saved-by-baseball,"Thu, 07 Nov 2024 15:00:00 GMT",,"Benjamin Hill Benjamin Hill travels the nation collecting stories about what makes Minor League Baseball unique. This excerpt from his newsletter -- which he reported on from Lansing, Mich., on Aug. 27 -- is one of those stories. Read the full newsletter here, and subscribe to his newsletter here. By the time Craig Conklin got his first job coaching in the Minors, he had already survived a volatile childhood, a period living out of his car, drug addiction, a stint in the military and the death of his adult daughter. Through it all, he knew what kept him going. “There are two things that saved my life,” Conklin said. “Baseball and surfing.” It was late in the 2024 season, the tarp was on the field, and the 62-year-old skipper of the Lansing Lugnuts – High-A affiliate of the Athletics -- was in his office telling the story of his long and winding career. Over the course of a 20-minute conversation, the words soundtracked by the muffled pulsation of the reggaeton and hip-hop songs his young charges were blaring in the clubhouse, Conklin shared his lifestory. Undergirding it all was the deeply ingrained tenaciousness that has been his life’s guiding force. “There are thousands of guys out there who can run a drill, hit fungoes, throw BP,” he said. “But there aren’t a lot who have experienced what I have in life, so that was a valuable tool to add to those other things. … People skills. Being able to sense people's emotions and read their body language, just how they can't carry themselves. Have them feel comfortable enough to come talk to me about something. My door is always open.” Conklin has refined those skills over the course of 25 years working for the Oakland organization, but his story begins on the beaches of Malibu. “I grew up in a family that was broken, and I was the blonde hair, blue eyes kid who lived at the beach,” he said. “My dad was involved in a lot of different things that weren’t conducive to the raising of a kid. So he dropped me off at the beach in the summers, and I’d hang out there all day while he went to work in Compton.” Throughout a childhood in which narcotics and criminality were a regular presence, Conklin found solace where he could. His love of baseball took root when he played catch with his grandfather for the first time. “If I was at the beach, or on a baseball field, the world couldn’t hurt. They’re sanctuaries. … I needed to be in those environments to feel safe and protected, so I did whatever I had to do to stay in.” But finding a way wasn’t easy. After getting cut from the Cuesta College juco team two years in a row, Conklin moved to San Diego -- “Where the best baseball in California’s at” -- in hopes of getting noticed there. He lived out of his car, was always low on money and eventually returned home. “I ended up talking my way into a tryout with the junior college team that had cut me two years in a row. … Two weeks later I’m starting in left field and then it got to the point where I could have signed as a free agent.” But Conklin never played baseball professionally. After finding out that his girlfriend was pregnant, he decided that “running off to go play baseball at that particular time wasn’t the prudent thing to do.” He joined the Army instead, serving in Kentucky with the 101st Airborne. When, three years later, his dad became terminally ill, he received an honorable hardship discharge and returned to California. “I was in limbo. I didn’t really know what I was doing. I got in trouble with drugs, three stints in rehab and different things like that,” he said. “Because that’s what I knew. That’s the environment we lived in. I didn’t have baseball to save me anymore. I only had surfing.” Conklin, needing the game back in his life, returned to Cuesta College in a coaching capacity while supplementing his income with all manner of odd jobs. He started to take notice of the scouts who hung around the field, thinking, “Maybe I could do that.” It was tough to get much information from members of this cloistered fraternity, but a scout whom Conklin knew from his playing days told him that Major League Baseball had a scout development program. He enrolled, and eventually landed a position with the (now defunct) Major League Scouting Bureau. “I was finishing concrete with a buddy of mine, told him ‘I gotta make a phone call about a job.’ He knew that I was trying to get into [scouting], goes ‘You know, guys like us don’t get jobs like that.’ I go, ‘Guys like you don’t get jobs like that. … If I don’t get a job this year, it’ll be next year, and if it isn’t next year, I’ll just keep going.” From 1999-2015 he worked for Major League Baseball as an area scout covering southern and central California. After the MLB Scouting Bureau disbanded, the Athletics hired him. “I always wanted to be in [player] development,” he said. “That was always the master plan. But I liked the freedom scouting gave me. I didn't miss any of my kid’s stuff in school. You’re a master of your own time as long as you were responsible and did your work.” Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. In October of 2017 Conklin endured a devastating loss. His daughter, Jordan, was killed in a car accident at the age of 28. “We were like this,” Conklin said, intertwining his middle and index finger. “Being on the road, as a scout, it can be pretty lonely. [After Jordan’s death] I didn’t need to be in my head like that.” Jordan’s death expedited Conklin’s transition from scouting to coaching, a decidedly less solitary pursuit. But there was never a doubt that he wanted to remain in the game. “I don’t subscribe to pouting or pity parties, no matter what happens to me,” he said. “My daughter passing away in the manner in which she did, surviving that and thriving through it, it’s an honor. Honoring her memory is very important to me. Whatever motivates someone to do the right thing, and I’ve always tried to do the right thing. Be empathetic. Compassionate.” These traits have guided Conklin in his coaching career, which began with the Triple-A Las Vegas Aviators and also included a season with the Single-A Stockton Ports. He arrived in Lansing in 2022, assuming the managerial role the following season. Conklin’s ultimate goal, as it is for most everyone, is to reach the Major Leagues. There’s no stopping now. “My upbringing caused me to get derailed and fall into selfishness. But once you rebound you come back to being who you are, if life hasn’t consumed you to a point of no return,” he said. “I was close to that, but that internal fire wouldn’t let me go down that road.”"
MLB News,Inbox: Jobe vs. Painter; prospects who could rise in 2025,https://www.mlb.com/news/pipeline-inbox-jackson-jobe-vs-andrew-painter,"Fri, 29 Nov 2024 20:01:12 GMT",,"Jim Callis I hope everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving. Let's dive into some questions to go with the leftovers ... More from MLB Pipeline:• Top 100 prospects | Stats | Video | Podcast | Complete coverage Hey Jim, what player or two outside of the Pipeline’s Top 100 has the upside and best chance to be ranked as a top ten Pipeline prospect a year from now would you say? Thanks! This actually happened in 2024, with Kristian Campbell going from not making our Top 100 Prospects or Red Sox Top 30 lists at the start of the year to ending it at No. 10. We don't see rises like that happen very often, but I'll play along. The two demographics that seemingly would provide the best candidates are international signees making their U.S. debuts, or players selected in the previous Draft (a la Campbell). Dominican shortstops Jesus Made (MIL No. 4) and Emil Morales (LAD No. 8) are two international players to watch. Made signed for $950,000 last January and batted .331/.458/.554 with six homers and 28 steals in 51 games in the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League. He has 25-25 upside, a strong arm and tools similar to Leodalis De Vries, who signed for $4.2 million with the Padres as part of the same 2024 international class and already has risen to No. 28 on the Top 100. Morales received a higher bonus ($1.9 million) and posted even louder numbers in the DSL, slashing .342/.478/.691 and leading the league in slugging, OPS (1.169), homers (14 in 46 games), extra-base hits (25) and total bases (105). He has a similar profile to Made with a little less quickness, meaning he's more likely to move to third base in the future. The prime 2024 Draft possibility is Rays outfielder Theo Gillen (TB No. 5), the best pure hitter in this year's prep class and the 18th overall selection. The Texas high school product could develop into a .300 hitter with 25 homers if he reaches his ceiling, and he's also a plus runner who should be an asset in center field. If -- and it’s a very big if -- Orioles outfielder Vance Honeycutt (BAL No. 3) can make consistent contact, he could rocket toward the top of the Top 100. The 22nd overall pick out of North Carolina, he had the best tools in the college crop (well above-average raw power, speed and center-field defense, plus arm strength) but also carried a 26 percent strikeout rate during his Tar Heels career and a 43 percent K rate during his brief pro debut. Who would you rather have on your team in 2025, Jackson Jobe or Andrew Painter? I saw Painter -- MLB's No. 32 prospect -- earlier this month in the Arizona Fall League, where he ranked as the top prospect. The Phillies right-hander's mid-90s fastball, upper-80s slider/cutter and low-80s curveball were all weapons. He also showed feel for his 90-mph changeup and threw strikes, though he did battle his fastball command a bit -- understandable considering that he missed all of the last two seasons while dealing with an elbow injury that required Tommy John surgery. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. All that said, I'd take Jobe (MLB No. 5) for 2025. The Tigers righty has a formidable fastball/slider/changeup repertoire of his own and usually fills the zone, though his control was erratic at times this season. I like Painter's stuff and command better for the long run, but Detroit should get significantly more innings out of Jobe than Philadelphia will from Painter. Though Jobe's career high is the 95 2/3 innings he tallied in 2024, when he lost seven weeks to a hamstring injury, he should be able to work 135 next season. The Phillies will have to be more careful with Painter, with 80-100 innings a realistic workload. They'll have to manage him judiciously in order to have him available for a high-leverage role as a starter or reliever in the postseason. I'm sure the Dodgers feel Dalton Rushing's bat is close to Major League ready, but how much work does he need defensively in left field to get the call? -- @jaredjmassey on Bluesky Rushing's bat does look like it's ready for the big leagues. MLB's No. 39 prospect tied for second among Minor League catchers with 26 homers in 2024 while slashing .271/.384/.512 between Double-A and Triple-A. The Dodgers had him regularly play the outfield in the last two months of the Minor League season, looking for a way to get him more at-bats when he serves as Will Smith's understudy in the Majors. Deceptively athletic and quicker than most catchers, Rushing could play an adequate left field right now. Smith made his second straight All-Star Game in 2024, but his defense slipped as he caught a career-high 121 games during the regular season and he looked exhausted during Los Angeles' World Series run. Los Angeles could cut Smith back to 100 games at catcher and give him another 20 starts at DH, while Rushing could catch 60 games, get 40 games in left field and DH occasionally. That would keep them both fresh behind the plate and Rushing can get the job done as a sporadic left fielder. For what it's worth, Teoscar Hernández was the worst defensive left fielder in baseball in 2024, so Rushing in left won't torpedo the Dodgers' defense. Thoughts on Tyler Black? Many had him as a 55 FV but Brewers don't seem super eager to find a place for him. Lack of defensive home where bat will play may be too much to overcome. -- @Badgermaniac on Bluesky Everything that Badger Maniac says is true. Black is an on-base machine with the potential to hit 15-20 homers and steal 25 bags per season. But he also has fringy arm strength and less savvy in the field than he does on the bases. The Brewers tried him at second base, third base, left field and center field before deploying him mainly at first base in 2024. A 2021 supplemental first-round pick from Wright State, Black (MIL No. 5) doesn't really fit the first-base profile. He got just six starts there for Milwaukee last summer and batted .204/.316/.245 in an 18-game trial. The Brewers don't have a clear-cut third baseman for next season, though Black's arm would be an issue. Black's offensive game is still appealing but he may need a trade to find regular big league at-bats. His best infield fit is second base, but Milwaukee is set there with Brice Turang and Black's glove is substandard there. He's 24 years old and at a crossroads in his career."

MLB News,Braves take flier on bullpen arm Gillispie,https://www.mlb.com/news/braves-agree-to-deal-with-connor-gillispie,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 03:52:04 GMT",,"Mark Bowman ATLANTA -- Connor Gillispie will come to Spring Training with a chance to fill one of the Braves’ bullpen voids. The Braves announced they signed Gillispie to a one-year, non-guaranteed contract on Friday night. The financial figures weren’t revealed. With this arrangement, the 27-year-old pitcher has been given a spot on Atlanta’s 40-man roster. But he will be owed just a portion of his contract if released before the end of Spring Training. Gillispie made his MLB debut on Aug. 4 against the Orioles, but he spent most of this season in Cleveland’s Minor League system. He allowed four hits and two earned runs in eight innings over three appearances before being sent back down. He posted a 4.05 ERA in 27 appearances (15 starts) for Triple-A Columbus this year. With Joe Jiménez expected to miss most or all of the 2025 season, closer Raisel Iglesias, Pierce Johnson, Aaron Bummer, Daysbel Hernandez, Grant Holmes and Dylan Lee are currently Atlanta’s only projected bullpen members. Gillispie's experience as a starter could make him a long relief candidate."

NEW YORK -- As more than 1,000 fans streamed through the Citi Field team store last week, donating a record 13,000-plus pounds of food to the Food Bank for New York City, Mets staffers tried to analyze what had gone so right. Were their marketing efforts working that well? Were people simply feeling extra charitable this year? Or had the Mets’ extended postseason run elevated their brand in the eyes of many, creating a closer relationship between the club and its fans? “I’m sure it was a combination of it being the holidays but also the team having finished on such a strong, high note,” said Jane Son, head of foundation and community engagement. “It’s great that, certainly from a foundation and community perspective, we’re benefiting from fan excitement of wanting to support the team -- and, as we head into the holidays, the community.” This year’s MetsGiving initiatives have been as ambitious as ever, beginning with the aforementioned food drive on Nov. 19. Later that week, the Mets received a surprise invitation to ring the Nasdaq opening bell, with former Mets captain John Franco doing the honors to spread MetsGiving awareness. Franco subsequently drove to the New York Common Pantry in Harlem, where he handed out turkeys to families in need. For the rest of that day, Mets employees fanned out around the five boroughs to donate 8,500 turkeys -- another record for an annual team initiative. Ding ding ding!John Franco rang the @NasdaqExchange opening bell along with Mr. and Mrs. Met this morning to celebrate MetsGiving! 🔔📈 pic.twitter.com/88Uwenpxht “We’re home here in Queens, but we also want to make sure we’re supporting others that need it in the other boroughs,” Son said. “We want the city to know we’re here for them.” It’s a charge that will continue for another month, with three more events scheduled: a public coat drive on Dec. 11, followed by the Amazin’ Mets Foundation’s Holiday Dinner for local families in need on Dec. 18, and the team’s annual Kids’ Holiday Party on Dec. 19. Another Mets alumnus, Todd Zeile, will play Santa Claus this year at the party. “We’re grateful that we’ve got alumni that are looking to give back to the community and be there with us to continue to support them,” Son said, “even though they’re no longer playing for the team.” The @Mets and @newyorkcares are teaming up for their annual Coat Drive, presented by your local @DriveToyota dealers.

In that fashion, the Mets hope their on-field success will continue to aid their philanthropic efforts off it. “Obviously, just always looking to give back to the community,” Son said. “The holidays are a tough time for a lot of people, more so this year. And I know every year, everybody says it. But we’re just really focused on helping the community during this time.”"
MLB News,This team just upped its offer to Soto (report),https://www.mlb.com/news/juan-soto-rumors,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 22:17:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of the latest news and rumors surrounding Juan Soto. Nov. 27: Yankees increase offer to Soto (report)The Soto sweepstakes appear to be entering the next round, with the Yankees upping their initial offer in recent days, per a report from MLB Network insider Jon Heyman. While Heyman wrote for the New York Post that the Yanks have also touched base with Corbin Burnes and Max Fried -- as well as some of the other top free agents -- he said New York has not yet extended an offer to either player. Instead, the Yankees' main focus for the time being remains on bringing back Soto. Though it's unclear exactly what New York's latest offer is -- or what the original numbers were -- the club has reportedly told Soto it is willing to include opt-outs in a potential contract. There will likely be other teams also willing to extend that luxury, with the Mets, Dodgers, Red Sox and Blue Jays remaining the most likely landing spots for Soto if he elects to leave the Bronx. Nov. 26: Soto's decision coming before the Winter Meetings?The 2024 Winter Meetings in Dallas begin on Dec. 9. An annual highlight on MLB's offseason calendar, there is usually a flurry of player movement during the four-day event. Some of the best free agents agree to their next contract during the Winter Meetings. But the best free agent this year might agree to his deal before the Meetings begin. A source told Sean McAdam of MassLive.com that there is a “very good” chance Soto selects his next team even before the start of the Winter Meetings. This jibes with what MLB.com's Mark Feinsand reported recently; he wrote that ""the feeling around the industry"" is Soto could make his decision before Dec. 9. Five teams have already made an offer to Soto, a source told MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi: the Mets, Red Sox, Dodgers, Yankees and Blue Jays. However, those are not believed to be final offers as Morosi clarified Tuesday. Morosi said he thinks there is a ""real possibility"" that a Soto signing comes in the early days of the Meetings. If it comes on that first day, it would be the same date (Dec. 9) that Shohei Ohtani made public his decision to sign with the Dodgers last year, although that came after the Meetings concluded. Nov. 26: Red Sox 'stepping up efforts' to sign Soto (report)The Red Sox are one of the five teams that have made a contract offer to Soto, a source told MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi. No one knows the value of that offer, but it shouldn't be taken lightly as Boston is reportedly ""stepping up efforts"" to land the offseason's No. 1 free agent. More > Nov. 26: Five teams submit offers to Soto (source)To this point, Soto's free agency has been about meeting with teams and hearing their general pitches -- but that has changed according to MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi, who reports that five teams have submitted contract offers to the 26-year-old superstar: the Red Sox, Dodgers, Mets, Yankees and Blue Jays. ESPN's Buster Olney reported over the weekend that contract offers were expected to begin rolling in this week. Juan Soto has offers from 5 teams, source confirms the report by @RandyJMiller. Boston Red SoxLos Angeles Dodgers New York MetsNew York YankeesToronto Blue Jays @MLBNetwork Nov. 20: Soto has 'good meeting' with YankeesThe Yankees met with Soto on Monday in California, and team owner Hal Steinbrenner confirmed Wednesday that it was a ""good meeting"" with ""very honest back-and-forth dialogue."" Steinbrenner said that Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, manager Aaron Boone, president Randy Levine, and special assistant to the GM Omar Minaya were all in attendance during Monday's meeting. But he didn't divulge any part of the team's pitch to Soto or say if any offers were made during the meeting. ""It's been a priority,"" Steinbrenner said about signing Soto. ""We wouldn't have gone out to the West Coast if it wasn't. ... We'll be in the mix. I'll leave it at that."" As of Wednesday, Soto has had in-person meetings with the Yankees, Mets, Red Sox and Blue Jays. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Tuesday that Soto will also meet with the Phillies at some point. Soto also plans to sit down with the Dodgers this week, according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Steinbrenner said he has ""no idea"" if the Yankees will meet with Soto again or if he's confident that the club can re-sign the 26-year-old superstar. But he added, ""[W]e've got the ability to sign any player we want to sign."" Nov. 19: Phillies plan to meet with Soto (report)Yet another team has emerged as a potential suitor for Soto: the Philadelphia Phillies. According to MLB Network insider Jon Heyman, the Phils plan to meet with Soto at some point, though nothing has been scheduled yet. Soto reportedly has already met with the Blue Jays, Red Sox, Mets and incumbent Yankees and is scheduled to meet with the Dodgers next. Per Heyman, it's believed that no offers have been made to Soto yet. The Phillies already have one of the most complete rosters of any MLB team, but they are looking for ways to improve after failing to advance past the National League Division Series in 2024. Phillies ownership has shown a willingness to pay up for some of the top free agents on the market, with Bryce Harper, Trea Turner, Zack Wheeler, J.T. Realmuto, Aaron Nola, Nick Castellanos and Kyle Schwarber all signing lucrative deals with Philadelphia in free agency. Phillies managing partner and CEO John Middleton was candid in addressing Soto's market earlier this month, saying that he believes the outfielder wants to be in New York but adding that Philadelphia could get involved in the bidding anyway as a ""stalking horse."" Nov. 18: Cohen to best any Soto offer by $50 million (report)Yankees broadcaster Michael Kay said on his radio program on Monday that according to a source, Mets owner Steve Cohen is willing to beat any other club's offer to Soto by $50 million. ""I'll put it this way,"" Kay said. ""And I don't think this is something Yankees fans are going to want to hear. I don't think the Yankees are going to go [up to $700 million]. I don't. And then I've heard from somebody in baseball today that Cohen is willing to go $50 million over whatever anybody offers. So it looks like the Mets really want to get this guy."" Nov. 18: Dodgers expected to meet with Soto this weekSoto's decision on where to sign this offseason is the most anticipated in baseball, and according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand, ""the feeling around the industry"" is that the decision could be made before the annual Winter Meetings get underway in Dallas on Dec. 9. Feinsand also writes that the Dodgers are expected to be the next team to meet with Soto, with plans to sit down with the superstar slugger sometime this week and perhaps as early as Tuesday. More > Nov. 18: Yanks meet with Soto (report)MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reports in an article for the New York Post that the Yankees met with superstar slugger Juan Soto in Southern California on Monday as they look to retain him after he helped lead them to the World Series. More > Nov 16: Blue Jays, Red Sox and Mets have met with Soto (reports)The Red Sox met with Soto and his representatives, including agent Scott Boras, in Southern California on Thursday night, according to a report from Sean McAdam of MassLive. It appears they aren't the only club that has chatted with the 26-year-old superstar. MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Saturday morning that the Blue Jays, along with Boston, have made ""impressive in-person presentations"" to Soto. Heyman later added another team to the list, reporting that the Mets met with Soto on Saturday. He noted that ""all early signs suggest the meeting went extremely well,"" and that owner Steve Cohen and other ""high-ranking Mets officials"" made the trip. The Red Sox's meeting with Soto, which was of an introductory and informative nature, per McAdam, lasted for three hours and was deemed as “productive,” though neither money nor terms were discussed between the parties. Soto was reportedly “impressed” by Boston’s presentation, which included a video noting the franchise’s history of star players from the Dominican Republic, Soto’s native country. The Red Sox also detailed their plans for the future, highlighting a promising group of prospects who could potentially team up with Soto to help the club be successful in the years to come. Heyman reports that Soto is scheduled to meet with a fourth team, the Yankees, on Monday in California."
MLB News,The Crawford Boxes didn't make Alex Bregman,https://www.mlb.com/news/alex-bregman-free-agent-home-road-splits,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 19:31:00 GMT",Third baseman has almost identical OPS on home and on road,"Mike Petriello Unlike Juan Soto, a generational hitter who is going to be productive no matter where he plays, Alex Bregman is the type of hitter who – according to popular opinion – would be massively affected if he left the short porches of what was until recently Minute Maid Park in Houston. It’s not hard to see why that feeling persists, either: You already know how this gag goes: We share something that seems true, and then tell you why it’s not true, so let’s just get the punchline out of the way. Over the course of his career, Bregman has no discernable home/road split whatsoever ... … and, like many players who don’t call Coors Field home, his annual splits have been wildly inconsistent over the years, fluctuating in one direction or the other. In some years, like in 2017 (that's right, 2017) and 2019, he’s hit better on the road. In some years, like in 2018 and 2022, he’s hit much better at home. In 2024, there was barely any difference at all. For the most part, it’s up-and-down. If there’s evidence that he’s a mere product of his home field in Houston, we’re not seeing it here. But: Why? How is it that a medium-powered hitter with a swing geared for a very friendly landing spot in his home park hasn’t actually been meaningfully better at home? We have two ideas. 1. First things first: Houston’s home field is not the right-handed home run haven you think it is. We’ve all seen it, of course. It’s a moderately-hit fly ball to left that’s a lazy fly ball in every other park, but just ever so barely sneaks over the wall in what will now be known as Daikin Park. It happened to Ronel Blanco just last summer, as one example of several. Bregman himself has benefited from it too, certainly, like in 2022 when he hit a ball not that hard (94.1 MPH) and not that far (341 feet) and ended up with a home run out of it anyway. It’s not that those things never happen. It’s just that they don’t happen nearly as often as you think, and if you were to look at Statcast park factors for right-handed hitters over the last three years, you’ll learn something interesting. Daikin Park has been almost exactly average park for righty batters, and only slightly above-average for homers, where it ranks tied for 11th. There's a whole lot of ""that's average, or close to it,"" so far as Houston park factors go. Why? We’ve been talking about this since at least 2018, that the park is better for pitchers than you think, and way back in 2005 the New York Times was on it about the park's neutrality. In 2023 the Athletic spoke to visiting hitters who claimed that the batter's eye wasn’t favorable for seeing the ball – and it’s worth noting the team did make changes to that backdrop both in Sept. 2023 and in Aug. 2024 in response. That can be seen somewhat in the fact that the hard-hit rate factor is near the bottom over the last three years – hard to hit it hard if you can’t see it well, we suppose – but if we’re talking about homers, then it might come down to the fact that since 2021, Houston batters have 419 homers at home, and 428 on the road. It’s essentially identical. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. So, the park isn't really what you think it is. Turns out, neither is Bregman. 2. While Bregman is a pull guy, he’s not only hitting cheapies either. Because Bregman isn’t of Aaron Judge-esque stature (he’s listed as 6 feet, 190 lbs.), and because he’s hardly a Giancarlo Stanton-like exit velocity god (he’s maxed out at only 109 MPH, and that happened only twice in his entire career), and because he is essentially a pull-only homer hitter (84% of his homers have been pulled, one of the highest rates on record since Statcast tracking began in 2015), it’s easy to think that the Crawford Boxes are responsible for creating his homers. Again: It’s not that it’s never happened. In May, MLB.com’s Theo DeRosa investigated those “stadium specials,” the kind of “out in just 1 of 30 parks” cheapie homers that you’re very familiar with in Yankee Stadium’s right field, among selected other places. It is true that Bregman was tied with DJ LeMahieu for the most of those types of homers, with 10, ahead of Aaron Judge and Jose Altuve. (Yes, there’s a home-field theme here.) It’s just that 10 out of 191 career homers over nine seasons is just really not very many. It’s one per season. It’s also not recent. There were 595 of those “out in only 1 of 30 parks” home runs in 2024, playoffs included, and Bregman didn’t hit a single one of them. (Gleyber Torres had the most, with three, all at Yankee Stadium, one coming off of Michael Wacha in the pivotal Game 5 of the ALDS.) Bregman hasn’t actually done this since June 2023, when he took Jacob Webb out for a grand slam, and he’s actually done it just four times in the last five seasons – once in 2021, once in 2022, and twice in 2023. So what’s happening here? It’s mostly that while he only hits moderate exit velocity homers to left field is true, those home runs he hits aren’t just created by the Crawford Boxes is also true. When he hits them that way, they stay hit. His first homer of the year certainly doesn’t look, visually, like anything Judge has hit, but it was also out in all 30 ballparks. When he took Simeon Woods-Richardson out of the yard in June, it was well past the Crawford Boxes, and would have been out in 29 of the 30 parks – everywhere but Baltimore. It’s that last part – a homer everywhere but Baltimore – that’s key here. It’s not that a moderately-powered hitter like Bregman can’t be affected by ballparks, because he can. It’s just that it’s probably less “he badly needs Houston to prop him up,” and more that “there’s a few specific ballparks where this profile would not work out well,” parks that eat up right-handed power due to dimensions or atmosphere, like in San Francisco, or Pittsburgh, or Miami, Baltimore (depending on how the again-changed left field plays), or Seattle, or St. Louis, – or Detroit, a popularly-suggested destination both due to the Tigers' need for offense and Bregman’s association with former Astros manager AJ Hinch. Maybe Soto, or Pete Alonso, can muscle the ball out of any park. Bregman likely can’t. Which means that the primary goal shouldn’t be “staying in Houston,” so much as it is avoiding the places listed above – or managing to get himself to stronger right-handed power parks, be they places unlikely to sign him (Colorado, Cincinnati, Los Angeles [Dodgers]), or teams that are more plausible landing spots (Phillies, Red Sox, Blue Jays). As Davy Andrews wrote recently, Fenway may be the most ideal home for this profile, as Bregman is the only player in history with at least 60 regular season plate appearances there and an OPS north of 1.200. If there is a concern here, it’s this: Bregman’s once-vaunted plate discipline wasn’t quite so disciplined last year. His usually-excellent walk rate declined in half, to a below-average 6%; his once-strong sprint speed, which had been in the 83rd percentile as a rookie, is down to a below-average 32nd percentile. It’s not that he’s not aging, and it’s not that there’s nothing at all to give you pause about what kind of future he has. But it’s probably going to be a lot more about the fact that he’s a ballplayer in his thirties than it is that he’s possibly no longer going to have the Crawford Boxes to take aim at."
MLB News,Judge's star-studded All-Star Gala only part of Yanks' charitable efforts,https://www.mlb.com/news/aaron-judge-s-all-rise-foundation-hosts-all-star-gala,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 15:42:56 GMT",,"Bryan Hoch This story was excerpted from Bryan Hoch’s Yankees Beat newsletter.

Aaron Judge was in his second season as a full-time big leaguer when he stayed up late one night with his mother, Patty, outlining their plans to give back to the community with a soon-to-be-formed charity that would bear the Yankees star’s name. In some ways, the founding of Judge’s ALL RISE Foundation in 2018 boasts a similar origin story to Derek Jeter’s Turn 2 Foundation, the blueprints of which were sketched out over a pizza dinner in a hotel room during the shortstop’s rookie season. That night, Jeter and his father, Charles, took their inspiration from a charity belonging to Dave Winfield -- and so it goes. Perhaps not coincidentally, Judge said that his father, Wayne, happened to be a big Winfield fan. “To whom much is given, much is required,” Judge said on Thursday, when his foundation hosted its third annual All-Star Gala at Cipriani Wall Street in New York. “Getting a chance to be in this position and be on this platform, I’ve seen so many guys before me -- Jeter, [CC] Sabathia, all those guys had foundations and they always gave back. “It didn’t matter how many All-Star Games, MVPs, Cy Youngs, whatever they had. They always tried to give back. I think it was those guys laying the foundation, and my parents laying the foundation.” A BIG thank you to all who supported us this week both in person at the gala or by joining the silent auction from afar. Sharing some quick highlights from the evening with special guests from @mlb and  @yankees.  Plus we enjoyed killer entertainment from @bas!@mmeventgroup pic.twitter.com/eCgNV1vEHc Nearly 500 guests attended Judge’s most recent event, including manager Aaron Boone, Hall of Fame manager Joe Torre, teammates Gerrit Cole, Nestor Cortes, DJ LeMahieu, Carlos Rodón and Anthony Volpe, plus former Yankees Harrison Bader, Isiah Kiner-Falefa, Corey Kluber, Mike Tauchman and Tyler Wade. Judge said that his foundation aims to inspire children and youth to become responsible citizens and encourage them to reach unlimited possibilities. “Both my parents were educators, so I got a chance to be around them, how they treated their students,” Judge said. “It didn’t matter if they were the A student, the best one in the class they didn’t have to worry about, or the D student just scraping by and trying his best to pass the class. They treated everyone with respect, everyone equally. It was pretty cool to see.” Aaron Judge had some friends show up to his All Rise Foundation gala tonight 👀 pic.twitter.com/0o3ZjwgpVO Grants issued by the foundation provide opportunities to selected non-profit organizations in California’s San Joaquin County and Fresno County, and the Bronx, as Judge aims to give back to the area where he grew up, where he attended college and where he currently patrols the outfield, respectively. With the Thanksgiving holiday ahead, the Yankees' organization also held events. The club teamed with Legends Hospitality and SCAN-Harbor (Supportive Children’s Advocacy Network) to host a feast for several hundred local residents on Friday at the Rev. T. Wendell Foster Park and Recreation Center, adjacent to Yankee Stadium.

MLB News,Are the Sasaki sweepstakes a two-team race?,https://www.mlb.com/news/roki-sasaki-rumors,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 22:01:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of the latest news and rumors surrounding Roki Sasaki. Nov. 27: Sasaki sweepstakes could come down to Dodgers, PadresThe Dodgers have been considered the favorite by many to sign Sasaki once he is posted for MLB clubs. Even with Blake Snell joining the Dodgers (per sources), L.A.'s interest in the 23-year-old Japanese right-hander seemingly hasn't waned. During his Wednesday chat on Bleacher Report, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman indicated that the Dodgers remain involved for Sasaki. Yet there is one other team that has ""a true shot"" of signing him, according to Heyman: the Padres. ""I think they are the one team beyond the Dodgers that really has a true shot at Sasaki,"" Heyman said of the Padres. ""While everybody is going for Sasaki, I think, very likely, he is going to end up with one of those two teams."" MLB.com's Mark Feinsand heard something similar earlier this month from executives around the league, who believe these NL West rivals are the top contenders for the fireballing phenom. Nov. 20: Sasaki not expected to sign with MLB team until Jan. 15MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said Wednesday that Sasaki is expected to be part of the 2025 international amateur signing class, which means the Japanese right-hander likely won't sign with a club before Jan. 15. ""It looks like ... the signing will happen in the new pool period,"" Manfred said on Wednesday. This was always the expected route for Sasaki, who is subject to MLB's international amateur signing bonus pool rules because he is younger than 25 years old and hasn't reached six years of service time. That means the value of his big league contract is limited to the money available in a team's bonus pool. The Dodgers, with about $2.5 million, have the most money of any team left in its bonus pool during the current 2024 international signing period. But if Sasaki waits until Jan. 15, when the 2025 international signing period begins, he could sign a contract in the neighborhood of $7 million. MLB.com's Jonathan Mayo provided the complete list of international bonus pools for the 2025 signing period here. Before Sasaki can sign with a team, he needs to be posted by his Nippon Professional Baseball club, the Chiba Lotte Marines. However, the team announced earlier this month that Sasaki will be posted this offseason. Nov. 14: Could this be the deciding factor in the Sasaki sweepstakes?The Dodgers are viewed as one of the top contenders to sign Sasaki once he is posted by his Nippon Professional Baseball team, the Chiba Lotte Marines. However, The Athletic's Jim Bowden (subscription required) doesn't see it that way. Based on his conversations with league sources, Bowden thinks it's ""unlikely"" Sasaki will sign with the Dodgers. And Bowden mentioned a few reasons why. The main one has to do with money. Since Sasaki is younger than 25 years old and hasn't reached six years of service in a foreign major league, he is subject to MLB's international amateur signing bonus pool rules. He won't get anything close to the $325 million contract that Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto received last offseason. Instead, Sasaki's contract value will be limited to what a team has in its bonus pool. That could be somewhere in the neighborhood of $7 million if Sasaki waits to sign until after Jan. 15, when each team's bonus pool will be refilled for the start of the 2025 international signing period. So, how can Sasaki make more money outside of his contract? Bowden says the answer is simple: endorsements. But therein lies the possible issue with a Sasaki-Dodgers match. ""In Los Angeles, [Sasaki would] be in the shadow of both [Shohei] Ohtani and Yamamoto, which would lessen his endorsement ceiling,"" Bowden wrote. Conversely, if Sasaki signs with a team such as the Padres, not only would he share a clubhouse with his idol, Yu Darvish, the 23-year-old ""could potentially maximize his endorsements in Japan, positioning himself as a rival to the Dodgers’ Ohtani and Yamamoto rather than a teammate of theirs."" Furthermore, a massive contingent of Japanese media cover the Dodgers on a daily basis, and, per Bowden, ""that level of attention is not the best situation for a young, developing pitcher."" The Dodgers are known for being fantastic with how they develop young pitchers. But Bowden points out that teams such as the Padres, Rays, Mets and Braves also have strong pitching development programs, thereby possibly negating any advantage L.A. might have there. ""Based on what I’m hearing,"" Bowden wrote, ""I think the Padres, Rays, Mets and Braves are all more likely to sign Sasaki than the Dodgers -- and several other teams will be in the mix."" Nov. 9: Sasaki to be posted by Chiba Lotte MarinesSasaki appears headed to the Majors next season. Sasaki, the consensus top young pitcher in Japan, will be posted by the Chiba Lotte Marines of the Nippon Professional Baseball, the team announced. Sasaki, 23, should inspire an all-out pursuit reminiscent of Shohei Ohtani’s initial contract with the Angels, in league-wide interest and financial scope. Ohtani agreed to a $2.315 million signing bonus with the Angels in December 2017. An unfettered market would have yielded a much larger contract, but foreign-born players are subject to international bonus pool money restrictions unless they are at least 25 years of age and have played as a professional in a foreign league recognized by Major League Baseball for a minimum of six seasons. Ohtani was not yet 25 years old when he was posted by the Nippon Ham Fighters, so the Collective Bargaining Agreement classified him as an international amateur. Sasaki falls into the same category now. More >"

LOS ANGELES – Since becoming a Dodger before the 2020 season, superstar Mookie Betts has made Los Angeles his home. This is where he’ll finish his playing career. Because of that, Betts has fully bought into the importance he has in the L.A. community. With Thanksgiving on the horizon, Betts hosted his third annual Grab and Go drive-thru event at Algin Sutton Recreation Center in South Los Angeles last week. Betts and his wife, Brianna, in conjunction with the Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation, Brotherhood Crusade and Betts’ 50/50 Foundation, distributed food, baskets, holiday toys and gift cards to over 750 families during the event. “This community was here to support me during that tough time in the [2023 postseason], so I think the most important thing is positive vibes,” Betts said at the event. “I think positive vibes go a long way, and we’re here doing that.” Mookie and his family, along with the @DodgersFdn, @BCrusade and the 5050 Foundation, hosted a Thanksgiving Grab and Go drive-thru at the Algin Sutton Recreation Center. They distributed turkeys, fixings and dessert in time for the holiday. pic.twitter.com/RIoaLoYN4j Betts’ event has quickly become one of the Dodgers’ best Thanksgiving initiatives. Hundreds of people lined up to receive the goods while Betts and his family and friends joined them with laughter, dancing and – as Betts said – positive vibes. “Thank you guys for standing in line. It means the world to me,” Betts said. “Any time I can come here and support you guys in whatever form, shape, or fashion, I’ll be here.” The 50/50 Foundation’s Thanksgiving Grab and Go event wasn’t the only one Dodgers players participated in leading up to the holiday. The Dodgers hosted their annual Thanksgiving turkey giveaway at Dodger Stadium last week, distributing about 2,000 meals to local families. The Dodgers worked with the Los Angeles Unified School District to identify households most in need, specifically those experiencing homelessness or extreme hardship. The meals consisted of one turkey and sides, which included cranberry sauce, boxed potatoes, stuffing, gravy and pies. Dodgers pitchers Anthony Banda, Landon Knack and Tony Gonsolin participated in the event, helping distribute the boxes of goods. “I think it’s amazing what we’re doing in giving back to the community. It fills my heart, really,” Banda said. “I was at one point there, where we needed help with the holidays. To be able to do this really warms my heart. It’s home for me, for real.”"
MLB News,"O's, Red Sox, Dodgers seen as contenders for Crochet",https://www.mlb.com/news/garrett-crochet-rumors,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 22:00:00 GMT",,"MLB.com MLB.com is keeping track of the latest news and trade rumors surrounding Garrett Crochet. Nov. 27: O's, Red Sox, Dodgers seen as contenders for CrochetSeveral teams have reportedly considered trading for White Sox ace Garrett Crochet. But a National League executive tells MLB.com's Mark Feinsand that one club is ""the team to watch on [Crochet], for sure."" That would be the Baltimore Orioles. The O's were in on Blake Snell before he agreed to a five-year contract with the Dodgers (per sources) on Tuesday. Although they could try to bring Corbin Burnes -- regarded as the No. 1 pitcher in this year's free-agent class -- back to Baltimore, the Orioles have been more often linked to other available hurlers such as Max Fried and Nathan Eovaldi. However, Crochet may be even more attainable for Baltimore given its wealth of prospect talent. The Orioles own the No. 3 farm system in baseball, per MLB Pipeline, and six of their top seven prospects are position players. That is what the White Sox are targeting in return for Crochet, who is under team control through 2026. Meanwhile, MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi is keeping an eye on the Boston Red Sox -- another reported Snell suitor before he landed with the Dodgers -- in the Crochet trade derby. Boston is loaded with highly touted position-player prospects, too, which could make it an attractive trade partner for the White Sox. Per a report from the Boston Globe (subscription required), the Red Sox are looking to add a top starter even if they can seal the deal with their primary target, superstar outfielder Juan Soto. Signing Soto would leave the team with less financial flexibility to do so, perhaps making Crochet a better fit for Boston than one of the top remaining arms on the free-agent market. Finally, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman said during his Wednesday chat on Bleacher Report that the Dodgers are also in on Crochet, alongside Baltimore and Boston. Even with Snell in tow, the 2024 World Series champs seem to still be a player in the pitching market as they have also been linked to Japanese ace Roki Sasaki and other hurlers. Nov. 25: Phils have had 'extensive talks' with White SoxThe Phillies and White Sox have discussed potential packages for Crochet that include All-Star third baseman Alec Bohm and highly touted outfield prospect Justin Crawford, per a report from USA Today's Bob Nightengale. Crawford is Philadelphia's No. 3 prospect, per MLB Pipeline, while Bohm is coming off his best season in the big leagues. The 28-year-old Bohm hit .295 with an .830 OPS in the first half on his way to his first career All-Star selection, but he put up just a .681 OPS following the break. The White Sox reportedly have some hesitation about that second-half dip, though Bohm has been a streaky hitter during his time in the big leagues. He's also had his troubles defensively, though he's coming off a much-improved showing at the hot corner in 2024. Nov. 22: These teams seem most interested in CrochetWith Crochet headlining the list of potential trade candidates this offseason, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman says four clubs -- the Orioles, Red Sox, Dodgers and Phillies -- are showing the most interest in acquiring the White Sox left-hander. Heyman wrote for the New York Post that the O's and Red Sox are in prime position to strike a deal based on the position-player talent that Chicago is likely seeking in return. Of course, there's still plenty of time for another team to enter the mix, with Heyman noting that others have also expressed interest. Nov. 13: These clubs could be involved in trade market for CrochetAlthough the White Sox didn't move Crochet prior to the Trade Deadline, there appears to be little doubt about their intentions for the left-hander this offseason. ""They're going to trade him this winter,"" a rival evaluator told ESPN's Buster Olney at the GM Meetings last week. ""It's not a matter of if; it's a question of when."" Olney shed some light on Crochet's potential market in an article for ESPN+ (subscription required) on Wednesday, noting that general manager Chris Getz is looking for ""a package of prospects constructed around at least one high-ceiling youngster to anchor the deal."" Chicago's preference is for that main piece to be a position player, but the team is open to a pitcher being the centerpiece, ""depending on the depth and quality of the prospects offered."" Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Based on conversations with industry sources, Olney names the Phillies, Padres, Yankees, Dodgers, Braves, Orioles, Red Sox and Mets as teams that could pursue a Crochet trade. Nov. 9: Mets showing interest in trading for Crochet (report)According to a report in the New York Post, the Mets are ""discussing"" Crochet, who is one of the most likely players to be traded this offseason. It would stand to reason given that three of New York's starters from 2024 -- Sean Manaea, Jose Quintana and Luis Severino -- are free agents. Though the Mets are certainly in position to spend big this offseason, Crochet would be considerably cheaper in his remaining arbitration years than spending toward the top of the free agent pitching market. Nov. 7: Crochet garnering trade interest from many clubs, but one stands outThe White Sox held on to Crochet through the 2024 Trade Deadline when they were receiving calls from many teams interested in acquiring the fireballing left-hander. Now, an even greater number of clubs are trying to maneuver a deal for Crochet, general manager Chris Getz said during this week's General Managers Meetings. Crochet entered this season with only 73 big league innings under his belt over parts of three seasons and a lengthy injury history. But from Opening Day on, he proved he could be an ace. Crochet received his first Major League start in that season opener and proceeded to strike out eight batters and allow one run over six innings. He eventually became a first-time All-Star and ended the season with 209 strikeouts in 146 innings. Given that big jump in innings, Crochet's workload was capped over the final few months of the season. He made it through the year without a stint on the injured list. What do the White Sox want in return for Crochet, who has two years of club control remaining? Getz has made it pretty clear. ""We need to improve our offense, it’s very clear,” he told reporters Tuesday. “With any trade or free agency, we are looking for ways to improve our offense."" One team that could be a match for Chicago in a Crochet trade is the Boston Red Sox. The Red Sox have six position players on MLB Pipeline's Top 100 Prospects list, including three in the top 10. They also have a few attractive pieces already at the big league level who are not yet eligible for arbitration. That group includes first baseman Triston Casas, catcher Connor Wong and Gold Glove outfielder Wilyer Abreu. With so much high-quality position-player depth, ""there’s a widespread sense that the Sox can trade for nearly anyone,"" according to The Boston Globe's Alex Speier (subscription required). MLB Network insider Jon Paul Morosi said Thursday from the GM Meetings that the Red Sox are ""the team I think a lot of people around here are looking at very carefully"" regarding a Crochet trade."
MLB News,Reliever grateful for 2nd chance at baseball -- after nearly becoming a teacher,https://www.mlb.com/news/erik-sabrowski-path-to-major-league-debut,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 17:22:51 GMT",,"Mandy Bell This story was excerpted from Mandy Bell’s Guardians Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. It’s the time of year when we all give a little more thought about what we’re thankful for in our lives. When it comes to Guardians reliever Erik Sabrowski, he can now be thankful that he didn’t quit baseball two years ago. In October of 2022, Sabrowski picked up the phone and called his agent. “'I don’t know if I’m loving this right now,'” Sabrowski recalled saying. “[My agent] said he would fly to Edmonton and kick my [butt] if I quit.” Sabrowski had every right to want to walk away. He was in the middle of recovering from his second Tommy John surgery. He had already sat through a cancelled 2020 Minor League season due to COVID. He was turning 25 years old and had never been above High-A. Plus, committing to finish this rehab process meant living in a dorm in Arizona, away from his fiancée, Renée, for another 12 months. He was ready to change his dream and go be a social studies teacher. But what if he was told that just two-and-a-half years later he’d be part of the best bullpen in Major League Baseball? “I wouldn’t have believed you,” Sabrowski laughed. “I would appreciate the spark, but I wouldn’t have believed you."" The future may have seemed out of reach, but Sabrowski decided to listen to his agent and follow through on this commitment to the game. Two months later, his phone rang. It was the Guardians.   Sabrowski was drafted by the Padres in the 14th round of the 2018 MLB Draft. Two weeks after he was selected, he learned he’d have to undergo Tommy John surgery for the first time. He pitched in just eight games in San Diego's system over the next three years -- all of those appearances in 2021 -- due to injuries and the pandemic. So, he wasn’t necessarily expecting to be taken in the Rule 5 Draft, but Cleveland had seen something in the lefty that it wanted.   “That was another thing that helped me get through the rehab,” Sabrowski said. “There’s an organization out there -- and it’s Cleveland of all teams, the pitching factory -- that believes they can see something in me and believe that they can help me get there.”   Everything started to build from there. Sabrowski got back on the rubber for Double-A Akron in 2023 and delivered a 2.49 ERA over 20 appearances. He pitched well in the Fall League that offseason and earned a promotion to Triple-A Columbus in ’24. He struggled in those first few outings at the highest Minor League level, but he made an adjustment in July and August that helped him settle back in -- and catch the big league staff's eye. So his phone rang, again. “Renée was sitting beside me when my phone lit up with [Triple-A manager] Andy Tracy,” Sabrowski said. “She almost put a dent in the roof she jumped so high. It was really awesome.” It was the moment he thought would never come: He was finally going to make his Major League debut, even if it didn’t happen for six games after getting his callup. It was all worth the wait. Sabrowski pitched 1 1/3 innings against the Royals on Sept. 4 without giving up a run. It set the tone for a flawless introduction to the Majors, considering he didn’t allow a run over his eight regular season appearances (12 2/3 innings). He went from the guy that had fans wondering, “Who is this?” when he was first called up to, “Sabrowski has to be on the postseason roster, right?” in a matter of weeks. He was, indeed, put on the playoff roster, and he only gave up one run in 5 1/3 innings between the American League Division Series and AL Championship Series. Sabrowski soaked in every second of this magical run. In each champagne celebration, his grin spanned ear to ear while chasing his teammates around the room.   This is a guy who knows he wasn’t supposed to be here. He knows the odds were stacked against him. He knows he was so close to walking away, but didn’t. Instead, he’s set himself up to be a staple in this bullpen for years to come.   Needless to say, there aren’t many people on this team who will be more grateful than Sabrowski this holiday season.   “Who’s got it better than me? That’s what I think,” Sabrowski said. “Like, first place team, popped champagne twice, best bullpen ever, it’s been incredible.”"

That's clearly wearing on the Ohio State faithful.,"As a postgame brawl was ongoing — Ohio State taking umbrage at Michigan planting a victory flag at midfield of the Horseshoe — the Fox camera caught Ryan Day off to the side, wearing a look on his face that suggested, “What is happening?” It may prove to be the enduring image of this epic upset/collapse, depending on which side of Toledo border you reside. Michigan 13, Ohio State 10. Again. “I’m still trying to digest everything that just happened,” a shell-shocked Day said after his fourth consecutive defeat to the Wolverines. “[I have] a locker room full of guys who are just devastated … There are a lot of guys who are crushed right now. There is nothing you can say at this point. You have to take the ownership of that and it starts with me.” The Buckeyes (10-2) will head to the College Football Playoff and may still go on to win a national championship this year but perhaps — perhaps — only that can answer for this disaster by Day. And the route to a title will be more arduous — no bye after failing to win the Big Ten (again), and maybe even a first-round road game. Michigan is headed to a meager bowl game at 7-5, but everything has been salvaged for first-year coach Sherrone Moore. They arrived as 19.5-point underdogs with a former walk-on, cancer-surviving quarterback who rarely throws the ball more than 10 yards in the air. Ohio State countered with a reported $20 million roster full of returning stars and portal kings, not to mention a coaching staff bolstered after hiring UCLA’s head coach (Chip Kelly) to call plays. It came with all the prerequisite focus that the Scarlet and Grey put on this rivalry — refusing to say the word ""Michigan,"" X’ing out all the ""M's"" on campus, having Day compare his previous three defeats to the tragic death of his father. And yet in the end it was The Team, The Team, The Team from Up North. Again. “As you know, it isn’t easy to accept,” Day said. “I have to take the ownership and I am the one who makes the final decisions.” The second-ranked Buckeyes can’t blame this one on Jim Harbaugh. It can’t blame this one on Connor Stalions. They can’t chalk it up to, say, not being able to handle some all-time great such as Aidan Hutchinson or maybe that the law of averages finally played out and Michigan finally got one. This is four straight and this should have been a mismatch, a complete lopsided affair. The talent differential was stark. The seasons headed in different directions. Michigan quarterback Davis Warren — the aforementioned walk-on with an inspirational story — completed just nine passes for 62 yards and two picks. His longest went just 18 yards, caught by a receiver, Peyton O’Leary, who entered the game with just eight receptions and originally signed to be a lacrosse player at Massachusetts. That sounds like a story out of the MAC. Yet in the end The Game was the game — won by brute force and not recruiting rankings, by will and want, not NFL draft status. When the end of the season comes and the temperatures drop and the winds kick up, there aren’t a lot of tricks to be had. Michigan was again tougher, straight-up tougher. The Wolverines outrushed the Buckeyes 172-77, always the greatest predictor of success in this annual clash. Kalel Mullings had 116 yards all by himself. How Day hasn’t been able to address this, even acknowledging injuries to the offensive line, is what will haunt him until he does. “We just couldn’t control the game in the run game,” Day said. “The overall execution wasn’t good enough.” There was more, of course. Two interceptions, two missed field goals and zero sacks didn’t help. And a horrific 12-men-on-the-field penalty on Michigan’s final drive gave the Wolverines a first-and-goal and the chance to kill more clock. The nerves and pressure were at times one-sided, perhaps a sign not just of the losing streak but the unhealthy intensity Day puts on this game. By the end it was all too clear, even to disbelieving eyes everywhere. Ohio State was shut out in the second half and its last first down came with 5:59 in the third — the Michigan defense just shutting everything down as boos rained down on the Buckeyes and their coaches. Meanwhile Michigan pushed and pushed and overcame their own errors and turnovers and limitations and won again. Next year they welcome the No. 1 overall recruit and have upped their NIL recruiting game to match the money in Columbus. If there ever were a year for Ohio State to run it up, whip it up and celebrate it up, this was it. Ohio Stadium was packed and looking for revenge. By the end they were screaming at Day, who despite a 66-10 record is somehow on a hot seat that only a national title can cool. “Everyone wants to win this game in the worst way,” Day said. “No one wants to win it more than we do. It’s our No. 1 goal … I don’t blame anybody for being upset.” That includes the Ohio State players who took great exception to Michigan trying to “plant” a flag on their logo postgame. A wild melee — complete with punches and pepper spray — ensued. A fight has broken out between Michigan and Ohio State after The Game pic.twitter.com/XPwdAjfYzN — FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) November 30, 2024 Whether you find it Michigan’s fault for the flag antics or Ohio State’s fault for showing more fight after the game than during it hardly matters. That it could happen again is what will linger beyond the volleys of “classless” behavior. “Those guys are trying to put a flag on our field and our guys weren’t going to let that happen,” Day said. “This is our field and we are obviously disappointed we lost the game but we have some prideful guys on our team [that] just aren’t going to sit back and watch that happen.” “They got to learn how to lose, man,” Michigan's Mullings countered. The losing to Michigan part they have plenty of practice at and until Ryan Day learns how to win this game, even with a stacked roster, perhaps nothing can spare him."

This year, McBride is averaging 68.5 receiving yards per game (second among TEs only behind George Kittle) and is tied for the second-most targets per game (8) — and thank goodness for that, as McBride is still seeking his first receiving touchdown of the season. [Week 13 Full-PPR Fantasy Rankings: QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | FLEX | D/ST | Kickers] Still! It's Week 13!

That's not to say he doesn't seem overdue for that touchdown, however, currently leading the team with 17 red-zone targets (10 RZ catches).

According to ESPN, the UCF coach is stepping down to become the offensive coordinator at Florida State. UCF ended its season on Friday night with a home loss to Utah. The defeat dropped the Knights to 4-8 on the season. “We would like to thank Coach Malzahn for his contributions to our football program over the past four seasons, including our transition into the Big 12 Conference,” the school said in a statement. “We appreciate his professionalism and dedication to our student-athletes throughout his tenure at UCF and wish he and his wife, Kristi, the very best in their future endeavors.” Florida State is 2-9 ahead of its regular-season finale against Florida on Saturday night. The Seminoles have been searching for an offensive coordinator for weeks after coach Mike Norvell fired both offensive coordinator Alex Atkins and defensive coordinator Adam Fuller following a 52-3 loss to Notre Dame. FSU's only wins this season are over Cal and Charleston Southern and the Seminoles have scored more than 21 points just once this season. That came in the team's 41-7 win over the FCS-level Pirates a week ago. Malzahn, 60, is taking the route UCLA coach Chip Kelly did less than a year ago. Kelly stepped down at UCLA to take the offensive coordinator job at Ohio State ahead of the 2024 season. The former Auburn head coach recently completed his fourth season at UCF. The Knights won nine games in each of his first two seasons but fell to 6-7 in 2023 before winning just four games this season. The drop in wins has coincided with UCF’s move from the American Athletic Conference to the Big 12. Before UCF, Malzahn was the head coach at Auburn from 2013 through 2020. The Tigers lost the BCS title game to Florida State in his first season in 2013 and won just 10 games once over the next seven seasons. However, Auburn never posted a losing season under Malzahn and was 6-4 in his final season. Malzahn was Auburn’s offensive coordinator when the Tigers won the national title following the 2011 season. He left Auburn to be the coach at Arkansas State for a season and then replaced Gene Chizik after one season with the Red Wolves."

On Thursday, it was Bears coach Matt Eberflus who squandered a chance to force overtime against the one-loss Lions. On Friday, Raiders coach Antonio Pierce mismanaged a chance to upend the two-time defending (and also one-loss) Chiefs. The problems started for the Raiders when Pierce burned a timeout due to indecision with 2:21 to play. After sending out the punt team while facing fourth and 11 from the Chiefs' 40 and down by two points, Pierce changed his mind. So he called timeout and opted for a 58-yard field goal attempt from Daniel Carlson. The kick was no good. To their credit, the Raiders forced the Chiefs to punt. Las Vegas got the ball back at their eight yard line with 1:56 left. And they moved the ball in position for another attempt to win the game. Things went sideways when quarterback Aidan O'Connell completed a seven-yard pass to running back Ameer Abdullah. It put the ball at the K.C. 32. Out of timeouts (thanks to the one they'd wasted), quarterback Aidan O'Connell hurried to the line and spiked the ball with 15 seconds to play. That was the mistake that deprived the Raiders of the chance to win. They could have run the clock down to three or four seconds before the snap and the spike. That approach would have ensured that the Chiefs would have had no shot to get in position for a game-winning field-goal try of their own. Then came the mistake that compounded the first one. Instead of trying a 50-yard field goal, the Raiders ran another play. The snap came early, O'Connell failed to catch it, and the Chiefs recovered. Game over. After the game was over, Pierce explained the reasoning for the final, botched play. ""We was gonna snap the ball and really just throw the ball out of bounds and just — the ball's at the 32 yard line. We were gonna kill four or five more seconds and kick a 49-yard field goal,"" Pierce told reporters. Later in the press conference, he was pressed again about that decision. ""Yeah, I answered that a minute ago,"" Pierce said. ""I was trying to just throw the ball away. . . . So we was gonna throw the ball away, waste four or five more seconds, and kick a field goal."" The explanation makes no sense. They could have wasted as many seconds as they wanted before O'Connell clocked the ball on the prior play. It's another failure of situational football. In the moments after Abdullah was tackled at the 32 with a ticking clock, O'Connell needed to know that the strategy in that moment was to use as much of the clock as possible, so that Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes wouldn't have a chance to do Mahomes things. After the ball was spiked, the Raiders decided to shrink Mahomes's window by burning four or five more seconds. And look at what happened. While different from the fiasco at the end of the Bears-Lions game, there's a common thread. Coaches and players need to be ready for every situation. They need to think clearly and decisively when it comes to clock management. The last play, which became the decisive turnover, wasn't necessary if O'Connell had the presence of mind to line up on the ball, milk the clock, and spike it with just enough time to try the field goal. That's on Pierce, frankly, for not having O'Connell ready to do what needed to be done in the most important moment of the game."

Ridley continued his strong second half of the season in Week 12 when he caught five of six targets for 93 yards. He’s now played five games since DeAndre Hopkins was traded and has averaged an elite 32% target share across these contests. Since Week 8, Ridley has averaged 14 fantasy points per game which ranks eighth among all receivers ahead of Puka Nacua and Terry McLaurin. Ridley has benefitted from Will Levis playing better the past month. During this time, Levis ranks fourth among all QBs, averaging 9.6 yards per attempt. This week, Ridley gets a beneficial matchup against the Commanders. Washington ranks 29th in coverage this season according to PFF and they allow the fifth-most touchdowns to wide receivers. The Titans are six-point underdogs this week so there’s an increased chance they play from behind. If so, this could lead to more targets and production for Ridley. Make sure he’s in your lineup this week. Addison is coming off a big week against the Bears. He produced 162 yards on eight catches and found the end zone. Addison was the No. 1 fantasy receiver on the entire week after this career-high performance. He benefitted from the Bears focusing most of their attention on Justin Jefferson. This allowed Addison to see plenty of one-on-one matchups and he took advantage of these. Addison has now finished as a top-24 receiver in three of his last four games. He’s coming off back-to-back games of at least eight targets and a touchdown. The most impressive part about all of this is he’s found so much success despite difficult matchups against the Titans and Bears. But this week Addison finally gets a good matchup. He’ll face the Cardinals this week who allow the 10th most efficiency per passing play this season. Last week, Jaxon Smith-Njigba totaled 77 yards and a touchdown against the Cardinals. Expect Arizona to focus most of their attention on Jefferson and for Addison to see lots of one-on-one matchups again. He’s a start this week. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Irving had a great matchup last week against the Giants who allow the most rushing yards per play. We deemed him to be in the best spot of the week in Week 12 and he came through for us. Irving turned 18 touches into 151 total yards and a touchdown. He posted his first top-five finish of the season and even saw an improvement in his receiving-game usage. The Bucs rookie ran 59% of the team's routes, his second-highest mark in a game this season, leading to six receptions. This week, Irving gets another elite matchup against the Panthers. Carolina allows the most rushing yards per game and second-most rushing touchdowns this season. Opposing backfields average 29.3 fantasy points per game against the Panthers, the most in the league. Even if you’re loaded at the running back position, make sure Irving is in your lineup this week. McConkey is coming off a rare game where he didn’t lead the Chargers in target share. In Week 12, McConkey earned 17% of the team's targets in a strong matchup against the Ravens. He saw two fewer targets than teammate Josh Palmer. Despite this, McConkey still led the team with six catches and 83 yards. He’s now averaging 103 yards the past two weeks and continues to look great as a route runner. There’s a chance the Chargers feature McConkey even more moving forward given Quentin Johnston’s drop issues. This week the quality matchups continue for McConkey against the Falcons. The last time we saw Atlanta was in Week 10 before their bye, when they gave up 307 yards and four touchdowns to Bo Nix and the Broncos. Atlanta allows the seventh most receiving yards per game and ranks 31st in pressure this season according to PFF; Justin Herbert should have plenty of time to throw this week. McConkey is once again a top-20 option and start this week."
"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Fantasy Football Week 13 Sleepers: Don't overlook these options if your lineup needs help,https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy-football-week-13-sleepers-dont-overlook-these-options-if-your-lineup-needs-help-170612375.html,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 17:06:12 GMT",Fantasy football analyst Scott Pianowski offers his favorite Week 13 sleepers to give your lineup a boost!,"There were hits and misses on the Week 12 sleeper page, like any other week. Luke Schoonmaker, Nick Westbrook-Ikhine and Roschon Johnson had touchdowns and Will Dissly was solid, as usual. We like that. But Quentin Johnston toasted a bagel on Monday (so many soul-crushing drops) and there were some other bricks. Here's hoping you don't need a lot of sleepers in your Week 13 lineups. All 32 NFL clubs are in action this week and you are probably jostling for playoff position. The stakes are rising. But if injuries or underperformance have bitten you, perhaps some of these names can help out. At this stage of the game, we know what Edwards is — a two-down pounder who offers almost nothing in the pass game. However, he's going to be the first look at the goal line with J.K. Dobbins (knee) set to miss time, and the Falcons present a rushing defense that's slightly below average in most metrics. Edwards probably needs a touchdown to pay off his projection, but I'd give him a better than 50% chance to get that score here. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Here's another back who's shown nothing in the pass game (just two receptions), but McNichols has been efficient when asked to carry the ball (in a mild surprise, his success rate is actually slightly higher than Brian Robinson Jr. and Austin Ekeler). Robinson suffered an ankle injury in Week 12 (though he was left off the final injury report), and Ekeler (concussion) has been ruled out. It's unclear if Robinson will be limited at all, which could put McNichols in play against an average Tennessee rushing defense. Bo Nix isn't the only rookie winner in Denver; Vele's role continues to expand and he's been impressive. Vele is coming off his busiest and most productive game of the year (6-80-0, nine targets) and the Monday draw is favorable, up against a Cleveland secondary that's allowed the fifth-most points to opposing wide receivers. Boundary specialist Courtland Sutton is the undeniable alpha in the Denver passing game, but Vele will probably see a target share of 20% or higher in this spot. One of the biggest fantasy stories from Week 12 was the emergence of Bryce Young, who looked poised and in control against the intimidating Kansas City defense. Young wasn't fazed by the blitz packages and made several on-target throws despite challenging pressure. It appears the Panthers knew what they were doing when they gave Young a temporary benching; he's looked like a different player since the return. This means we can start attacking the Carolina receiver room with some level of confidence. Thielen's resume probably makes him the more comfortable sleeper play, off a solid 3-57-0 line in his return from injury, but we also have to note Moore saw heavy usage in the Kansas City game (6-81-1) and drew a team-best 10 targets. The Buccaneers play a lot of shootouts, with a capable offense and a leaky secondary. Perhaps the Panthers can uphold their end of the bargain. Some fantasy managers didn't want to hold MVS through the bye week and I get it, given his history of inconsistent performance. And even in two smash games, they've come with limited volume — just seven targets led to his 5-196-3 line the past two games. The hope is that Valdez-Scantling will make one big play to justify your faith, and at least there's little downfield competition in this offense. The Rams secondary has been a plus matchup for most of 2024. It's becoming a cut-and-paste case with NWI, a low-target player who somehow has scored in 6-of-7 games. NWI is seeing snap shares over 90% each week in the aftermath of the DeAndre Hopkins trade, making him the second-most important target in his offense. I'm not afraid to dial him up against an average Washington defense; the Commanders are heavy favorites, which could push Tennessee into a more proactive passing game."

The bizarre play, on which the Raiders had a miscommunication that resulted in quarterback Aidan O'Connell not knowing that a shotgun snap was coming to him, ended the Raiders' hopes of winning on a last-second field goal. The Raiders were flagged for an illegal shift on the play, which the Chiefs declined, but it sounded like an official blew the play dead for a false start, which would have negated the snap. ""We heard a whistle on our sideline,"" Pierce told reporters on Saturday. Pierce said he'll send that play in to the league's officiating office and ask for an explanation, but he said that's a typical practice after every game when the team has questions about a call. The official near the Raiders' sideline appeared to blow his whistle and signal timeout before the Chiefs jumped on the loose ball, which should have meant the play didn't count. Pierce has a legitimate complaint about that."

The team is making sure it gets a few more. The super-utility man has agreed to a five-year, $74 million contract extension with a sixth-year club option, the Dodgers announced Friday. Per ESPN's Jeff Passan, the deal includes a $17 million signing bonus and deferred money. The Los Angeles Dodgers have agreed on a contract extension with IF/OF Tommy Edman for five years for $74M through the 2029 season with a club option for the 2030 season. — Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) November 29, 2024 Edman was previously set to hit free agency after 2025. He now joins Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Blake Snell and Will Smith as Dodgers players under contract through 2029. The structure is similar to the Dodgers' other significant deal of the offseason (so far), as Snell's five-year, $182 million deal also included a significant signing bonus and deferred money. That setup helps the Dodgers when it comes to CBT calculations, with little cost to the player thanks to the up-front money. Edman landed with the Dodgers at this year's trade deadline, joining the club in a three-team trade that also saw reliever Michael Kopech go to Los Angeles. The trade wound up vital for the Dodgers' playoff run, with Kopech quickly becoming one of the team's high-leverage bullpen arms and Edman winning NLCS MVP honors while providing both flexibility and highlight plays on defense. Edman is the rare player who can provide above-average fielding at shortstop, center field and second base, playing the former two during the Dodgers' World Series run. The Dodgers prioritize positional flexibility, and Edman gives them that at three premium defensive positions. He also gives them a strong bat, with a catch. Edman is a switch-hitter who clearly has a better side, hitting .181/.256/.267 against right-handed pitchers and .412/.417/.882 against left-handed pitchers. He can also catch fire at times, such as when he hit .407/.393/.630 in the NLCS against the New York Mets. Shortstop in particular has been a problem position for the Dodgers since Trea Turner left in free agency, so much so that they tried Mookie Betts at the position this year. Center field isn't a strength either, with a platoon of Andy Pages and James Outman looming for 2025. Edman figures to see plenty of time at both in 2025. Locking down that kind of piece for the next five years is significant for the Dodgers, who entered the offseason with a lengthy to-do list despite holding the Commissioner's Trophy. Extending Edman was one item, as was getting a starting pitcher such as Snell. Still remaining are another starting pitcher (the Dodgers truly cannot have enough), a corner outfielder (think Juan Soto or Teoscar Hernández) and perhaps a bullpen arm or two (Blake Treinen is a free agent). That's all to say the team which has already spent $256 million this offseason is nowhere close to finished."

Herbert has been fantasy’s QB9 over the last five games, and the Chargers will likely continue to rely more on the pass with J.K. Dobbins out. The Falcons have yielded the 10th fewest fantasy points to RBs but the seventh most to QBs this season. Atlanta has ceded multiple TD passes in seven straight games, allowing a whopping 18 over that span. The Chargers have a healthy 25.5-point implied total, so Herbert is a top-five QB this week. Pickens is coming off a quiet game, but he saw the second-most air yards (143) last week. Pickens’ prorated season stats during games with Russell Wilson would be 136 targets, 88 catches, 1,404 receiving yards and 7 touchdowns. His fantasy production has seen a 60.2% boost with Wilson compared to Justin Fields this season. The Bengals have been a pass-funnel defense over the last five games, when they’ve allowed the second most schedule-adjusted fantasy points to wide receivers but the second fewest to running backs. Etienne will return to splitting work with Bigsby, who was back practicing in full this week. Houston has allowed the sixth-fewest fantasy points to running backs this season, and Jacksonville has the fifth-lowest implied team total (20.5 points). Bigsby’s averaged 16.7 fantasy points (0.5 PPR) in games without Etienne this season but just 6.8 with him. Etienne has struggled even without Bigsby, so both backs are bench candidates in Week 13. Conner has a 48% carry share over Arizona’s last three games, while rookie Trey Benson has a 29% share over that span. Conner leads the league in evaded tackles and continues to see work in the passing game, but he’s losing work overall and gets the league’s toughest matchup this week. The Vikings have allowed just 62.3 RB rushing yards per game, an NFL-low five rushing touchdowns and by far the lowest EPA/rush. Vikings’ opponents have averaged the fewest rushing attempts per game (20.9) this season. Meanwhile, Kyler Murray has gotten just 5.4 YPA against zone coverage, which Minnesota has used at the league’s second-highest rate (79.5%). Murray has also struggled against the blitz and two-high coverage (25th in fantasy points/dropback), which are two features of Brian Flores’ defense. Minnesota has ceded an NFL-low 8.6 rushing yards per game to quarterbacks. Moreover, Marvin Harrison Jr.’s target rate falls from 30.3% against man down to 18% versus zone, while his fantasy points per route run takes a similar tumble (0.65 to 0.34). Harrison Jr. hasn’t seen more than seven targets in a game since Week 3, and no wide receiver in the top 60 is averaging fewer fantasy points per game if you removed touchdowns. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Murray has the same number of top-five QB weekly finishes (four) this season as he does bottom 10. There is admitted risk he goes off on your bench against a Minnesota pass-funnel defense allowing the second most pass attempts per game (37.9). Conner is the RB20 in this week’s “expert consensus ranks,” so you may not have better alternatives. But at minimum, temper expectations for Conner, Murray and Harrison Jr. this week. Here’s a sleeper for this week. Josh Downs and Ashton Dulin are out for Week 13, while Alec Pierce (foot) is questionable, so Mitchell could be looking at a vastly expanded role Sunday. Michael Pittman Jr. will likely be shadowed by Christian Gonzalez, and Mitchell has seen his target rate (43.2%) and fantasy points per route run (0.49) skyrocket against man coverage, which the Patriots have used as the league’s second highest rate (40.2%). Mitchell hasn’t experienced much success with Anthony Richardson this season, but AR played far better than the box score indicated last week, and his willingness to throw downfield appears like a good fit for the rookie WR. If there’s a player who’s widely available (just 4% rostered) on waiver wires who could make an impact this week, it’s Mitchell. The Jets’ defense has unquestionably fallen off since firing Robert Saleh, but they’ve allowed just two passing touchdowns and have the league’s second-highest pressure rate over the last four games. For the season, New York has yielded the third-fewest passing yards per game (197.2) and the fewest passing touchdowns (five). DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett were cleared to play, but could be limited. The Seahawks’ defense ranks fourth in EPA/play since trading for Ernest Jones, so game script may not call for much passing in this slow-paced matchup. Sit Smith this week. Pollard won’t likely see a 94% snap share or quite as big of a workload as he did last week with Tyjae Spears returning to a full practice Thursday, but he should remain in fantasy lineups. The Commanders have yielded 4.8 YPC, the fifth-most EPA/rush and the second-most RB rushing yards per game (120.8). Will Levis is playing much better, and the Titans defense should help keep the game script manageable. Start Pollard even with Spears’ return. Irving’s big game last week could’ve been massive if not for being tackled at the one-yard line on two separate drives and losing fourth-quarter work in the blowout. He out-snapped and ran more routes than Rachaad White for the first time this season. Irving is first in the league in yards after contact per rush (4.2), and he ranks top five both in YPC and yards per route run. Irving has been fantasy’s RB11 since Week 6 despite seeing less than 50% of the snaps over that span, as he quite simply looks like one of the NFL’s best running backs right now. Irving will continue to lose some work in Tampa Bay’s backfield, but he should remain in fantasy lineups in a prime matchup this week. Carolina has allowed the most rush attempts per game (27.5), rush yards per game (129.5), touchdowns (16) and schedule-adjusted fantasy points to running backs. Bryce Young has undeniably looked far better recently, but the Buccaneers are 5.5-point home favorites Sunday, so game script should be favorable. Tampa Bay also sports the league’s highest implied team total (27.5 points), so treat Irving as a top-12 back this week. Stafford has been fantasy’s QB43 (8.9 fpg) in five games without both Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua on the field this season; he’s been the QB8 (19.0 fpg) during five games with the wide receivers. Stafford’s season pace would be 4,887.5 passing yards and 37.4 touchdowns with Kupp and Nacua on the field, and that includes facing the league’s current best defense last week. The Saints have allowed the eighth-most schedule-adjusted fantasy points to QBs over the last five games. The Rams have one of the league’s highest projected totals (26.5 points) in a fast-paced matchup against a depleted and vulnerable New Orleans’ secondary. Stafford is the QB14 in “expert consensus ranks” this week, but he’s my QB4. Jalen Hurts has averaged just 21.3 pass attempts over the last six games, but more volume should be there in this fast-paced matchup. Baltimore has allowed the fewest RB rushing yards per game (60.5), while Ravens’ opponents have averaged by far the most pass attempts (39.2) this season. Moreover, Goedert saw a 33.3% first-read target share last week without DeVonta Smith. The wideout returned to a limited practice Thursday, but Smith may not be 100% even if he’s able to suit up. Fire up Goedert against a pass-funnel defense in a matchup with this week’s highest total (51.0 points). Samuel is the WR43 in fantasy points per game this season, sandwiched between Quentin Johnston and Rashod Bateman. He’s the WR42 in expected fantasy points, just behind Allen Lazard. Whether it’s injuries or recovering from pneumonia, Samuel simply hasn’t looked like nearly the same player this year. He’s committed multiple drops and ranks #118 out of 123 pass catchers in ESPN’s Open Score. Samuel feels “due” for a breakout game, and the 49ers are getting the second most yards per play (6.3) and due for red-zone regression. But San Francisco’s offense was a disaster without Brock Purdy and Trent Williams last week; Purdy looks increasingly iffy for Sunday night while barely throwing this week, and Williams seems unlikely to play. The 49ers have the second-lowest implied team total (19.5 points) this week, which strongly suggests Brandon Allen is starting in a windy game with temperatures in the 20s. The Bills have let a WR eclipse 16.1 fantasy points during just one game all season, so Samuel is a bench candidate Sunday night. Chubb saw season highs in snap share (64%), rush yards (59) and carries (20) last week, but his fantasy day was only saved by two short touchdown runs. He’s getting just 3.0 YPC and averaging only 1.4 targets (and 1.4 receiving yards) over five games since returning from another serious multi-ligament knee surgery. Chubb remains a threat to score at the goal line, but he gets a tough matchup this week. The Broncos have allowed the second-fewest rush yards before contact per attempt (0.8) and the third-fewest rushing scores (six) this season. Denver has been vulnerable to receiving backs, but Chubb ran only eight routes last week, and the Broncos have ceded the fourth fewest schedule-adjusted rush fantasy points to RBs over the last five games. The Browns have issues at left tackle and a lowly 19.5-point implied total, so Chubb deserves bench consideration Monday night."

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Finding trade parter for Brandon Ingram where he wants to re-sign proving challenge for Pelicans,https://sports.yahoo.com/finding-trade-parter-brandon-ingram-171714599.html,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 17:17:14 GMT","Finding a team that will take on Ingram's $36 million contract is challenging, but finding one where he might re-sign is even harder.","It's no secret: The New Orleans Pelicans have been “aggressively” trying to trade Brandon Ingram since last offseason. Two things have stood in the way of that getting done: Ingram's $36 million salary that is hard to move, and the fact it's the last year of his deal, so he is looking for a team that will sign him to a max or near max new contract. There was enough friction between New Orleans and Ingram that he did not show up for the team’s voluntary offseason workouts, although by all reports he has been professional through this young season. The update on this saga is that there is no update. Through what has been an ugly 4-16 start to the season, the Pelicans are still looking for a trade — one where they take back less money and lower their tax bill — but finding a taker that will sign Ingram long-term is still a problem. Here is what Brian Windhorst wrote at ESPN. Sources told ESPN the two sides can't agree on a contract extension and trade talks since last summer have failed to align. Finding a place where New Orleans can send Ingram's $36 million salary and get value while also reducing salary -- the Pelicans are currently in the luxury tax for the first time ever and not likely to stay there -- is hard enough. But finding a deal with a team Ingram will be comfortable signing a new contract with has also stalled talks, per sources. ESPN’s Tim Bontemps adds that the NBA's new CBA and its tax aprons are adding to the challenge. The league's new collective bargaining agreement continues to cause a lot of friction for teams. Signing a player such as Ingram, a 6-foot-8 forward who has averaged at least 20 points per game for six consecutive seasons, will require a hefty contract next summer. All but a few franchises have limited salary cap space, and teams are reluctant to hard cap themselves with a trade early in the season. The several teams in the second apron aren't even allowed to trade for him. Injuries have decimated the Pelicans through the first 20 games of the season and with Zion Williamson expected to miss a chunk more time due to a hamstring strain, the Pelicans have some hard choices to face. While we may be just one-quarter of the way into the NBA season, the Pelicans are already 6.5 games out of even the last play-in spot in the West and would need to leapfrog five teams — and improve their record to .500 or better — just to get into that conversation. At what point does management start thinking about a pivot to tanking, er... focusing on young players and looking to the NBA Draft? (Nobody in the NBA would actually tank, right?) This is a different situation than Philadephia in the East just because of the conference disparity — the 3-14 Sixers are just four games out of the postseason and don't need to get back to .500 to make it. Philly has time to turn it around, but does New Orleans? None of which makes trading Ingram any easier. Maybe the Pelicans will just ride with him all season as a scorer on a struggling team. Nothing is coming easy for New Orleans this season."
"Yahoo!

The Cowboys lost 52-0 to No. 25 Colorado on Friday to cap a 3-9 season that included a 0-9 record in Big 12 play. It was the worst loss ever for coach Mike Gundy to cap his worst season in charge and the first time Oklahoma State hasn’t won at least four games in a season since the Cowboys were 3-8 in 2000. It was a miserable showing for the Cowboys. The offense couldn’t do anything with freshman QB Maealiuaki Smith at the helm, and the pass defense was gashed by Colorado QB Shedeur Sanders. Oklahoma State turned the ball over three times and even committed three personal foul penalties in a first quarter that featured three touchdowns for the Buffaloes. The game was over after Colorado built a 21-0 lead that included an 11-yard pass to prohibitive Heisman favorite Travis Hunter. Hunter finished the game with 10 catches for 116 yards and three touchdowns. His final TD catch was a 23-yard grab in man coverage to put the Buffs up 52. TRAVIS HUNTER, ARE YOU KIDDING!? 😱THIRD TD OF THE DAY 🔥 pic.twitter.com/6yTD1nk1Cq — SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) November 29, 2024 Oh, he also had an interception. The Cowboys went 10-4 a season ago and lost to Texas in the Big 12 title game before capping the season with a win in the Texas Bowl. It was the eighth time in 19 seasons that a Gundy-coached team had won at least 10 games. That season, along with a host of returning starters like RB Ollie Gordon, QB Alan Bowman and WR Brennan Presley, led to a preseason ranking of No. 17 in the AP Top 25 and made Oklahoma State one of the favorites in a wide-open Big 12. The Cowboys started the season 3-0 but things fell apart from there. A 22-19 home loss to Utah to start Big 12 play ended up being a matchup of the two worst teams in the conference. A week after losing to the Utes, OSU was blown out by Kansas State and then lost by 24 to West Virginia. A close call against BYU on Oct. 18 — as the Cougars got a late TD to win the game — ended up being the closest Oklahoma State came to a conference win. In early November, Gundy apologized for comments he made at a news conference as the team was 0-6. When discussing fan criticism of the team during its losing streak, Gundy said that “most people are weak” and “they fall apart and panic” when things aren’t going well, while also saying that “in most cases, the people who are negative and voicing their opinion are the same ones that can’t pay their own bills.” Given the way that Oklahoma State played in 2024, you can understand why fans were criticizing a program that had been to a bowl game for 18 straight seasons. A loss to TCU a week after Gundy's comments meant that Oklahoma State wouldn't be going to a bowl for the first time since Gundy's first season. Colorado’s win eliminates TCU, Texas Tech and West Virginia from Big 12 title contention. However, the Buffaloes still need some help to get to the Big 12 title game. Colorado entered Week 14 tied atop the conference at 6-2 with Arizona State, BYU and Iowa State. The Buffs are on the wrong side of tiebreakers in a three or four-way tiebreaker and will need two of the three other teams to lose on Saturday to make the conference title game."

Friday was the weirdest of all.,"The Kansas City Chiefs are finding weird ways to win this season. Friday was the weirdest way of all. The Las Vegas Raiders were in field goal range with less than 20 seconds left, and they were trying to get closer. Rookie center Jackson Powers-Johnson then snapped to quarterback Aidan O’Connell in shotgun before he was ready, and it hit him in the chest. The Chiefs fell on the ball and after a long conference between the officials, they ruled the Chiefs had recovered the fumble. Game over. Chiefs win 19-17. The Raiders fumble it, the Chiefs recover it to seal the game ‼️#LVvsKC on Prime VideoAlso streaming on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/WvNvUONRM5 — NFL (@NFL) November 29, 2024 After the game, Powers-Johnson took the blame for the blunder, saying it was a miscommunication between he and O'Connell. Likewise, O'Connell took accountability, saying: ""it was completely my fault. I was looking out to right, making sure guys were set and I started clapping. In my head I was thinking signal the ball to get the ball, but when I start clapping it tells Jackson, basically, snap the ball. Jackson did exactly what he should have done and I clapped too early."" Kansas City is doing just enough to get by, and they seem to find a way to win close games over inferior teams every week. Amazingly, that’s been good enough for a 11-1 record. The Chiefs looked unimpressive yet again on Friday, but as usual they found a way to win. This time it was holding off the Las Vegas Raiders, who are now 2-10. The Chiefs are now the first team this season to clinch a playoff spot, but their issues are legitimate. Their offensive tackles are struggling badly. The offensive skill-position talent is good but doesn’t have a lot of explosive speed outside of Xavier Worthy, who is an unreliable rookie. The defense this season has been good but short of what it was last season. And despite all of that, the Chiefs are 11-1. And as we all learned last season, when the games matter most in January, the Chiefs’ issues just seem to fade away once the postseason starts and they’re marching to another Super Bowl. But they shouldn’t be barely beating teams like the Raiders. Early on the game seemed to be there for the taking for the Raiders. They just kept blowing opportunities. The Raiders were able to move the ball well enough but couldn’t do enough on the Chiefs’ side of the field. Daniel Carlson missed two long field goals. The Raiders, one of the worst rushing teams in the NFL over many years, also got stuffed on a fourth-and-1 handoff at the Chiefs’ 31. Late in the third quarter, right before O’Connell took a 15-yard sack that led into Carlson missing another field goal, the Raiders were outgaining the Chiefs. And they trailed 13-3. Finally, the Raiders made a move. Ameer Abdullah had a long kickoff return and then electric rookie tight end Brock Bowers had a great touchdown grab from 33 yards out. The Raiders trailed 16-10. Once again, the back-to-back champion Chiefs were in a closer game than anyone expected against one of the worst teams in the NFL. Then it got serious as the Raiders took a fourth-quarter lead. On the first play of the fourth quarter, O’Connell threw deep down the left sideline. Tre Tucker got behind the Chiefs secondary and caught a 58-yard touchdown that gave the Raiders a lead and gave everyone a jolt. At that moment, eight seconds into the fourth quarter, the Raiders had outplayed the Chiefs. At Arrowhead Stadium. With O’Connell returning from injury to play his first game in over a month. The Chiefs put together a drive into Raiders territory, though that stalled when both tackles were beaten on a third-and-goal play and Kansas City settled for a field goal and a 19-17 lead. Mahomes was visibly upset after that play, and on the next series guard Joe Thuney replaced Wanya Morris at left tackle. That’s a situation the Chiefs have to figure out before the playoffs. The Raiders had a shot to take a late lead. They drove into Chiefs territory in the final minutes. But with 2:17 left, not facing a decent option on fourth-and-11, Carlson tried a 58-yard field goal and was well short for his third miss of the day. Carlson has been one of the best kickers in the NFL over his career, but the Chiefs caught him on what might be his worst day as a pro. And because the Chiefs couldn’t put the game away, the Raiders had yet another chance. Bowers had a huge 25-yard catch down the middle to get the Raiders close to field-goal range, and then Jakobi Meyers and Ameer Abdullah made catches to get Las Vegas even closer. But the Raiders screwed up the shotgun snap, the Chiefs fell on it and the game was over. The play call came in late, and with the play clock winding down, O’Connell started clapping almost as soon as the huddle broke for the snap to come quickly. The left guard tapped Powers-Johnson, who snapped it before O’Connell was ready. It bounced off O'Connell and the Chiefs fell on it to end the game. The Chiefs haven’t played well for much of the season. But their record is still almost pristine, somehow. With the win and improving to an 11–1 record, the Chiefs have clinched a playoff spot. Ten years in a row, and it never gets old.

Las Vegas takes over at its 32-yard line with 5:15 remaining. The Raiders have to punt after Aidan O'Connell has to throw the ball away quickly on a Kansas City blitz up the middle. AJ Cole's 55-yard punt pushes the Chiefs back to their 17-yard line with 6:46 remaining in the fourth quarter. Wanya Morris lets K'Lavon Chaisson blow past him and he sacks Patrick Mahomes for a nine-yard loss on 3rd-and-goal from the 5-yard line.

Patrick Mahomes follows up with a 15-yard pass to DeAndre Hopkins and Kansas City is on the move. Just like that, the Raiders are on top. After the Chiefs go 3-and out, Las Vegas turns around and scores a TD in two plays. Aidan O'Connell connects with Tre Tucker streaking down the left sideline for a 58-yard score to tie the game.

The referees ruled that the catch happened at 14 seconds, but that it required a 10 second runoff, giving the Chiefs only four seconds left in the half.

The Chiefs are forced to punt, and Las Vegas will get a chance to make a play before the end of the first quarter. Stuck at 3rd & 16, Aidan O'Connell's seven-yard pass to Brock Bowers wasn't enough to move the chains, so Las Vegas went for the punt...and Raiders punter AJ Cole was able to get the ball at the one. A holding penalty called on the Chiefs moved the ball further back, half the distance to the goal. But wait! The referees corrected the mistake, saying that it was supposed to be called on the Raiders, and Cole redid the punt...and to make it more confusing, all of this happened during the commercial break. So here we are. Chiefs have the ball at the 23. We're all on the same page now. The Chiefs got into the red zone off a pass interference penalty, but two incomplete passes from Mahomes forced Kansas City to go for the field goal.

Lawrence, who is listed as questionable, has missed the past two Jaguars games due to a sprained left shoulder suffered on Nov. 3 against the Philadelphia Eagles. But after returning to practice this week there was hope he would be able to get back on the field this week. ""I think [the sprained AC joint] has been a pretty difficult thing to gauge, honestly, of what's the best path forward,"" Lawrence said Wednesday. ""[Surgery is] definitely something that I'm considering and not off the table at all. It's something that we're going to have to just [approach] truly day-by-day, week-by-week.

Purdy is dealing with a right shoulder injury and has yet to practice since getting hurt on Nov. 17 against the Seattle Seahawks. ""Anytime you go through an injury and stuff like that you want to know what's going on with your body and how long something could be or if something's serious or not, if you're healthy or not,"" Purdy said. ""All those things definitely ran through my mind. But glad everything was clean within the MRI and knowing that we had a plan to get ready for this week, and I'm ready to go now.""

At least for now. The 49ers announced they waived the second-year wide receiver on Friday, less than two seasons after San Francisco selected Bell No. 253 overall in the 2023 NFL Draft. Bell wraps up his 49ers tenure with eight receptions for 90 yards and three touchdowns across two seasons. The sophomore wideout has received plenty of criticism this season, most notably for a brutal performance in San Francisco's Week 2 loss to the Los Angeles Rams where Bell dropped multiple passes in critical spots. A year was all the difference, as Bell initially burst on the scene with a promising preseason for the 49ers during his rookie season. He finished the 2023 preseason with the NFL's fourth-most receiving yards, hauling in 10 receptions for 172 yards in three games. That initial momentum never developed into consistent production or playing time in the regular season, with Bell's high point likely being his first NFL touchdown in a primetime win over the New York Giants last season.

[Week 13 Full-PPR Fantasy Rankings: QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | FLEX | D/ST | Kickers] Over his past three games, Smith-Njigba has taken on an increased role in the offense, totaling 31 targets, 23 catches, 367 receiving yards and 3 TDs dating back to Week 9. That's good enough for a ranking as the overall WR5 in full-PPR scoring league formats, standing as one of just three wide receivers (the others being Tee Higgins and Ja'Marr Chase) to average 120+ receiving yards per game in that span. Will JSN continue to be a PPR cheat code thanks to a significant boost in target volume over the past four weeks?

While they have a 12-9-1 record, they have lost five straight games. Because of their struggles, the Rangers are ready to shake up their roster, as NHL insider Elliotte Friedman reported earlier this week. View the original article to see embedded media. Friedman specifically noted that Chris Kreider is one veteran who the Rangers are willing to listen to offers for. He is a player who the Buffalo Sabres should undoubtedly have on their radar. The Sabres need a top-six winger, and Kreider is just that. The 6-foot-3 winger has nine goals in 19 games this season and has scored at least 36 goals in his previous three seasons. This includes his monster 2021-22 season, where he had 52 goals and 77 points in 81 games. However, besides being an impactful scorer, Kreider is known for his immense physicality. Thus, he is a threat in more ways than one, so he would be a major addition if acquired by the Sabres. Yet, one notable obstacle in a potential Kreider move is his 15-team no-trade list. If the Sabres are on his no-trade list, they would not be able to acquire him unless he accepted a move to Buffalo. However, the Sabres would not need to worry about this possibility with Kaapo Kakko. © Dennis Schneidler-Imagn Images NHL insider Darren Dreger reported on TSN Insider Trading that Kakko's name has resurfaced in the trade market, and he is another Ranger who could possibly be traded. He is a player who the Sabres were previously linked to, so it would not be particularly surprising if they made a push for him. Kakko, 23, has had a solid start to the season, posting three goals, 12 points, and a plus-12 rating in 22 games. With numbers like these, he would be a solid addition to the Sabres' middle six. However, when noting that he is a former second-overall pick with high upside, he has the potential to hit a new level. Thus, he could be an excellent player for the Sabres to take a shot on.

If you like what you see, you can subscribe for free here. As you navigate your Sunday and Monday start-sit decisions, be mindful that you'll have more matchup information than usual. Four NFL games will be complete when we get to Sunday, which might help you break some fantasy ties as you decide if upside or floor is more important to your final choices. Here's a traffic-light report to help you out. He caught all six of his targets against Baltimore while Quentin Johnston went 0-for-5, mixing in multiple drops. It's shocking to me that McConkey has yet to see double-digit looks in any game, but this feels like the week the Chargers steer into their most reliable target. Justin Herbert will have plenty of time; the Atlanta pass rush is non-existent. You get a little anxious with the crowded backfield in Tampa Bay. Rachaad White will always have a role and even Sean Tucker scored last week, but Irving has the best metrics of the group and he's started to become the featured player. And the Panthers, as you know, are the dream matchup for running backs in 2024. Start Irving with confidence. He's a lock for 250 yards and two touchdowns these days, with the upside for more. With Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp both healthy again, this is a passing game to hang your hat on. Obviously he offers no floor, but that's not uncommon at tight end. But we know Hill is the most powerful goal-line option the Saints have, and the New Orleans offensive line has quietly gotten back to full health in recent weeks. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. If you want a juicy YPC, look elsewhere. If you want pass-catching work, we can't help you. But Edwards carries goal-line equity, and I suspect a short score will push him into double-digit fantasy points this week. The Arizona matchup is slightly harder than average, but Darnold's been more consistent than many realize. He's posted a QB rating over 100 in 9-of-11 starts, and he has multiple touchdown passes in eight games. I realize Cincinnati is the NFL's ultimate carnival team — they score a bunch, they allow a bunch— but Pittsburgh's offensive identity rarely changes, no matter the matchup. The Steelers want to run to set up the run, which means Wilson probably doesn't make it past 30 attempts no matter how the game goes. I suppose he's playable in some spots, but I'm not eager to punch the ticket. Normally I'd be lukewarm on a 34-year-old tight end who specializes in the catch-and-fall, but with Austin Ekeler probably out, Ertz will be the first read whenever Jayden Daniels needs a short throw around the middle of the field. Touchdown deodorant saved him in Week 12, but he's been a diminished runner all year, yet to pass 60 yards on the ground. We talk about Denver's sterling secondary a lot, but the Broncos also have a top-five rushing defense. Tank Bigsby is expected back to muddy the playing time, and Houston's run defense ranks No. 2 in rushing DVOA. Anytime I can proactively avoid the 2024 Jaguars, I'm in favor of it. He had the nifty touchdown on Monday night but his market share is usually modest when Isaiah Likely is around, and Baltimore's unlikely to throw more than 30 passes against anyone. The Eagles have also been excellent in seam coverage all year. This one hurts, because I've been invested in his breakout all year. But Brock Purdy is a question mark and the Buffalo area is welcoming a major snowstorm. It's a good week to tuck Jennings on your bench, preferably with a ski cap on."

"Yahoo! Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",Fantasy Football Week 13 Fades: Expect a lower ceiling for Lamar Jackson,https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy-football-week-13-fades-expect-a-lower-ceiling-for-lamar-jackson-151937702.html,"Fri, 29 Nov 2024 15:19:37 GMT",Beware of these six players with bust potential in Week 13!,"Another week, another round of crucially important start/sit decisions. To help you make them, here's a look at six players with bust potential in Week 13. Something to keep in mind as you're reading: a ""fade"" or ""bust"" designation doesn't automatically mean you should sit a player, depending on the depth of the rest of your roster or available options on your waiver wire. OK, OK. Hear me out. This is not at all a call to sit fantasy football's overall QB1 on the year — not by any stretch of the imagination. However, my duty as the resident ""busts and fades"" columnist is to warn of potential landmines in your lineups — to warn you of not just players you should avoid entirely for fantasy, but to also advise when the stats say a player's ceiling could be lower than it usually is. After all, that knowledge can change the way you approach setting the rest of your lineup. Lamar Jackson has had the safest floor of any fantasy quarterback this season; he's finished outside of the top 12 just once (Week 11 vs. Steelers), and has finished as a top-five QB in seven of 12 games this season — the perfect blend of upside and safety at the position we've hardly ever seen. This week, Jackson will face a surging Eagles defense that has made big-time strides in both their coverage and rushing defense through the second half of the season. Heat check 🔥 You're still starting Lamar Jackson in every one of your season-long fantasy lineups; just brace yourself for a potential down week. James Conner's fantasy managers have been on a wild ride so far this season, with his production anywhere between his 21-122-1 line in Week 2 on to his 7 carry, 8 rushing-yard outing in Week 12. Like I said — a roller coaster. It does feel like the down weeks are getting a little more frequent, however. Over his past four games, he's averaged just over 50 rush yards per game (37.3 yards receiving). He's averaged 3.53 yards per carry in that span and a 22.8% stuff rate that ranks sixth-highest among the 26 RBs with 50+ carries dating back to Week 8. In addition to Conner's waning efficiency in recent weeks, he's got a challenging matchup on deck with the Minnesota Vikings — one of the most formidable rushing defenses in the league this season. The Vikings lead the league with an 86.1 PFF run defense grade, the fourth-lowest average depth of tackle (3.41 yards) and a league-low 27 missed tackles. Minnesota's defense is tied for a league-low five rush TDs allowed this year, allowing the second-lowest YPC average (3.6), second-fewest yards after contact per attempt (2.4) and third-lowest explosive run rate (9.4%), all amounting to the second-fewest fantasy PPG to opposing RBs. Heat check 🔥 As the starting running back on a good (albeit inconsistent) offense, it's challenging to leave Conner on your bench. However, given that all 32 teams are playing this week, you've got more options than you did in Week 12. If you've got better flex options (Bucky Irving, for example), don't hesitate to start them over Conner this week. I have a distinct feeling that Jeremy McNichols will be on plenty of sleepers lists this week as an ""in case of emergency"" button. Commanders starting RB Brian Robinson Jr. is dealing with a high ankle sprain, and his status is up in the air for Week 13. Meanwhile, teammate Austin Ekeler is in the concussion protocol after suffering a brutal hit on a kickoff return in the same matchup. That leaves McNichols, Mr. RB3, to fill their shoes. Even if McNichols gets the start in Week 13, he's got a challenging matchup on deck up against the Tennessee Titans, who have been a stout rushing defense this season. The Titans have the fourth-most-highly-graded rushing defense unit this year, tied for the fifth-lowest YPC average allowed (4.0), seventh-fewest rush yards after contact per attempt (2.7) with the fourth-fewest tackles for a loss or no gain in that span per PFF. Heat check 🔥 McNichols remains on fantasy benches in most fantasy leagues, even if he does get the start and will see volume. It's no secret that the Washington Commanders' Kliff Kingsbury-led offense has cooled since their red-hot start to the season. Terry McLaurin in particular has been a huge beneficiary of improved quarterback play, sitting pretty as the overall WR5 in half-PPR scoring formats, averaging a career-best 15.8 YPR, already having tied his previous career high of seven receiving touchdowns through just 12 games. The Titans are allowing the fourth-fewest fantasy points per game to opposing WRs, yet to give up a single game of 18+ fantasy points any opponents this year, despite having faced some solid competition (Nico Collins, Justin Jefferson, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Garrett Wilson). This team is allowing the third-lowest successful play rate in the league on targets to WRs this season at 45.7% per NFL Next Gen Stats, giving up the fourth-fewest yards per target and the fifth-lowest completion rate on such plays all season (59%). Heat check 🔥 Slot McLaurin into your Week 13 lineups, but with the expectation that the best bet for a big fantasy day is another 86-yard house call to save the day. There's no doubt that Buffalo Bills WR Khalil Shakir has been one of the safest targets in the league this year. He's got reliable hands for days with an 87.5% catch rate dating back to last season that leads all WRs (min. 50 targets, inc. postseason). He's also incredibly efficient with his opportunities and a 124.5 passer rating when targeted (third-highest) while averaging 7.7 yards after the catch per reception (fourth-highest). However, Week 13 could challenge his typically safe floor. Shakir's consistent volume (7+ targets in each of the past five games) has made him a popular flex/sleeper option in any given week. However, the San Francisco 49ers could be a limiting factor for him in Week 13, even if there are some vacated targets over the middle in the absence of an injured Dalton Kincaid. Though the Niners are currently a bit of a dumpster fire, LB Fred Warner remains the glue holding their middle-of-the-field coverage together. Warner continues his standing as one of the best coverage linebackers in the league, and he's limited slot receivers in a big way. Dating back to Week 7, the 49ers are allowing the second-lowest EPA per play on slot targets (-0.176), giving up 0 TDs, 3 INTs and a league-low 46.3 passer rating on such plays. Shakir, who operates primarily out of the slot at a 75.8% clip this season, could see a decline in his efficiency in this spot. Heat check 🔥 Shakir is a fine bye-week fill-in, but with all 32 teams in the mix, his ceiling isn't quite high enough to risk a down week in a challenging matchup. The Jacksonville Jaguars are coming off a Week 12 bye, which means TE Evan Engram is freshly rested and ready to take on all the work he can handle. There should be plenty of work in store for him this week, as the team received more bad injury news ahead of their bye, losing WR Gabe Davis for the season with a knee injury after already missing Christian Kirk (also out for the season with a broken collarbone). Even if he does see some decent volume, though, it might not be a great matchup for a big-time fantasy day. In Week 13, the Jaguars get a challenging intradivisional matchup with the Houston Texans — a matchup that has made for some disappointing TE performances for even the league's best. Houston ranks 27th with 7.51 fantasy points per game allowed to opposing TEs (3.3-25.5-0.4 average line), while averaging the third-lowest EPA per dropback and a league-low 39.1% successful play rate on targets to the TE position per NFL Next Gen Stats. Heat check 🔥 Engram should have a solid floor in half- and full-PPR scoring formats due to the necessity of target volume, but don't expect big-time efficiency. This defense has allowed just three TEs all season to surpass the 50-receiving-yard mark."

Sports - News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games",4 Keys to a Week 13 fantasy football victory (and one RB stash for the future),https://sports.yahoo.com/4-keys-to-a-week-13-fantasy-football-victory-and-one-rb-stash-for-the-future-151156571.html,"Fri, 29 Nov 2024 15:11:56 GMT","Fantasy football analyst Sal Vetri offers up some tips for navigating Week 13, plus one RB worth stashing ahead of the playoffs!","Dominate your fantasy football leagues in Week 13 with these keys to victory. It’s the second straight week where Irving has claimed the crown for the best spot of the week. Last week, he faced the Giants who allow the most rushing yards per play. New York also ranks top-five in explosive plays allowed to running backs. Irving made the absolute most of this matchup by turning 18 touches into 151 total yards and a touchdown. He was also tackled twice on the 1-yard line and saw Sean Tucker vulture both of the following goal-line carries. Irving now enters an even better matchup. He’ll take on the Panthers who allow the most rushing yards per game and second-most rushing touchdowns this season. The Bucs rookie is trending up at the right time and was a clear focal point of their offense coming out of the bye week. Irving and the Bucs come into this game as six-point favorites. Expect even more touches if the Bucs can play with a lead, just like we saw in Week 12 against the Giants. Conner is coming off one of his worst games of the season. In Week 12, Conner turned seven carries into just eight total rushing yards. He was able to salvage his day by catching five passes for 41 yards. It was a down game but overall this season Conner has been great. He’s averaging 5.2 yards per touch and ranks first in broken tackle rate this year according to Player Profiler. He’s seen a strong role, averaging over 18 opportunities per game, and Conner ranks eighth in red-zone touches this season. Those are the cheat-code touches that lead to big fantasy days. Conner profiles out as a league-winning running back due to his strong fantasy playoff schedule. But that strong schedule doesn’t include this week’s sketchy spot. Conner has to face the Vikings' No. 1-ranked run defense according to PFF. Minnesota allows the fewest rushing yards per game and second-fewest rushing touchdowns this year. It’s difficult to sit Conner due to his strong role, but if you have better options, you should consider them. Subscribe to Yahoo Fantasy Forecast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you listen. Thomas returns from his bye week to face the Texans. Houston is fresh off a game where it allowed Will Levis to complete 75% of his passes for 278 yards and two touchdowns. In this game, the Titans had four different pass-catchers totaling at least 11 fantasy points. Calvin Ridley led the way with five catches for 93 yards. This is a solid spot for Thomas as he returns from his bye. The last time we saw Thomas he was totaling 82 yards on five catches against the Lions in Week 11. This was his best game with Mac Jones at QB and it was encouraging to see Thomas being used more in the short to intermediate parts of the field. This type of usage pairs better with Jones, who isn’t known for consistently being able to hit downfield throws. There’s a chance we get Trevor Lawrence back this week; that would certainly cement Thomas as a must-start. But if Lawrence can’t go, I saw enough in Week 11 to feel confident starting Thomas against the Texans, especially since the Jaguars are coming out of their bye week with an extra week to prepare for this matchup. Jaguars WR Gabe Davis also notably suffered a season-ending knee injury in Week 11, which could put Thomas in line for some extra targets. Moore could be a sneaky play this week if you are struggling to find a solid FLEX option. The last time we saw Moore was on Thursday Night Football in Week 12 — the crazy weather game against Pittsburgh. It was difficult for either passing game to find success given the conditions, and this impacted Moore’s fantasy day as he turned five targets into just three catches for 21 yards. It was not a good day by any means, but the context of poor weather allows us to look past this down performance. Before this game, Moore was averaging 9.7 targets per contest with Jameis Winston under center. This is great usage, and it could get even better in Week 13 as WR Cedric Tillman is in the concussion protocol. If Tillman is out or limited, we could see Jerry Jeudy play more on the outside for the Browns in Week 13. This matters because the Browns face the Broncos this week. If Jeudy was forced to play more on the outside, he’d likely line up against standout cornerback Patrick Surtain II. This could put Moore in a beneficial spot working out of the slot against Denver. Moore is available in over 80% of Yahoo leagues right now and he’s worth a pickup if you are desperate at FLEX this week. The fantasy playoffs are just a few weeks away and right now is the perfect time to start preparing. One way to set yourself up for success is by stashing high-value running backs. These are guys on good offenses who would likely take over a large portion of their team's backfield touches if the starter ahead of them were to go down. One of the best running back stashes right now is Trey Benson (24% rostered). Benson is the Cardinals' third-round rookie out of Florida State. He’s best known for his elite combination of size, power and speed. In 2022, Benson broke the college football broken tackle record which was previously held by guys like David Montgomery and Kenneth Walker III. This broken tackle success has carried over into the NFL, where Benson ranks top 12 among all backs with a 26% broken tackle rate. He’s only earned 58 touches this season but he’s looked good on this limited sample averaging five yards per touch. If James Conner were to miss time, Benson would likely step into Conner’s workhorse role in the Arizona offense. Conner is 29 years old and he’s missed on average four games per season in his NFL career. What makes Benson an even better stash is the Cardinals' fantasy playoff schedule. Arizona will take on the Patriots, Panthers and Rams in the fantasy postseason. The Patriots rank 25th in run defense according to PFF, the Panthers currently allow the most rushing yards per game and the Rams gave up 124 yards and a touchdown to James Conner already this season back in Week 2. Benson is a priority stash as the fantasy playoffs approach."

One day later, he was between the pipes, leading the Minnesota Wild to another victory. According to the league's Public Relations, with his 3-2 win over the Chicago Blackhawks on Friday night, Fleury joins Hockey Hall of Famer Martin Brodeur as the only goalies to win NHL games as a teenager and 40-year-old. After celebrating his 40th birthday yesterday, Marc-Andre Fleury collected his fifth straight win and extended his season-opening point streak to six games – tied for the second longest in @mnwild history.#NHLStats: https://t.co/l682TYcpDg pic.twitter.com/FWlK1gkzqa — NHL Public Relations (@PR_NHL) November 29, 2024 Fleury's first win came as a member of the Penguins, who drafted him first overall in 2003 on Oct. 18, 2003 against the Detroit Red Wings. Twenty years later, on Jan. 15, 2024, he moved into second place on the NHL's all-time wins list with his 552nd victory. It's only fitting that Fleury finds himself in another category alone with Brodeur after Friday's win, as the two have secured the first (691) and second-most (566) wins in professional hockey history. Moreover, if Fleury could play 14 more games before retiring, he'd overtake Roberto Luongo (1,044) and be behind Brodeur (1,266) for most games played. Fleury seems to be making history every night he straps on his pads. Fans across the league should embrace the next five months because the next time we see The Flower, it will be at a jersey retirement ceremony or his Hockey Hall of Fame induction."
"Yahoo!

If you can give your fans an edge over the opposition at every cookout, church social, grocery store line and tee box in the state of Alabama for an entire year, well, that washes away a whole lot of sins. And right now, there are a couple coaches in sore need of the kind of divine providence that comes with an Iron Bowl victory. It’s always been this way, every time Auburn and Alabama have squared up. Gene Stallings, national championship-winning head coach at Alabama and disciple of Bear Bryant, had a simple rule for coaching in Tuscaloosa. “If you want to be a successful coach at Alabama, you’ve got to beat Auburn,” he said in 2013. “You don’t have to beat them every year, but you have to beat them more than they beat you.” The same rule applies on The Plains. You can fumble your way through an entire season at Auburn, but if you can close out the year with a win over those elitists from Alabama — even better, if you can ruin their title hopes — that buys you both good grace and job security. Between the two of them, Alabama’s Kalen DeBoer and Auburn’s Hugh Freeze have coached in a grand total of one (1) Iron Bowl. That one was an instant classic — last year’s “Gravedigger” Alabama victory — but even the games that appear routine from outside Alabama carry epochal weight. “To sit in this seat and to lose one like we did last year still doesn’t sit right,” Freeze said earlier this week. “I know that the Auburn faithful had to endure that, and we want to change that feeling in this building and for our great fan base in this state.” “Ever since I’ve been here, I think I hear about it every day,” DeBoer said this week, “and understand what it means and the excitement.” All due respect to the head coach of the Alabama Crimson Tide, but he can’t yet really understand it. Not until kickoff, and not until the aftermath, one way or the other. For coaches, the weight of the Iron Bowl looms like storm clouds in the distance. Former Alabama head coach Bill Curry failed to win the Iron Bowl in all three of his attempts for Alabama, including the first one ever played at Auburn’s Jordan-Hare Stadium, and he (allegedly) got a brick thrown through his window for his efforts. After the third loss, he decamped from Tuscaloosa for a lower-stress job leading the Kentucky Wildcats. The opposite holds true, as well. Former Auburn coach Tommy Tuberville once won six straight over Alabama — his final victory came over first-year Alabama coach Nick Saban — and parlayed the name value from that success into a U.S. Senate seat a decade later. Freeze got the Auburn job in part because of his success in beating Saban back-to-back in the mid-2010s while at Ole Miss. “It’s talked about, and not just told to me, but talked about amongst everyone in their homes, and it’s Thanksgiving weekend, so if you’re not at the game, you’re home watching it with your friends and family,” DeBoer said. “Heard stories of families being divided because of it in many different ways, so that’s what rivalry games are all about, and I know this is a rivalry that’s on another level.” Freeze may have kept the wolves at bay with last week’s upset win over Texas A&M, but he would quiet them down nicely with a victory over Alabama. That would be Auburn’s sixth win of the season, making the Tigers bowl-eligible and quelling concerns that Freeze isn’t the guy to get this program back to national competitiveness. DeBoer is walking an even higher tightrope. Alabama (8-3) hasn’t lost more than three games — or totaled single-digit wins — since Saban’s first year, when the Tide had an on-field record of 7-6. Yes, DeBoer is still in his first year, but an uninspiring record, a failure to make a 12-team playoff field, and a loss to Auburn? Honeymoon long over, trial separation already under consideration. At both Alabama and Auburn, victory in the Iron Bowl is both necessary and sufficient for a head coach to claim success. National championships will get statues built of you, but wins in the Iron Bowl make day-to-day life a whole lot easier. Beat those blue bloods, or that cow college, on the other side of the state, and all’s right with the world. Lose, and it’s a long 364 days … with no guarantee you’ll be around to see the next one."

It happens in various communities throughout the country every year, to high-school players. This week, Medrick Burnett Jr. of Alabama A&M died of a head injury he sustained on the field last month. Burnett, a redshirt freshman from Lakewood, California, suffered the injury on October 26, in a game against Alabama State. Via the Associated Press, Burnett died on Wednesday night. He was 20. And football life goes on, as it always seems to do. Few if any will decide to stop playing when they hear about Burnett's passing. Most will reconcile it by saying, as Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa did last month, ""There’s just risk in any and everything and I’m willing to play the odds."" The NFL hasn't had an in-game fatality since 1971, when Lions receiver Chuck Hughes died of a pre-existing heart condition. In July 2009, then-Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer predicted a player would inevitably die during an NFL game. ""The truth of the matter is . . . somebody is going to die here in the NFL,"" Palmer said at the time. ""It’s going to happen."" It almost happened in early 2023, when a routine hit triggered commotio cordis for Bills safety Damar Hamlin. If/when it happens, what will happen to the NFL? Given that the death of Medrick Burnett Jr. has been received more like an afterthought and less like the major story it should be, those who play football at all levels likely will be inclined to shrug, to regard the situation as a fluke, and to keep going. That's not to say anyone should stop. Everyone has the right to engage in a broad range of risky behaviors. Many take far greater risks than football players do, for far less money. (Hell, some pay good money for the rush of staring down serious injury or death.) The point is that, when it happens, there seems to be little or no soul searching or reassessing. As Joe Burrow said after Tua's serious concussion from late September 2022 against the Bengals, ""Part of what we signed up for. You’re gonna have head injuries. You’re gonna tear your ACL. You’re gonna break your arm. That’s the game that we play, that’s the life that we live and we get paid handsomely for it. I think going into every game, we know what we’re getting ourselves into."" More than a decade ago, once the risks of brain injuries became clear and obvious, many assumed football would wither and die. Some in the media seemed to actually be rooting for that to happen, twisting themselves in knots to tie any and every retirement to concerns about concussions. And here we are. In late 2024, the game is stronger than ever. The people who play it accept the risks.

The speedy infielder helped the Cardenales de Lara secure their doubleheader sweep on Friday as he reached base four times, stole three bases, drove in three runs, and scored three runs of his own. Acuña is now hitting .388 with two doubles, one triple, one home run, nine RBI, nine stolen bases, and an impressive .996 OPS over his first 17 Winter League games. Most of his time in the field has been spent at shortstop, only logging one outfield appearance thus far. The youngster had a bit of an up-and-down campaign in the minors, but he filled in admirably when called upon to make his highly-anticipated big-league debut in place of the injured Francisco Lindor down the stretch. Acuña showcased his strong defense and game-changing speed while also hitting an impressive .308 with a triple, two doubles, three home runs, and a .966 OPS across 14 games. While he certainly made a positive impression, it remains to be seen what type of role he'll play this season in a crowded Mets infield with even more young infield talent on the way. “Any time you’re able to make an impression at the major league level it’s a good thing,"" David Stearns said at the GM Meetings. ""He obviously performed at a very important time of the season for us. We also understand it was a couple of weeks, and I think we have a significant amount of performance history on all of those guys to fall back.”"

They found themselves the reluctant recipients of  a  122-103 punch to the gut against the Nuggets.

Still, the Buckeyes will likely still find a place in the College Football Playoff come Sunday, Dec. 8 when the field is announced. The absolute floor for Ohio State in the College Football Playoff Rankings is No. 10 Indiana despite the fact the Buckeyes will potentially finish with one more loss than the Hoosiers. They have two top-10 wins, one of which was a dominant 38-15 victory over Indiana just last week. Between that and the Hoosiers' poor strength of schedule, there is not much they can do to Purdue to prove they belong ahead of Ohio State. There is also a case for the Buckeyes to stay ahead of No. 8 Tennessee, which won at Vanderbilt on Saturday. Their losses are similar, and Ohio State has two wins over teams that are higher ranked than the Volunteers' best win, which is No. 13 Alabama.  Tennessee is also a playoff lock following its win on Saturday. The decision over which of Ohio State or Tennessee is ranked higher could end up determining who hosts a matchup between the two in a first-round CFP game. Ohio State could still win the Big Ten, but it is asking a lot. Penn State would have to lose to Maryland and Indiana would have kick the (Old Oaken) Bucket against Purdue. That reverts everything back to the three-way tie we had to start the day, and the Buckeyes would still win that because of head-to-head results with the Nittany Lions and Hoosiers."

Now they'll have to do so without two notable names, on Saturday releasing 2023 first-round draft pick Emmanuel Forbes while placing running back Austin Ekeler on injured reserve. Forbes, 23, had been a healthy scratch for the Commanders multiple times this season. His exit is nonetheless notable, considering Washington drafted the Mississippi State product No. 16 overall in 2023. After appearing in 14 games as a rookie, the young cover man struggled to find a role under new management this summer, and dipped farther on the cornerback depth chart after the in-season trade acquisition of former New Orleans Saints star Marshon Lattimore, who's yet to make his Washington debut. Forbes posted a reference to Job 8:7-17 upon his release, seemingly hinting at his abrupt tenure in Washington: ""Your beginnings will seem humble, so prosperous will your future be."" Ekeler, meanwhile, has been a steady change-of-pace back for the Commanders' offense when healthy, though he suffered his second concussion of the 2024 season in Week 12. His move to injured reserve guarantees at least a four-game absence, meaning he'll be sidelined for all but one of the Commanders' remaining regular-season games, and perhaps the rest of the year. Signed to a one-year deal this offseason after seven seasons with the Los Angeles Chargers, Ekeler has totaled 701 yards from scrimmage in tandem with Brian Robinson Jr., securing 33 catches as a secondary passing outlet for rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels. His absence figures to result in more touches for reserve back Jeremy McNichols, who's set to serve as the No. 2 alongside Robinson this week."

They have jumped out to a quick  40-34 lead against Rutgers.  If Texas A&M keeps playing like this, they'll bump their record up to 6-2 in no time. On the other hand, Rutgers will have to make due with  a  5-3 record unless they turn things around (and fast).  Rutgers Scarlet Knights @ Texas A&M Aggies Current Records: Rutgers 5-2, Texas A&M 5-2  The Texas A&M Aggies' road trip will continue as they head out to face the Rutgers Scarlet Knights at 3:30  p.m.  ET on Saturday at MGM Grand Garden Arena. The Aggies are strutting in with some offensive muscle as they've averaged 77.3  points per game  this season.  Last Wednesday, Texas A&M didn't have too much breathing room in their  match against Creighton, but they still walked away with a  77-73 win.  Among those leading the charge was   Henry Coleman III, who  almost  dropped  a double-double on 17 points and nine  rebounds.  Texas A&M  smashed the offensive glass and  finished the game with 21  offensive rebounds. That strong performance was nothing new for the team: they've now  pulled down at least ten  offensive rebounds in 19 consecutive  matchups  dating back to last season.  Meanwhile, Rutgers' game  on Wednesday was all tied up 41-41 at the half, but sadly for them it didn't stay that way. They took  a  95-90 hit to the loss column at the hands of Alabama. Despite running the score up even higher than they did in their prior game  on Tuesday (85), the Scarlet Knights still had to take the loss.  Dylan Harper put forth a good effort for the losing side as  he  went 11 for 19 en route to 37 points plus two  steals. His evening made it three games in a row in which  he has scored at least 22.4 points. The team also got some help courtesy of  Ace Bailey, who  had 22 points along with two  steals.  Texas A&M's victory bumped their record up to 5-2. As for Rutgers, their defeat dropped their record down to an identical 5-2.  Rebounding is likely to be a big factor in this contest:  Texas A&M has crashing the boards this season,  having  averaged 45.1  rebounds per game. However, it's not like Rutgers struggles in that department as   they've been averaging 36.3. With both teams battling to corral missed shots, we'll see if one team can grab an edge.  Texas A&M is hoping to beat the odds  on Saturday, as the experts think they're headed for a loss. This will be their first time playing  as the underdogs this season.  Rutgers is a 4.5-point favorite against Texas A&M, according to the latest college basketball odds. The oddsmakers had a good feel for the line for this one, as the game opened with the Scarlet Knights as a 5.5-point favorite. The over/under is 148.5  points.

They'll have a key reinforcement for their on-field efforts, however, with star linebacker Matt Milano activated from injured reserve Saturday. Milano's activation comes two weeks after the Pro Bowler was designated to return, and all but confirms Buffalo's plan to play the veteran against the 49ers. Milano was a full participant at Bills practice this week, taking noticeable strides in his recovery from a torn biceps suffered in August. The 30-year-old Milano has been one of the NFL's most productive linebackers when healthy, but he also missed extensive time in 2023, when a leg fracture cost him all but five games. Third-year veteran Terrel Bernard has served as Buffalo's top linebacker in his absence. In 2022, his last healthy season, Milano logged a career-high 72 solo tackles, 11 pass breakups and three interceptions, helping the Bills advance to the Divisional Round of the playoffs. An All-Pro selection that year, he also posted a career-high 15 tackles for loss the season prior."

The Longhorns are cruising in their first year as an SEC member and sit in sole possession of first place in the conference, already achieving back-to-back 10-win seasons for the first time since 2009.  Texas A&M is in the midst of a resurgence under first-year coach Mike Elko. The Aggies are contending for a spot in the SEC Championship Game after beating LSU and Missouri. However, a 43-41 quadruple-overtime loss to Auburn last week narrowed their path, making this a must-win matchup.  The Longhorns and Aggies have played 118 times and Texas holds a dominant 76-37-5 advantage. The last time these teams played, the Longhorns mustered only 237 yards but outlasted Texas A&M 27-25 in 2011. This one carries much bigger stakes. The winner will play in the SEC Championship Game against Georgia and have a shot to win their first SEC titles.  History reignites: The last time these two teams met was in 2011, the final matchup between these two schools as Big 12 members. Justin Tucker's game-winning field goal went down in history as the rivalry sat dormant for 13 years. Surprisingly, these two teams have rarely been good at the same time. The last time both teams were ranked coming into the matchup was 2004. On paper, this is the highest-ranked matchup since No. 1 Texas traveled to No. 12 Texas A&M in 1977. The energy will be off the charts.  Strength on weakness: Texas is good nearly everywhere on defense, but the Longhrns have been a little more lenient on the ground -- ranking middle of the pack in the SEC in yards per carry. While Texas A&M isn't super efficient running the ball, they love to lean on it. The Aggies trail only Tennessee in rushing offense and yards per carry at 4.96, and are actually the best in SEC play alone. Expect offensive coordinator Collin Klein to stress test the interior of the Texas defensive line repeatedly.  A tale of two QBs: Quarterbacks Quinn Ewers and Marcel Reed couldn't be much more different. Ewers was a former No. 1 recruit who is in his third year as a starter. Reed was a mid-four star who was thrust into action as a former backup. Still, both bring some clear strengths and weaknesses. Ewers has been inconsistent with his long ball and is dealing with a nagging ankle injury. Reed is still developing as a passer, and his poor first half doomed Texas A&M against Auburn. Whichever signal-caller is more consistent will be in great shape to win the game.  Date: Saturday, Nov. 30 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ET Location: Kyle Field -- College Station, Texas TV: ABC | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)  Texas is the better team, they will contend for a national title and have more players picked in the NFL Draft. The Aggies are still searching for identity under first-year coach Mike Elko and need quarterback Marcel Reed to develop quickly. And yet, there's truly no telling what will happen in the renewal of this historic rivalry game. Texas got the last one at the buzzer, and it could easily go a similar direction this time.

CBSSports.com Headlines,Gabriel proves he is world's best scoring defender as Arsenal star delivers again in 5-2 win at West Ham,https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/gabriel-proves-he-is-worlds-best-scoring-defender-as-arsenal-star-delivers-again-in-5-2-win-at-west-ham/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 21:10:22 +0000",The Brazilian scored his 17th Premier League goal on Saturday,"LONDON -- This time, Michail Antonio is not letting go. It's Arsenal's third corner of the match and the West Ham No. 9 has already discovered more than enough about what happens if he cannot keep Gabriel Magalhaes in his vicinity. Antonio gets his arms around his opponent's trunk, taking hold of man rather than shirt. Declan Rice fires towards the near post. Gabriel isn't getting anywhere near there. It's probably not a foul even if it is a fair way from your standard jockeying for position. Antonio might be dicing with danger but the damage to the cause could be all the greater if he lets Gabriel go away. When you're matching up against the most effective deadball weapon in the sport, gambling on what the officials might think of your grappling seems a shrewd approach. Anything to stop the best-scoring big man not named Joel Embiid. By the time Gabriel departed this contest at the interval, he had had a sizeable role in two of Arsenal's five, not once but twice swinging an utterly ludicrous affair in the direction of the visitors. So dangerous is the Brazilian when Bukayo Saka and Rice stand over a deadball that his 10th-minute opener seemed utterly predictable from the moment he, the last man to join the deadball arsenal, trotted into position. It was a rather different spot than usual. In recent weeks, Gabriel has planted himself front and center of the deadball efforts, hovering at the penalty spot and demanding one or two defenders come to him. Across from him, a great mass of shirts intent on dragging the other team into the vortex, freeing a line for big Gabi. This time, Gabriel placed himself in the oversized scrum half role, hovering on the peripheries of the maul. If one might mix sporting metaphors, what appeared to be a scrum instead took on another form. Riccardo Calafiori, Kai Havertz, perhaps even Leandro Trossard and William Saliba, were all setting picks for Gabriel to curl his run around. Antonio couldn't get through the tumult and none of the black shirts were letting their West Ham men abandon their assignments. From the back post to the front, the best goalscoring center back of the last five years had an unobstructed path to goal. Everyone knew what was coming next. Gabriel's belief in his scoring prowess has proven to be infective. ""He has a real belief,"" said Mikel Arteta. ""The more it happens the more you believe it. You can tell straight away from the body language of the player, how they communicate, that something is coming."" So Gabriel delivered what was his 17th goal from a set piece since he arrived in the Premier League a tempestuous youngster in the summer of 2020. His first appearance rather set the tone -- rising high, heading down -- but no one could have expected such a remorseless accrual of deadball goals since. A centerback who has never had a shot of a free kick has scored 17 Premier League goals, three more than anyone else has accrued from non-penalty set pieces since the start of the 2020-21 season. Free kick wizard James Ward-Prowse, the only man whose right foot can be compared to a wand? Fourteen. The great poacher Mohamed Salah? Twelve. Big Virg, Big Dunky, Big Stonesy? Ten. Since the start of last season, only Robert Lewandowski matches his return of seven set-piece goals across Europe's big five leagues. These are numbers of yore, Steve Bruceian. Ronald Koeman-esque. Quite the helpful addition for a team that, unlike their title rivals, likes to spread the scoring far and wide. Gabriel might have had another before the break. Hitting Antonio with the hesitation, he burst away, springing high enough that his head rose higher than the arm of Lukasz Fabianski, who could only graze Gabriel with his left fist. Arsenal's second penalty was the outcome, Bukayo Saka adding to Martin Odegaard's earlier on as Arsenal quelled the nerves that might have been building when Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Emerson struck two remarkable goals in as many minutes. Who knows if more might have come in the second half? The injury that had forced him off in Tuesday's win at Sporting meant 45 minutes was all Gabriel could offer. ""He did great to be a part of that,"" said Arteta. ""With that result and the state he is feeling, we decided to take him off."" Gabriel is only honing his craft. The shots he gets from set pieces are of a remarkably high quality. Consider that heading the football tends to have a quite significantly negative impact on the xG value of a shot. The average xG of a shot in Europe's top five leagues is around 0.1 to 0.11. A Gabriel header since the start of last season is worth 0.16. These are seriously good openings that his movement and Arsenal's blocking are creating. There is a meticulousness to the forging of Gabriel's opportunities. Before Saka's delivery went in his center back was across to tell him where it was supposed to go -- this being Saka he hit it on a dime. Calafiori and Havertz were instructed on their blocking. As to what William Saliba was told, I can only speculate. Maybe something along the lines of, ""I got this chief."" At the final whistle, a warm handshake with set piece Nicolas Jover, who might want to keep an eye over his shoulder. Gabriel is going to do him out of a job with all this on-field micromanagement. The end result of this all feels a little like when Steph Curry comes off two pindown screens. Just with a higher probability of a goal. Because if you haven't gotten to Gabriel before the ball has gone into the box, you're already too late."

The Gators and Seminoles have played every year since 1958, except for 2020 when leagues around the nation adjusted their schedules to include conference-only games in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Florida leads the series with a 37-28-2 record, but modern games have favored Florida State. The Seminoles are riding a two-game winning streak and have come out on top in nine of 13 games since 2010. Seven of those wins have come by at least two possessions.  But this year's ""Sunshine Showdown"" tells the story of two programs headed in opposite directions, especially when considering preseason expectations. Florida coach Billy Napier entered the year on one of the hottest seats in college football, and a relatively lackluster start did not do much to help his case. Since the administration reaffirmed its faith in Napier, though, the Gators have ripped off two straight SEC wins against ranked opponents.  In Week 13 they downed Ole Miss 24-17, snapping a six-game losing streak against top-10 teams. Florida State, on the other hand, entered the year as a top-10 team fresh off a 2023 campaign in which it finished the regular season 12-0 and won the ACC championship.  The Seminoles dropped their season opener against Georgia Tech and have been in a spiral since, with a 2-9 record and just one win against an FBS opponent.  Freshmen in the spotlight: For the first time in series history, both Florida and Florida State will start freshmen quarterbacks in Saturday's game. DJ Lagway, the No. 1 signal caller in the class of 2024, has been a mainstay in the Gators' rotation all year, but he took the starting job when incumbent Graham Mertz suffered an ACL injury on Oct. 12 against Tennessee. Lagway has given Florida fans plenty to be excited about during his time on the field. He's thrown for 1,477 yards and nine touchdowns while rushing for 105 yards thus far. His arm talent is apparent any time he uncorks a deep ball, but his accuracy on long throws is impressive for a quarterback this early into his collegiate career.  Florida State was put into its own tough quarterback situation in October when DJ Uiagelelei injured his throwing hand. The Seminoles have tried a couple different options in the wake of Uiagalelei's setback, which led to freshman Luke Kromenhoek earning his first career start in Week 13 against Charleston Southern. Kromenhoek completed 13 of his 20 passes for 2019 yards and three touchdowns in the win.  A lot on the line for Florida State: Florida State is far from bowl contention at this point, but the Seminoles still have plenty to play for -- even beyond bragging rights against a top in-state rival. The Seminoles have a chance to avoid losing 10 games for the first time since 1974 and just the third time in program history. Florida State snapped a six-game losing streak in Week 13's win against Charleston Southern, so the Seminoles are on the right track. They have already become the third FBS team since 1998 to win their conference and then finish last in that same conference the following season. Florida State is also the first ACC program to take sole possession of 17th place in the expanded league.     Florida can improve postseason stock: Florida already secured bowl eligibility by beating Ole Miss, but Saturday is a prime opportunity to notch another win and improve its standing in the bowl bidding process. The Gators have not won seven games since 2020, when they went 8-4 and made it to the Cotton Bowl under former coach Dan Mullen. They also haven't had a winning record under Napier, so improving to 7-5 in the regular season will ensure that Florida finishes above .500 for the first time in four years.  Date: Saturday, Nov. 30 | Time: 7 p.m. ET Location: Doak Campbell Stadium -- Tallahassee, Florida TV: ESPN 2 | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)  Florida has been on a tear recently, but really the Gators have been better than their record indicates all year. Key to the late-season turnaround is a defense that, despite some mounting injuries -- especially in the secondary -- has vastly improved in short order. The Gators held two really good offenses under 20 points in their last two wins against LSU and Ole Miss. Now they face a Florida State offense that has averaged a woeful 11 points per game against FBS opponents. The Seminoles have eclipsed the 20-point mark just twice this season, and one of those was in a recent win against Charleston Southern.

Sitting on a score of  39-29, Louisiana has looked like the better team, but there's still one more half to play.  Louisiana entered the  contest with five straight  defeats and they're well on their way to making it six. Can they turn things around, or will Nicholls hand them another  loss? Only time will tell.  Nicholls Colonels @ Louisiana Ragin Cajuns Current Records: Nicholls 3-4, Louisiana 1-6  After three games on the road, Louisiana is heading back home. They will welcome the Nicholls Colonels  at 3:00  p.m.  ET on Saturday at Cajundome. The Ragin Cajuns have been getting the ball to fall more lately as they've increased their point totals each of their last four games.  Louisiana is headed in fresh off scoring the most  points they have all season. They took  a  98-86 hit to the loss column at the hands of UAB on Monday. Having run the score up that high, both teams might be doing some extra defensive drills very soon.  The loss doesn't tell the whole story though, as several players had good games. One of the most active was  Kyndall Davis, who  went 5 for 8 en route to 13 points plus seven  rebounds and two  blocks. He had some trouble finding his footing against George Wash.  on Saturday, so this was a nice turnaround. Christian Wright was another key player,  earning 15 points in addition to six  assists.  Even though they lost, Louisiana was working as a unit and  finished the game with 19  assists. That's the most  assists they've posted since back in January.  Meanwhile,  everything came up roses for Nicholls against Mississippi College on Monday as the  team secured  a  79-35 win.  Louisiana's loss dropped their record down to 1-6. As for Nicholls, their victory bumped their record up to 3-4.  Looking ahead, Louisiana is expected to win a tight contest, barring any buzzer beaters. This contest  might not be the best time to bet them against the spread since they've let bettors down the last five times they've played.  Everything went Louisiana's way against Nicholls in their previous matchup  back in December of 2017, as Louisiana made off with  a  105-80 win. Will Louisiana repeat their success,  or does  Nicholls have a better game plan this time around? We'll find out soon enough.  Louisiana is a slight 1-point favorite against Nicholls, according to the latest college basketball odds. The oddsmakers were right in line with the betting community on this one, as the game opened as a 1-point spread, and stayed right there. The over/under is 148.5  points.

Armed with a few days' rest, they will  face off against  the Washington Wizards at 8:00  p.m.  ET at Fiserv Forum. The Wizards are crawling into this  matchup hobbled by 13 consecutive losses, while the Bucks will bounce in with five consecutive wins.  The Bucks are headed into this one after the oddsmakers set last week's over/under low at 222.5, but even that wound up being too high. They narrowly escaped with a  win as the  team sidled past the Heat  106-103. The  squad ran away with 65  points in the first half and mostly just sat on those to pick up the  victory.  It was another big night for  Damian Lillard, who  shot 8-for-13  from beyond the arc and  dropped  a double-double on 37 points and 12  assists. He continues to roll, besting his previous point total in each of the last five games he's  played.  Meanwhile, the Wizards gave up the first points and the most points  on Wednesday. They wound up on the wrong side of a  painful 121-96 walloping at the hands of the Clippers. Washington was surely aware of their  disadvantage in the point spread, but the foreknowledge did nothing to prevent the result.  Milwaukee's win  ended  a  six-game drought on the road  and  puts them at 9-9. As for Washington, their defeat dropped their record down to 2-15.

Ohio State can punch its ticket to the conference title game for the first time since 2020 with a win over Michigan this weekend. Indiana also remains alive with a finale against Purdue Saturday.  The biggest game on this weekend's slate will see Texas travel to College Station to face Texas A&M with a spot in the SEC Championship Game against Georgia on the line. The Lone Star Showdown will be renewed for the first time since 2011, and the stakes have rarely been this high.  As Week 14 action arrives, here's a viewer's guide to help you navigate through all of Saturday's games. All times Eastern Michigan at No. 2 Ohio State -- noon on FOX, fuboTV (try for free): The Buckeyes are on the doorstep of reaching the Big Ten Championship Game, and a rematch with Oregon would be on the table if Ryan Day's squad takes care of business this weekend. The Buckeyes have lost their last three games against Michigan. The Wolverines could play spoiler with an upset win. No. 15 South Carolina at No. 12 Clemson -- noon on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): The loser of this game is out of the playoff picture in all likelihood. With Clemson being in danger of being left out of the ACC title game (Miami needs to beat Syracuse), this game could serve as its final audition to get into the CFP as an at-large team. South Carolina has won its last five games and is now in the thick of the CFP picture. No. 5 Notre Dame at USC -- 3:30 on CBS, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App (Free): Notre Dame has been on a tear since losing to Northern Illinois earlier this season. With wins over Texas A&M, Louisville, Navy and Army on Notre Dame's résumé, a win over USC would almost guarantee an at-large berth to the CFP. USC has won three of its last four games after starting 3-4 and became bowl-eligible with a win over UCLA. Notre Dame leads the all-time series 49-37-5. Auburn at No. 13 Alabama -- 3:30 p.m. on ABC, fuboTV (try for free): Alabama's hopes of reaching the CFP are currently on life support after losing to Oklahoma on the road.

The Sun Devils are on the verge of reaching the Big 12 title game and potentially playing for a berth to the CFP.

No. 3 Texas at No. 20 Texas A&M  -- 7:30 p.m. on ABC, fuboTV (try for free): This is the best game on the Week 14 slate. Even if Texas and Texas A&M had nothing to play for, the renewal of the rivalry after more than a decade makes this appointment viewing. The winner of this game clinches a berth in the SEC title game against Georgia and could be playing for a first-round bye in the CFP. One of the biggest storylines to monitor will be the health of Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers, who suffered an ankle injury against Kentucky last weekend."

The Blue Devils beat Wake Forest with a walk-off touchdown as time expired. With eight seconds left in regulation, Duke and Wake Forest appeared to be headed for overtime. The Blue Devils had the ball at the Demon Deacons' 39-yard line, which was too far to attempt a game-winning field goal. Instead, Manny Diaz kept his offense on the field and chose to take one last shot to the end zone. Quarterback Maalik Murphy dropped back and found a wide open Jordan Moore running downfield. Moore made the catch and spun into the end zone for the walk-off touchdown. In all its glory.

This will also be the first showdown between the Tigers and the Sooners since 2019's College Football Playoff, when Ed Orgeron's historic Tigers downed Lincoln Riley's Oklahoma to advance to the CFP National Championship.  The Tigers hold a 2-1 advantage in the series, with Oklahoma's only win against the Tigers coming in 1950.  LSU is fresh off a bounce-back 24-17 win against Vanderbilt. Prior to that, the previously 6-1 Tigers dropped three SEC contests in a row. All three of those losses came by double digits, including one defeat against unranked Florida.  Not to be outdone, Oklahoma notched its biggest win of the season -- and took a sledgehammer to Alabama's College Football Playoff hopes -- in a 24-3 romp over the Crimson Tide. That was Oklahoma's sixth win of the year, which means that the Sooners will make it to a bowl game for a 26th straight season, the second-longest streak in the FBS.  Though both teams have already locked down a bowl game, a win Saturday is still important to improve either team's stock during the postseason bidding process.  Help could be on the way for Oklahoma: Oklahoma's offense has struggled a lot this season -- the Sooners notably fired offensive coordinator Seth Littrell on Oct. 20, one day after a 35-9 loss to South Carolina -- and a big reason why is the fact that the Sooners have been without their five top wide receivers for a majority of the year. Most of the injuries that set that room back occurred either in the preseason or within the first few games. The good news for Oklahoma is that help could be on the way at the receiver spot.  There is a possibility that Deion Burks and Jalil Farooq are both able to return against LSU. Farooq has only played in two games this season, including a brief appearance against Missouri, while Burks hasn't played since Nov. 9. Burks' return would be a special boon as, in spite of his missed time, he still leads the Sooners with three touchdowns catches.     All eyes on Garrett Nussmeier: Saturday could be LSU quarterback Garrett Nussmeier's last time in Tiger Stadium. The redshirt junior, who spent three years biding his time and learning LSU's system before emerging as a starter in 2024, is eligible to declare for the 2025 NFL Draft. At one point, he was seen as a potential first-round prospect due to his excellent frame and big arm. But his stock has dropped a bit down the stretch amid some late-season struggles. Nussmeier has thrown five touchdowns to five interceptions in LSU's last four games and seven of his 11 interceptions came in the past six contests. LSU coach Brian Kelly recently said he is ""hopeful"" that Nussmeier will return in 2025 in an attempt to recover some of his draft buzz.   Strength vs. Strength: Even with Nussmeier's struggles of late, LSU still has one of the most prolific passing attacks in the nation. And Nussmeier did have a good game against Vanderbilt, posting 332 yards and one touchdown through the air while completing just over 75% of his passes. The Tigers currently rank second in the SEC with 317.7 yards passing per game. They have plenty of talented receivers to spread the ball to, including wideout Kyren Lacy, who is currently tied for first place in the SEC with eight touchdowns.  Oklahoma's secondary will be a huge test. The Sooners have held each of their last three opponents -- and four of their last five -- under 200 yards passing. They've also been opportunistic when it comes to creating turnovers. Oklahoma had three interceptions against Alabama, one of which linebacker Kip Lewis returned for a crucial touchdown to give the Sooners their decisive advantage.  Date: Saturday, Nov. 30 | Time: 7 p.m. ET Location: Tiger Stadium -- Baton Rouge, Louisiana TV: ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)  All sports betting odds via Caesars Sportsbook. Check out the latest Caesars promo code to get in the game.  Oklahoma has quietly had an excellent defensive season. Or, at least it was quiet before the Sooners held Alabama's explosive offense to three total points. The Sooners currently rank fourth in the SEC in total defense (311.3 yards per game) and are holding opponents to just 20.2 points per contest. Jackson Arnold has also been solid for the Sooners after returning to the field -- especially with his legs. He has 221 yards and one touchdown rushing in Oklahoma's last three games. All this to say, Oklahoma is a bad matchup for an LSU team with a faltering offense and a defense that really struggles to defend against rushing quarterbacks. The Sooners may not win straight-up (the game's a tossup in my mind), but it will be incredibly close either way. The six-point betting line seems like too much. Pick: Oklahoma +6  SportsLine's proven computer model is calling for several outright upsets in Week 14 of college football. Visit SportsLine now to see them all, plus get spread picks for every game from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times."

Sitting on a score of  36-35, Montana State has looked like the better team, but there's still one more half to play.  Montana State came into the  contest with some extra motivation after the  defeat they were dealt the last time these two teams faced off. We'll see if they're able to flip the script or if it'll just be more of the same.  CSNorthridge Matadors @ Montana State Bobcats Current Records: CSNorthridge 5-2, Montana State 3-4  The CSNorthridge Matadors' road trip will continue as they head out to face the Montana State Bobcats at 3:00  p.m.  ET on Saturday at Max Worthington Arena. Coming off a loss in a game the Matadors were expected to win, they now face the more daunting task of proving themselves against unfavorable odds.  CSNorthridge is probably headed into the  contest with a chip on their shoulder considering Montana just ended the team's  five-game winning streak  on Wednesday. They took  an  83-75 hit to the loss column at the hands of the Grizzlies.  Even though they lost, CSNorthridge  smashed the offensive glass and  finished the game with 19  offensive rebounds. That's the most  offensive rebounds they've posted since back in November of 2023.  Meanwhile, Montana State blew past Abilene Christian, posting  an  85-59 victory. The Bobcats have made a habit of sweeping their opponents off the court, having now won three  matches by 20  points or more this season.  CSNorthridge's defeat dropped their record down to 5-2. As for Montana State, their win was  their fourth straight at home dating back to last season, which  pushed their record up to 3-4.  Some high-performance offense is likely on the agenda as  both  are some of the highest scoring teams in the league. CSNorthridge hasn't had any problem running up the score this season,  having  averaged 83.3 points per game. However, it's not like Montana State struggles in that department as   they've been averaging 77.1. With both teams so easily able to put up points, the only question left is who can run the score up higher.  CSNorthridge beat Montana State 82-70  in their previous meeting  back in December of 2023. The rematch might be a little tougher for CSNorthridge since the  team won't have the home-court advantage this time around. We'll see if the change in venue makes a difference.  Montana State is a solid 5.5-point favorite against CSNorthridge, according to the latest college basketball odds. The oddsmakers had a good feel for the line for this one, as the game opened with the Bobcats as a 4.5-point favorite. The over/under is 152.5  points.

This matchup will mark the 95th all-time meeting between the historic programs. The two rivals have played each other every season in football since 1926, except during World War ll (1943-45) and the COVID-19 shortened season in 2020. The Fighting Irish have turned around their season since suffering a loss at home to Northern Illinois in Week 2. Notre Dame enters this matchup on the cusp of securing an at-large berth to the 12-team College Football Playoff after winning its last nine games. With wins over Texas A&M, Louisville, Navy and Army on Notre Dame's résumé, a win over USC would almost guarantee an at-large berth. The Irish are currently a -650 bet to make the CFP, according to Caesars. USC has won three of its last four games after starting 3-4 and became bowl-eligible with a win over UCLA last weekend. Before the Trojans' showdown against Nebraska earlier this month, coach Lincoln Riley made a quarterback change, electing to bench Miller Moss in favor of UNLV transfer Jayden Maiava. USC has won both games Maiava started.  Here is everything you need to know about Notre Dame's matchup with USC this weekend. Follow along with LIVE updates. Date: Saturday, Nov. 30 | Time: 3:30 p.m. ETLocation: Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum -- Los Angeles TV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App (Free)Streaming on Paramount+ with Showtime (Try It Free) One final test for Notre Dame before the CFP: Notre Dame's path to the CFP is simple. If the Fighting Irish handle business this weekend and move to 11-1, the only drama left will be what seed they draw. With so many CFP contenders falling in recent weeks, Notre Dame should be in contention to host during the first round game. Maiava has been a spark for USC:  Riley made a switch at quarterback After USC lost to Washington, benching Moss in favor of Maiava. The change appeared to have paid off, with Maiava adding a new dynamic to USC's offense. With USC's quarterback situation remaining fluid heading into the 2025 season, Maiava can solidify himself as Riley's QB1 long-term with a strong performance down the stretch. Notre Dame's run game is the key: Notre Dame has a chance to win its 11th game of the season this weekend, which would mark the sixth time in program history that's happened. The Fighting Irish have turned their season around because of the run game. Notre Dame has 37 rushing touchdowns as a team entering Week 14 -- the most in a season since 1991. Running back Jeremiyah Love and quarterback Riley Leonard are the first duo in program history with at least 13 rushing touchdowns each.  Notre Dame's run game is the key to victory. The Fighting Irish have been on a tear since losing to NIU early in the season and the program is on the cusp of securing its third CFP appearance. Although USC has looked like a better team with Maiava at quarterback, the inability to win close games down the stretch has been an issue under Riley. The Trojans are one of six FBS teams to lead in the fourth quarter of every game this season. Notre Dame leaves no doubt about its status as a CFP team this weekend and covers the line on sports betting apps. Pick: Notre Dame -7.5 All sports betting odds via Caesars Sportsbook.

After losing to Oklahoma last week, No. 13 Alabama (8-3, 4-3 SEC) will miss the College Football Playoff unless chaos unfolds around the sport this weekend. Auburn (5-6, 2-5) has disappointed throughout the season and is just playing for bowl eligibility at this point. The game might be lacking on a national scale, but that doesn't diminish the importance for both coaches.    First-year coach Kalen DeBoer has already overseen the worst Alabama team since 2010 and really can't afford an Iron Bowl loss to a six-loss Auburn team when it comes to fan buy-in and recruiting momentum. Second-year Auburn coach Hugh Freeze was largely hired for his ability to beat Nick Saban -- a feat he accomplished twice while at Ole Miss. While he can't do that again, he'd earn a lot of goodwill with a road Iron Bowl victory ahead of what is shaping into a critical third season for him on the Plains.   It will be hard to beat last year's thrilling fourth-and-31 touchdown finish, but this game has a way of delivering even when the nation's gaze is elsewhere.    Date: Saturday, Nov. 30 | Time: 3:30 p.m. ETLocation: Bryant-Denny Stadium  – Tuscaloosa, AlabamaTV: ABC | Live stream: fubo (Try for free) Which Milroe appears? In a win over Georgia where he totaled four touchdowns and nearly 500 offensive yards, Jalen Milroe looked like a legitimate Heisman Trophy contender. In a loss to Oklahoma where he threw three interceptions, including one pick six, his performance had fans calling for him to be replaced. The Milroe experience has been a rollercoaster for Alabama this season, largely dependent on if he can be effective running the ball with his legs. In losses to Vanderbilt and Oklahoma, particularly, Milroe couldn't move the ball effectively in the passing game and looked increasingly helpless. This should be Milroe's last game inside Bryant-Denny Stadium and Alabama could use the version that looked electric against Georgia and LSU to make a reappearance.    Run the ball, Auburn The Tigers found success running Jarquez Hunter against Texas A&M, totaling 130 yards and three touchdowns in the upset win. Using Hunter -- plus some Thorne in designed runs -- should be effective against an Alabama defense that has struggled to defend the run and is now without senior linebacker and play-caller Deontae Lawson. Oklahoma's 1-2 punch of quarterback Jackson Arnold and running back Xavier Robinson combined for 238 yards and two touchdowns against the Tide last weekend.    Unusual smack talk The Iron Bowl is full of emotion but largely devoid of headline-making comments from players in the lead up to it. That's not the case this season where a spicy back-and-forth has added some extra juice to the game. It started with freshman Auburn linebacker Demarcus Riddick saying Tide star freshman Ryan Williams wasn't a ""big-time player to me"" and vowed to never lose to Alabama. Tide QB Milroe returned fire the next day saying he didn't know who Riddick was and to just let him talk. Other Alabama players backed up Williams' unique skills. Don't be surprised to see some more spicy comments coming out after the game depending on the result.    Sports betting odds via Fanatics.

Auburn hasn't won in Tuscaloosa since 2010, a wild 28-27 comeback win known as the ""Camback,"" and even with Alabama licking its wounds off an Oklahoma loss, this isn't the year that changes. Auburn's Hugh Freeze will come up with a great game plan to frustrate Alabama, but the Crimson Tide still have too much of a talent advantage to lose its home finale.

They have a bit of a cushion as they currently lead Robert Morris  42-30.  If Ohio keeps playing like this, they'll bump their record up to 3-5 in no time. On the other hand, Robert Morris will have to make due with  a  6-3 record unless they turn things around (and fast).  Robert Morris Colonials @ Ohio Bobcats Current Records: Robert Morris 6-2, Ohio 2-5  After five games on the road, Ohio is heading back home. They will welcome the Robert Morris Colonials  at 2:00  p.m.  ET on Saturday at Convocation Center. The Bobcats are strutting in with some offensive muscle as they've averaged 76.6  points per game  this season.  The experts predicted Ohio would be headed in after a  win, but Texas State made sure that didn't happen. Ohio took  a  74-65 hit to the loss column at the hands of Texas State on Sunday. The  matchup marked Ohio's lowest-scoring  contest so far this season.  Despite their  defeat, Ohio saw several players rise to the challenge and make noteworthy plays.  AJ Clayton, who  posted 18 points plus five  rebounds, was perhaps the best of all. The team also got some help courtesy of  Aidan Hadaway, who  scored 13 points plus five  rebounds and two  steals.  Meanwhile, Robert Morris came tearing into  Wednesday's  game with five straight wins  (a stretch where they outscored their opponents by an average of 15 points) and they left with even more momentum. They came out on top against the Golden Griffins by a score of  72-64.

Looking forward, Ohio is the favorite in this one, as the experts expect to see them win by 10.5  points.

Having just played yesterday, the Detroit Pistons will get right back to it and host the Philadelphia 76ers  at 7:00  p.m.  ET at Little Caesars Arena. The Pistons have been getting the ball to fall more lately as they've increased their point totals each of their last three games.  The Pistons are headed in fresh off scoring the most  points they have all season. They put the hurt on the Pacers with a sharp  130-106 win on Friday. Detroit pushed the score to  92-73 by the end of the third, a deficit Indiana had  little chance of recovering from.  The Pistons got their  victory on the backs of several key players, but it was  Malik Beasley out in front who  went 10 for 14 en route to 25 points plus two  steals. What's more,  Beasley also posted a 55.6%  three-point shooting accuracy, which is the highest he's  posted since back in October. Jaden Ivey was another key player,  going 8 for 13 en route to 23 points plus six  assists and five  rebounds.  The Pistons were working as a unit and  finished the game with 35  assists. That's the most  assists they've managed all season.  Meanwhile, the 76ers fought the good fight in their overtime  contest against the Rockets  on Wednesday but wound up with a less-than-desirable result. They took  a  122-115 hit to the loss column at the hands of Houston. Philadelphia has now  taken an 'L' in back-to-back games.  The 76ers'  defeat came about despite a quality game from  Tyrese Maxey, who  dropped  a double-double on 39 points and ten  assists. With that strong performance,  Maxey is now averaging an impressive 25.7 points per game. Jared McCain, on the other hand, was considerably less helpful: he went 0-7 from long range.  Detroit's win  ended  a  three-game drought on the road  and  puts them at 9-12. As for Philadelphia, their loss dropped their record down to 3-14.  Saturday's  match is shaping up to be a scrappy  game:  The Pistons have crashing the boards this season,  having  averaged 46.4  rebounds per game (they're ranked fourth in  rebounds per game overall). It's a different story for the 76ers, though, as  they've been averaging  only 39.5. Given the Pistons' sizable advantage in that area, the 76ers will need to find a way to close that gap.  Looking ahead, the Pistons are expected to win a tight contest, barring any buzzer beaters. For those looking to play the spread,  watch out: Detroit is  playing at home, but their 3-6 record against the spread as such isn't exactly encouraging.  Detroit is a slight 1.5-point favorite against Philadelphia, according to the latest NBA odds. The oddsmakers had a good feel for the line for this one, as the game opened with the Pistons as a 1-point favorite. The over/under is 216.5  points.

Rider is headed into this one after the oddsmakers set last week's over/under low at 138.5, but even that wound up being too high. They fell victim to a  bruising 72-48 defeat at the hands of Villanova  on Wednesday. The  contest marked the Broncs' lowest-scoring  match so far this season.  Meanwhile,  winning is always nice, but doing so behind a season-high score is even better  (just ask Delaware). They walked away with  a   100-94  victory over Yale  on Sunday. With that  win, the Fightin' Blue Hens brought their scoring average up to 78.8  points per game.  Delaware got their  victory on the backs of several key players, but it was  John Camden out in front who  went 7 for 11 from beyond the arc en route to 30 points plus eight  rebounds.

Southern Miss is headed into Saturday's   game looking for a big change in momentum after dropping their third straight game  on Monday. They fell  82-74 to Abilene Christian.  Meanwhile,  after a string of four wins, Milwaukee's good fortune finally ran out  on Wednesday. They took  an  84-76 hit to the loss column at the hands of UCF.  Jamichael Stillwell put forth a good effort for the losing side as  he  dropped  a double-double on 14 points and 12  rebounds.

The CFP race takes up significant oxygen in the national discussion, but conference title games will play a large role in forming that 12-team bracket. As such, there is still much to figure out with not much time left to do so.   Rivalry week is always a bit of a quagmire when it comes to college football betting, and the shifting stakes at both the conference and national levels have changed how these games are viewed. Still, it's hard to imagine the end of college football season without games like Michigan-Ohio State, Alabama-Auburn and -- once again -- Texas-Texas A&M.  Be sure to stick with CBS Sports all day Saturday for college football coverage from the opening kickoff onward. Let's take a look at our expert picks for the best games in Week 14 with cited picks from best sports betting apps available.                                        All times Eastern  3:30 p.m. | CBS, Paramount+ with Showtime, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App -- Notre Dame's run game is the key to victory. The Fighting Irish have been on a tear since losing to NIU early in the season, and the program is on the cusp of securing its third CFP appearance. Despite the change to Jayden Maiava at quarterback, the inability to win close games down the stretch has been an issue under coach Lincoln Riley. The Trojans are one of six FBS teams to lead in the fourth quarter of every game this season. Notre Dame leaves no doubt about its status as a CFP team this weekend and covers. Pick: Notre Dame -7.5 (odds via Caesars) -- Cameron Salerno  3:30 p.m. | ABC, fubo (Try for free) --   The Iron Bowl has a tendency to get weird, though that is mostly when the game resides inside Jordan-Hare Stadium. Auburn hasn't won in Tuscaloosa since 2010, a wild 28-27 comeback win known as the ""Camback,"" and even with Alabama licking its wounds off an Oklahoma loss, this isn't the year that changes. Auburn's Hugh Freeze will come up with a great game plan to frustrate Alabama, but the Crimson Tide still have too much of a talent advantage to lose its home finale. Alabama to win straight up but look for Auburn to cover. Pick: Auburn +11.5 (odds via Fanatics) -- John Talty  7:30 p.m. | ABC, fubo (Try for free) -- Texas is the better team, they will contend for a national title and have more players picked in the NFL Draft. The Aggies are still searching for identity under first-year coach Mike Elko and need quarterback Marcel Reed to develop quickly. And, yet, there's truly no telling what will happen in the renewal of this historic rivalry game. Texas got the last one at the buzzer, and it could easily go a similar direction this time. Regardless, the line is simply too large heading into what should be one of the most hyped games in the history of both programs. Pick: Texas A&M +5.5 (odds via DraftKings) -- Shehan Jeyarajah  Noon | Fox, fubo (Try for free) -- It's hard to think of the history of this rivalry and believe there will be a blowout, but I can't shake that feeling. Michigan just hasn't been good enough offensively this season to give me reason to believe it can keep this one close. Plus, considering the bad blood the Buckeyes have for the last three years, you have to think they'll show little mercy late in the game. Take the Buckeyes to cover the betting line. Pick: Ohio State -21 (odds via DraftKings) -- Tom Fornelli   Noon | ESPN, fubo (Try for free) -- Another in-state rivalry in Texas is taking a lot of the Week 14 spotlight, but the Palmetto Bowl is not to be slept on. It does have College Football Playoff ramifications -- the loser is in all likelihood out of the race -- but this is one of college football's fiercest rivalries.

They have a bit of a cushion as they currently lead Northeastern  35-22.  If Vermont keeps playing like this, they'll bump their record up to 5-4 in no time. On the other hand, Northeastern will have to make due with  a  5-3 record unless they turn things around (and fast).  Northeastern Huskies @ Vermont Catamounts Current Records: Northeastern 5-2, Vermont 4-4  The Northeastern Huskies' road trip will continue as they head out to face the Vermont Catamounts at 1:00  p.m.  ET on Saturday at Roy L Patrick Gymnasium. Coming off a loss in a game the Huskies were expected to win, they now face the more daunting task of proving themselves against unfavorable odds.  Northeastern is probably headed into the  contest with a chip on their shoulder considering Cal-Baker. just ended the team's  four-game winning streak  on Sunday. They took  a  68-60 hit to the loss column at the hands of the Roadrunners.  Despite their  defeat, Northeastern saw several players rise to the challenge and make noteworthy plays.  LA Pratt, who  scored 15 points along with six  rebounds, was perhaps the best of all. Pratt had some trouble finding  his footing against FGCU on Saturday, so this was a step in the right direction.  Meanwhile, Vermont posted their biggest  win since December 20, 2023 on Wednesday. They blew past Plattsburgh State 78-55.  Vermont was working as a unit and  finished the game with 20  assists. That's the most  assists they've posted since back in January.  Northeastern's loss dropped their record down to 5-2. As for Vermont, they pushed their record up to 4-4 with the  victory, which was their 13th straight  at home dating back to last season. This contest  is shaping up to be a blowout:  Northeastern  just can't miss this season,  having  made 49.5% of their  field goals per game. It's a different story for Vermont, though, as  they've  only  made 41.3% of their  field goals this season. Given Northeastern's sizable advantage in that area, Vermont will need to find a way to close that gap.  Northeastern couldn't quite finish off Vermont in their previous matchup  back in December of 2023 and fell  73-71. Can Northeastern avenge their  defeat or is history doomed to repeat itself? We'll find out soon enough.  Vermont is a 4.5-point favorite against Northeastern, according to the latest college basketball odds. The oddsmakers had a good feel for the line for this one, as the game opened with the Catamounts as a 4-point favorite. The over/under is 129  points.

One day, workers came to the school in the morning to find a total of 15 shoes belonging to 10 children gone missing, with more scattered around the building.   The school reported the incident to the Fukuoka Prefectural Police, and after several recurring thefts, the police installed security cameras to get to the bottom of the bizarre crime spree.  The video revealed that it was not a malicious actor but a sneaky weasel that had a taste for stinky feet. The same night the cameras were installed, the suspect returned around 7:30 pm, when the school was quiet, and quickly snatched a white sneaker from a cubby before running off with it.  One employee at the school said, We were very worried, but now that we know it was an animal, we are relieved.  As for the police, they say they were also surprised to discover the identity of the culprit, saying,  We're relieved that the incident was not caused by a human, but this is the first case of its kind. The stolen shoes have not yet been recovered, but the school has installed netting over the cubby holes at night to prevent the crime spree from continuing, as the suspect still remains at large.

The result was a bigger majority than many were predicting, after similar legislation was roundly defeated in 2015.Under the terms of the bill, a terminally ill adult with a life expectancy of six months or less could seek assistance to end their life, provided that two doctors and a High Court judge approve their decision.

But some in Britain are really, really excited about the prospect of being able to end their own lives or the lives of a loved one using a medically sanitized version of self-murder. Dame Esther Rantzen said she was 'absolutely thrilled' at the result, but that it was unlikely to have an impact on her own life.The broadcaster, who is terminally ill, said minutes after the historic vote: 'It's going to take probably almost two years for it to change the law, and I'd be astonished if the drug I'm on manages to extend my life that far.'

Except, this wasn't your garden-variety gnome, made to protect the family home against witches and evil spirits. It was made for much worse things. The gnome was a solid 4 lbs of 100% MDMA, which is the main component of the street drug ecstasy. While the Netherlands is infamous for legalizing a lot of drugs, ecstasy isn't one of them. Oddly enough, the Netherlands is also the leading producer of ecstasy. Anyways, on a recent drug bust, Dutch police found the lawn gnome sitting among a pile of other drugs.

The folks over at The Economist, the economics magazine in Britain, have pored over the US budget and think they know exactly where to make cuts.   I think we can all agree, with the defense spending and endless wars, with a gigantic welfare state, with paying for housing and healthcare for illegal immigrants, and the myriad of fake and gay university studies subsidized by the US government, the first place we need to cut is ... veterans benefits.  The current system was introduced during the first world war. It provides tax-free monthly payments to soldiers who are injured or sick owing to their service. From 1960 to 2000, roughly 9% of veterans qualified for payments, typically for ailments such as hearing loss or burns. The department assigns a rating from zero to 100% based on the severity of disabilities. In 2000 the average rating was 30%; monthly payments averaged the equivalent of $975 today. Few qualified for the top tier.The modern programme bears little resemblance to its original form. This year 6m veterans — or a third of the total — qualified for payments, with an average monthly benefit of $2,200. The modern programme bears little resemblance to its original form. This year 6m veterans — or a third of the total — qualified for payments, with an average monthly benefit of $2,200. Are we spending ... inefficiently on our vets? You know, there's probably an argument to be made. But are our vets getting even a fraction of the care they deserve for serving in our armed forces?  I mean, how did The Economist publish this crap piece? What kind of people are running this site?  Oh yeah ... It's starting to make sense now.       You can click through to see some much more colorful language that The Economist likely earned in response. Maybe I am a little bit crazy, but what if we stopped the forever wars, secured our borders, and used some of the money we were spending on pensions in Ukraine and aid to Palestine and give it to our veterans instead?

The 70% number is staggering. Consider that private Christian colleges and trade schools only make up 10% of the post-secondary student population in the U.S. Ivy League schools like Harvard, with their massive endowments, are allowed to discriminate openly against students based on religion, sexuality, and skin color - and their presidents are often protected from open plagiarism - but the Biden admin spent most of its time focusing on the little guys who just want to give people alternatives to liberal arts studies in gender degrees? [American Principles Project] Policy Director Jon Schweppe said the Democrats have been 'busy weaponizing every part of the federal government to target their opponents"" for the past four years.'While major assaults from agencies like the Department of Justice have taken most of the headlines, we should not ignore similarly corrupt efforts in other agencies as well,' Schweppe said.'As our report details, the Biden-Harris Department of Education has been engaged in a long-running scheme to punish Christian colleges that are ideologically opposed to the left's agenda. The unfair targeting of these institutions has been egregious, and it needs to stop immediately.'

Fox News gives the examples of Grand Canyon University and Liberty University, both conservative Christian schools. These two schools alone face more financial penalties than ""all penalties imposed over the past seven years combined."" Consider the fact that Penn State was fined $2.4 million for Jerry Sandusky's sexual crimes and Michigan State was fined $4.5 million for Larry Nassar's sexual crimes. That was essentially a slap on the wrist for those massive public schools. Now consider that the Biden admin fined Grand Canyon University $37.7 MILLION over allegations that it misled students about the cost of its doctoral programs. Even if said allegations are true, are you telling me that discrepancies about the cost of tuition being properly communicated is worth a fine ten times as large as sex scandals where college staff were abusing multiple students and it was ignored/covered up??  The report from APP said further that at 'least 12 Christian colleges have been the target of excessive penalties or banned from receiving federal student aid; by comparison, no Ivy League school has been the recipient of punitive action by the Office of Enforcement.''The average fine against a Christian school for a Clery Act violation was $815,000, compared to $228,571 against public and private institutions,' it said.

In that way, this ad makes me feel sad, because I'm not sure there's a way to put the ""feel good"" genie back in the bottle - and given the practices of such companies, I don't know that we should.

It turns out Geter-Pataky also works as a justice of the peace. After she was put on leave and eventually fired for the ballot-stuffing charges, she allegedly found another way to stuff the ballot boxes via her justice of the peace role. She started conducting green-card marriages to secure a path to citizenship. Independent journalists first uncovered the suspected activity and started an investigation. The following video shows Geter-Pataky busily conducting 15 simultaneous weddings at the New Haven City Hall:  NBC investigated further and found that just in the month of October 2024, Geter-Pataky conducted 114 weddings in New Haven over a 30-day period. Most licenses show one applicant per couple was born outside the U.S. and doesn't have a social security number, indications they might not be U.S. citizens.  Only a few of them were from Connecticut, much less New Haven. Connecticut Republicans are calling for the state attorney general, Democrat William Tong, to investigate what's happening with the marriages. 'We're simply asking the attorney general's office to do what they do in many cases and investigate whether there's illegal activity occurring,' Sen. Stephen Harding (R-Minority Leader) said. But Tong says he can do nothing about criminal immigration laws. Besides, he's busy trying to stop the Trump administration from deporting illegal immigrants currently living in Connecticut. The Democratic mayor of New Haven, Justin Elicker, has implemented a two-day waiting period on marriage applications to try to stem the tide of green-card marriages but has no intention of doing more than that. The city doesn't have a role in determining why two people are tying the knot.We're not the love police, we're not trying to determine if they're actually in love, if it's a legitimate marriage, or if there's something else going on. We're not the love police, we're not trying to determine if they're actually in love, if it's a legitimate marriage, or if there's something else going on. One might be tempted to think that Geter-Pataky will stop the green-card marriages when she goes to prison for the ballot-stuffing charges, but those were only civil charges brought by the city of Bridgeport to have her removed from her job. Criminal charges are the responsibility of Attorney General Wong, and like I said, he's pretty busy ensuring all the illegal stuff keeps happening in Connecticut. The best hope is that a U.S. attorney might investigate, given that it's a possible immigration crime. Shout out to NTB users @quodscripsi and @mrsswanson for the heads up about this story.

Young Ayden was born without a full heart, a rare congenital defect. His mother originally didn't realize what was wrong with him, only noticing that he would regularly fall asleep too quickly while nursing and was regularly too cold. At one point his temperature measured 88º, far too cold for anyone, let alone a baby; that was when the family discovered the medical condition.  Several surgeries were required to save Ayden's life; those led to some developmental disabilities, though they kept him alive and helped him lead a relatively normal life, including a job at a local cafe. A life-threatening infection earlier this year, however, led doctors to conclude Ayden needed a new heart. Miraculously, a match was quickly found.  And so far, so good. Ayden's not out of the woods just yet, but the limberness of the heart so soon is a very promising sign. ...'Everyone's excited,' [Skillman] said. 'And when people see him, they're just happy to see he's back home. They've also noticed that his skin color is different.

	The Chiefs continue to find new ways to win football games, this time with the Raiders fumbling a snap in field goal range down two.","The Chiefs have had an incredible run of luck this season, which feels borderline unfair for a team as talented as they are to also have luck on their side. They’ve won one-possession games in just about every way possible, with walk-off kicks, blocked kicks, and now, walk-off turnovers.  In a Black Friday slugfest against the Raiders, the Chiefs once again found themselves trailing in the fourth quarter, but were able to march down the field before settling for a field goal to go up 19-17. Vegas, with Aidan O’Connell now under center, isn’t exactly an explosive offense, but in the final minute they were able to cross midfield and were seemingly in field goal range for a game-winning try with 15 seconds left in the game. After spiking it on second down on the 32, the Raiders lined up for third down to try and get a little closer for the kick, but miscommunication on the snap saw the ball bounce off O’Connell’s chest because he wasn’t ready for it, bouncing away where the Chiefs eventually recovered it.  What a WILD ending on Black Friday 👀 pic.twitter.com/JtYRVva6Zy — NFL (@NFL) November 29, 2024  Given the Raiders were out of timeouts, it didn’t really matter who recovered the fumble as the clock would’ve wound down to 0:00 even if O’Connell had corralled it. It’s a horrific way to lose if you’re the Raiders, as this season has been a disaster but they take pride in managing to be a thorn in Kansas City’s side. Unfortunately, one of the complications of being on a backup QB is the snap count can be a bit different, and O’Connell was trying to survey the defense one last time before taking the snap when the ball was suddenly on him. For the Chiefs, they somehow move to 11-1 despite another mediocre offensive showing, but they don’t put pictures on the scoreboard and the win counts all the same to move them one step closer to a first round bye and the top seed in the AFC."

	Black Friday features a 10-game slate of NBA Cup action, and there are a variety of clinch (and elimination) scenarios at stake.","The 2024 Emirates NBA Cup is winding down group stage play, with Friday bringing the fourth and final game for some teams — and the third for others. Two teams (Houston and Golden State) came into Friday having already clinched a spot in the knockout rounds, while a few others (Utah, New Orleans, Washington, and Toronto) had already been eliminated.  In total, 20 teams will be in action on Friday, as the league filled out the Black Friday slate for a full day of Cup action, and there’s plenty at stake when it comes to keeping hope alive of getting to Las Vegas. Here, we’ll go through what’s at stake in each group with Friday’s games ahead of Tuesday night’s group stage finale.  Knicks (3-0) defeat Hornets (0-3)
Magic (2-0) at Nets (1-2) The Knicks beat the Hornets by one in a fun one to open Friday’s action, and in doing so they improved to 3-0 to give themselves a really good look at the knockout rounds — and officially eliminated Charlotte. Orlando needs a win to keep pace with New York (and to boost their odds at the Wild Card), but those two teams will play on Tuesday so even with a loss to Brooklyn, the Magic would be alive to win the group if they can beat the Knicks.  Raptors (0-2) at Heat (1-2)
Pistons (2-0) at Pacers (0-2) The Pistons are the only team playing on Friday still in the hunt for the group. A win over Indiana would give them a big boost in odds to make the knockout rounds, especially if they can get a comfortable win, as they’d be 3-0 before facing the similarly undefeated Bucks. 3-1 will have a good shot at the Wild Card, but they’ll need to boost their point differential (+4) to get there. Toronto and Miami is more a game for pride, but the Heat could technically be in play for a Wild Card with a win as they’d be 2-2 with a good point differential (+10 currently). Miami would need a lot of help, including a Pistons loss, for 2-2 to be the best record of the second place teams in all the groups in the East.  Cavs (1-1) at Hawks (2-1)
Celtics (2-1) at Bulls (2-1) All four of these teams are still alive in the group, as the Wizards (0-3) have been eliminated, and the three 2-1 teams all have clinch scenarios in play today. Atlanta clinches the group with a win over Cleveland and a Chicago win over Boston. Boston clinches with a win over the Bulls and a Cavs win over the Hawks. Chicago clinches with a win over Boston and a Hawks win over the Cavs. Cleveland will be alive for the group win if they beat Atlanta and get a Chicago win over Boston. A loss will effectively eliminate any of these teams from the knockout rounds (as 2-2 will almost assuredly not earn a wild card).  Clippers (1-1) at Timberwolves (1-2)
Kings (0-2) at Blazers (1-1) The 3-0 Rockets have already clinched this group by beating L.A. and Portland, meaning the rest of these teams are all playing for Wild Card berths. The Clippers and Blazers both need wins to give themselves a chance at 3-1, which is obviously much more likely to get a Wild Card spot than 2-2. The Kings and Wolves, meanwhile, will need to not only get wins but get help from around them — while also thinking strongly about point differential if they’re going to make it in a 2-2 tiebreaker.  Thunder (1-1) at Lakers (2-1) Only two teams are in action on Friday for the most competitive group in the West, and this will be an eliminator of sorts. A win will keep OKC alive, with a game against already eliminated Utah left on Tuesday, while the Lakers would wrap up a 3-1 campaign and simply be waiting out the results of Tuesday night’s game between the Suns and Spurs, as they would need a Spurs win to have the head-to-head tiebreaker.  Pelicans at Grizzlies The Warriors have already clinched Group C with a 3-0 record including a win over Dallas. New Orleans is already eliminated, as their point differential of -38 makes it impossible for them to make up ground on other potential 2-2 teams. Memphis is 0-2 and will need a miracle to get in as a Wild Card team, but they’ll need a win on Friday afternoon to keep those slim hopes alive (and preferably by a lot to pad point differential)."

	Shaboozey performed ""A Bar Song,"" ""Last of My Kind,"" and ""Highway"" from Ford Field.","The NFL kicked off its Thanksgiving slate on Thursday afternoon with an NFC North showdown between the Chicago Bears and the Detroit Lions. It’s a matchup between two teams that bookend the division standings — the Lions are on top, the Bears are in the basement — but part of what makes the Thanksgiving games interesting despite that is the pageantry of the whole thing. Of course, there was CBS sending its top crew, the celebration of John Madden, and all the fun little touches that come from games taking place on Thanksgiving. And of course, while it’s not the Super Bowl halftime show, fans at the stadium and watching on television got treated to a performance while both teams made their ways into their respective locker rooms. While Lainey Wilson is scheduled to perform during Giants-Cowboys and Lindsey Stirling is the halftime show during Dolphins-Packers, Shaboozey took the stage at Ford Field during the early game. Unsurprisingly, he performed his smash hit “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” along with “Last of My Kind” and “Highway.”  A post shared by NFL (@nfl)  If you’d like to watch the full performance, you can do that right here. While Shaboozey performed, the Lions were certainly the happier of the two teams in the halftime locker room, as they held a 16-0 lead and limited the Bears to only 53 yards of total offense in the first half."

	The Lions star right tackle hasn't given up a sack all year, but on Thanksgiving he took a sack on a trick play that the Bears covered up.","The Detroit Lions have been the best team in the NFC this season, thanks in part to one of the most balanced offensive attacks in the league. Detroit is built inside out, relying on arguably the best offensive line in football to pave the way for their two-headed rushing attack with David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs, with Jared Goff picking defenses apart in the play-action game off that running game.  On top of that, offensive coordinator Ben Johnson is about as creative as they come when it comes to dialing up some trickeration, and on Thanksgiving he tried to let his star right tackle, Penei Sewell, shine on the Lions first drive of the game. After picking up a first down to put them just outside the red zone, Sewell lined up at tight end and came around on a reverse, but instead of running it, the big fella was looking to throw it downfield. Unfortunately for Sewell, the Lions, and everyone watching hoping to see some Large Man Excellence, the Bears covered it extremely well and there was nowhere for Sewell to go, with the Bears defense eventually swarming him and pushing him out of bounds — because they could not bring him to the ground.  Penei Sewell tried it 😅 📺: #CHIvsDET on CBS/Paramount+📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/tPb5KRWNCr — NFL (@NFL) November 28, 2024  It’s actually a really good play by Sewell not to force a throw into coverage like most non-QBs would do in that situation, and the fans still went crazy for the play call and for Sewell shrugging off the entire Bears defense to stay on his feet. The craziest part of the whole thing is that Sewell, by losing two yards, took a sack on the play, which means he has taken more sacks this season than he’s given up at right tackle. Sewell came into the game having allowed 0 sacks in more than 700 snaps, per PFF, which is an astonishing stat and a great example of why he’s a perennial All-Pro. Hopefully, this won’t be the last time we see Sewell given the chance to throw the ball cause I want to see him get a chance to let the ball fly."

	Come get these winners.","Thanksgiving is here and that means a virtual smorgasbord of football action. The weekend begins with a tripleheader on the big day itself, and the fun doesn’t stop until Monday. In this space, it’s been a tough season but, on the bright side, four of the last five weeks have ended in the green as we scratch and claw our way toward respectability. There is still a long way to go but, before we get to the Week 13 picks, let’s take stock of the progress. Come get these winners. I’m tired of fading the Lions. It hasn’t gone well, and I hate it. But this is another spot where I think I have to. Detroit is banged-up and, while the Lions should win this game at home, Chicago is a step above the doormats that should be catching double-digits in this spot. Thoughts and prayers. In the interest of full disclosure, I’m a Falcons fan. I don’t want to bet on the Falcons. I actively try not to. But this is a spot I really like. Atlanta is coming off a bye, while Los Angeles played a high-impact game on Monday on the west coast. I would already have the Falcons as a tiny favorite before accounting for the situation, so give me the candy on the home underdog.  This is Cincinnati’s last stand. At 4-7, they have zero margin for error. That’s not why I’m taking them, but the Bengals should be able to move the ball and score, even against Pittsburgh’s defense. The market is still a touch higher on the Steelers than I am, and grabbing this below a field goal is advantageous.  Make no mistake, Carolina isn’t very good, but they are undervalued at this number. Bryce Young looks like an NFL quarterback and, while the Panthers are going to give up some points here, they can go shot-for-shot with the Bucs at home. NFC South overs have crushed all season. I’m not getting off the train just yet and, as noted earlier, I think this might even be a spot when the Over is correlated to the underdog to some degree. Tampa Bay’s defense should pave the way for some fireworks."

	A pair of Buffaloes go off the board to start our latest mock draft, while four quarterbacks end up going in the first round.","We are at the end of college football’s regular season, which coincides with the unofficial start of the stretch run for the NFL season: Thanksgiving Day games. Right now, we have a pretty good idea of who the best teams are in the league, and can start to predict with a little bit of certainty what needs teams will have as the 2025 NFL Draft rolls around and which college football players could do a good job filling them. As such, it’s time for us to roll out the second version of our mock draft for next April — you can check out how things played out the last time we did this right here. As for how this one is going to go, well, how about a team trading up for Shedeur Sanders to get us started? (Draft order as of Nov. 27, 2024) If it’s not evident by the fact that they benched then cut Daniel Jones midseason and are currently starting Tommy DeVito when he’s healthy, the Giants really want a high pick and really need a quarterback, and a trade up to 1 to take Sanders makes sense if they can’t tank their way to the top pick. While he doesn’t have the strongest arm on earth, Sanders is an excellent processor of the game and can throw the ball accurately all over the place. He’s gotten better about getting the ball out and not hunting big plays that lead to sacks — Colorado’s OL taking a step forward helps, of course — and while the Giants don’t have nearly the level of playmakers that Colorado has relative to their level of competition, he’d love getting to throw to Malik Nabers. Add in that he has the sort of big personality that can handle New York and the Giants could theoretically hire his father if they fire Brian Daboll and Sanders checks a ton of boxes here. The Jaguars move down a spot, pick up some extra picks for their trouble, and get the best football player in this Draft — and in fact, if you were to look up “football player” in a dictionary, there should be a photo of Travis Hunter there. Hunter is doing things we’ve never really seen playing both ways at an elite level in college, and while it’s possible he eventually has to choose a primary position in the NFL – I could see him picking receiver or corner and then playing mostly high leverage snaps at the other – his versatility and ability at either spot would be a welcome addition or a Jags team that just needs more talent. Also, if his goal is to play both sides in the NFL, the Jags are a team that needs help at both spots, so they’d likely be thrilled to let him give it a go.  Ward’s rise from a QB at Incarnate Word to a Heisman contender for the College Football Playoff-bound Miami Hurricanes really has been impressive. He’s a dynamic thrower of the ball with good mobility and has gotten better and better over the course of his career. He’ll take some sacks and put the ball in danger a little more than I’d like, but that’s an area where he’s grown during his time with the Canes. The Raiders need a lot of help in a lot of different places, but above all else, their top priority this April should be getting a franchise quarterback they can build around. Ward would provide that. The Patriots need to bolster their offensive line to better protect Drake Maye. The rookie QB has impressed in flashes since taking over as the starter, but he’s under pressure far more often than New England would like. This isn’t the best tackle class in history, but Kelvin Banks Jr. has been terrific for the Longhorns and would be welcomed with open arms by Maye and the Pats. He’s just a junior but has 37 starts already under his belt at Texas and has excellent movement skills and strength.  It’s still unclear if Bryce Young is the long-term answer for the Panthers, but it has been impressive how he’s managed to respond to getting benched earlier this year — he hasn’t been an MVP candidate or anything, but it looks like getting a hard reset has led to the game slowing down a bit for him. No matter who the QB is, Carolina could use a No. 1 receiver to add to an interesting group of pass catchers, and Burden is that guy. He’s got everything you want outside of the fact he’s 5’11, as he’s a major big play threat who can line up just about anywhere and would give Young another really fun target to go alongside promising youngsters Xavier Legette and Ja’Tavion Sanders. The Titans could be in play for a new QB, but if Sanders and Ward are off the board, I think their focus needs to be in the trenches. Will Campbell is the other top tackle in this Draft and whether Tennessee rolls with Will Levis for one more year or addresses the QB situation in free agency, they’ll want to do a better job keeping them upright. Campbell figures to be capable of providing that help, and it’s time to build inside-out in Tennessee.  The Jets are in the middle of one of the most disappointing years we’ve ever seen out of an NFL team relative to preseason expectations, and they’re going to need throw the baby out with the bathwater as they move on from the Aaron Rodgers era, which means a big roster shakeup that should include Haason Reddick leaving as a free agent. There isn’t really a QB worth taking here, so New York should just go with the best player available, which we think means Carter. The linebacker-turned-edge rusher has seemingly gotten better every week for the Penn State defense, he’s going to destroy the Combine, and would bolster a good Jets defensive line that features building blocks in Quinnen Williams and Will McDonald. It’s can come off as lazy to compare Carter to Micah Parsons as another LB-turned-EDGE from Penn State who wears 11, but also, that’s a pretty good comp. The Browns would be in a really interesting spot at this spot in the Draft. Perhaps by April a third QB will emerge as a consensus top-10 guy, but based on the play on the field this year, I’m not willing to put any other QB up here. Whoever is under center in Cleveland next year is going to need some guys to throw to, as Amari Cooper is gone and the current receiving corps is far from loaded. Tet McMillan would immediately give them a big-bodied No. 1 that can help any quarterback that ends up taking snaps in Cleveland next year. Arizona may have fallen off as a team, but the 6’5 McMillan is a one-man wrecking crew on the outside that no one has been able to figure out. As long as they don’t go down the Nick Wright path with this pick, they should really target McMillan if they can’t get one of the QBs. Good things tend to happen when teams select guys who played in Georgia’s defense. The Saints need to figure out a direction after firing Dennis Allen midseason (it does seem like interim coach Darren Rizzi has a real shot at getting the job), but a big part of that direction is figuring out a succession plan for guys like Cameron Jordan and Demario Davis. Chase Young is a free agent after this year, too, so they have a big hole at EDGE, and Williams is a long and talented option to build the pass rush around going forward. His numbers haven’t been quite as imposing as you might expect, but the measurables, good tape, and Georgia pedigree all make him worth a top-10 pick. The Bengals can’t stop anyone this year, and as a result, they are completely wasting what should be an MVP season from Joe Burrow. If they’re picking 10th and the best corner is sitting on the board still available, they should sprint to the podium to get this pick in. Johnson has been a bit out of sight, out of mind while sitting out with an injury, but he’s a bad dude on the outside and Cincy desperately needs an upgrade in their secondary. I know the temptation will be to replace Tee Higgins (who is almost assuredly not going to be back) with a top-10 receiver, but this is a thin receiver class at the very top once Burden and McMillan are off the board and their bigger issues are on defense, anyway.  Dallas has to figure out a ton of stuff this offseason, and in my eyes, none are bigger than “how do we keep opposing offenses from moving the ball on us at will?” Sorting out Micah Parsons’ future is important, but so is bolstering the heart of their defensive line, which is just not good enough. Graham could fix that immediately, as he’s the rare gigantic defensive tackle (6’3, 315 pounds) who is disruptive on all three downs and would make it easier for a guy like Parsons to eat off the edge. You can go in a lot of directions here, but Graham is the perfect mix of best player available and fills a need for the Cowboys. The Bears have to upgrade their line this offseason in front of Caleb Williams. The interior of the line is really the biggest need, but they could use an upgrade at tackle, as well. Simmons suffered a season-ending knee injury against Oregon, but was in the mix as one of the top tackles coming into this year after the way he played as a junior in 2023. They addressed the skill positions last year, but this Draft should be all about the trenches (on both sides of the ball) for the Bears.  Don’t discount a tight end here, as the Colts do seem like they’re still all-in on Anthony Richardson and that’s the biggest skill position hole on their offense — both Colston Loveland and Tyler Warren would be outstanding fits in Indianapolis. But their defense is not great, and Scourton would give them a powerful EDGE who can play the run or the pass, and is big enough (6’4, 285 pounds) that he can line up at defensive tackle in some situations. He’s been a key piece on the Aggie defense this year, and would be a good fit on a Colts defensive line that prioritizes big, physical dudes. Miami might see both of their safeties leave this offseason, and just generally could use a talent upgrade in the middle of the field. Malaki Starks would provide that, as the Georgia safety is a special player with positional versatility at either safety spot and can play some nickel. Starks flies around at the back end of the Georgia secondary and would bring some needed juice to the Dolphins defense.  It’s unfortunate that Morrison is out for the year with a hip injury, because he is a fantastic player and would make a Notre Dame defense that might be the best in America even better. He has just about every tool in the toolkit that you want out of a star cornerback, as he’s comfortable manning up opposing receivers or dropping into a zone, and he’s very willing to do what he needs to do against the run. A starting outside corner is going to be high on the list of priorities for the Bucs this offseason, and they manage to get one here. The Rams would be slightly upset they can’t get Morrison, but then, they’d remember they can get Revel and would be over the moon. If he didn’t tear his ACL before the season, Revel would have a real shot at going in the top-10 this year because of his elite size, athleticism, and competitive nature. Los Angeles desperately needs to come out of the Draft this year with one of the three standout cornerbacks, and while they miss on Johnson and Morrison, Revel fills the need they have, and it won’t shock us if you see a number of comparisons between him and Eagles rookie standout Quinyon Mitchell. The Niners are going to be in a fascinating spot this offseason if things don’t turn around quickly. But whether they are making major changes to personnel or just trying to retool for one more run with this group, adding some talent on the offensive line would be a good idea. Upgrading their right tackle spot would make a ton of sense, and if Williams doesn’t stay another year at Texas (which is in play if he thinks that’d get him a top 5-10 pick next year), he’s a mountain of a man that would likely intrigue John Lynch and company in the Bay.  James Conner is a free agent, and the Cardinals have seen the value in having a physical, bruising rushing threat alongside Kyler Murray this season. Well, there’s no one better at that style of running than Ashton Jeanty, and while it’s always a little tricky to find the spot for a running back in the first round, he’s a no-doubt talent. The Cardinals would be thrilled to land him at this spot, and the likely Heisman finalist would be very fun to see alongside Murray in the desert.  At some point, the Falcons will be good at rushing the passer again. It really is stunning just how long it has been since they’ve had a player record double-digit sacks in a season (it hasn’t happened since 2016!), and it’s not going to happen this year barring a miracle, either. They don’t even really pressure quarterbacks. Enter Pearce, who has been a load off the edge for Tennessee over the last two seasons — as of this writing, he has 17 sacks in two years. He could use some polish, but he’d be as good of a bet as Atlanta’s made on a young pass rusher in quite some time. Seattle is gonna be looking for some help up the middle on defense at just about every level this offseason. If the board shakes out this way, Seattle would have to at least consider adding the big fella from Kentucky to bolster the interior of their defensive front, with Jarran Reed a potential free agent departure. Mike MacDonald is going to want to beef up his defense and what better way to do that than adding a 6’6, 344 pound wrecking ball up front, as Walker pops off the screen every time you watch Kentucky.  This is a bit of a luxury pick, but Washington has its face of the franchise under center in Jayden Daniels, and one of his favorite targets is soon-to-be free agent tight end Zach Ertz, who turns 35 this offseason. As such, we’ll give him Warren, who has been the best tight end in college football this year and a remarkably versatile piece for the Nittany Lion offense. He’ll play as a tight end, outside receiver, slot receiver, running back, quarterback, and snap the ball, all in the same game. An offense built around Daniels, Warren, and Terry McLaurin would be one of the most fun in the NFL, and if the Commanders want to challenge the Eagles in the NFC East, they’re going to need guys who will help them win shootouts. The Texans have two great edge rushers in Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson, but their interior line play has left something to be desired. Williams helps anchor the excellent defensive front for Ohio State, as very few teams find room to run in the middle against the Buckeyes this season. Putting the 327-pounder between Hunter and Anderson would help address some of Houston’s problems, and the Texans have shown in the past they want to invest heavily in their defensive line.  One of the biggest surprises in the NFL this year has been the Broncos, which look like they struck gold by picking Bo Nix last year. Their tight end room hasn’t given them much of anything this year — Adam Trautman has nine catches on 15 targets — but as we saw with Jimmy Graham in New Orleans, Sean Payton can do some really fun things with a big time player in that position. Loveland fits that bill. He’s a good blocker for a college tight end who hasn’t been able to show off his effectiveness in the passing game as much this year because of how bad the QB play has been in Ann Arbor. And with no receivers really worth taking here, Denver brings in the best skill position player on the board for their young QB. Wow, crazy, Jim Harbaugh takes one of his former Michigan players, what a shock. Truth be told, if Loveland is on the board, we think Harbaugh himself might sprint to the podium to say his name within 10 seconds of the Chargers getting on the clock, as he would fill a critical need for another pass catcher. Instead, they go with another Michigan Man™ who fills a need in Grant, who moves really well for his size (6’3, 339 pounds) and would know exactly what he needs to do in Jesse Minter’s defense from day one. He can slide right in at nose tackle and make life easier for everyone in the Chargers’ front seven. The Ravens defense has not been playing at the level folks in Baltimore are accustomed to, and that figures to be the focal point of their offseason. Walker would give the Ravens a really talented and versatile linebacker that they can use as an edge rusher and play off ball some when needed next to fellow Bulldog Roquan Smith. Walker has shown flashes this season, particularly in the Texas game where he had three sacks in a blowout win for the Dawgs, and Baltimore could find plenty of ways to use his talents.  A real wild card team at the end of the first round right now, the Steelers could be all over the place. One thing they’ll at least have to think about is a quarterback, as they don’t have a long-term answer right now. I’d expect Russell Wilson to be back on a short-term deal, but at this pick, they might consider taking the hyper-talented Milroe and letting him sit and learn some of the finer points of the passing game at the NFL level before throwing him out on the field. Milroe is an S-tier athlete, and the Steelers could get him some touches and action in running packages, where he’d be even more dynamic than Justin Fields is in those spots now.  In a division that features three opposing teams with a wealth of pass catching options, Green Bay could really stand to upgrade its cornerback room and put someone on the other side of Jaire Alexander, who has also missed some time this year due to injuries. Bolstering their pass rush wouldn’t be a bad idea, either, but Barron is a veteran, battle-tested member of the Longhorn secondary who plays all over the place and would brings some versatility and tenacity to Lambeau. Aaron Jones has been great for Minnesota on a 1-year rental, but they will likely be looking for a long-term answer at running back next year as they presumably prepare for JJ McCarthy to take over as their starting quarterback. Hampton doesn’t get a lot of discussion because UNC stinks, but he’s a crazy talented back and I think he’s going to be really good in the NFL. The Vikings love using running backs in the pass game, too, and Hampton has 34 catches for 295 yards this season. Beck has had a rollercoaster season in Athens, which has led to some reconsidering his position in this Draft. That said, I think by the time we get to April, he’ll be firmly back in the first round conversation thanks to some Pro Day buzz, and this might be too late to get him. If he is still on the board, someone that missed out early on the top two guys would have to look at trading back in to get him, and I think the Browns should seriously consider doing that. Philly is a willing trade-back team and there’s no one particularly exciting here to add for them. Cleveland desperately needs an answer at QB long-term after the disaster that has been Deshaun Watson. Beck had a really bad stretch of turnover-prone games and the decision-making has been questionable at times, but he also makes the kinds of throws that make scouts and coaches go wild. Perhaps the Browns would rather bottom out next year to chase on of the top QBs then — a top guy in the 2026 class if he stays in school another year, Penn State QB Drew Allar, is from northeast Ohio and a childhood Browns fan — but I think someone will look to jump back into the first round to secure Beck if he slides this far.  Receiver wouldn’t be a bad course of action for the Bills, but there really isn’t anyone who would step right in and raise the group’s ceiling, plus they can just re-sign Amari Cooper. Instead, let’s have them get a running mate at defensive tackle for Ed Oliver in Harmon, who has been really good for the Ducks this year after transferring in from Michigan State. He’s big, disruptive, plays the run well, and is among Oregon’s leaders in sacks and tackles for loss.  The name of the game in Kansas City is keeping Patrick Mahomes upright, and despite being only 11 games into the season, he’s been sacked 27 times — he’s never been sacked more than 28 times in his career, and he’s getting sacked on 6.62 percent of his dropbacks, a career-high. They have to protect him better, and targeting Ersery to replace Wanya Morris at LT would make a ton of sense. A three-year starter for PJ Fleck, Ersery is 6’6, 325 pounds, a good athlete for his size, and brings some bite as a run blocker, too. He impressed in his biggest test of the season (Abdul Carter had zero sacks when Minnesota played Penn State), and we wouldn’t be surprised if he’s off the board sooner than this, especially if he tests well in Indianapolis. The Lions will have a vanity pick, which is pretty wild to consider, and what says “Dan Campbell vanity pick” more than taking an interior offensive lineman. The tackle position is set for years in Detroit, but they could use some help bolstering their guard spot between them — it’s worth remembering that Graham Glasgow turns 33 this offseason, while Kevin Zeitler turns 35. I think the Lions would love to have a swing guy that can move around as needed on the line, and Jackson started the year as a guard for the Buckeyes but kicked out to left tackle when Josh Simmons got hurt and will presumably finish the year there."

	A very good 'Inside the NBA' riff revolved around one moment on Kendrick Lamar's new album and some curious decisions Drake's made recently.","Kendrick Lamar stunned everyone last week when he teased and then dropped his newest album, GNX. Two things happened very quickly: One, it began receiving widespread acclaim, and two, people started screaming “MUSTARD” as loud as they could immediately after they heard “TV Off” for the first time. Lamar screams it on the track as a way to shout out collaborator DJ Mustard, and because the internet just does this sometimes, it got turned into a meme. Because it was a thing people were making jokes about, it seemed a foregone conclusion that it would pop up on Inside the NBA sooner rather than later. And during halftime of Tuesday night’s NBA Cup game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Phoenix Suns, “TV Off” came over the speakers, which led to a very good riff from the fellas and special guest panelist Jalen Rose. Shaq decided to scream “MUSTAAAAAARD” a few times and crack a joke or two, while Rose slid in a spectacular line that we assume Drake won’t love. “I don’t know if y’all should be playing that Kendrick,” Rose told the desk. “You don’t wanna get a lawsuit up in here.” “Lawsuits don’t scare us around here,” Ernie Johnson quickly responded. Rose, of course, is referencing the multiple legal actions that Drake has threatened against Universal Music Group around the biggest song from his feud with Kendrick over the summer, “Not Like Us.” No lawsuits have been filed yet, but if this does turn into a full-blown legal fight between Drake and UMG, we are willing to be large sums of money that Inside is going to make a ton of jokes about it."

	While it is unclear if Jokic has picked a side in the Drake and Kendrick feud, at least he knows one of the songs from it.","Here’s the thing with Nikola Jokic: Despite being the best basketball player on the planet, he’s done a very good job of keeping his personal life and interests away from the court out of the public eye. All we really know about him is that the dude absolutely loves horses, to the point that he was pretty bummed when he learned that the Denver Nuggets’ championship parade in 2023 was going to keep him from getting back to his horses in Serbia as soon as possible. Well as it turns out, we now know a thing that Nikola Jokic apparently likes: the song “Not Like Us.” While warming up for Monday’s game between the Nuggets and the New York Knicks, Jokic rapped along to the song while Russell Westbrook had the time of his life on the bench, which you can view here. I would love to know Jokic’s complete thoughts on the feud between Kendrick Lamar and Drake, along with whether or not he knows all the words to “Euphoria,” “6:16 in LA,” and of course, “Meet the Grahams.” A lot of this is because, when we did this back in 2019, Jokic refused to answer because he claimed it was someone I’d have never heard of, so I am fascinated in learning more about his taste in music."
Sports – UPROXX,Charles Barkley Thinks The Lakers Are Doing An ‘Awful’ Job Handling Bronny’s Development,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/charles-barkley-lakers-bronny-james-development-g-league/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 18:27:33 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	Barkley thinks the Lakers are doing Bronny a disservice keeping him from playing road games with the G League.","The Los Angeles Lakers have gotten off to a solid start to the 2024-25 season, going 10-6 in their first 16 games with JJ Redick at the helm. Even with the actual play on the court going pretty well, the Lakers still manage to create a bit of controversy with the way they are handling the rookie season of second round pick Bronny James.  Bronny made his debut in the opener alongside LeBron, becoming the first father-son duo in league history to play together, and since then has made 6 NBA appearances — including in the Lakers visit to Cleveland, where Bronny was born. He’s also spent some time in the G League with the South Bay Lakers, playing two games so far with the Lakers affiliate. The reason Bronny has only made two appearances in the G League is the decision was made not have Bronny traveling and playing road games with South Bay. That, of course, limits the opportunities for James to get in game action, which is the point of having him in the G League, but travel for G League teams isn’t by charter and the decision was made just to keep him in L.A.  That move has led to plenty of conversation, with much of it focusing on whether the Lakers are stunting Bronny’s development with their plan. Charles Barkley certainly thinks so, explaining on a recent radio hit on “The Bettor Angle” why he thinks it’s not fair to Bronny or the South Bay Lakers (10:00 mark of the below video).  “They’ve handled it awful,” Barkley said. “Awful. … I thought it was great, a little ceremonial first game, but the kid’s not ready to play in the NBA. He should be in the G League so he can play basketball. He’s not going to get better sitting on the bench. But also this thing where he’s only gonna play home games, it’s wild? You mean stupid. It’s not fair to him. It’s not fair to the team. Can you imagine a coach of that — like, you come off a road trip and there’s a player you ain’t seen in a week or two, and then you feel like you gotta play him. I don’t think they’re doing Bronny any favors and they just handled this thing really bad. It’s a bad look for the Lakers. I actually think it’s a bad look — I really like everything LeBron’s done, but this is a bad look for him in my opinion.”  There’s no doubt that Bronny needs game reps and keeping him off of the road certainly limits his chances to get those. As for the bit about a guy being on and off the roster throughout the season, if there’s anywhere guys are going to be accustomed to dealing with that, it’s the G League where you regularly have players going up and down to and from NBA rosters — particularly with two-way deals being so prominent now. The reasoning from the Lakers (and James family) perspective is likely that flying commercial and going to G League arenas brings some considerable security questions that are not guaranteed to be met for someone with Bronny’s popularity. That said, it’s hard to argue with the criticism that James isn’t getting the maximum opportunity to develop from a basketball perspective."

	Four injured All-Stars are all expected to return to the court this week.","Injuries: They’re not fun! For the first month or so of the season, fans have lamented that some of the biggest stars in the league have missed time due to knocks they suffered this season. Fortunately, we haven’t seen too many long-term injuries that are set to cost guys extended periods of time, and this week, a handful of former All-Star selections who have spent time on the sidelines are slated to return to action. Arguably the biggest beneficiaries of this are the Phoenix Suns, which have spent the last seven games without Kevin Durant due to a calf strain and have looked awful with him sidelined. Over the last five games, Phoenix has also dealt with the absence of Bradley Beal due to his own calf strain. Fortunately for the Suns, both are expected to be back for Tuesday’s NBA Cup game against the Los Angeles Lakers, according to Shams Charania of ESPN. The Memphis Grizzlies, meanwhile, have seemingly been in a state of injury crisis for the last year, with Ja Morant getting caught up in that. After only appearing in nine games last year due to a suspension and a shoulder injury that he suffered in practice, Morant has only played in eight games this year due to a hip injury, but that is going to change on Monday night, according to Chris Haynes. Morant, who has not played since Nov. 6, is in line to return for the Grizzlies’ game against the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday night. In a good bit of news for the New Orleans Pelicans, Haynes also reported that their high-profile offseason acquisition, Dejounte Murray, is slated to return to action after suffering a hand fracture in the team’s season opener — although he won’t play in Monday’s game against the Toronto Raptors, Murray is expected to return on Wednesday against the Indiana Pacers. The team traded for Murray in a deal with the Atlanta Hawks, but he’s only been able to give them 30 minutes this year due to his injury, which is part of the reason why New Orleans is off to a Western Conference-worst 4-13 start to the year."

	Porzingis has not played this season after suffering a foot injury during the 2024 NBA Finals.","The Boston Celtics have been on a role to start this season, as the team is 14-3 at this early juncture, sits in second place in the Eastern Conference behind the scorching hot Cleveland Cavaliers (who Boston has already beaten this year), and looks to be in as good of a position to defend a championship as any team in recent memory. All of this has happened without the services of Kristaps Porzingis, who has not played this season after suffering a foot injury during the NBA Finals that required surgery. Fortunately for the Celtics, their time without Porzingis on the floor is about to come to an end. According to Shams Charania of ESPN, Boston is going to get Porzingis back during Monday night’s game against the Los Angeles Clippers. “Porzingis has been making rapid improvements in his recovery from foot surgery in late June, completing scrimmages in recent weeks of practices with the Celtics and their NBA G League affiliate, Maine,” Charania wrote. Porzingis joined the Celtics via a trade with the Washington Wizards last offseason and immediately became a perfect fit for how Joe Mazzulla wants to use his centers. His three point shooting and ability to protect the rim were invaluable when he was able to play, but a calf injury limited him to only seven games in the team’s run to a championship last year. Not long after his return in the NBA Finals, the Celtics announced that Porzingis suffered a torn medial retinaculum allowing dislocation of the posterior tibialis tendon in his left leg during Game 2, which the team deemed a “rare injury.” He was able to play 16 minutes in their Game 5 win that sealed a championship, but needed offseason surgery."

	The Cowboys led 20-9 with just over three minutes to play and ended up with a 34-26 win thanks to the dumbest finish to a game this year.","The Commanders and Cowboys played in. one of the funniest games in the NFL this season, as the two divisional rivals went back and forth with each team being on the wrong end of some massive blunders in what ended up a 34-26 Cowboys win.  The final three minutes was particularly insane, as it saw the game go from 20-9 Dallas to 34-26 with a truly outrageous sequence of events. The first was a touchdown from Jayden Daniels to Zach Ertz, with Daniels running in the two-point try to make it 20-17. On the ensuing kickoff, Kavontae Turpin let the ball bounce in front of him and had it roll past him for a near-disaster, before turning it into a touchdown return with a quick spin move and outrageous speed, making it 27-17.   A post shared by NFL (@nfl)  The Commanders would then kick a field goal with just under two minutes to play to make it 27-20. A failed onside kick figured to be about the end of things, but it was truly just the beginning. Washington’s defense got the three-and-out needed to give their offense a chance at a miracle, and Daniels delivered for the second time this season as Dallas’ defense melted down, allowing Terry McLaurin to catch the ball and evade everyone on his way for an 87-yard touchdown. However, Austin Seibert had already missed an extra point earlier in the game, so it was anything but a guarantee they would tie the game, and sure enough a bad snap led to a rushed operation and Seibert hooked another left of the uprights to keep it a 1-point game (videos below).   A post shared by NFL (@nfl)  On the ensuing onside kick, the Cowboys scooped it up and ran it back for a touchdown, which was the one thing that could keep the Commanders hopes alive, as they would get the ball back with time on the clock and a chance at another Hail Mary. Alas, this time Daniels’ efforts at a miracle ended up being caught by Dallas and the game finally ended with a Cowboys win that became far more difficult than it ever needed to be."

	Fred VanVleet did not like getting ejected and definitely earned a fine with how he went out at the end of Blazers-Rockets.","The Houston Rockets have had a phenomenal start to the 2024-25 season, entering Saturday’s game against Portland at 12-5 on the young season, but things did not go as planned against the scrappy, young Blazers in a 104-98 loss.  The frustrations of that loss were evident late in the fourth quarter when Fred VanVleet got ejected after getting into it with the officials, telling them all that they suck, but then took things a step further after getting run by walking directly to the official that tossed him, pointing in his face, and telling him “you’re a b*tch.”  pic.twitter.com/wtHPtHgSMc — Diamond Scar (@diamondscar22) November 24, 2024  From the TV angle, it wasn’t clear if VanVleet made contact with the official’s face, which was of concern to the Rockets broadcast crew as that would’ve been an auto-suspension. However, a side angle showed that he did not make contact, but did still point his finger right in the ref’s face in a moment that wasn’t exactly his finest. This will definitely lead to VanVleet paying a hefty fine to the league office, and we’ll have to wait and see if, even without actually poking the ref, this crossed enough of a line to earn him a night off without pay. VanVleet is averaging 14.9 points and 6.2 assists per game this season for Houston."

	The Warriors tend to have very good seasons when Kendrick Lamar puts out an album.","Kendrick Lamar stunned everyone on Friday afternoon. There had been hopes for months that a new album was on the way following his high-profile feud with Drake, and it looked like we were going to get another sign that something big was on the horizon when he released the music video for “GNX.” And then, Kendrick took things a step further by just releasing his sixth studio album, which is also titled “GNX.” Because it is an album that Kendrick Lamar released out of nowhere, people went from being stunned to praising the project. And it’s possible that no one ends up being happier about this than the Golden State Warriors. Why, you may ask? Well, as it turns out, good things tend to happen to the Warriors — which entered Friday night’s game against the New Orleans Pelicans with an 11-3 record, good for first place in the Western Conference — when Kendrick puts out an album. Each of the last four times that has happened, the team has gone on to win an NBA championship, with To Pimp a Butterfly coming out in March 2015, Damn. getting released in April 2017, and Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers dropping in April 2022. There was also the soundtrack to Black Panther, which came out in February 2018 and featured songs that were either performed or curated by Kendrick. As for his other two studio albums, Section.80 and good kid, m.A.A.d city, the former came out a few weeks after they drafted Klay Thompson, and the latter was released in Oct. 2012, one week before the start of the 2012-13 NBA season, which marked the first time that Golden State made it to the postseason with Steph Curry on the team. Now, the overwhelming likelihood is that this is a bunch of insane coincidences, but if the Warriors do end up winning a championship, we’re going to think something weird is going on … and Kendrick will probably be a little bummed, as he’s a well-documented fan of the Los Angeles Lakers, which are currently the 4-seed in the West and find themselves 1.5 games back of Golden State."

	Jones, the No. 6 overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, was benched by the Giants earlier this week.","The New York Giants made the decision to bench starting quarterback Daniel Jones earlier this week amid a brutal year where the offense has struggled to find any sort of consistent rhythm. Now, in a shocking turn of events, the team announced on Friday afternoon that the sixth overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft asked for and was granted his immediate release. In a statement, which you can read in its entirely below, Giants president John Mara praised Jones for his handling of his benching, and made clear that parting ways was a mutual decision. Daniel came to see me this morning and asked if we would release him. We mutually agreed that would be the best for him and for the team.  Daniel has been a great representative of our organization, first class in every way. His handling of this situation yesterday exemplifies just that. We are all disappointed in how things have worked out.  We hold Daniel in high regard and have a great appreciation for him. We wish him nothing but the best in the future. Jones has had a tumultuous tenure in New York, as the decision to draft him that high was largely based on his perceived upside. While he’s certainly flashed the ability to be an accurate passer and a threat with his legs — so much so that the team gave him a $160 million extension in 2023 that was cited as a reason why they could not bring back Saquon Barkley in free agency this offseason — he’s never been able to become the face of the franchise the team envisioned. The Giants sit at 2-8 on the season, and are playing host to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday afternoon. The team has already announced that Tommy DeVito will start under center. To add some intrigue to this, the Giants face the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving this year. Dallas has had its own QB struggles this season as Dak Prescott is out for the year with the injury, and if they wanted, it would make sense to bring in Jones and try to get him up to speed ahead of Thursday."

	Miller made one of the best defensive plays you will ever see to stop an alley-oop by the Pistons.","The Charlotte Hornets and the Detroit Pistons squared off on Thursday night in a battle of two up-and-coming teams that hope to take a step forward in the Eastern Conference this season. While neither of them are expected to compete for a championship or anything, both are built around promising young players and hope that better days are on the horizon. One of the brightest young stars in Thursday’s game was Brandon Miller, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft who flashed as a rookie and has built on that in a big way during his second year in the league. Unfortunately for the Pistons, that meant finding out that Miller is a freak of nature, as evidenced by him making one of the best defensive plays you will ever see when he single-handedly blew up an attempted alley-oop by picking a Wendell Moore lob out of mid-air.  A post shared by NBA (@nba)  If Miller became horizontal during this, it’d look an awful lot like Odell Beckham Jr.’s famous one-handed catch from when he played for the Giants. Anyway, the Hornets won in overtime, 123-121, with Miller leading the way, as the former Alabama standout went for 38 points, seven rebounds, four assists, four steals, and a block in 42 minutes of work."

	Gobert got a 3-second call as he pouted over not getting the ball late in a tie game, and Anthony Edwards was not happy.","The Minnesota Timberwolves were one of the best teams and stories of the 2023-24 season, as Anthony Edwards made the leap into superstardom, Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert figured out how to play off of each other around him, and they made a run to the Western Conference Finals.  The vibes in Minnesota were, as they say, immaculate, but then a week before training camp they traded Towns to New York for Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo in a trade that has seen both the Knicks and Wolves struggling to build chemistry early in the season. Both teams are still hovering around .500, but the Knicks can get away with that in the East and still have a good look at a top-4 seed. In the West things are very different, as the Wolves came into Thursday’s game in Toronto with a tenuous hold on sixth at 8-6, needing a win to avoid dropping to a tie for 10th early this season.  In theory, the 3-12 Raptors should’ve been a good spot to get a win for the Wolves, but Minnesota found themselves in a dogfight with Toronto (on their incredible alternate court) late in the fourth quarter. With the game tied at 95-95 and five minutes to play, the Wolves chemistry issues became apparent when Randle waved off Gobert who had deep post position under the hoop, and the 4-time DPOY responded by walking to the other side of the lane to get a 3-second violation.   A post shared by LeagueAlerts Inc. (@leaguealerts)  While Gobert’s frustration is understandable, as he had two feet in the restricted area with a seal on a smaller defender and didn’t get the ball, you also can’t purposefully get a turnover in a tie game in the fourth quarter. That was what Anthony Edwards was thinking, as he got on Gobert as they came down the floor, letting him know that’s not an acceptable reaction to not getting the ball. That turnover proved to be important as the Wolves saw the Raptors pull away late for a 110-105 win, dropping Minnesota to 8-7 and a tie for 10th in the West with Dallas and Sacramento."

	To celebrate Hubie Brown calling it a career, we looked back on how old he was during major events that happened in his lifetime.","Basketball fans are going to see broadcasts get a little worse sooner rather than later. That’s because Hubie Brown, the legendary former coach who has turned into a stalwart on ESPN’s coverage of the league, will only call one more game before he retires at 91 years old. “We are going to give Hubie one last shot on a game,” ESPN president Burke Magnus told Jimmy Traina of Sports Illustrated. “He deserves that. We think the world of him. I think it is absolutely remarkable the level in which he still calls games at age 90-plus. I don’t mean to be purposely mysterious here but we are going to honor Hubie during the regular season at some point to be determined and send him off in style.” That he is still capable of working at 91 is remarkable, but Brown is still sharp as a tack and as good as it gets calling basketball games, and while no one has deserved retirement more, it’s always a tough day when someone as highly-regarded as him calls it a career. There is, still, no one better at seeing something, pointing it out, and explaining why it’s a big deal than Brown, and he has terrific chemistry with his broadcast partners. We’re all going to miss Hubie, and to celebrate the end of his time in the booth, we wanted to celebrate him by having some fun and looking at everything he’s seen over his extraordinary life. You see, Hubie was born on Sept. 25, 1933, which means he has been around for, quite literally, every single game that the NBA has played — the league was founded in June of 1946, when he was 12 years old. That got us wondering: How old was he during some of the biggest moments in world, American, and NBA history over the last century or so? Let’s dive in. Start of WWII: 5 years old (Sept. 1, 1939)
End of WWII: 11 years old (Sept. 2, 1945)
The first NBA game: 13 years old (Nov. 1, 1946)

Wilt Chamberlain plays in his first NBA game: 26 years old (Oct. 24, 1959)
John F. Kennedy Assassination: 30 years old (Nov. 22, 1963)
Super Bowl I: 34 years old (Jan. 15, 1967)
First moon landing: 36 years old (July 20, 1969) End of the Vietnam War: 41 years old (April 30, 1975)
Hubie Brown’s first game as an NBA head coach with the Atlanta Hawks: 42 years old (Oct. 21, 1976)
The first time Larry Bird and Magic Johnson played in the NBA Finals: 51 years old (May 27, 1984)
First NBA Draft Lottery: 52 years old (May 12, 1985)
End of the Cold War: 56 years old (Dec. 3, 1989)
Michael Jordan retires for the first time: 60 years old (Oct. 26, 1993) 9/11: 67 years old (Sept. 11, 2001)

	ESPN content president Burke Magnus explained that the network's biggest star ending up on its newest property is a bit tricky.","ESPN has about a year to figure out how it’s going to handle Inside the NBA. As part of Warner Bros. Discovery’s deal to remain in the NBA’s media ecosystem, it was announced that Turner will continue to produce Inside, but license it out to ESPN, which solves the network’s longstanding issues trying to put together a pregame, halftime, and postgame NBA show that viewers enjoy. An unsurprising question that popped up after this was whether Stephen A. Smith — who is in the middle of some high-profile contract negotiations with ESPN — would find a way onto the show. Smith is the guy ESPN has built its NBA coverage around, and while that has come under plenty of criticism, he’s famously close with the Inside crew and has appeared on it in the past. But apparently, as of now, the network doesn’t have any intetion of putting Stephen A. on their newest property. “We have no plans to do that,” ESPN content president Burke Magnus told Jimmy Traina of Sports Illustrated. “And that’s because, frankly, the construct of the deal really doesn’t — that’s not how it was conceived. What is conceived is that Turner, as they have always done with this show, with this cast, with the people involved behind the scenes, are going to continue to do what they’ve always done. And we’re going to distribute it on the ESPN platform. Frankly, that’s exactly what we want. We don’t want to change it. We don’t want to interject new talent into it. We don’t want to really do anything to it.” It is worth mentioning that the scuttlebutt around Smith’s contract negotiations revolves around him wanting to do more NFL stuff for ESPN, but considering how big Inside is and his relationship with the guys, it is fair to wonder if he’d want to have any sort of presence on the show as part of a new deal (if, of course, he comes to terms with the network on one). For now, the complexities of the deal with Turner gives ESPN a way to say they have no plans of putting him on Inside in any capacity, but we’ll certainly be waiting to see if that changes as Smith and ESPN sit down at the negotiating table.

	Come get these winners.","In many circles, Week 11 has been described as the best slate of games so far when it comes to the 2024 NFL season, and it is hard to argue. There was entertaining action in every window other than Monday night and, on a week-to-week basis, that is not always the case. In this space, we also found success with a third winning week in the last four. Granted, it came with a hilarious investment in a team that lost by approximately 100, but a loss counts the same by a half-point or 30 points, right? Before we get to the Week 12 schedule and five picks against the spread, let’s take a look at the (unfortunately negative) season-long progress. Come get these winners. We struck with our principles last Thursday to success, and we’re doing it again here. It is unsightly to bet on Cleveland right now, and I won’t argue that. The Browns are 2-8 and having a season from hell. With that said, the market is too high on the Steelers in this spot. Pittsburgh continues to be unreal in an underdog role under Mike Tomlin, but the Steelers are 33-41-3 (44.6%) as a road favorite under his watch. Do I think the games from 2008 impact this week? I do not, but I can’t get this to more than a field goal on a short week in Cleveland. Let’s go Browns. This is a space that prides itself on taking the stands that few others will take. This is another example. The Lions are dominating everyone. We found that out the hard way last week. But this is really a 7.5-point number on the road? Detroit’s ATS record (8-2) is stellar but things have gone too far. Or maybe we’ll lose this bet and swear off fading the Lions for a while. Either way, I like the home dog here. Our Wong teaser of the week is here. Tennessee’s defense has been spunky this season, but the Titans still have Will Levis and a rudderless offense that gives us hope in the Texans at home with the move through key numbers. On the other side, I’ve actually been a touch low on the 49ers compared to the market this season and, while that has been the right stance on the whole, this is a principle play to take it up to 8.5. Remember when the 12th Man meant something? Well, the Seahawks are 2-4 at home this season, and the word is out on that. While I am not suggesting that home-field advantage is the reason for this play, I like Seattle to keep it going after a strong performance in an upset over San Francisco a week ago. Arizona is off a bye and on a four-game winning streak but, no matter what I do, I can’t get this to a pick’em, much less than +1 available at BetMGM right now. I don’t give out many road favorites, but I tend to make exceptions for when the Chargers are the home team. Granted, a lot has changed in Los Angeles, with Jim Harbaugh immediately turning the Chargers into a very competent and effective outfit. However, the Chargers still might have the least significant home-field advantage in the NFL, and Baltimore is at least slightly undervalued here coming off a loss to Pittsburgh."

	Charles Barkley wasn't gonna let the night go by without making a joke about their upcoming move to ESPN next fall.","Over the weekend, some exciting news broke regarding the future of Inside the NBA, as ESPN is adding the beloved studio show as part of a new licensing agreement with Warner Bros. Discovery. The show will continue to be produced independently by TNT Sports from their Atlanta studio, with Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, Shaquille O’Neal, and Charles Barkley remaining employees of WBD — well, so long as they get Shaq’s contract done — but they’ll be part of ESPN and ABC’s coverage of the Playoffs, Finals, and major regular season games. That was stunning news to many fans, largely because ESPN has been trying to figure out how to create a competitor to Inside for decades to no avail, and the fellas have never been afraid of making fun of ESPN — particularly Barkley. Chuck has taken ESPN and their analysts to tasks a number of times over the years, and while I doubt that stops in total, he knows times are changing soon for he and the rest of the fellas. On Tuesday night, after the Spurs beat the Thunder in the late game on TNT, Chuck couldn’t help but crack a joke to Kenny Smith that they’ve gotta “go back to kissing ass” ahead of their move to ESPN next fall.  No one has been more outspoken over the last six months about the contract negotiations with the NBA than Barkley, sometimes to the chagrin of his colleagues. He’s been extremely vocal about his frustrations with TNT not keeping NBA rights and has noted his biggest concern is trying to figure out how to keep everyone at TNT employed. That mission seems to have been accomplished with this latest news of the show being licensed to ESPN, and he showed still going to be Chuck and poke fun at the new arrangement."

	Another case of Vince Staples, being Vince Staples.","Vince Staples isn’t afraid to voice his opinion regarding anything and anyone. No one is exempt from the “Little Homies” rapper’s blunt takes—not fellow musicians, fans, or content creators. Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum is the latest person to feel his humorous wrath. Today (November 19), Vince Staples and Jayson Tatum came face-to-face in a new commercial for the Jordan brand (viewable here). Instead of using his beloved lyricism on full display, Vince channelled his words for another reason. As highlights of Tatum’s Championship season took over the screen, Vince gave Tatum a piece of his mind. “What type of dude is Jayson Tatum,” asked Vince. “The type of dude who’d crush a team and then say some cold sh*t like, ‘We just played our game and the rest took care of itself.'” As Vince pointed out, Tatum is a many of few words but when he does speak out against his opponents it cuts deeps. However, Tatum manages to keep a cool head or so Vince argued, saying: “The type that have a whole city and internet, booing him. And he’s just smiling.” Before the clip ends, Vince has one more grievance to air as a long-suffering Los Angeles Clippers fan. “That sh*t really message me up, man,” he said.  Unfazed by it all, Tatum laughs off Vince’s monologue. In Tatum’s eyes, it doesn’t matter who hates him because his partner, singer Ella Mai and their child provides more than enough love to make up for it."

	After a loss dropped the Sixers to 2-11 on the year, the team held a players-only meeting where Maxey voiced a gripe about Embiid.","The Philadelphia 76ers have been the biggest disappointment in the NBA to start the 2024-25 season. While there have been injuries to Joel Embiid, Paul George, and Tyrese Maxey that have prevented them from taking the court as a trio, Philadelphia has gotten off to a 2-11 start this year, which is tied with the openly tanking Washington Wizards for the worst record in the NBA. For a team that entered this season with championship aspirations, it’s pretty shocking to see just how bad Philly has been. And following a 106-89 loss to the Miami Heat on Monday night where the team blew a 19-point lead, Kyle Lowry called for a players-only meeting, according to Shams Charania of ESPN. And per Charania, the meeting included Maxey confronting Embiid with a message that the former NBA MVP “accepted.” Via ESPN: In the meeting, Maxey challenged Embiid to be on time to team activities, calling out the former league MVP about being late “for everything” and how it impacts the locker room, from other players to the coaching staff, sources briefed on the meeting told ESPN. Maxey and Embiid have a close friendship and have a history of holding each other accountable, according to those around the team. Embiid was listed as doubtful to play against the Heat with an illness, but eventually took the floor and struggled, going for 11 points, eight rebounds, and five assists in 31 minutes of work on 5-for-11 shooting from the field. Maxey, meanwhile, was unable to play, as he’s working his way back from a hamstring strain he suffered earlier this season. Charania also noted that Sixers players addressed head coach Nick Nurse, saying that “they want to be coached harder, and coaches in turn said they want players to practice with purpose and attention to detail.”"

	Powerhouse Hobbs has a list of aspirations after spending seven months out with a knee injury.","Powerhouse Hobbs wasn’t sure how fans were going to receive his return. Recency bias is a real thing in the wrestling industry, and any extended absence comes with the reality that you’re out of sight and out of mind.  When he walked out of the tunnel to the roar of the live audience as Ricochet’s surprise partner just two weeks ago, any anxiety over what the reaction would look like evaporated. For Hobbs, it was like he’d never left.  “It was one of those things where it let me know how special this business is, how special the fans are,” Hobbs tells Uproxx Sports. “When it comes down to it, we do it for them. We do it for their entertainment. We do it for their reactions. We do it because we love it. We all love to go out and perform in front of them. But then when they go ahead and give you that love back, man, it makes you want to go even harder.” As smooth as he looked in his return to the ring, the prior seven months were anything but easy.  He ruptured his patella tendon in a main event match, going from the high of being prominently featured on television on Wednesday night to having surgery the following Monday. The next day, he flew across the country, and just a week later was back in the gym determined to return stronger.  “I probably had a few days to be in my feelings and soak everything in,” Hobbs says. “But my main objective was to come back better than when I left. This recovery, I would get up at five, eat, in the gym by six on one leg for two hours, come home, eat, then off to PT for three hours a day, Monday through Saturday.” There were moments Hobbs says he felt helpless. He couldn’t bend his knee at all. He remembers the emotions of asking his three-year-old daughter to help take his sock off, asking his son to help him stand, or making sure he had something to hold onto so he didn’t fall in the shower.  The experience, Hobbs says, humbled him. Small accomplishments compounded. A strong support system that included conversations with wrestling legends like Sting, Mark Henry, and Billy Gunn helped him prepare for the ups, downs, and evolving mindset in how he’d navigate his return.  In his time away, Hobbs focused on the things he could control and put extra effort on how he could elevate other areas of his game.  “I got a lot of promos just sitting on the couch watching wrestling. I was very angry, not being able to do what I want to do,” Hobbs says.  Practicing patience is something Hobbs has had to learn over his four years in AEW, and especially now in what’s essentially a fresh start. You can’t manufacture many of the special moments in wrestling — they’re going to happen organically, like the infamous Meat chants last year. “You’re going to hear the people tell you what they want,” Hobbs says, “so it’s on you to capitalize on it.” Hearing the crowd react to his return, and feeding off their energy over the past few weeks, should give him confidence that he’ll be able to be successful in his career refresh. He created a list of aspirations during his time away, including another singles championship reign.  There’s no order to how he goes about checking off his accomplishments, but admits the primary focus is a “longer, stronger reign.” His path to wearing championship gold again comes with confidence, believing in himself, and turning the volume up on his character.  Before his injury, Hobbs says there were discussions about how he could start bringing who he is in real life to his character. Now that he’s had time to sit and stew on the future, he’s ready to show the world who he is.  “I’m going to start bringing my life into my character, the things that I hate, the things that I love. I’m just gonna show everyone how much more intense I can be, how destructive I can be, how I don’t give a shit at times who’s in my way,” Hobbs says. “In the end, this business, there only can be one. It’s going to come to a point where I’m going to show everybody that it’s all about me. They’re either going to be with me or be against me. It doesn’t matter. They boo me, I’m just going to start tearing everything up in front of them.  “And I think that’s what wrestling is missing a little bit. That one guy who makes people afraid, but they want to see him kick someone’s ass. I feel that it’s time to bring it out.”"

	Jake Paul's boxing fit in his match against Mike Tyson was one of the most expensive in boxing history. Here is what he wore.","Over the weekend, social media sensation turned legit boxer Jake Paul faced off against the mighty (if aged) Mike Tyson, attracting the eyes of 60 million viewers for what was undoubtedly the fight of the year. The two fighters, aged 27 and 58 respectively, lasted the entire eight rounds, with Paul ultimately besting Iron Mike, crushing the hearts of pretty much everybody over the age of 30. But we’re not here to talk about the fight, we’re here to talk about Jake Paul’s fit, which Paul revealed on the “Talk Tuah” podcast was worth over $1 million. “This outfit that I’ve made for the fight is the most expensive fight outfit in the history of boxing,” said Paul. The fit was a custom piece designed by Dominic Ciambrone’s Surgeon Studios and featured metallic silver shorts with diamond tennis chains, and a graphic of Mr. Monopoly holding a money bag. The full outfit was completed with a jewel-encrusted gray jacket prominently featuring the logo of Paul’s new body care line W. It’s flashy, brash, and eye-catching, a perfect reflection of Paul’s whole vibe. Love him or hate him, you can’t deny that this fight helped to solidify Paul’s status as a pop culture icon of the 2020s, and despite Tyson’s advanced age, being able to go toe to toe with the GOAT and come out on top is no easy feat. This is also a big win for Ciambrone, who we’ve been keeping a close eye on since the days he was simply referred to as the Shoe Surgeon. Check out the fit in action below."

	Tyrese Haliburton took over the NBA Cup last year. Which young, up-and-coming player is most likely to do that this year?","Tyrese Haliburton entered last season in an interesting spot. Yes, everyone knew he was a really good, really talented basketball player — he even made it onto the 2023 All-Star team. And yet, Haliburton was mostly a guy who did some cool things on a not great Indiana Pacers team, which came on the heels of him doing some cool things as a rookie and a second-year player on a not great Sacramento Kings team. And then, last season happened. More specifically, the inaugural NBA Cup (known at the time as the In-Season Tournament) happened, and Haliburton was the driving force behind an upstart Pacers team that took it to everyone and made the championship game, where they fell to the Los Angeles Lakers. It was the exact sort of springboard to stardom that a cup competition should provide, as a young, up-and-coming team led by a young, up-and-coming star went on a run and nearly won the whole thing. Haliburton averaged 26.7 points, 13.3 assists, and 4.9 rebounds in seven tournament games, and while he cooled off a bit as the year went on due to lingering injury issues, he was still able to use his NBA Cup performance as a springboard to an All-NBA Third Team nod and an appearance in the Eastern Conference Finals. Now, with this season’s NBA Cup underway, it’s worth wondering which young star is going to use this edition of the tournament as a way to assert themselves as a superstar, and today, we wanted to look at some of the frontrunners to do just that on teams that have already gotten off to good starts in Cup play. The Rockets have been one of the best up-and-coming teams in the league so far this season, and while you can toss a few guys in as their answer (Jalen Green would be a good fit here, too), we’ll go with Sengun, who was great last year but was sidelined with an injury during their big run later in the calendar. Anyone who watches Houston knows that Sengun is good, but ever since they traded James Harden, the Rockets haven’t gotten a ton of attention. The NBA Cup is a chance to change that — they steamrolled the Clippers in their Group A opener last week — and if they can win their game in Minnesota next week, they’re going to be the overwhelming favorites to move out of their group. Add in that Houston has a net rating of +12.98 when Sengun is on the floor this season and while depth is one of their biggest strengths, we’re willing to bet that he’s the guy who will carry them to Cup wins if they come. Atlanta beating the Celtics in their NBA Cup opener was a shock, and they followed it up with a win over Washington in their second game. The craziest thing about the game against Boston: Trae Young didn’t play, as Daniels was a two-way menace (28 points, seven assists, six steals) and Johnson stuffed the stat sheet (18 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists, three steals, a block). Young is, obviously, the face in Atlanta, but on the heels of the Dejounte Murray trade, there’s space for someone to blossom into his star running mate. Daniels’ ability to just ruin opposing backcourts and Johnson’s ability to do anything Atlanta needs on a given night both fit well alongside him, and they’ll both have to be great if the Hawks go on a run. Things have been completely dire in Detroit for a while now, and as a result, Cunningham hasn’t lived up to his billing as a No. 1 overall pick. But things are starting to change — Detroit is 2-0 in Cup play, with Cunningham going for 21 points, nine assists, seven rebounds, and two blocks against the Heat before putting up a 21-point, 10-rebounds, 10-assist triple-double with five steals and a block against the Wizards. He has to cut down on his turnovers, but he’s spearheading the Pistons as they try to take a big step forward under JB Bickerstaff. So far, so good, and if Detroit goes on an improbable NBA Cup run, it’ll be because Cunningham took a big leap towards becoming the face of the franchise the Pistons have craved for years. The most likely option to go on a Haliburton-esque run. Orlando is 2-0 with wins over Charlotte and Philly, even though Paolo Banchero is out with a torn oblique. The ball has been in Wagner’s hands a lot as a result, and the decision has paid off in a big way. He’s starting to find his shot after he couldn’t hit anything last season, while he looks really comfortable as a scorer and a facilitator. The Magic being good without Banchero is only possible because of Wagner, and a trip to the knockout rounds of the NBA Cup is within reach — their game in New York on Dec. 3 looms large, and we cannot wait to see what Wagner does under the bright lights of Madison Square Garden. You might have heard this by now: The Cavs are the best team in basketball this year at 15-0, and they won their only NBA Cup game so far against Charlotte. All eyes are on Tuesday night’s trip to Boston to take on the defending champs, which is the exact sort of high-profile stage Cleveland could use to emphatically say they’re championship and NBA Cup contenders. A big reason for the success? Mobley, as the decision to bring Kenny Atkinson on board as head coach has led to him looking more comfortable on offense and his usual brilliant self on defense. He has to continue to do that if the Cavs are going to be championship contenders, and the NBA Cup is a great place for him to show that he’s taken a step forward in his fourth season. If you want, you can also make a case for Darius Garland here, who has been nothing short of spectacular this season and is showing why he’s one of the best young guards in the league. However, Garland has been an All-Star and Donovan Mitchell is a known commodity, so we’ll go with the young big man as the Cav most likely to turn heads.  The Thunder are in a tricky spot due to the injuries suffered by Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein, so it’s possible they are just not big enough to go on an NBA Cup run. If they can, though, our hunch is it’s because of Williams stepping up and being the perfect running mate alongside Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. He keeps getting better and better the more experience he gets under his belt, and so far this season, Williams has done that again, as he’s putting up career-best marks in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks per game. He won’t unseat Shai as the man in Oklahoma City any time soon, but the Thunder are the exact sort of team that can use the NBA Cup as a chance to announce their arrival to the rest of the league. Williams can do the same."

We pick up the HBCU Homecoming series with only a day left before Director of Bands Chancellor Mills gets to prove himself in his first year in the position with the help of more than 100 band members and his staff. “It’s all in the planning, first and foremost,” Mills said in preparation for the event. “We don’t want to throw anything together and just put it out there; it’s huge this year.” As Mills said, the planning is critical, as the pressure of the occasion couldn’t be any higher, with current students and alumni all expecting a great show. “This performance is just going to signify where this program is,” said Mills. “It’s going to dictate how we’re going to move for the next 3-5 years. It’s significant in terms of what we want to give back to our community.” Fortunately, the hard work pays off as the band comes out at halftime to give the crowd their best with renditions of hip-hop classics produced by Just Blaze, including Joe Budden’s “Pump it Up” and “What We Do” by Freeway, who appeared to perform the song in-person. “I’ve had my songs played at a million sporting events,” Blaze said of the performance. “This is just kind of a great add-on to that part of the legacy. It sounded amazing.” As Blaze says in the episode, the party was far from over after the performance. Check out additional footage from the band’s night performance and more to see how the performance was received."

	Apparently, Shaq is a little upset with things, although he would like to remain on the show.","Basketball fans got some pretty monumental news over the weekend. As part of the agreement that will keep Warner Bros. Discovery as one of the league’s broadcast partners during its upcoming media right deal, Turner Sports will continue to produce “Inside the NBA” but license the show out to ESPN, which will air it going forward. The deal officially got announced on Monday, and there are some pretty big questions that continue to hang over the agreement that ESPN and Turner will have to get sorted out between now and the start of the 2025-26 season. As it turns out, there’s one especially big one that hangs over the deal, as Jimmy Traina of Sports Illustrated reported that Shaquille O’Neal is out of a contract on July 1, 2025. And apparently, there’s a bit of tension on the Hall of Fame inductee’s side of things right now. While sources say Shaq wants to remain on the show, he’s frustrated that there has been congratulations and press releases hyping that Inside the NBA is remaining the same while he is currently not under contract to be with the company next season. As Traina noted, Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, and Charles Barkley all do other things for Turner, so their deals are different from Shaq’s, who exclusively does NBA work for the network. It goes without saying, but Inside without Shaq would not feel the same, although we’re optimistic that Draymond Green joining the show whenever his playing career ends would be a good fill-in for him. Still, whether it’s agreeing to another deal with Turner or working something out with ESPN, here’s hoping that Shaq is at the desk with the rest of the guys when Inside airs on the Worldwide Leader for the first time."

	There's no word on whether the league will have a high-profile halftime show for its other Christmas game.","The NFL has started to have a larger and larger presence on Christmas Day over the years. This season, the league will put a pair of marquee games on Dec. 25, as the Kansas City Chiefs will travel to Pittsburgh to Take on the Steelers in the 1 p.m window, while the Houston Texans will play host to the Baltimore Ravens at 4:30 p.m. ET. Late on Sunday night, the NFL decided to announce that it has something special up its sleeve for the late afternoon game, as it was revealed that Beyonce will perform at halftime in her hometown.  A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce)  There’s no word on whether the league has a similarly huge name lined up for the early game, but lining up Beyonce — who headlined the Super Bowl halftime show back in 2013 — for a performance during a showcase game like this makes a ton of sense. Of course, there is a potential problem that will be monitored throughout the Christmas Day schedule, as the games will be aired on Netflix, which just struggled mightily with its broadcast of the boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul. Adding Beyonce to what will already be a highly-anticipated NFL game should only bring more eyeballs onto the platform, and there’s going to be a whole lot of interest in whether or not Netflix will be able to keep up with the demand."

	The Wings got the top pick in the 2025 WNBA Draft and will get the chance to draft UConn star Paige Bueckers.","The 2025 WNBA Draft figures to feature some serious talent, headlined by UConn star Paige Bueckers, and that meant Sunday was a big day for the Chicago Sky, Dallas Wings, Los Angeles Sparks, and Washington Mystics, as those four teams were set to learn their fate in the Draft Lottery.  The ping-pong balls fell in favor of the Wings, who will get the opportunity to select Bueckers first overall next spring and figure to create one of the WNBA’s most exciting backcourts immediately with Bueckers joining established Wings star Arike Ogunbowale in Dallas. For the second straight year, the Sparks will hold the No. 2 overall pick and the Sky will pick at No. 3, while the Mystics will have the fourth pick. The fifth pick will go to the expansion Golden State Valkyries, followed by the playoff teams from a year ago — aside from the Aces, who forfeited their draft pick as part of a league punishment.  The 2025 WNBA Draft first round order looks as follows:  1. Dallas Wings
2. Los Angeles Sparks
3. Chicago Sky
4. Washington Mystics
5. Golden State Valkyries
6. Washington Mystics (via the Atlanta Dream)
7. New York Liberty (via the Phoenix Mercury)
8. Indiana Fever
9. Seattle Storm
10. Chicago Sky (via the Connecticut Sun)
11. Minnesota Lynx
12.

	Jon Jones successfully defended his UFC Heavyweight championship at UFC 309 in New York.","Jon Jones (28-1) knocked out Stipe Miocic (20-5) in the third round to retain the heavyweight championship at UFC 309 from Madison Square Garden in New York.  Jones opened with a couple shots up top, a leg kick, and eventually a takedown. On top, Jones worked the ground and pound, refusing to give Miocic any room on the ground in a dominant first round — but while it looked like Jones could have ended it early, Miocic was able to hang on. Miocic opened the second round with a more measured approach, waiting for his own opportunities to attack without being taken down. The former heavyweight champion was relatively flat-footed before opening a more active approach in the third, but as Miocic moved, it was Jones who picked apart Miocic.  Jones hurt Miocic with a big right hand midway through the round, but kept the champ at bay with a combination of his own. Jones hurt Miocic with a spinning back kick to the body, then finished him off with lefts and rights on the ground before the referee stoppage.  Jones’ return to the UFC on Saturday was just his second bout in the heavyweight division. He hadn’t fought since last year, claiming the UFC Heavyweight belt in his debut in the heavyweight division against Ciryl Gane. Jones is arguably the greatest fighter in UFC history, but his background is riddled in controversy amid two victories over another greatest of all-time contender, Daniel Cormier. Miocic hadn’t fought since 2021, when he suffered a second-round knockout at the hands of Francis Ngannou.  Jones as the winner has an interesting path forward. On one hand, the interim champ, Tom Aspinall, is waiting in the wings and ready to prove himself against an all-time great. On the other hand, Alex Pereira seems prepped to climb to the heavyweight division, making possibly two weight jumps in three year as the former middleweight and current light heavyweight champion. Jones hasn’t seemed as interested in Aspinall recently, but opened the door to that fight after the win.  After his loss, Miocic retired from the UFC."

	Chuck, Shaq, Kenny, and Ernie will continue covering NBA games in 2025, as ESPN will license the show from TNT starting next year.","When TNT Sports lost the rights to the NBA this summer, with the league opting for a three-network deal with ESPN, NBC, and Amazon, the biggest question from fans was what would the future look like for ‘Inside the NBA’. After initially sounding as though it would end after this season, TNT was able to get Charles Barkley to agree to stick around for the remainder of his contract, with plans to continue the show in some capacity.  Now, we know what that will be, and instead of TNT airing the fellas talking about various sports (as was rumored at one point), they will continue to cover the NBA as part of ESPN’s NBA coverage in a unique licensing deal between Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery. According to the Wall Street Journal and Andrew Marchand of The Athletic, the deal will see TNT Sports continue producing the show, but it will air on ESPN.  Separately, Warner Bros. Discovery struck a deal with Disney to license the TNT show “Inside the NBA” to ESPN and ABC starting next season, according to the people familiar with the matter. The show, which features the former players Charles Barkley and Shaquille O’Neal, has an enthusiastic and large following. The show will air throughout the course of the season. This all happens alongside a larger settlement between the NBA and WBD, with Bleacher Report and House of Highlights maintaining rights to NBA videos. That is all excellent news for those at TNT Sports and those outlets, and sources inside TNT Sports tell Dime that they are “considering it a best case scenario” after losing NBA game broadcasts. [UPDATE: This post previously stated WBD would continue operating NBA TV and the league’s digital platforms, as was reported by the WSJ, but that was incorrect. NBA Digital and WBD will continue their current relationship but will not be operated by WBD (as is the current structure), while NBA TV will not be operated by WBD in the future.] For NBA fans the biggest news is that Charles Barkley, Shaquille O’Neal, Kenny Smith, and Ernie Johnson will still be on our televisions — one would assume from Studio J in Atlanta still if TNT is producing it — each week during the NBA season. One would expect they’ll move from their Thursday slot to Wednesday for ESPN’s biggest night of games — as the other options are Friday and Sunday and I have a hard time imagining them moving to either of those. The move allows the best show to continue without any changes to talent in front of or behind the camera, which is particularly important, and one would think if ESPN is adding the show they will understand what makes it so good and give it the kind of space and time it deserves, rather than what they currently do with their studio offering. It remains to be seen what happens with NBA Countdown, as they’ll still need to have something for those Friday and Sunday games, but may shake up their main crew with the Inside fellas becoming their A-crew and Finals team."

	The NBA has big plans for how it wants to build on 2024's shooting competition between Steph Curry and Sabrina Ionescu.","The NBA struck gold at All-Star weekend in 2024. While the game itself was bad enough that the league is considering a major shake-up in its format and the Dunk Contest was a dud, a shooting contest between Steph Curry and Sabrina Ionescu injected a whole lot of excitement into the festivities on Saturday night — Curry was able to win, but it was awfully close. With the 2025 edition of the All-Star Game taking place in the Chase Center, it would make a ton of sense for the league to run back a Steph vs. Sabrina shootout. According to Shams Charania of ESPN, that is, indeed in the works, but there’s a catch: They may not be the only NBA and WNBA players involved. Curry and WNBA star Sabrina Ionescu of the New York Liberty participated in the first NBA versus WNBA 3-point challenge at All-Star Saturday night this February in Indianapolis. Curry and Ionescu are in strong conversations to return in a variation of the shootout, which could include other NBA and WNBA players such as Klay Thompson of the Dallas Mavericks and Caitlin Clark of the Indiana Fever, sources said. Expanding on the competition and including Thompson and Clark always made far too much sense, so it’s good to see that the NBA might do something that would obviously be a huge draw."

	The NBA is considering a shakeup to make the All-Star Game a 4-team tournament like Rising Stars -- and include the Rising Stars winners.","The last really good NBA All-Star Game was in 2020, which was both the first year of the Elam Ending format and just a few weeks after Kobe Bryant’s tragic death. Players took the game more seriously than we’ve seen in quite some time, as it was a league-wide celebration of the Lakers legend, but since then the game has fallen back into old habits of being a glorified pickup run with barely a hint of defense being played.  That has led to fans tuning out and TV networks being upset, and Adam Silver seemed like a broken man after last year’s game was the highest scoring in history, handing Giannis and the East the All-Star Game trophy with the glowing praise of “you scored the most points. Well, congratulations.” The truth is, the All-Star Game just isn’t important enough for players to go all-out, especially with how much money is at stake for them nowadays. It’s no longer the biggest national stage some of them will get to show out and build their profile, and the result is a bunch of guys trying not to get hurt while producing a few highlights.  For that reason, the league needs to get creative. We offered our thoughts on what that should look like last year, as they’ve bounced back-and-forth between formats and how they pick teams to varying degrees of success. This year we might see a significant change to the format, as ESPN’s Shams Charania brought word that the league is in deep discussions on a new format that would be similar what they did with the Rising Stars Game, breaking the All-Star rosters into 4 teams and having them play a semifinal game and then the winners of those playing in the final. The teams would be 3 teams of 8 All-Stars and the winning team of the Rising Stars Challenge from Friday. Charania highlights how discussions around this format started at Summer League and have included league personnel, team executives, players (including Stephen Curry), and coaches, with significant momentum towards being adopted for the 2025 game in San Francisco. At the very least, you could bet that whatever team of All-Stars got matched up with the Rising Stars winners would likely have a little more juice to not lose, which would yield the intended results of raising the level of competition.  I think anything would be an improvement over a regular four-quarter game, and the Rising Stars games have been improved as a result of this format change. Even if they aren’t suddenly the greatest basketball games in history, they move quicker and when it’s close late the competitive juices get flowing in a way we don’t see often in the current All-Star format."
Sports – UPROXX,It Is Silly That Nikola Jokic Has Somehow Gotten Better To Start The 2024-25 Season,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/nikola-jokic-start-2024-25-nba-season-denver-nuggets/,"Fri, 15 Nov 2024 21:41:00 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	Nikola Jokic entered this season as an all-time great already. Somehow, someway, he keeps getting better.","There’s this fun thing I like to do sometimes that I affectionately call the Barry Bonds game. How it works: You go onto baseball-reference, pull up the page for the legendary San Francisco Giants slugger, and just look at how ridiculous it was that Bonds was able to put up the numbers he did during his prime. Yes, steroids, I know, but even with that caveat, individual players are not supposed to break their sport the way that Barry Bonds was able to break the game of baseball. We’re not fully there yet, but going onto Nikola Jokic‘s basketball-reference page is getting to a similarly very silly point. Ever since becoming the no-doubt cornerstone of the Denver Nuggets back in 2018-19, Jokic has consistently put up some of the wildest numbers in the league. His last four years feature three MVPs and a second-place finish while averaging 26.1 points, 12.2 rebounds, 8.7 assists, and 1.4 steals in 34.1 minutes per game while shooting 58.8 percent from the field and 36.4 percent from three. The advanced stats especially love him — scroll on down to the “Advanced” section, a lot of stuff is bold (led the league) and a few things are gold (all-time career marks). There is no one quite like Jokic, and there has never been anyone quite like Jokic. His career True Shooting percentage is third in league history, behind only Rudy Gobert and DeAndre Jordan, while attempting 1,942 more three-pointers than those two combined. His career total rebound percentage is 15th, right in between ABA legend Mel Daniels and Marcus Camby. He’s 25th all time in assist percentage — the three names directly behind him are Ja Morant, Ricky Rubio, and LeBron James. The dude just has his fingerprints all over games in a way that no one has ever consistently matched. I say all of that to say this: Somehow, someway, on a team that needs him more than ever (which says a lot as the entire franchise is built around having him), Jokic has raised his game through the first stretch of the 2024-25 season. This should not be possible. It’s not even like he’s suddenly adding something new to his bag of tricks, he’s just better than ever at being Nikola Jokic. Small sample size caveats are prominent here, but here’s some stuff to consider: Points per game: 29.7 (fifth in the NBA, his current career-high is 27.1 PPG)
Rebounds per game: 13.7 (leads the NBA, current career-high is 13.8 RPG)
Assists per game: 11.7 (leads the NBA, current career-high is 9.8 APG)
Steals per game: 1.7 (t-9th in the NBA, current career-high is 1.7 SPG) The only players to ever average a triple-double over a full season, of course, are Oscar Robertson (once) and Russell Westbrook (four times). Neither of them, in any of their triple-double seasons, were in the same galaxy as Jokic’s current True Shooting percentage of 66.7 percent — both guys, funny enough, posted a TS% of 55.4 percent in their most efficient season with a triple-double. And all of the advanced stats that tend to show that Jokic is a marvel (PER, win shares per 48 minutes, box plus/minus) are outrageous — if the season ended today, he’d post the highest single-season PER (33.31) of all-time, the highest BPM (15.02) of all-time, and the fourth-highest WS/48 of all-time behind some guys named Kareem and Wilt. So, yeah, Jokic is a joke, the single best basketball player in the world today and the guy spearheading a Nuggets team with some flaws that came as the result of a talent drain over the last few years to an early 7-3 record and, as of this writing, the longest-active winning streak (five games) in the Western Conference. And here’s the funny thing: If Denver did not have Jokic playing like this, they would be in some serious trouble. Have a look at how dire things get when he is not on the floor, via PBP Stats: There is a reason why, when asked what the ideal number of minutes is for Jokic to be on the floor for the Nuggets, Michael Malone said “48.” We’ve seen plenty of teams over the years be totally helpless when the sun around which everything revolves goes to the bench — LeBron’s teams in his prime were famously horrendous when he would sit, the Sixers have an organizational commitment to being awful without Joel Embiid, etc. — but seeing as how Jokic is either scoring or assisting on nearly half of all the points that Denver scores, well, it’s pretty important that he never comes off the floor. That’ll have to change at some point (well, probably), but Jokic playing like this means it’s easier for the Nuggets to slowly bring along their young guys who have to take on bigger roles this season — although it must be said that Christian Braun has impressed as the de facto Kentavious Caldwell-Pope replacement. They can also afford to be patient with Jamal Murray, who still hasn’t quite looked like himself on the heels of a pretty nasty run of injuries that made his postseason and Olympic efforts hard to watch at times, but just got paid in a big way and absolutely has to get on track. Of course, at some point, Denver is going to need to totally round into form, even if there are some really encouraging signs beyond Jokic. Aaron Gordon has been awesome so far this year when healthy, while Michael Porter Jr. continues to just do his thing as a huge dude who can shoot the hell out of the basketball. When 75 percent of the core your team is built around is playing at a high level from the start of the year — and that final member of your core has a reputation for saving his best for when the lights get brighter — you’re usually in a pretty good spot. There are still big picture questions that can only be answered when the playoffs roll around, which is the curse of being a team with title-or-bust aspirations. In the meantime, all anyone can really do is sit back, watch, and marvel at the spectacle that is Nikola Jokic, the best player in the world at the very height of his powers, someone who keeps finding ways to break the game of basketball, and an all-time great who stands shoulder-to-shoulder alongside the greatest players to ever set foot on the hardwood. And the scary part? As the early portion of this season has shown, if anything, he’s only getting better."

	'We’re nothing. We’re just dead. We’re dust.'","Tonight, November 15, is the much-publicized boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul. Ahead of the fight, which will stream on Netflix, Iron Mike was asked by internet-famous teen reporter Jazlyn Guerra, a.k.a. Jazzy’s World TV, for his thoughts on legacy. He took it very seriously.   “Well, I don’t know. I don’t believe in the word ‘legacy,'” Tyson replied. “I just think that’s another word for ego. Legacy doesn’t mean nothing. That’s just some word everybody grabbed onto. Someone said that word, and everyone grabbed on the words, and now it’s used every five seconds. It means absolutely nothing to me. I’m just passing through. I’mma die, and it’s gonna be over. Who cares about legacy after that?”  Tyson somehow wasn’t done. “What a big ego,” he continued. “So I’mma die. I want people to think that I’m this, I’m great. I’m, no. We’re nothing. We’re just dead. We’re dust. We’re absolutely nothing. Our legacy is nothing.” Guerra responded to Tyson’s stream-of-consciousness existentialism with a polite “thank you so much for sharing that,” but 50 Cent had another takeaway. “G*ddam it! Mike ya scaring the kids, WTF chill,” the rapper wrote on X. “Note to self, keep the kids away from Mike.”  You can watch the video here.

	This year's NBA City Edition unis were officially unveiled on Thursday, so we're ranking them from 30 to 1.","The NBA and Nike officially unveiled the 2024-25 City Edition uniforms for all 30 teams on Thursday, and while the designs have been leaked since this summer, I like to wait until we get the official images to rank them. That is because the actual jerseys themselves almost always look better than their 2D mock-ups, which is certainly the case with this year’s crop. The leaks got roasted to no end on social media and while I’m not crazy about this year’s group of uniforms, they aren’t as bad in actuality as the leaks looked.  That said, there are some heaters and some really bad ones, along with a big crop this year of very “meh” looks as it’s fair to wonder if Nike and the teams are running a bit short on ideas — good news guys, at least another 12 years of these! Here we are ranking the uniforms from worst to best, where there’s one that should become part of one team’s permanent look.  NBA
Creating good alternates is hard when you have an iconic jersey set, and that’s the problem the Celtics (and Lakers) run into every year. These are just bad and don’t even seem to be trying to do anything interesting. Wear your normal (and great) uniforms, please.  NBA
Same goes for the Lakers. These are just unbecoming of a once proud franchise.  NBA
I’m honestly kind of stunned they went back to the Heat Culture well again after the reaction to when they did this last year, but it does look a little better on the all red uniform. Still, c’mon guys, stop trying to make this a thing. NBA
On the opposite end of the spectrum from Boston and L.A. is OKC, which has had one uniform in its history that I thought was legitimately good (the 2018 City Edition honoring Oklahoma’s Native American heritage). Everything else has been either “meh” or outright bad. I’ll say this, these aren’t the worst unis they’ve ever had, but I just am not a fan.  NBA
The Pacers have done this look before in black, and it’s just not for me.  NBA
A retro look that just doesn’t really land for me. I will say, I bet the court they have for this color scheme will look great, but I’m just not a big fan of the lettering.  NBA
I wouldn’t call these bad, they just don’t land for me, but that’s also been the case for a number of the Brooklyn City Editions over the years.  NBA
I’m just out on the 5280 thing. I like the mountains on the side and the topographical map thing, and while I think there are better executions, leaning into the rainbow coloring is generally good for Denver. However, I just can’t get on board with the 5280 in place of lettering. NBA
All of the uniforms in this tier have the same issue of not being bad, but also not being particularly inspiring. Dallas’ are particularly plain, which, again, not necessarily bad, but not memorable either.  NBA
I get they’re going for the Chicago musical font here, but it feels like they weren’t willing to go all-in on it and the end result is pretty bland.  NBA
I get what Minnesota’s going for, but I just see an old Windows 98 screensaver in that design.  NBA
They aren’t as bad as the Lakers and Celtics, but they also have a similar problem where their normal uniforms are iconic classics and trying something new often just makes you want them to do what they always do.  NBA
The Magic are at the top of this group by virtue of having the best lettering/logo — the Magic with a star for the A is always great — but Orlando has great uniform looks and this one just falls flat comparatively.  NBA
Like Orlando, Charlotte has some great throwback looks and this just makes me wish they were wearing one of those instead.  NBA
My colleague Mark said the logo looks like it should be for store brand paper towels and I can’t unsee it. I do like that shade of blue though.  NBA
Perfectly fine, even though it’s still a little confusing when the Bucks are wearing all-blue.  NBA
Never seen a more Oklahoma State jersey in my life. Go Pokes.  NBA
I actually kinda like these, but they are giving off strong vibes of made up Houston jerseys for a movie that couldn’t afford NBA licensing.  NBA
If I were to guess, these will be among the most polarizing unis. I dig New Orleans leaning into being a little different and weird, and the herringbone pattern with actual bones certainly does that. They will likely be at the bottom of some folks rankings but I don’t think their standard unis are so good that they can’t get weird and have it work.  NBA
These have grown on me a bit, in part because they at least look like Warriors uniforms — unlike their Michigan/Marquette alternates from a year or two ago. They aren’t the best uniforms in the world, but a solid attempt at playing off something unique to the Bay (the Golden Gate Bridge).  NBA
I really like the District font and this year they put it on a nice color instead of whatever the hell the black and green and orange thing was a year ago. The Wizards won’t be good this year, but I do think they’ll look good in these.  NBA
I like this Spurs font, they’ve done it before but it works for me. I also like this shade of blue. These aren’t as good as their fiesta look in the past, but a solid choice and I just like when the Spurs have a little pop of color.  NBA
I like these, even though I will not immediately spot this color and go “Cavs” in my brain. Part of why these will work is their court that goes with them is phenomenal.  NBA
Another one that gets a big boost from an unbelievably good court design. These play off the old 1995 All-Star logo, and while I’m not crazy about the font, I still dig them. If they incorporated the saguaro cactus into them, they’d be higher.  NBA
The Blazers almost always do a good job with the City edition uni, and this year is another good addition to their rotation. A big part of that is their “Rip City” font just looks good on anything. NBA
The Jazz are finally making the move back to the purple mountains with their full-time uniform set, and this year’s City Edition is a very good version of that.  NBA
The throwback to the Memphis Sounds just looks fantastic. I love that Memphis font and these are going to look fantastic on the floor — even if it’ll take a little adjustment to seeing a team in red and thinking “Grizzlies”.  NBA
The Kings also have another really good throwback look, taking it to the days of the Cincinnati Royals. The royal blue and red just pops, and they didn’t try to do too much with a uniform that doesn’t need much more.  NBA
I’m a sucker for this spectrum Sixers look. I just think it’s so clean and the white edition is even better than the navy look from a couple years back.  NBA
The Vince Carter Raptor doing his legendary between-the-legs dunk is so good and the Raptors need to just make it their permanent logo. These with the purple retro look they brought back this year is a damn-near perfect uniform set and it’s a shame they will move on to something new next season."
Sports – UPROXX,We’re Picking Winners For Week 11 Of The 2024 NFL Season,https://uproxx.com/sports/nfl-picks-winners-week-11-spread-best-bets/,"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:03:27 +0000","<figure class=""post-thumbnail"">

	Come get these winners.","Sometimes, you simply want to unplug the season and plug it back in. That is where we are when it comes to NFL handicapping in 2024. After a pair of encouraging weeks, the ugliness returned in Week 10, including a Falcons-Saints game that impossibly stayed under with three missed field goals and other malodies. We won’t be deterred from the goal of righting the ship but, hey, you could also fade these picks if you’re feeling spicy. Before delivering this week’s five-pack, let’s take a look at the carnage in 2024.  Come get these winners. A Thursday night Under? Let’s get back to basics. Washington has been an “over” team to the tune of 7-3 this season, but Philadelphia has been quietly stout on defense in recent weeks. This is, of course, a short week for both teams, and Washington has some injury issues along its offensive line. I tend to think the Commanders defense is a touch undervalued in this spot as well, and this is a favorable price. The Saints got the bounce last week after firing their coach and, with the help of one of the worst kicking performances of the season for Atlanta, New Orleans won a game it shouldn’t have won. That could benefit us this week, as the Browns are underdogs in a spot where they probably shouldn’t be. Let’s ride the Jameis roller coaster and hope it goes well. Detroit is a wagon. They seemingly cover every week and, when they don’t like in Week 10, they somehow win the game despite a million turnovers. With that said, getting a full 14 here on Jacksonville is something I can’t pass on. Trust me, I know how ugly it is. Seattle is healthier and coming off a bye, including the projected return of DK Metcalf. I’ve also been a touch low on San Francisco all season, and I simply can’t get this to 6.5 points, even with McCaffrey back for the 49ers. This teaser happens to involve a pair of prime time games, but I would like it even if it didn’t. Candidly, I love each leg here, with the Bengals more than able to get in the backdoor if things go south at the outset. Houston is on the road, which does scare me a bit, but the situation in Dallas is rather dire, and the Texans may be discounted a bit after a maddening loss to Detroit."

	Giannis got called for a foul despite getting all ball. But fortunately for the Bucks, as Rasheed Wallace once said, ball don't lie.","The Milwaukee Bucks played host to the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night, and while there is still a ton of basketball left to be played this season, you won’t find a more insane final 90 or so seconds of regulation than what we got out of these two Central Division opponents. The two teams traded the lead back and forth, and after a Marcus Sasser three tied things up with just under 30 seconds left, Milwaukee got the ball and had a chance to win. A wide open look by Taurean Prince did not fall, and with a hair over a second left on the clock, Detroit called a timeout, advanced the ball, and tried to replicate the magic it found on a sideline out of bounds play on Tuesday night against Miami. It looked like that was going to happen, as Cade Cunningham lobbed one up to Ron Holland near the rim, but Giannis Antetokounmpo was able to break things up … well, at least it looked like he did, but the referees called a foul that stood after a review even though it really did not look like Giannis fouled Holland at all. However, in the words of the great philosopher Rasheed Wallace, ball don’t lie. Holland stepped up to the charity stripe and missed short twice, which ended up sending the game to overtime. It would’ve been an awfully harsh way for the game to end for Milwaukee, but, again, Sheed’s got us covered here."
Sports – UPROXX,Draymond Green Claims Steph Had Extra Juice For Warriors-Mavs Because Klay ‘Ghosted Him’,https://uproxx.com/dimemag/draymond-green-klay-thompson-ghosted-steph-curry-warriors-mavs/,"Wed, 13 Nov 2024 23:16:08 +0000","<div class=""upx-component upx-embed-url""><div class=""embed-holder""></div></div>Steph Curry apparently had a little extra motivation for Klay Thompson's return to the Chase Center.","Klay Thompson made his return to the Chase Center on Tuesday night as a member of the Dallas Mavericks. It went the way that things tend to go when teams travel to take on the Golden State Warriors: Steph Curry did some absolutely ludicrous Steph stuff, and the Warriors went on to pick up a 120-117 win to start their NBA Cup campaign. Curry scored all 12 of the Warriors’ points during a 12-3 run to close out the game, and plenty of people noted that he looked especially fired up after hitting a three with 27 seconds left that essentially iced things. It turns out there’s a reason why: According to Draymond Green, Curry was ghosted by Thompson in the lead-up to the game. “I’m stirring the pot, I pissed Steph off,” Green said on his podcast, which you can watch at the 4:30 mark of the video at the top of this post. “He’s like, ‘Yeah, I talked to Klay last night about’ — cause he was supposed to speak before the game. He was like, ‘Yeah I called Raymond and told him I’m not speaking. I just need to lock in on the game, so I ain’t speaking and I talked to Klay about it.’ He tried to check in with Klay about something else, and Klay ghosted him, so he got pissed. And here we go. Locked in.” Steve Kerr said that Curry was supposed to address the crowd before the game, but he and Thompson decided against it, while Green did drop a hint after the game that Thompson isn’t an easy guy to get a hold of when he told the press “You ever try to keep in touch with Klay? It’s very one-sided. The love is there. The relationship is there.”"

	The legendary Spurs coach has been away from the team since Nov. 2.","The San Antonio Spurs have been without the services of legendary head coach Gregg Popovich since the start of November. While the team previously said that Popovich’s absence was due to an illness, on Wednesday afternoon, the Spurs revealed that Popovich suffered what was described as a “mild stroke” ahead of their game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Nov. 2, 2024. “The San Antonio Spurs today announced that Head Coach Gregg Popovich has suffered a mild stroke,” the team said in a statement. “The episode occurred on Nov. 2 at the Frost Bank Center. Popovich, who has already started a rehabilitation program, is expected to make a full recovery. At this point, a timeline for his return to the sidelines has not been determined. During this time, the organization is grateful to the extended community for providing privacy and space to the Popovich family.” Assistant coach Mitch Johnson, who has been part of the Spurs’ famed coaching system since 2016, has filled in for Popovich as he’s been away from the team for the last six games. When asked last week for an update on Popovich, Johnson said that the Hall of Fame coach was “in good spirits,” even though there was no word on when fans could expect to see Popovich back on the sideline. One of the greatest basketball coaches of all time, the 75-year-old Popovich has been at the helm of the Spurs since 1996. He is a 5-time NBA champion, a 3-time Coach of the Year, and is the NBA’s all-time wins leader among coaches."

	Let's be honest, Charles Barkley and Shaq were always going to do this at some point.","It’s been a rough start to the year for the Toronto Raptors. While they were never expected to compete for a championship this year, injuries to a number of key contributors like Scottie Barnes and Immanuel Quickly have played a big role in the team going 2-10, which is the worst record in the league at this early juncture. A bright spot has been the play of Gradey Dick, the No. 13 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft who is shooting 37.3 percent from three and his upped his scoring to 20.1 points per game. He’s a good player whose last name has led to stuff like this happening, and shockingly, it was not until Tuesday night that the Inside the NBA guys had their inevitable meltdown over him.   A post shared by Dime (@dimemagazine)  “This boy’s ballin right here, y’all,” Charles Barkley told the crew. “I think you pointed that out, Gradey Dick,” Ernie Johnson responded. “I can’t say his name,” Barkley shot back. “I just can’t say his name. I’m not gonna say his name, I don’t give a damn what y’all say around here.” It was right around this point that we got one of the consistently funniest things on Inside: Shaq laughing so hard at something insane that Chuck said that he sounds like he’s furiously trying to clear his throat. Anyway, the fellas kept going down this road for a bit longer, because there was never going to be any stopping this riff once it finally happened. As for how the rest of Dick’s night went, he scored a career-best 32 points with five rebounds and three assists in a 99-85 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks."

	There was some extra juice in the building for Klay Thompson's return to the Bay, and Steph reminded the fans whose house it was late.","The biggest game of the night in a packed slate of NBA Cup games was the Mavs taking on the Warriors in Klay Thompson’s first game back in San Francisco since leaving as a free agent this summer for Dallas.  It was an emotional scene as they played a terrific tribute video and had the crowd in captains hats to honor their former star, but once the game got going there was plenty of juice on both sides in a reunion that wasn’t all happy. The two teams went back and forth, as the stars on both sides all played their roles, with Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving combining for 52 for the Mavs, while Thompson hit 6 threes on his way to 22 points in his return, including a big one late that gave Dallas a five-point lead midway through the fourth quarter.  That lead would get up to seven before Stephen Curry took over for the Warriors, scoring 12 points in the final 3:10 of game time, including a personal 10-0 run (aided by some spectacular defense from Draymond Green) that turned a Golden State deficit into a 4-point Warriors lead. His final bucket of that run was a vintage stepback three-pointer over Dereck Lively II, as he hit the Mavs big man with his signature “night night” celebration, before making a demonstrative declaration to the crowd that “this is my sh*t.”  STEPH CURRY HAS THE LAST 10 WARRIORS POINTS. 10-2 run to put GSW up 4 with under 30 seconds. 🏆 DAL-GSW | West Group C action🏀 #EmiratesNBACup on TNT pic.twitter.com/xNxak7xWr5 — NBA (@NBA) November 13, 2024  The Mavs would hit a three to cut the lead to one, but a pair of Curry free throws and a missed Luka three saw the Warriors win in regulation, 120-117. Curry finished with 37 points in the win, and while it’s clear there’s not actual bad blood between either side in the Splash Bros. breakup, there did seem to be a little extra fire from Curry for a mid-November game to make a statement at home with Klay now on the other side. While the “night night” is nothing new, the jersey popping and yelling “this is my sh*t” was more than we ever see from Curry in a non-playoff environment, and while I am a fan of the NBA Cup and think it brings out more competition in these games, I think this had more to do with who was on the other side than the Cup ramifications of this game."

	Shaq, who is never shy about being brutally honest when modern big men come up, did not mince words about Joel Embiid.","Joel Embiid took the floor for the Philadelphia 76ers for the first time this season on Tuesday night. Embiid, who has spent the start of the year ramping up to play after some knee problems, looked like someone who needs to work off a ton of rust, as he went for 13 points on 2-for-11 shooting with five assists and three rebounds in a 111-99 loss to the New York Knicks. It’s probably safe to assume that Embiid will be fine as long as he can manage whatever is up with his knee, while the Sixers — which find themselves 2-8 at this early juncture — have to get him, Paul George, and Tyrese Maxey all healthy and clicking as soon as possible. But even if that happens, Shaquille O’Neal is not optimistic about Philly’s ability to win a ring with Embiid at the center of things, which he expressed at halftime on TNT. “In New York, it’s a tough team to play,” O’Neal said. “But this was the fear I had for Joel Embiid. You announce arrogantly, I’m not playing back-to-backs, Ernie. I’m not injured but I’m sore. I’ll come back when I want to come back. Now, when you say things like that, you’re supposed to come back with extra energy. 0-for-3? I would have been 0-15. But you know what y’all would have said. ‘Hey, Shaq’s not playing well, but he’s playing aggressive.’ The plan that they are having, it’s not working. And not only that, I say this respectfully, Joel Embiid will never win a championship until he gets his mind and his attitude right.” Shaq has essentially staked out a place in the basketball punditry world as the guy who will call out big men when he feels they aren’t living up to what they’re capable of, and clearly, he thinks Embiid is the kind of guy who can lead Philadelphia to a championship. In fairness to Embiid, while he did say he may not play in back-to-backs going forward in an effort to be healthy when the playoffs roll around, he said after the loss to the Knicks that he wants to play in Wednesday’s game against the Cleveland Cavaliers, even if the decision is out of his hands."

	With the game tied in overtime, Miami tried calling a timeout. There was just one problem: They didn't have one available.","The second annual Emirates NBA Cup tipped off on Tuesday night, with a number of teams taking the (very vibrant) floor for the league’s relatively new in-season tournament. In the East Group B, the Detroit Pistons played host to the Miami Heat and looked like they were going to cruise to a win before Miami got hot down the stretch of regulation. With things tied up, the two teams went into overtime, where Miami was able to take a lead with just under two seconds left before things got very, very weird. First, the Pistons drew up a beautiful sideline out of bounds play to get a dunk for Jalen Duren that tied things up. And then, a furious Erik Spoelstra walked onto the court and called a timeout. There was just one problem: Miami didn’t have one, which meant we had a classic Chris Webber situation on our hands — perhaps it was fate that one of Webber’s Fab 5 teammates, Jalen Rose, was in attendance and lost his mind. Malik Bealey stepped up to the free throw line, buried it to put Detroit ahead, then on the ensuing Pistons possession, got fouled one more time with 0.1 seconds left to seal the game. It was, quite frankly, stunning to watch Spoelstra make such a big mistake, but at the very least, we got a really entertaining end to a game that suddenly has some stakes to it because of the NBA Cup."

	Caitlin Clark found a very unique pitfall of fame at The Eras Tour: Getting so many friendship bracelets you start to lose circulation.","Taylor Swift’s “The Eras Tour” has been the biggest show in the world for the past few years, as the tour has had millions of fans pass through the gates at stadiums around the globe. After finishing her international leg of the tour, Swift added another run of U.S. tour dates, which included recently playing three nights in Indianapolis at the start of November.  In attendance for those shows was the biggest sports star in the city at present, as Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark wasn’t about to miss a chance to see her favorite artist play shows in her new home city. The only problem for Caitlin at the Eras Tour was that she’s too popular in Indianapolis, which meant she was being constantly given friendship bracelets from other Swifties. That’s a very nice problem to have, but in her effort to wear every one she was given, it started to create an issue, as she explained at the Women’s Leadership Summit.  “Taylor Swift, I just went two nights in a row in Indianapolis. I’ve been three times,” Clark said. “I had a ton [of bracelets], all the way up the arms. I had to take them off, my circulation was getting cut off! Everyone was just chucking their bracelets at me. I’ve seen her three times, and every time the show has just gotten better.”  She showed off her collection on Instagram during one of the shows and it was a lot of bracelets.  Clark has spent the last year or two learning the ups and downs of life as a superstar, but this is certainly a very unique pitfall of fame, being so popular you get too many friendship bracelets and start to lose feeling in your arm."

	The NBA Cup is back for a second season, and here's how it will all work and what groups each team ended up in.","The NBA’s efforts to add a little excitement to the doldrums of its regular season will return on Tuesday evening. For the second straight year, the league will hold its new cup competition, now known as the Emirates NBA Cup. The first year was fun, with the Los Angeles Lakers winning the whole thing by knocking off the Indiana Pacers in Las Vegas, and now, the NBA will continue its efforts to turn this nascent event into a crucial part of its calendar. What does this all mean? Well, we tried to answer that today by explaining what’s new this year, how the whole thing will work, and why we’re excited to watch this as it tries to become a tentpole event on the NBA calendar. So is this just the In-Season Tournament but with a new name? It is! While the NBA has never explicitly said this, my assumption is that they spent the first year calling it the In-Season Tournament so fans would get a sense of what it is before calling it what they always wanted to call it: The NBA Cup, or more specifically, the Emirates NBA Cup. Or maybe they just couldn’t find a sponsor in the first year. What’s that Emirates thing? I’ve seen its logo on courts but never actually looked into what it is. It’s an airline based out of the United Arab Emirates that sponsors a lot of stuff. They’re sponsoring this event, which is the second-best thing that the NBA does, and fortunately, Emirates has plenty of experience sponsoring the second-best thing, as they are the shirt sponsor for Arsenal. What? Just let me cook. Ok, so, any major differences from last year other than the name? A big one are the courts. Last year, they came under criticism from players (who kept slipping on them) and fans (who thought some were huge eyesores, particularly because of the weird, cumbersome stripe they had going down the middle of the courts). They’re not nearly as bad this year, as they replaced the stripe with rings in the center of the floor and got rid of some of the more abrasive designs that just do not work on television. I’m sure not everyone will love them, but I think they are a huge improvement on last year — we just have to see if players struggle with their footing on them, or else the aesthetic changes do not matter at all. What about point differential? I know some players disliked that. Well, that’s still sticking around as a potential tiebreaker for which teams do and do not advance. Frankly, I think it’s fine and we saw last year that some of the European players were trying to egg their teammates on — Domantas Sabonis was the main one I remember — but it’ll still take a bit of a shift for everyone to get on board with it. Remind me how determining how teams advance will work again? Sure! Right from the league: So the easiest way to move on is to just win your group and not worry about any tiebreakers. That is correct. Well then, what do the groups look like? Once again, the NBA broke things up into three groups of five teams in each conference — this will, hopefully, look a lot cleaner when expansion happens, we get up to 32 teams, and they can do groups of four in each conference where each team plays group games home and away. The group games will happen on Tuesdays and Fridays starting tonight and running through Dec. 3. Here’s how it all looks: West Group A: Minnesota, LA Clippers, Sacramento, Houston, Portland West Group B: Oklahoma City, Phoenix, LA Lakers, Utah, San Antonio West Group C: Denver, Dallas, New Orleans, Golden State, Memphis East Group A: New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Brooklyn, Charlotte East Group B: Milwaukee, Indiana, Miami, Toronto, Detroit East Group C: Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington How do these teams qualify for the knockouts? Same as last year — win your group and you get a spot. Both conferences then get one remaining spot for a wild card team, which goes to the best remaining team that did not automatically qualify by winning its group. This is probably where those aforementioned tiebreakers would come in, but you never know. And will the knockouts work like last year, too? Yup! Single-elimination basketball games, with the quarterfinals happening on-site at home arenas and the semifinals and final happening in Las Vegas. The quarters are on Dec. 10 and 11, the semis are on Dec. 14, and the final is on Dec. 17. And are these games all considered regular season games, too? For the most part they are — group games, the quarters, and the semis will all count towards regular season records again, while the championship game will not. So it looks a lot like last year, then. That’s right, the league has, essentially, decided to keep a lot of things the same other than the name and the courts. Oh, also, as a programming note: home teams will wear their Statement Edition uniforms, while road teams wear their Association edition uniforms, according to the league. Huh, well then, ok. You don’t seem enthused about all of this, dear reader. Yeah, I mean, I am still unsure why I should care about this. Well that’s easy: You don’t have to! You’re an adult with agency and the ability to care about whatever you want, times are tough, maybe you don’t want to get super personally invested in a new thing the NBA is doing, that’s fine. But you seem to like this. I do! Why? I think a big split I have noticed here is “fans who like soccer” and “fans who do not,” with the former being more open to the idea of a midseason cup competition — Adam Silver has compared the NBA Cup to the FA Cup in English football, but basically every domestic league has a secondary cup competition. The thing is that these competitions are universally considered not as important as winning the league, but they are still important because it’s an opportunity to win something historic and provide some validation for a team’s season. The NBA Cup is only in its second year, so clearly, it has a way to go before it gets taken that seriously — the whole saga with the Lakers debating putting up a little banner is an example of this. But the FA Cup, for example, is not considered cool because everyone farts around and then Manchester City wins it at the end. It’s considered cool because teams from several levels of English football have a chance to win it, and sometimes, you get magical runs to the very end. We got a glimpse of what that could look like last year when the Indiana Pacers nearly won the whole thing. Hell, if not for the fact that they’re the Lakers, it’d probably be viewed as proof of concept that the final was between a Play-In team and an upstart young squad trying to win something for the first time. That is, to steal a phrase from the English, the magic of the cup. So acknowledging that this isn’t as important as winning the NBA Finals is fine? One-hundred percent. The longer the NBA sticks with this — and, let’s face it, Silver is essentially staking his legacy as a commissioner on this becoming a big deal — the more likely it is that it’ll settle into a spot where fans/franchises like that it is a thing that they can win, all while understanding that the big prize is still waiting for them in June. It helps, of course, that there’s a financial incentive to do well. Remind me what that is. Sure! Players whose teams make the quarterfinals make $50,000, players whose teams make the semifinals make $100,000, players on the runners-up make $200,000, and players on the team that wins the whole thing makes $500,000. Nice. I agree. Anyway, this sounds like, bare minimum, a thing I can have on my television on Tuesdays and Fridays. It is, and really, if that’s all that comes from this for the next year or two, that’s totally fine. Something like this will only become a big deal the more it happens and the more it becomes ingrained as part of the sport’s culture, and as long as this year is a step towards doing that, I’m sure it’ll all work out in the long-run. Nice. Well, I suppose I can tune in. That you can, and if you want to know what games are on, when they’re on, and which networks they’ll be on, you can click right here."

Last year, the eight teams that emerged from group play were the Celtics, Bucks, Pacers, and Knicks in the East, and the Lakers, Kings, Suns, and Pelicans in the West. Ultimately, the Lakers beat the Pacers in the final, marking the high point of the season for Los Angeles, while that was just the beginning of a run to the conference finals from Indiana. There are differing views from teams on how they approach the Cup, but because most of the games until you get to Vegas count all the same as regular season games, you should see contenders still trying at least until the quarterfinals where they may punt to avoid adding a trip to Vegas to their schedule.  Not every team has the Cup schedule circled on their calendars, and for some, it gets in the way of the long-term goals (either to get lottery balls or winning a title). But as the Pacers showed a year ago, for a young team without much playoff experience, the Cup can get guys feet wet to that kind of environment and build some confidence for the tournament everyone cares about come April, May, and June.  Here, we’ll look at eight teams that we think should be willing to invest early season energy into trying to get to Vegas and hoist the NBA Cup.   Houston’s gotten off to a strong start this season at 7-4, and I think they’re in a similar position to the Pacers last year, as they can use this as a way to test their young roster without much playoff experience. A successful run to the knockout rounds (and maybe beyond) would be a genuinely big deal for the Rockets, who can assert themselves as a genuine threat in the West playoff race with a strong tournament showing.  We saw that the Lakers were willing to raise their level a year ago in the Cup competition, and it’d be kind of incredible if they went back-to-back. Their group is a bit less daunting now that the Thunder are without Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein (although that’s still an excellent team), and if they make the knockout rounds, a team with LeBron and AD is always going to be a threat in a single-elimination basketball game. We’ll see if they approach it with the same aggression, but this is a team that has to try and chase wins regardless, so I’d expect the effort to be there, even if they can’t replicate the same kind of run.  The Grizzlies want to prove they are fully back as West contenders, and they can make a strong statement if they come out of the aforementioned Group of Death. They are playing at a high level right now, led by Jaren Jackson Jr.’s continued brilliance, and if they can get to Vegas, they’d have a very good chance at lifting the Cup. And if Ja Morant can get healthy and come back in time, absolutely no one will want to see that guy in a one-off. By the time the season is over, the Spurs will likely have filtered out of the Play-In race, but this is the exact kind of team I think should place an overemphasis on the NBA Cup. The Spurs are still building around Victor Wembanyama and figuring out what that should look like, but this team has been fairly competitive early (5-6) and could take advantage of some injury woes for the top teams in their group to try and make a little noise in the Cup. We saw in the Olympics that Wemby loves some heightened competition, and this might be a good chance to turn him loose and make an all-out push for something in November, understanding that they probably don’t have the roster just yet to really threaten the playoffs.  Will the Cavs ever lose? At some point, yes, but why not keep the good vibes rolling as long as possible and try to win the Cup? Yes, they’re a title contender, but unlike, say, Boston, this isn’t a team that’s had any real playoff success. Building some good habits in the knockout rounds could pay dividends down the road, and seeing as how they’re in the same group as the Celtics, I’m sure they’d love to use this as a statement of intent in the event they cross paths in the postseason. The Bucks desperately need something to turn around their season, and maybe the Cup gives them a carrot to chase that can wake things up. I’m skeptical they have the juice to make this happen, as the vibes are just horrendous in Milwaukee right now, but theoretically, Giannis and Dame (who will miss their opener with a concussion) are good enough as a tandem to beat anyone. That will require them to get on the same page, which hasn’t really happened to this point, but perhaps playing on different courts can change the mojo in Milwaukee.  Like every team other than the Cavs and Celtics in the East, the Knicks are off to a sputtering start at 4-5. Their star-studded roster isn’t clicking just yet, the defense has taken a major step back, and the offense hasn’t been quite good enough to make up for it. Their group, at one point, looked like the toughest in the East, but the Magic are without Paolo Banchero and the Sixers … well, we’ll get to them in a second. That cracks the door for the Knicks to try and lay a foundation of winning they can build on as the season progresses and create that chemistry that’s been lacking in games with a slightly bigger game feel. Joel Embiid is back for the Cup games, but Tyrese Maxey is out and Paul George has been on a minutes restriction. This team is desperate to go on a run, and with the big fella back, there’s no time like the present to try and climb out of the East’s basement. Like the Bucks, Philly just needs to stack some wins and get some positivity, and if they can somehow make it to Vegas, they can erase a decent amount of the early season concern about them."
Sports,Jake Paul’s Promoter Calls Claim Mike Tyson Fight Was Rigged “Illogical And Inane”,https://www.vibe.com/news/sports/jake-pauls-promoter-denies-claims-mike-tyson-fight-rigged-1234954466/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 18:23:02 +0000","""We embrace the doubt—it only fuels Jake to work harder and achieve greater success.”","Jake Paul‘s team has spoken out after doubters claim he unfairly defeated Mike Tyson.  
	In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, Most Valuable Promotions clarified that the record-breaking boxing match was not rigged in Paul’s favor. 
	“It is further illogical and inane that MVP, in the debut of a hopeful long-term partnership with the world’s biggest streamer—an organization that made its first-ever foray into live professional sports with Paul vs. Tyson—would even so much as consider such a perverse violation of the rules of competition,” detailed the statement. 
	Earlier this month, the former YouTube vlogger faced off against the former undisputed world heavyweight champion in a boxing match broadcast on Netflix. The bout, which had viewers fighting streaming issues, resulted in a unanimous decision victory for Paul in the officially sanctioned match.  
	After the fight, Michael Irvin, sports commentator and former NFL player, joined Cam’Ron and Mase’s It Is What It Is talk show and shared his belief that the results of the match were predetermined. 

	








 
	“That fight was a lie,” he exclaimed. “Everybody’s lying […] they had no intentions to really strap it on. If you look through that, I didn’t see one patented uppercut by Mike Tyson. What did Mike Tyson win on? Uppercut.”

	Irvin continued to assert, “I heard some people talking about they couldn’t put [Mike Tyson’s uppercut] in the contract,” adding, “He couldn’t body and then uppercut. Like, how can you put that in a fight contract?” 
	“This is not the first time Jake Paul has faced unfounded skepticism or outright disbelief as a professional athlete, and frankly, the claim that his bout must have been rigged is just the latest backhanded compliment to come his way,” Nakisa Bidarian, co-founder of Most Valuable Promotions reiterated to THR.

Sports,"Bronny James’ Preferential Treatment Comes Into Question, But What If It’s Necessary?",https://www.vibe.com/news/sports/bronny-james-preferential-treatment-comes-into-question-1234950678/,"Wed, 20 Nov 2024 21:35:12 +0000",An ESPN insider is arguing that James' fame could make his safety an issue on the road.,"Bronny James is the son of arguably the greatest NBA player of all time, LeBron James, so a bit of nepotism was to be expected as the 20-year-old pursued his father’s career. He eventually landed on his dad’s Los Angeles Lakers squad in the second round of this year’s NBA draft. After just a few games, however, he was sent to play in the NBA’s G League to build up his skills.  
	Upon his arrival, it was reported that Bronny would “shuttle” between both teams during an undisclosed period of time and will only be playing in G League home games, as to not fly commercial with his South Bay Lakers teammates. It is also reported that Bronny would be skipping road games due to the team staying at affordable hotels like the Courtyard-Marriott, rubbing many, including former NFL star and podcaster Ryan Clark, the wrong way.

	








 
	On his The Pivot podcast, Clark shared his confusion over Bronny’s ability to skip games due to travel and lodging accommodations when he hasn’t earned his stripes as an athlete just yet.

	“What has Bronny James done that he shouldn’t be able to stay at the Courtyard-Marriott?,” Clark questioned. “You say, ‘well, they fly commercial.’ What has Bronny James done where he should be too good to fly commercial? The pros isn’t about where you came from, how you were raised, what your parents had. Professional sports is about how well you can contribute, and you don’t get treated differently because of your parents.” A post shared by The Neighborhood Talk (@theneighborhoodtalk) 
	Many agree with Clark, including ESPN reporter Brian Windhorst, who believes coddling Bronny now will be “detrimental” to his career, adding that he believes the special treatment the former USC student receives from the Lakers has gone “too far,” The Post reports.   
	Another ESPN insider, however, is arguing that the Lakers are treating Bronny differently because, well, he’s different.  
	“Bronny James isn’t just your normal, everyday G League player,” ESPN’s Shams Charania said on The Pat McAfee Show on Tuesday. 
	“I don’t know if it’s a security thing, but there’s a different level of fanfare when he’s on the road for these G League games, a different level of everything when he’s with that G League team. How do you manage that on the road? I don’t think the door is necessarily completely shut on him playing in those road games as the G League season goes on, but as of right now that is the plan that the Lakers have laid out, and they want him to continue to shuttle back and forth, spend as much time on the active roster as possible.”

The fight ended up being highly underwhelming for many, and Michael Irvin recently shared his belief that most likely was not an accident. 
	“That fight was a lie,” he said during an appearance on Cam’ron and Ma$e’s popular sports talk show It Is What It Is. He continued, citing how both boxers didn’t seem to be putting in 100% effort and Iron Mike did not utilize a special move in his arsenal. “Everybody’s lying […] they had no intentions to really strap it on. If you look through that, I didn’t see one patented uppercut by Mike Tyson. What did Mike Tyson win on? Uppercut.”

	








 
	The NFL Hall Of Famer revealed rumors he heard that could explain why the fight wasn’t as exciting as it was promoted to be. “I heard some people talking about they couldn’t put [Mike Tyson’s uppercut] in the contract,” he stated. “He couldn’t body and then uppercut. Like, how can you put that in a fight contract?”

	Michael Irvin continued his assessment of the fight and rumored contrast terms by drawing a parallel to his NFL career. “That’s like making me play a game without running a slant route in the deep end or the deep out,” he said. “You do what you do best. If they take that away, you ain’t that dude anymore, and they took that away.” 
DJ Whoo Kid supported Irvin’s claims when he recounted a conversation he had with Jake Paul at a fight after-party, saying, “Legally they each cannot go at each other hard.” Despite being disappointed by how the boxing match went, the former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver was happy to see Mike Tyson secure a large payday. “I’m happy he got every dime, or whatever it is,” he said. “I want him to get his money. I just wanted him to free the beast.” 
	Per the final tally of the fight, Tyson threw 97 punches and only landed 18. Paul threw 278 punches and landed 78. Iron Mike was paid $20 million and Paul got $40 million. One valid explanation for the underwhelming bout is the health issues Tyson dealt with in the lead-up, which made them postpone the match as it was originally booked for July. He suffered from an ulcer flare-up and revealed that he almost died in June. 

	








 
	“This is one of those situations when you lost but still won,” Mike Tyson wrote on X. “I’m grateful for last night. No regrets to get in ring one last time. I almost died in June. Had 8 blood transfusions. Lost half my blood and 25lbs in hospital and had to fight to get healthy to fight so I won. To have my children see me stand toe to toe and finish 8 rounds with a talented fighter half my age in front of a packed Dallas Cowboy stadium is an experience that no man has the right to ask for. Thank you.” 
	“I wanted to give the fans a show, but I didn’t want hurt someone who didn’t need to be hurt,” Jake Paul said of the match. “I didn’t wanna hurt someone that didn’t need to be hurt.”  Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox"

	Another person raised concerns about another major event next month and expressed doubt about whether or not Netflix could handle the traffic. “Netflix couldn’t even stream a Tyson fight right but now they doing a Christmas NFL game. Featuring Beyonce. Ok bro,” they sarcastically typed.

	On Nov. 6, Portis, the Milwaukee Bucks forward released a public message via Instagram pleading for the public’s assistance in locating the stolen items, which he’s willing to pay $40,000 cash for. In the video, Portis spoke of his love for the city of Milwaukee, where he became a resident after signing a deal with the Bucks organization in 2020. 
	“Over the last four-and-a-half seasons, I’ve considered Milwaukee as a home,” Portis, 29, said. “I’ve grown here, I come here a boy and elevated into a man. The love you guys have given me here isn’t something I’ve ever felt before in my NBA career.”

	








 
	He continued, explaining the circumstances behind the burglary, which occurred while Portis was out of town for the Bucks’ matchup against the Cleveland Cavaliers earlier this month.

	“While I was at the game yesterday, we had a home invasion and they took most of my prized possessions,” Portis added, expressing the importance that the items, which he did not specify, hold to him and his family. 
	The burglary of Portis’ home marks the latest in a string of home invasions seemingly targeting professional athletes that have occurred in recent months. 
	In September, Minnesota Timberwolves guard Mike Conley’s Minnesota home was broken into and ransacked, with jewelry being listed among the items stolen. Authorities believe the burglary of Portis and Conley’s homes could possibly be connected due to similarities in the two break-ins, despite occurring in neighboring states. 
	NFL stars and reigning Super Bowl champions Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce’s homes were also burglarized in October, within a 48-hour period of one another. While no items were reported as stolen from Mahomes’ residence, the culprits in the burglary of Kelce’s home made off with $20,000 after breaking into the property through a rear door.

	








 
	Drafted in the first round of the 2015 NBA Draft by the Chicago Bulls, Portis has spent time with Bulls, Washington Wizards, and New York Knicks before joining the Bucks, winning a championship with the team in 2021.

	Jake Paul came out to to the ring to Phil Collins’ “In The Air Tonight,” riding in a customized low-rider with his brother Logan Paul. The entrance was jam-packed with thinly veiled jabs at Tyson, with the song referencing the boxer’s appearance in The Hangover, and even a bird, referencing the “Now Kith” meme. Tyson, however, walked out to the ring with pure intention of throwing down and nothing more. And all the built-up tension was released as the two combatants entered the ring for the highly-anticipated showdown. 
	While both Tyson and Paul promised to knock the other boxer out before the 5th round, the match surprisingly went for the entire eight rounds. Tyson came out swinging for the first two rounds but Father Time quickly got Iron Mike together, as the icon began to slow down with each subsequent round. Paul kept to a moderate pace throughout the whole match.

	“I’m going to do everything Coach Autry needs me to do,” Anthony added. “We talk a lot, especially late at night, about how we can make Syracuse basketball great. Off the court, Coach is super cool.

Paul was clocked at 220 pounds, a career-high for him, and then began his usual antics. Hitting the stage in a crawling stance, Jake Paul then immediately began running toward Iron Mike, getting directly in his face. 
ESPN reports that around this time, the YouTuber “purposefully” stepped on Tyson’s foot, to which he responded by slapping him in the face. A source close to the event claimed that Mike Tyson had grown “tired” of the content creator’s trash talk in the days leading up to Thursday. So, Paul stepping on the OG’s foot finally set him over the top, resulting in him slapping his opponent. “[Mike Tyson] hits like a bi**h! It’s personal now.

Former NBA stars Carmelo Anthony and Rudy Gay recently chimed in on the recent back and forth between Drake and DeMar DeRozan, which was a byproduct of the 6 God’s feud with Kendrick Lamar earlier this year. 
	“I think Drake was hurt a little bit because of the relationship he built with DeMar in Toronto,” Melo said on an episode of his show 7PM In Brooklyn. “Representing the 6, Raptors — you know that was a lot of connection with those two. He’s a Raptor for life from a basketball standpoint. Yes, that jersey should be going up.” 

	








 
	Gay, who just recently retired from the NBA, previously played for the Raptors, and is a new recurring co-host on 7PM, disapproved of Drizzy’s behavior. “That’s wack, man. Drake is wack for that,” he asserted. “You gotta pull up on DeMar if you feel that way before you go on camera.” Melo agreed, especially regarding the Toronto rapper’s comments on taking down DeRozan’s banner if the Raptors ever hung one up for him.

	“Drake did a lot when he said I’ma go up there and take it down. That part is a lot,” Carmelo Anthony said. However, he acknowledged that DeRozan turned himself into Drake’s opposition when he joined Kendrick Lamar on stage at The Pop Out concert and appeared in the “Not Like Us” music video. “Those are shots. You my man, we in the crib, we hanging, we building the 6 up. From that standpoint, that would f**k me up, too. I’m gonna feel a way no matter what, but yes, you do have a conversation. As a man, you have a conversation.” 
	Though Rudy Gay did not like the “First Person Shooter” rapper’s actions, he leveled with Anthony on that part. “If you got a problem, come at me,” he said. “To see your man’s out there dancing with the enemy, that’s kinda crazy.” 
	Drake and DeMar DeRozan went viral earlier this month when the For All The Dogs rapper sat courtside for the Toronto Raptors matchup against the Sacramento Kings. At one point, he was interviewed on air and said, “Unfortunately, we’re playing this goof [DeRozan] tonight, but it is what it is” as well as “If you ever put up a DeRozan banner, I’ll go up there and pull it down myself.”

	








 
	After the Raptors defeated the Kings, Drake could be seen mouthing “F**k outta here pu**y” as DeRozan walked off the court. During a post-game press conference, the six-time All-Star was asked about the comments regarding the banner and said, “Well he gon’ have a long way to climb to take it down, so tell him good luck.” 
	This is a significant change in their relationship, just three years after DeRozan said that Drake would “forever have a friend” in him. When he was traded from the Raptors to the Spurs, despite being told he would not be traded, the five-time Grammy winner invited him to his house and gave him support in his time of disappointment.

SJSU has been embroiled in controversy this season because of a transgender player on the team, Blaire Fleming. Several teams have forfeited matches against SJSU, while Fleming has been named in lawsuits that include members of the Spartan’s team and staff.  SJSU advanced to the final after Boise State became the latest team to forfeit a match, this time a semifinal in the conference tournament.

Latest Sports News Today on Fox News,Who is Blaire Fleming? SJSU volleyball player dominating female rivals and enraging women's rights groups,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/who-blaire-fleming-sjsu-trans-athlete-dominating-female-rivals-enraging-nation,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 07:00:25 -0500",San Jose State volleyball player Blaire Fleming will play for a conference championship at the center of a political firestorm over transgender inclusion.,"Former NFL player Jack Brewer joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss his reaction to the team forfeiting, 'Squad' member Ayanna Pressley's concerns about the future of the Democratic Party and how he is giving back this Thanksgiving. San Jose State volleyball player Blaire Fleming built a prosperous athletic resume en route to the epicenter of national controversy. Many of Fleming's past competitors had to settle for losses along the way. Fleming is the leader in kills for a San Jose State team that will compete in the Mountain West tournament final Saturday against Colorado State. The athlete's spiking ability has been a competitive asset and a point of outrage by critics, including President-elect Trump, amid the controversy over Fleming competing against women as a transgender athlete.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM But the team and coach Todd Kress have ridden the power of Fleming's spikes back to the conference final for the second time since 2022, Fleming's first season at San Jose State.  This time, they didn't even have to play in the semifinal to get there after Boise State forfeited a semifinal match to the Spartans amid the controversy. But even when Fleming's presence isn't prompting other teams to give a match away, which has resulted in seven conference wins for San Jose State this year, Fleming's natural physical ability is still there to help the team win.  That ability has been there since high school.  Fleming was born in 2002 at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, just south of Omaha. But Fleming grew up in Aldie, Virginia. Fleming has also been referred to as ""Brayden Fleming"" in reports from multiple media outlets. San Jose State's official volleyball website lists the player's birth name as Blaire Rene Fleming.  Fleming played girls' volleyball at John Champe High School. At a listed height of 6-foot-1, Fleming is inches taller than the average women's college volleyball recruit of 5-foot-9, according to NCSA College Recruiting.  The advantage in height and spiking ability coincided with Fleming being a game-changing player for John Champe and girls volleyball head coach Jasmine Jackson. In November 2018, Fleming posted a highlight reel for college recruiters on the high school sports social media site Hudl. Fleming's highlights showed multiple clips that demonstrated the athlete's leaping and spiking ability.  Most of the clips show the same type of play over and over again: Fleming leaping high above the net, higher than any other player on the court, and slamming the ball down with authority as trap music blared in the background. Multiple opponents were seen diving to the floor in an attempt to reach Fleming's spike on time but falling well short of where Fleming's spike landed. One year later, Fleming was the centerpiece of the best volleyball team in John Champe High School history with a historic 19-win season in 2019 – Fleming's senior year. That year, Fleming was named first-team all-district and set the school's single-season record for kills in a season with 266. Fleming set the school's single-game record for kills with 30 against Battlefield High School in September of that year.  The Hudl video of that game showed Fleming with dyed blonde hair, leading the team to victory with 30 powerful slams. Fleming's finished as runners-up in the district tournament and made the regional playoffs that year, and Fleming was crowned the team's MVP by teammates.  Fleming's college career began at Coastal Carolina during the COVID-affected 2020 season. So Fleming's college debut came a few months later than usual, in October that year. And even as a true freshman, Fleming averaged 1.86 kills per set, third on the team.  Fleming's dominance came out even more when the game mattered most. After a staggering 19-1 regular season, Coastal Carolina reached the Sun Belt Conference championship game against Texas State. Fleming put up career-highs in kills with 12, three digs and two blocks, but Fleming's team lost in the deciding fifth set. That was the last match Fleming played for Coastal Carolina, and it would be another 22 months before Fleming played another college volleyball game after entering the transfer portal.  No reason has been officially given by Fleming, nor San Jose State or Coastal Carolina, for the player deciding to transfer. If Fleming had stayed at Coastal Carolina, it's possible the player wouldn't have been playing in a conference championship game this year without breaking state law. South Carolina, where Coastal Carolina is located, passed the Save Women's Sports Act May 16, 2022. The bill was prefilled Nov. 17, 2021.  SJSU TRANSGENDER VOLLEYBALL SCANDAL: TIMELINE OF ALLEGATIONS, POLITICAL IMPACT AND A RAGING CULTURE MOVEMENT No stats or games have been recorded for Fleming for the 2021 season. But Fleming got a chance for a new start in California at San Jose State.  According to a lawsuit against the Mountain West filed by a plaintiff list that includes suspended San Jose State volleyball coach Melissa Batie-Smoose, former head volleyball coach Trent Kersten allegedly targeted Fleming as a transfer recruit and gave the athlete a full scholarship, allegedly while knowing Fleming is a biological male.  ""Prior to the 2022 season the then coach of the SJSU Team, Trent Kersten, recruited an outside hitter from Coastal Carolina University, a NCAA Division I program in Conway, South Carolina, named Blaire Fleming, who had entered the transfer portal,"" a lawsuit states.  ""Fleming was given a full scholarship to play for the SJSU Team. On information and belief, SJSU advised the MWC that Blaire Fleming was a trans-identifying male and would be participating in women’s volleyball on the SJSU Team."" Kersten left the program after the 2022 season.  California is one of 24 states that allow transgender student-athletes to play for teams that match their gender identity. The Golden State's law is one of the oldest of its type in the country, having been in place since 2013.  However, according to the lawsuit, when the program made the decision to recruit Fleming out of the transfer portal, the coaches involved allegedly didn't go out of their way to inform all the players on the team. San Jose State has confirmed to Fox News Digital the university never formally notified any of the opponents on its schedule of the ongoing controversy and lawsuits in which Fleming is named this season.  Former San Jose State volleyball players Alyssa Sugai and Elle Patterson have joined the lawsuit against the Mountain West and recounted the events that led to them no longer being on the team.  Sugai claims she was told by coaches she was not ""physical"" enough as a player compared to Fleming. ""As a result of her frustration and feelings of inadequacy, because she was not able to make the starting line-up through effort and sacrifice and because her diminished playing time behind Fleming prevented her from receiving offers through the transfer portal, Sugai faced depression during and after the transfer portal period and ultimately determined that she had no realistic choice other than to give up playing collegiate volleyball after the 2022 season,"" a court document states.  Blaire Fleming of the San Jose State Spartans attempts to block a shot during the first set against the Air Force Falcons at Falcon Court at East Gym Oct. 19, 2024, in Colorado Springs, Colo. (Andrew Wevers/Getty Images) ""Losing to Fleming caused Sugai to doubt her ability to play volleyball at a high level, even though she had rigorously trained and competed since childhood. It also caused her to doubt her self-worth and caused her to feel ‘defeated.’"" Patterson also played behind Fleming and alleges the university did not fulfill previous verbal offers of a scholarship to her for the 2023 and 2024 seasons. Patterson says she even paid full tuition to play in 2023 after being told she would get a scholarship for 2024. However, the program did not make good on that offer either, she alleges.  ""Ultimately, Patterson informed Associate Head Coach Batie-Smoose and Head Coach Todd Kress that she was financially unable to pay for full out-of-state tuition, room and board at SJSU again in 2024 and therefore would be unable to return to the SJSU Team without a scholarship,"" the documents state.  ""Nevertheless, Todd Kress remained firm in his position that Patterson would not receive a scholarship to play on the SJSU Team in 2024, and that Fleming would receive a full scholarship to play on the SJSU Team."" San Jose State volleyball co-captain Brooke Slusser will take the floor beside Fleming for the Spartans on Saturday night in the championship game. Slusser will be doing this despite being at the forefront of the lawsuit against the Mountain West over Fleming's presence on the team and the lawsuit against the NCAA over its policies on gender identity headed by Riley Gaines.  Slusser has alleged that she was never told what Fleming's biological sex was when Slusser transferred to San Jose State in 2023, one year after Fleming did. Slusser also alleges she shared living spaces with Fleming and frequently was assigned to share hotel rooms for road games because Fleming requested it.  ""Slusser did learn however that the reason she had been assigned to room with Fleming so often during road trips in the 2023 season was that Kress and other SJSU women’s volleyball officials asked Fleming who Fleming wanted to room with, and Fleming chose Slusser,"" the court documents say.  Slusser previously told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview that she would not have ""opened up"" with Fleming on the personal level she had during that first season had she known Fleming was a transgender athlete.  The lawsuit claims Fleming admitted to being a biological male in a conversation with Slusser over ice cream in April.  ""Slusser asked why Fleming had not shared this information with her before, particularly as they had been living together. Fleming responded that there never seemed to be a good time to bring it up, and that he had been afraid that Slusser might not be his friend if Slusser knew the truth. Fleming also said that if Slusser was uncomfortable with it that Fleming would leave the volleyball team,"" the documents state.  Things got more complicated in October, when Slusser alleges she learned of a plot by Fleming to have her spiked in the face by a volleyball during a game against Colorado State Oct. 3. The lawsuit alleges the incident was reported by teammate Tanner Manusky to Kress and Batie-Smoose the night before the game, and that Manusky was present during a conversation between Fleming and Colorado State player Malaya Jones.  Jones is one of the only players in the conference with better kill numbers than Fleming.  Batie-Smoose was suspended by the program after filing a Title IX complaint that included the same allegations.  According to a letter obtained by Fox News Digital from Mountain West Commissioner Gloria Nevarez, the conference says it conducted an investigation into the allegations of the Title IX complaint but did not find sufficient evidence to confirm the claims. Slusser's attorney has provided a statement to Fox News Digital questioning the validity of the investigation.  Slusser previously told Fox News Digital the program's response to the allegations makes her feel ""unsafe"" and being treated unfairly compared to Fleming.  Brooke Slusser and Blaire Fleming (Getty Images) ""If this was me, and I was the one threatening to do this to my teammate who's caused so much commotion, there would have been action taken immediately,"" Slusser said. ""I was definitely very angry, and I was glad at first to know that it was already made aware to the coaching staff and compliance and everyone, but I don't know if that made me feel any differently. I was just angry because I didn't think someone would go to these lengths. ""Threatening to want to hurt one of your own teammates, I just feel like there's so many things in that whole conversation that would make a school want to get it dealt with.""  Slusser also said she has not spoken with Fleming about the allegations, adding that speaking with the athlete ""isn't worth my breath.""  ""I think anyone can see that's in my circle and in the gym that they're not here to support me. They're here to support Blaire, and they have decided that they will basically do anything to keep supporting Blaire and to not be there for me and my needs,"" Slusser said. ""I just have decided you can't really trust anyone here.""  Fox News Digital has reached out for a comment in response from Fleming via San Jose State University multiple times but has not received a response.  Despite these tensions, when Slusser and Fleming are on the court together, they play as one of the most effective duos in the conference. Slusser and Fleming were each named to the Mountain West all-conference honorable mention list.  The Spartans finished the regular season with the third-best hitting percentage in the conference. Slusser finished with a top 10 individual hitting percentage in the conference. Fleming was second in the conference in kills per set with a .386, still well behind Colorado State's Jones, who led the way at .457.  In Slusser's first lawsuit against the NCAA, she alleged Fleming's spikes travel at 80 miles per hour and that her and her teammates felt as though they ""couldn't protect themselves.""  Still, Slusser has been quick to help set up Fleming for some of those signature spikes despite the situation.  During games, they have been seen closely communicating, even patting each other on the back and huddling up next to each other.  Brooke Slusser and Blaire Fleming of the San Jose State Spartans call a play during the first set against the Air Force Falcons at Falcon Court at East Gym Oct. 19, 2024, in Colorado Springs, Colo.  (Andrew Wevers/Getty Images) In the first game played after Slusser filed her lawsuit against the Mountain West, the Spartans faced Colorado State in a rematch of a game in which Fleming was alleged to have conspired to have Slusser spiked in the face.  Fleming was cheered during Senior Day ceremonies by the San Jose State crowd, and some fans even brought signs into the arena in support of the transgender player.  And, with Slusser's help, Fleming put on one of the best performances of the athlete's career. Fleming finished the match with 24 kills, one shy of a career high, and a game-winning service ace in the decisive fifth set.  When the ball from that play hit the floor, Slusser joined the rest of her teammates in rushing to embrace Fleming and celebrate the game-winning play. It put the team in position to play in the conference tournament.  Fleming had not made any public statements Fox News Digital was aware of at the time of publication, since the controversy surrounding the team erupted nationally.  The athlete has been the subject of frequent online discussion that has become more confrontational as the season has progressed.  San Jose State did not respond to questions about whether Fleming has been harassed or threatened during controversy. However, the university has confirmed the team has had armed police protection since September after news of the first forfeit on the schedule. ""The team has been a subject of significant attention, not all of it positive, and we are ensuring their security,"" a spokesperson told Fox News Digital.  Fox News Digital provided a series of questions to San Jose State about the measures it is taking to protect the players, including whether digital forensics by the university police department is being used or whether the situation has been elevated to state or federal investigators.  ""The university has asked students and staff to share all concerning communications with UPD to be evaluated and addressed appropriately, including in conjunction with proper authorities where appropriate,"" said part of a statement San Jose State provided to Fox News Digital. Trump called out Fleming during a town hall event on Fox News Channel’s ""The Faulkner Focus"" Oct. 17. ""I saw the slam, it was a slam. I never saw a ball hit so hard, hit the girl in the head,"" Trump said. ""But other people, even in volleyball, they’ve been permanently, I mean, they’ve been really hurt badly. Women playing men. But you don’t have to do the volleyball. We stop it. We stop it. We absolutely stop it. You can’t have it.""  Trump also revealed his intention to ban transgender inclusion in women's sports if elected. San Jose State has insisted the footage Trump is referring to shows the ball hitting another player's arm, not her head. High-profile figures and social media groups, including Gaines, the International Council on Women's Sports (ICONS), XX-XY Athletics and the popular right-wing X account ""Libs of TikTok"" have frequently used Fleming's image and story to promote awareness for opposing transgender inclusion in women's and girls sports.  However, some have also come out in support of Fleming.  Fleming was defended in a recent ESPN interview by transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, who tied Gaines at the 2022 NCAA championships, sparking Gaines' ongoing lawsuit against the NCAA.  ""To have my own personal identity and personhood turned into a culture war talking point just totally takes all my humanity away. It can be very difficult to keep trying to persevere through that,"" Thomas said. Multiple left-leaning media outlets have chosen not to identify Fleming by name in coverage of the team and situation.  The issue of protecting Fleming's identity was even a lengthy talking point in a recent emergency hearing in Colorado that decided whether Fleming would be allowed to play in the Mountain West tournament.  Federal Judge Kato Crews presided over the hearing brought by Slusser, Batie-Smoose and the other Mountain West players with their lawsuit against the conference. The players and Utah State aimed to contest Fleming's eligibility to compete in the upcoming tournament and to reverse the six conference wins awarded to San Jose State after teams forfeited over Fleming's presence.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Crews dedicated the first 45 minutes of a hearing to a debate over what pronouns to use while referring to Fleming and whether the athlete's name should be used. Crews ruled that the player's name could be used and that anyone could use pronouns they felt like using.  Crews ruled that Fleming was eligible to play in the tournament. It was a decision that enraged activists fighting transgender inclusion and has only raised the heat of the controversy Fleming and the other Spartan players are playing through.  Fleming's presence has essentially ensured, on its own, that San Jose State will play in the conference championship with a chance to clinch an NCAA tournament berth after Boise State forfeited a semifinal match.  The last time Fleming played in a conference championship, the athlete had a career day. Now, Fleming is a senior, possibly playing college volleyball for the last time under a much brighter and intense national microscope. The country will watch and see how Fleming affects the course of women's sports history.  Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Ahead of their Mountain West tournament semifinal game Friday, three members of the top-seeded Colorado State's women's volleyball team knelt during the national anthem. One of the players, Malaya Jones, has been accused of conspiring with San Jose State University's transgender player, Blaire Fleming, to influence the outcome of a game between the schools and hit Fleming's teammate, Brooke Slusser, in the face with a ball during a match.  The Mountain West Conference conducted an investigation into allegations of conspiracy by players on San Jose State and Colorado State's volleyball teams and closed it without any discipline.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Malaya Jones (1) of the Colorado State Rams attacks the net against the Colorado Buffaloes at the CU Events Center Sept. 20, 2024, in Boulder, Colo.

Batie-Smoose was suspended shortly after the complaint was filed, to the dismay of Slusser and other players on the team. San Jose State volleyball player Chandler Manusky is quoted in a separate lawsuit recounting an incident in early October, when she and other teammates, including Fleming, violated team rules by sneaking out of a team hotel the night before a match against Colorado State.

""I was definitely very angry, and I was glad at first to know that it was already made aware to the coaching staff and compliance and everyone, but I don't know if that made me feel any differently. I was just angry because I didn't think someone would go to these lengths. ""Threatening to want to hurt one of your own teammates, I just feel like there's so many things in that whole conversation that would make a school want to get it dealt with.""  The Rams won their match against San Diego State Friday in four sets, setting up a date with San Jose State Saturday for the conference championship.

Craig Carton, Danny Parkins, Mark Schlereth and Greg Jennings ask if the Steelers are still Super Bowl contenders. George Pickens was not particularly in a giving mood during his media session inside the Pittsburgh Steelers' locker room the day after Thanksgiving.  Instead of providing reporters with thoughtful or insightful responses to their questions, the third-year wide receiver channeled former NFL running back Marshawn Lynch's viral moment at Super Bowl XLIX's media day in 2015. Pickens repeatedly responded, ""I’m just here so I won’t get fined,"" as reporters directed questions at the 23-year-old. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver George Pickens stands on the sidelines prior to the preseason game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, on Aug. 11, 2023. (Kevin Sabitus/Getty Images) One of the questions directed at Pickens centered around whether the receiver had heard from the NFL about any potential punishment for his involvement in a scuffle at the end of last week's game against the Cleveland Browns, which the Steelers lost 24-19. ""I'm just here so I won't get fined,"" he repeated. UNC 'REACHED OUT' TO STEELERS OC ARTHUR SMITH ABOUT HEAD COACH OPENING On the final play of the game, Steelers quarterback Russell Wilson tossed a Hail Mary toward the end zone. Pickens was in the area of the pass, but Browns cornerback Greg Newsome II was guarding him and effectively took the wide receiver out of the play. Cameras missed the beginning of what looked to be a skirmish, but a quick pan appeared to show Pickens and Newsome getting tangled up near the stands. The camera then showed Pickens being held back by two members of stadium security near the seats. One fan was even holding Pickens' arm, leading to initial speculation the player was getting into it with fans.

(Cooper Neill/Getty Images) Shortly after the Steelers' surprising loss inside the Browns' snowy home stadium, Pickens placed the blame on the game's weather conditions. ""Conditions played a huge, huge part in today’s game. I don’t really think the Cleveland Browns are a good team at all,"" he told reporters. ""I think the conditions kind of saved them today."" ""The snow, the conditions were so bad,"" he continued. ""I don't even think the QB could see sometimes. And when you got conditions like that, at the opponent's home field, it kind of plays in their favor."" The snowfall picked up in the second half of the game. While the weather conditions were something both teams had to contend with, Pickens' assertion suggests the Steelers fell to 8-3 due to the snow and wind.

(Mark Alberti/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) Friday's exchange was not the first time this season that Pickens has shown his apparent lack of fondness for having to interact with the media.  In October, Pickens came under scrutiny after he wore eye black during a game that featured a profane word. The eye black strip, which stretched under his eyes, said, ""open f---ing always."" NFL policy prohibits players from adding messages to eye black during games, but apparently the rule was not on Pickens' radar. ""Never seen (the rule) before,"" he said when asked if he was aware of the league's policy pertaining to eye black. ""Have you seen it before?"" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A reporter then mentioned the fine that Steelers defensive lineman Cam Heyward had to pay in 2015 when he wrote his father's nickname on his eye black. Heyward's father, Craig, played in the NFL from 1988-1998 and went by the nickname ""Ironhead."" Pickens shrugged when his teammate's fine was brought up, saying, ""Years ago, when I wasn’t in the league? So, no."" The Steelers will look to solidify their position atop the AFC North when they play the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. It doesn't always look pretty for the Kansas City Chiefs, but they somehow found a way to get it done again. After squandering a 13-point lead, the Chiefs managed to squeak by the Las Vegas Raiders, 19-17, on Black Friday. Less than a week after needing a field goal as time expired to beat the three-win Carolina Panthers, the Chiefs took Friday's victory in bizarre fashion.

However, with 15 seconds left, rookie center Jackson Powers-Johnson snapped the ball too early, and the Chiefs recovered.  The Raiders argued it was a false start, which would have negated the fumble. But referees ruled it an illegal shift, and the Chiefs declined the penalty, giving them the ball and the win. The Chiefs were up 16-3 toward the end of the third quarter, but the Raiders never gave up. Aidan O’Connell hit Brock Bowers for a 33-yard touchdown, and, after forcing a three-and-out, O’Connell  hit Tre Tucker for a 58-yard score. The PAT gave them a 17-16 lead early in the fourth. Kansas City answered with its fourth field goal of the game to regain the lead, but in the closing minutes, the Raiders were moving the ball again. On 4th and 11 with 2:21 left, the Raiders went for a 58-yard field goal, but it was no good.

The Raiders marched, though, getting inside the 40-yard line quickly. With a touchdown pass to Justin Watson, Patrick Mahomes became the Chiefs' all-time leader in touchdown passes, surpassing legend Len Dawson. Mahomes now has 238 passing touchdowns in just under seven full seasons. The victory clinched a playoff spot for the Chiefs, who will play postseason football a 10th straight season. They improved to 11-1, tying the Detroit Lions for the best record in football. While Chiefs kicker Matthew Wright went 4-for-4 on kicks, the Raiders' Daniel Carlson missed three of his, all from well over 50 yards.

Daniel Jones' tumultuous tenure with the New York Giants came to an end last week. After initially benching the 2019 first-round draft pick, the franchise granted the quarterback's request for his release. The decision to part ways with Jones was described as a mutual agreement, with Giants President and co-owner John Mara saying moving on from Jones ""would be best for him and for the team."" Jones cleared waivers in short order and landed with the Minnesota Vikings. He is expected to serve as a backup to starter Sam Darnold.

""I don't know how that whole situation went down, but to think that you'd ask for a release from a team that committed a lot to you is maybe different than how I would've handled that,"" Brady said during Thursday's broadcast.

I faced them in college, and some things didn't go the way I wanted, but the people that mattered the most to me were the guys in the locker room. I showed up every day.

Eberflus said that they ""handled the situation correctly."" Danny Parkin... Detroit Lions wide receiver Jameson Williams took a costly penalty in the fourth quarter of the Lions' 23-20 win over the Chicago Bears. With the Lions driving into Bears territory, Williams was shoved out of bounds after a catch and then flipped the ball at a player on the Bears sideline.  Williams was flagged 15 yards for taunting, and the penalty proved costly as kicker Jake Bates missed the 45-year-field goal that would have put the Lions up 26-13 at the time.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Detroit Lions wide receiver Jameson Williams (9) runs after a catch against the Chicago Bears during the second half of an NFL football game in Detroit, Thursday, Nov. 28, 2024.  (AP Photo/Duane Burleson) That missed field goal was crucial in spurring the Bears’ attempted comeback, as they scored a touchdown on the ensuing possession after the missed field goal. A reporter asked Lions head coach Dan Campbell after the game about Williams’ taunting penalty, as the wide receiver was benched for the rest of the game following the penalty.  ""I’ll be honest with you, that’s already cleaned up.

San Diego State's women's volleyball team released a statement on Friday suggesting it is willing to participate in a potential Mountain West Tournament final match against San Jose State. The statement comes two days after Boise State forfeited its semifinal match to the Spartans amid a national controversy over a trans athlete.  San Diego State will take on top-seeded Colorado State in the semifinal on Friday night for the chance to face San Jose State for the conference championship in Las Vegas, Nevada. The program said the team has made a ""decision to play."" ""We love playing the sport of volleyball. We remain focused on continuing our strong start to the season and competing for a Mountain West championship. Our decision to play is not intended to be any kind of statement besides demonstrating our commitment to volleyball,"" the statement read.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The program also announced that players will not be doing any media interviews throughout the tournament.  San Diego State played two matches against San Jose State this year, sweeping the Spartans by winning both matches. San Diego State dominated San Jose State in straight sets on the Spartans' home floor on October 10. The rematch in San Diego on November 9 saw the Aztecs in three sets to one.  San Jose State's trans player Blaire Fleming still led both games in kills, but San Diego State was able to overcome it both times.  Meanwhile, Boise State, forfeited both regular season matches to San Jose State, and were one of four conference opponents to do so in the regular season.

The Cowboys enter Week 13 with a 4-7 record after defeat... Mike McCarthy's job security has been a topic of conversation all season long.  The Dallas Cowboys' struggles this season have appeared to amplify the noise surrounding the head coach. The Cowboys did manage to upset the Washington Commanders in Week 12 before following up that performance with a 27-20 win over the New York Giants on Thanksgiving Day. McCarthy is in the last year of his contract, and it remains unclear whether longtime team owner Jerry Jones would opt to bring him or any members of the current coaching staff back.

The Fox Sports broadcast caught Wolverines Tavierre Dunlap and Jason Hewlett on the sideline with tearing eyes after apparently being pepper sprayed by police officers on the field. Multiple reports said pepper spray was used to de-escalate the skirmish after the Wolverines’ 13-10 upset of the No. 2 Buckeyes in Columbus, Ohio on Saturday.    Other footage showed Michigan defensive lineman Mason Graham seemingly getting pepper sprayed amid the chaos.  A third angle shows a police officer pepper-spraying a group of Ohio State players as they try to break up the skirmish.   Sports Illustrated senior writer Pat Forde said he was caught in the crossfire.  “Just got secondhand pepper sprayed,” Forde wrote on X. The brawl broke out moments after Michigan upset Ohio State as Wolverines players tried to plant their flag on the Buckeye’s logo at midfield.  “I don’t know all the details of it, but I know these guys are looking to put a flag on our field and our guys weren’t not gonna let that happen,” Ohio State head coach Ryan Day said after the game. “I’ll find out exactly what happened, but this is our field. We certainly were embarrassed of the fact that we lost the game, but there’s some prideful guys on this team that weren’t just gonna let that happen.” Multiple players could be seen going at it as security, police and team staff tried to separate them. “For such a great game, you hate to see stuff like that after the game,” Michigan running back Kalel Mullings said. “That’s just bad for the sport, bad for college football. But at the end of the day, some people gotta learn how to lose. “You can’t be fighting and stuff just because you lost a game. All that fighting, we had 60 minutes, we had four quarters to do all that fighting. And now people want to talk and fight, that’s wrong. It’s just bad for the game. Classless, in my opinion.

We are women, NOT TRANSGENDER WOMEN. Just WOMEN will do in the future,” Navratilova wrote on the social media platform on Friday. The Times published an article Thursday which documented the inner turmoil of a women’s college volleyball team – the San Jose State University Spartans – attempting to field a transgender female player in upcoming tournament games. The attempt to get the trans player to compete has caused division, not only in the league, but among team members, some of whom are suing their own team.  The outlet reported, “Earlier this month, a senior co-captain of the Spartans and the assistant coach filed a lawsuit to stop the transgender athlete from playing in this week’s Mountain West Conference tournament, claiming that she violates Title IX rights to gender equity at federally funded institutions.” NYT- you stink. We are women, not NOT TRANSGENDER WOMEN. Just WOMEN will do in the future. https://t.co/xJZNJvS6O1 The co-captain was joined by 10 female volleyball players, most of whom are on other teams that play against the Spartans. The Times described the situation as a “complicated mess,” noting that “some of the Spartans no longer talk to one another at practice or outside of games” and adding that even the head coach – who supports the trans student – “has stopped talking to some players off the court, too.” The Times reporter Juliet Macur appeared to step into the debate as well, as further down in her piece, she employed the term “non-transgender women” as one way to distinguish biological women. Describing some of the science that fuels that debate as to whether trans women can compete in women’s sport, Macur wrote, “On its website, the N.C.A.A. says trans volleyball players are eligible to play if their testosterone level is less than 10 nanomoles per liter — that’s at least four times more than what many experts say is the top of the range for non-transgender women, and in the typical range for adult men.” At other points in the piece, the reporter also referred to the biological female athletes as “athletes assigned female at birth.” Frustrated social media users trashed these controversial descriptions of women.  British Olympian and activist Sharron Davies posted, “Written in the NYT … women are now Non-transgender women! Just wow! How anyone can say this isn’t a men’s rights movement I’ll never know, whilst women lose their rights, their words, their safeguards, their sports, their sex discrimination laws… I will never understand.” Anti-trans activism account “WomenAreReal” addressed the outlet on X, stating, “Hey @nytimes Don’t call us ‘non-transgender women.’ Just stop it. Stop all the offensive terms for us.” The account listed other politically correct terms trans activists have used to referred to biological women, including, “birthing parent,” “uterus haver,” “menstruator,” and “vaginal presenting.” “We are WOMEN!” the account added.  Journalist Tiffany Wong posted, “LMAO, New York Times is calling normal, sane women ‘non-transgender women.’” Conservative journalist Andy Ngo remarked, “In woke ideology, there are only transgender women and non-transgender women.” Even Rep.

After a four-yard gain, Smith was taken down near Michigan’s sideline, and that’s when things got interesting.  Smith rose to his feet and there appeared to be some pushing and shoving between the two rivals.  Caught in the middle of the mini brawl, the field judge fell to the turf hard and appeared to be shaken up as he lay at the feet of the players for a brief moment.  The referee was eventually helped up and both teams were dealt offsetting penalties for the brouhaha.  One of the best and oldest rivalries in college football, it’s no surprise the Buckeyes and Wolverines almost went to blows.  Ohio State and Michigan are playing in their 119th game against each other.  The Wolverines, last season’s national championship winner, have won each of the past three contests.  Michigan came away with a 13-10 victory that ended in an ugly brawl as the team tried to plant its flag on Ohio State’s turf."

Each loss seemed to hit like a gut punch until the Blueshirts finally struck back with a nail-biting 4-3 win over the Canadiens on Saturday afternoon at Madison Square Garden.  There has been something intangible missing from this team since the start of the season.  In this much-needed win, however, the Rangers’ emotions seeped out.  They pushed. There was a sort of engagement on the ice we haven’t seen.   In terms of effort, no one could question the Rangers in this one – albeit against an inferior Canadiens team.  A feel-good win nearly slipped through their fingers, however, when the Rangers blew a two-goal lead in the third period. Kaapo Kaako then capitalized on a fortunate four-minute power play for the final 2:40 of regulation. Montreal, tied for the second least amount of points in the NHL, suffered the six-game losing streak the Rangers were specifically trying to avoid on Saturday. That much was apparent.

Moments after the Wolverines’ 13-10 win, the two teams got into a brawl near midfield after Michigan players tried to plant their flag on Ohio State’s logo on Saturday. Multiple players could be seen going at it as security, police and team staff tried to separate them.  Michigan edge rusher Derrick Moore was in the middle of melee, holding his team’s flag and trying to plant it on the Buckeyes’ famed logo.  And Ohio State linebacker Jack Sawyer, who had an interception in the game, ripped the Michigan flag away from the Wolverine players before tensions finally calmed down.  “I don’t know all the details of it, but I know these guys are looking to put a flag on our field and our guys weren’t not gonna let that happen,” Ohio State head coach Ryan Day said after the game. “I’ll find out exactly what happened, but this is our field. We certainly were embarrassed of the fact that we lost the game, but there’s some prideful guys on this team that weren’t just gonna let that happen.”  Police used pepper spray, according to multiple reports, with members of both teams getting hit.  Several Michigan players were shown on the Fox broadcast rubbing their eyes in obvious discomfort.  “For such a great game, you hate to see stuff like that after the game,” Michigan running back Kalel Mullings said. “That’s just bad for the sport, bad for college football. But at the end of the day, some people gotta learn how to lose. “You can’t be fighting and stuff just because you lost a game. All that fighting, we had 60 minutes, we had four quarters to do all that fighting. And now people want to talk and fight, that’s wrong. It’s just bad for the game. Classless, in my opinion. People gotta better.”  Saturday’s game marked Michigan’s fourth-straight in the famed rivalry, though they entered this edition unranked and as massive underdogs with Ohio State ranked No. 2 in the country.  Michigan now sits at 7-5, while Ohio State is 10-2. As the fracas finally began to settle down, Michigan defensive lineman Mason Graham could be heard shouting “Ohio State p—y’s in the Buckeyes’ direction.”  Michigan edge rusher Chibi Anwunah was escorted away by security after being pepper sprayed.  Michigan head coach Sherrone Moore also waved goodbye to Ohio State fans in the final seconds of the game.  “Unnecessary gesture by the Wolverines,” Fox play-by-play man Gus Johnson said of the postgame incident. “They won the game, no need to be disrespectful.”  Wolverines quarterback David Warren threw for just 62 yards and two interceptions, but Mullings rushed for 116 yards and a touchdown and Michigan’s defense stifled the Buckeyes offense throughout the game.  Ohio State quarterback Will Howard struggled, throwing for 175 yards, one touchdowns and two interceptions.  Buckeyes kicker Jeyden Fielding also missed two short field goals, while Michigan kicker Dominic Zvada drilled both his attempts."

The comments attributed to Williams were allegedly her chirping back at an internet troll trying mock her current relationship status with Allen now moving toward marriage. “luckily my boyfriend owns a team and doesn’t play for one,” Williams allegedly wrote back. “don’t have to be with another brain dead CTE athlete.” The comments have since been scrubbed from her account.  Longtime friends, Allen and Williams dated from 2017-2023.

Eleven games are on the docket for Week 13’s Sunday slate, including a scintillating “Sunday Night Football” matchup between the 49ers and Bills. Player props have been profitable this season, although our last installment during Week 11 went 1-4, losing 3.2 units and bringing down our total profit to 7.6 units this season. Our current record is 21-18 on the year. In seasons past, we profited 20-plus units, and things typically get better as the season wears on when we get more data to influence our bets. That begins now as we travel to drop our player props for Week 13 of the NFL season. Baker Mayfield has cleared 9.5 rushing yards in all but two games this season. Add in 25+ rushing yards, which Mayfield did as recently as last week against the Giants and three of his last seven, and you surely have a +EV (plus end value) wager at long odds. The Panthers are giving up 23.09 rushing yards per game to opposing quarterbacks, a below-average league mark.  All of those things considered, we should be wagering on Mayfield this weekend.  Rushing attempts, aka carries, are some of the better betting opportunities that we get each week, so be sure to target that, especially on Hard Rock and Bet365, which are the only sites that allow alternate bets on attempts. Tank Bigsby is the backup running back for the Jaguars but he’s also taken control of the role in different spurts this season. Prior to getting injured in Week 10, Bigsby had three straight games with more than a 50 percent snap rate.  He’s also run for 70-plus yards in five games this season.  Travis Etienne has zero games with more than 70 rushing yards this season, so there isn’t anything statically that points to him reclaiming the lion’s share of that load with Bigsby back at full health. Erich Richter is a brazilian jiu-jitsu blue belt but he has a black belt in MMA betting. During the football season he’s showcased massive profits at The Post in the player prop market the last two seasons. While constantly betting long shots, his return on investment is 30.15 percent since 2022."

That prospect is in jeopardy. And honestly, it’s not just a this-week thing. These final three years of his contract, for which Kreider’s no-move clause became a limited no-trade, were always going to feature land mines. It’s tough for a Ranger to go the distance.

Colorado State head coach Emily Kohan confirmed that the Rams will play in Saturday’s final at 5 p.m. ET after they defeated fifth-seeded San Diego State in four sets on Friday. “It’s been a really complex and emotional situation this whole season,” Kohan said. “And unless you’re in those rooms having those hard conversations and making those hard decisions, I don’t think you truly know how this feels. “I also think, regardless of your opinion on it, there’s some room here to acknowledge that there’s been a lot of young people showing courage all season long in a lot of ways.” SJSU has been embroiled in controversy this season because of a transgender player on the team, Blaire Fleming. Several teams have forfeited matches against SJSU, while Fleming has been named in lawsuits that include members of the Spartan’s team and staff. SJSU advanced to the final after Boise State became the latest team to forfeit a match, this time a semifinal in the conference tournament. The Broncos’ athletic department released a statement Wednesday night saying their team “should not have to forgo this opportunity while waiting for a more thoughtful and better system that serves all athletes.” In addition to Boise State, Mountain West members Wyoming, Utah State and Nevada as well as Southern Utah canceled matches this season against the Spartans. Nevada’s players said they “refuse to participate in any match that advances injustice against female athletes,” without providing further details. But speaking to members of the media on Friday, Kohan stood by Colorado State’s decision to play in the final. “This has been far from a regular season. We get an opportunity to play for another championship tomorrow, but we also are showing some courage to be the team that says, ‘Hey, we’re going to go out there and we’re gonna show courage in the way we play and that this can stop with us.’” “We’re not going to pass these difficult conversations on to the NCAA committee or any other team to have those crying conversations in the hotel,” she continued.

Following Iowa’s 13-10 win over rival Nebraska on Friday, Hawkeyes linebackers Jay Higgins and Nick Jackson called out Cornhuskers head coach Matt Rhule and the team’s captains for their pregame antics.  They claimed Rhule walked through Iowa’s pregame warmups.  “So we immediately knew what type of game this was,” Higgins said.  Soon after, Nebraska’s captains refused to shake hands with Iowa’s captains during the pregame coin toss, instead either staring straight ahead or down at the ground when the Hawkeyes reached out their arms. Higgins claimed that on Iowa’s first defensive drive, he told Rhule “It probably wasn’t a good idea to not shake our hands,” to which he says Rhule replied, “Who are you?”  Nebraska entered halftime up 10-0, though, before falling apart in the second half.   “How good did they feel at halftime? Didn’t shake our hands, up 10, they were probably in that locker room going crazy. But it felt great to beat them. Trophy game, everything was on the line.”  Iowa then scored 13 unanswered points in the second half, culminating in a game-winning 53-yard field goal from Drew Stevens as time expired.  After the game, Higgins made a beeline toward Rhule at midfield in order to shake his hand.  When asked if Iowa head coach Kirk Ferentz would ever do anything similar, Higgins took another shot.  “No, no, no, never,” Jackson said. “Come to Iowa and be a Hawk, see the difference.”  Iowa finished the regular season 8-4 overall and 6-3 in the conference, while Nebraska finished 6-6 overall and 3-6 in the conference. “I can’t imagine being some of those seniors, and then just happening like this again against Iowa, especially the way we played,” Nebraska head coach Matt Rhule said after the game.  Iowa’s social media department even got in on the fun, posting a video on X of Nebraska’s refusal to shake hands with the caption “ope” accompanied by a laughing emoji."

After a situation where Jones was assigned to play safety on the scout team in practice, he requested his release which the team granted. Jones landed as a backup on 9-2 Vikings, and spoke to reporters Friday about why he chose to sign there. “You look at offensively what they’ve been able to do, the system, coach [Kevin] O’Connell and his staff. Just a lot of good things happening across the board as a team and organization, and on offense especially,” Jones said, as covered by Sports Illustrated. “Just excited to join that and help out where I can.” Jones will be backing up Sam Darnold, a fellow former first-round pick who flamed out of New York after three years with the Jets. Darnold has had a renaissance in O’Connell’s system in Minnesota. “We haven’t had a ton of crossover on film, so I haven’t watched too closely,” Jones said Friday, referring to Darnold. “But just from following him and seeing some games on TV, obviously he’s been playing at an extremely high level and doing a lot of good things. Happy for him. I’ve known Sam for a while know, and always kind of pulled for him. He’s had a great year and played at a really high level.” The brightest spot in Jones’ NFL career came when he led a 31-24 upset on the road against the Vikings in the 2022-23 playoffs. “I like U.S. Bank Stadium,” Jones said, smiling. “It is an incredible stadium, and the fans there are incredible.

Ohtani, who won his first World Series title with the Dodgers in October and was a unanimous choice for National League MVP honors this year, filed a petition in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on Nov. 26. In addition to Ippei Mizuhara returning the baseball cards that Ohtani claims were bought with his money, the Dodgers star wants his former employee and friend to return signed baseball cards that were in Mizuhara’s “unauthorized and personal collection.” Mizuhara, of Newport Beach, California, had already pleaded guilty to bank fraud and tax fraud in June after he was accused of stealing approximately $17 million from Ohtani. The latest accusations came after Mizuhara allegedly used Ohtani’s bank account to secure funds, which he then used to buy cards on eBay and Whatnot beginning in January 2024. He was also accused of using the cash to pay medical bills and cover gambling debts to an illegal bookmaker. The complaint stated that Mizuhara was still buying cards through April 2024. Prosecutors alleged that the interpreter bought approximately 1,000 cards, using the alias “Jay Min.” Some of the packages were mailed to Mizuhara in care of the Dodgers, according to court documents reviewed by Sports Collectors Daily. Embed from Getty Images Ohtani asked for a hearing to regain ownership of the sports cards that authorities seized from Mizuhara, The New York Times reported. A judge granted the hearing, which will be held on Dec. 20, according to the newspaper. Mizuhara’s attorney, Michael Freedman, declined to comment on the filing, The Los Angeles Times reported. Mizuhara was fired in March 2024, The New York Times reported. His sentencing in the case involving tax and bank fraud had been set for Dec. 20 but was delayed to Jan. 24, 2025, The New York Times reported. In a declaration filed with the court on Nov. 27, Freedman said that Mizuhara was “in the process” of being evaluated by a forensic psychiatrist, The attorney stated that the psychiatrist was unable to complete the evaluation process before Dec. 6, but added that Mizuhara missed his Nov. 24 appointment due to an illness. In light of the psychiatrist’s schedule and the Thanksgiving holiday, Freedman requested an extension, which was granted. According to the documents filed on Nov. 26, Ohtani, as the petitioner in the case, has a “right, title and/or interest” in the sports cards because they were allegedly bought by Mizuhara using money prosecutors said he stole from the Dodgers’ two-way star. The items described in the petition are “collectible sports cards found in (a) silver and black Panopply case; collectible sports cards found in (a) gray Panopply case; a box containing collectible sports cards; a card wrapping device; and plastic card protectors holders.” In the $17 million fraud case, Mizuhara potentially could be sentenced to as long as 30 years in prison, the Los Angeles Times reported. As a legal permanent resident who owns a green card, Mizuhara also faces deportation to Japan, according to the newspaper. Embed from Getty Images Mizuhara had been with Ohtani for many of the hitting-pitching star’s achievements, according to ESPN. He was Ohtani’s catcher during the Home Run Derby competition during the 2021 All-Star Game and was there when the star signed his record-breaking $700 million, 10-year deal with the Dodgers. His bets to the bookies included wagers on NBA, NFL and college football games, along with international soccer, ESPN reporting. Prosecutors said that Mizuhara never bet on baseball games. The MVP award Ohtani won this year was the third of his career. He also won NL honors in 2023 and was the American League MVP in 2021 when he played for the Los Angeles Angels. Bob has been a sportswriter and copy editor for more than 45 years and a blogger for two decades. He is celebrating his 60th year of card collecting, and still counts his 1965 Topps Mickey Mantle as his favorite.  You can reach him at [email protected].

Sports Collectors Daily,Brothers Give Up Hockey Collection to Help Fallen Officer’s Family,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/grice-hockey-collection-officer-darron-burks/,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 11:19:21 +0000",Two brothers from Colorado have turned their collection of game-used hockey sticks and one very special puck over to Heritage Auctions to raise money for the Assist the Officer Foundation.,"November 27, 2024 By Rich Mueller  Two brothers from Colorado have spent the last several years collecting game-used hockey sticks from some notable NHL players.  Now, they’ve giving them all up to raise money for a fallen police officer. 20-year-old Austin Grice and his 12-year-old sibling Blake have consigned the collection of 19 sticks—14 of which are autographed—to Heritage Auctions, which is offering them in single lots. The sticks include those used by Alex Ovechkin, Peter Forsberg, Patrick Kane, John Tavares, Vladimir Tarasenko and Tukka Rask.  There’s also a puck signed by the late Johnny Gaudreau and it’s that item that was part of what compelled the brothers to sell the sticks.  Gaudreau, a member of the Columbus Blue Jackets, and his brother Matthew were killed while riding their bicycles in Salem County, NJ on August 29.  That same week, Dallas police officer Darron Burks was shot and killed while sitting in his patrol car.  A rookie officer in his first year on the force, Burks had just left his job as a high school math teacher and coach to join the force.  The Rice brothers will donate all proceeds from their items to the Assist the Officer Foundation, which is helping the Burks family.   “The boys went through the hockey stick collection they built, looking for the Johnny Gaudreau stick they knew they had,” recalled their father, Barrie Grice. “Sure enough, they found it, and decided they wanted to sell it to raise money for the police officer, using Johnny and Matthew’s spirits to help another, uniting tragedies in kindness. Brothers honoring brothers.” According to Heritage, “While the acquisition of each of the different items has a unique story behind it, one stick has meant more to the Grice Brothers than any other. When Blake was born, he spent his first month in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) due to his extremely premature birth. During that time, Austin attended a L.A. Kings/Colorado Avalanche game where he was given an autographed, game-used stick from Kings center Anze Kopitar.” Barrie Grice says that stick, too, went into the auction after Blake and Austin decided it was more important to support the charity.  “When Blake was talking to Austin about it on the phone, he asked his brother if he was sure he wanted to give that stick up. Austin responded, ‘There are more important things than a hockey stick, Blake. Like with your birth, the main thing is you are OK and you are here to be my brother. Those families lost people forever. It’s fine. Let’s donate that one, too.” The online auction runs through Dec. 7. Rich is the editor and founder of Sports Collectors Daily.

Sports Collectors Daily,"Dalton Knecht Basketball Cards Exist Thanks to NIL, Instant",https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/dalton-knecht-rookie-cards/,"Wed, 27 Nov 2024 11:15:55 +0000","A strong start to his NBA career has the Lakers feeling good and Dalton Knecht basketball cards are generating a buzz, too.","November 27, 2024 By Brendan Cross  The 2023-24 NBA rookie class was loaded. Victor Wembanyama led the way, while secondary names like Amen and Ausar Thompson, Brandon Miller and Scoot Henderson headlined the second tier of rookies. The 2024-25 class is still emerging but one player has Lakers fans–and their superstar–excited.  Dalton Knecht rookie cards will definitely be worth watching in the years to come. Knecht, the 17th overall pick in the 2024 NBA Draft, is separating himself from the crowd. The 6’6″ guard/forward is averaging just over 11 points per game as of Nov. 23, but his recent string of performances suggests Knecht could be climbing into stardom soon enough.  Knecht followed up a 27-point game on Nov. 16 at New Orleans with a 37-point output at home against the Jazz. In that game he drained 9 threes while helping lead the Lakers to a 6-point victory. In a postgame interview, LeBron James said he has no idea how Knecht fell to the Lakers at 17. He added that he was grateful Knecht was on the team and that he knew exactly what the Lakers were getting. Collectors are grateful as well. 76ers rookie Jared McCain is near the top of the well-performing rookies list so far, but Knecht is neck-and-neck with him.  2024-25 NBA trading card products will make their way to market soon enough but here are 5 of Knecht’s earliest cards. 2023-24 Bowman U NOW  
Knecht had a pair of Bowman U NOW cards while he was a Tennessee Volunteer. Bowman U Now is the collegiate version of Topps NOW. Cards are only available for 24 hours on the Topps website and lucky collectors who ordered a card had a random chance at receiving a numbered parallel. The total print run of the shooting picture (#30 in the series) is 919 while the print run of the dunking card (#60) is 999. The base versions aren’t actually serial numbered, but these cards will also be some of his most rare, considering less than 1,000 were made of each. Ninety numbered parallels, including a Gold 1/1, are part of those print runs. 2023-24 Bowman U Chrome #48  The Bowman U Chrome brand has been a popular addition to the Topps lineup in the last few years. For collectors who love prospecting outside of baseball, collegiate basketball and football athletes now have true Bowman autographs before they make the pros. There are numerous parallel versions on the base card along with the autographed versions. Base non-auto versions of this card are selling for $5-$10 but a PSA 10 Yellow Refractor Auto numbered to 75 sold for $1,275 on November 21. 2023-24 Bowman U Chrome Sapphire  Chrome, but make it Sapphire. Collectors love the gleaming blue Sapphire version of nearly every chrome product, so it should come as no shock that 2023-24 Bowman U Chrome also has a Sapphire release. Knecht does not have any autographs in this set, but there is still a full parallel rainbow that can be put together. A PSA 10 sold for $100 on November 23 while a raw Gold Sapphire Refractor parallel sold for $158.50 on November 23. Standard base versions have been bringing $30 and more. 2023-24 Bowman U Best 
Initially, 2023-24 Bowman U Best did not release to the same fanfare as its Chrome counterpart, but the design of the product is so striking and different that it will standout it any collection. Knecht has base cards and autographs here with parallel autographs numbered to /125 and lower. The pictured raw Refractor Auto /125 sold for a whopping $450 on November 22. 2024 Panini Instant Draft Night 
For now, Panini still has the NBA licensing rights, making this 2024 Panini Instant Draft Night card Knecht’s first true NBA rookie card. While he isn’t wearing a Lakers jersey, he is sporting a Lakers hat and the card itself has the Lakers logo on it.  The print-on-demand cards are only available for a short time and the total print run for Knecht’s card is just 512. There were also several different numbered parallels that collectors could buy for a higher price via Panini and those who did are feeling pretty good right now. Collectors on eBay are scooping these up as they realize that Knecht’s first true rookie card is in fairly short supply.   Raw versions of the base card have been selling in the $150 range while a Jungle parallel /25 sold for $511 on November 21.  Since Knecht has exploded on the scene, Panini has also produced some official Knecht rookie cards via Instant including one from his NBA debut.  Brendan Cross is a freelance journalist with a degree from San Jose State. A lifelong sports fanatic, his love of cards really blossomed in 2012 with the first release of Panini Prizm. He’s been hooked ever since, and he loves writing about it.

Replay Sports Cards has launched a campaign “to inspire the next generation of sports card collectors.” Kicking off during the holiday season, Replay Gives Back aims to donate one million cards to kids across the country. Collectors can donate cards at any of the company’s three shops in Charlotte, NC, Mt. Pleasant, SC and Boca Raton, FL.  The company says the cards will then be sorted into packs that will be distributed to young people through partnerships with local organizations, many of whom may have no access to cards.  “Our passion for sports card collecting goes beyond the cards themselves—it’s about the joy, connection and the fond memories that come with them,” says Brent Schepel, co-founder of Replay Sports Cards. The first distribution is planned for the days leading up to Christmas. Mike Weinberger, co-founder and president of the company’s franchising efforts says the program “is the beginning of a long-term effort to bring smiles to kids through the universal love of sports.

Some are already underway.,"November 26, 2024 By Rich Mueller  While we may not be into standing in line at 5 AM, waiting for the department or electronics store to open Friday morning, collectors have never been above a good hunt for Black Friday deals on sports cards, supplies or memorabilia.   Your local shop might be having an event but there are plenty of online deals to be had, too, no matter your interest.  Black Friday has become Black Friday Week in some cases, with promotions already underway. And yes, many will extend into Cyber Monday and beyond. While this is undoubtedly not an  all-encompassing list, here are some sales we know are happening across the landscape.  Happy hunting. eBay   Some eBay sellers have discounted items this week. They can be found on the Deals page. Just type something into the search box (like Topps, Panini, Upper Deck or whatever you’re looking for) and you’ll get the results of what’s been marked down. SportsMemorabilia.com and Fanatics Fanatics’ main website, SportsMemorabilia.com and Steiner Sports all fall under the Fanatics umbrella now and all will be offering discounts on autographed items and other collectibles.   A quick check at SportsMemorabilia.com showed autographs from Shaq, Jayson Tatum, Nolan Ryan, Don Mattingly, Chipper Jones, Henrik Lundqvist, Auston Matthews and numerous other stars discounted quite a bit as well. This signed, time lapse photo of Carlton Fisk’s famous 1975 World Series game-winning homer is less than $65.  If you’re an Eagles fan–or a football fan in general–this unsigned photo of Saquon Barkley is about as cool as it gets for a very low cost.  Cards are typically excluded from the sale but it’s possible certain card products will be discounted. It’s best just to start browsing. Fanatics, of course, will have mountains of team gear, too, where the discount will apply. The company’s offers will change by the day for those types of items, including a one-time $50 discount for new customers. If you’re all about baseball, MLBShop is another option. Card Companies Topps’ Holiday sale is open now.  The company offers discounts on certain items, including current and recent unopened boxes like Holiday Baseball, supplies and other items. There isn’t a ton of variety but they do sometimes sell out quickly so it’s best to at least check out the deals ASAP. Upper Deck is touting its Black Friday deals on cards and items from the UDA store. We suspect Panini America will also have some special deals on their website. Online retailers Black Friday/Cyber Monday is a big one for the big online retailers of trading card boxes.  Steel City Collectibles, Blowout Cards, Dave & Adam’s and other big sellers usually offer ongoing specials.  Steel City has a page devoted to their specials.  Another big seller, Baseball Card Exchange, will roll out its Black Friday specials (5-10% off depending on the size of an order) at one minute past midnight on Thursday night/Friday. Amazon/Walmart  Shopping for card deals on Amazon can be a little frustrating as the site isn’t really well organized but there are quite a few Black Friday deal offers for supplies–everything from penny sleeves to top loaders, graded card carrying cases, display stands for single cards and storage boxes. You can start here and search around for what you’re looking for. They do have a few unopened boxes of recent product in their Black Friday section. While prices may not always be better than eBay, shipping is often free, which can sometimes more than make up for it.

Sports Collectors Daily,How the 1994-95 NHL Lockout Spelled More Trouble for The Hobby,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/how-the-1994-95-nhl-lockout-spelled-more-trouble-for-the-hobby/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 01:40:06 +0000","Thirty years ago, a hobby already trying to stay alive due to the baseball strike had to face an NHL lockout to start the 1994-95 season.","November 25, 2024 By Jeff Morris  While 1994 in the sports card industry will always be linked to the Major League Baseball players’ strike that shut down the season and hastened the unraveling of what had been a booming market, there was another labor stoppage that gave the hobby a double whammy. The NHL locked out its players for the start of the 1994 season. The players had gone to training camp and there were even some pre-season games played. But on October 1, the players were locked out. They had played the entire previous season without a deal in place. The lockout lasted until the sides finally settled on Jan. 11, saving what would be a 48-game season and playoffs that would run deeper into the summer than ever before. The key issues involved salary cap and luxury tax proposals. The league wanted a mechanism in place that would benefit the small market teams and add parity. The players’ union was not on board with the plan. Meanwhile, the collectibles business took a second hard hit on the heels of the already devastating baseball strike. Series 1 trading card products rolled out on time, but the demand was nowhere near at the level it had been in the previous two years. While there is a monopoly with Upper Deck and the NHL today, the 1994 hockey card market was the wild west. The number of brands at that time was staggering compared to what is being released today. Joining Upper Deck in the market were Pinnacle, Fleer, Topps, O-Pee-Chee and Donruss/Leaf. Pro Set was gone but the Parkhurst name was being shopped around and eventually picked up by Upper Deck. Action Packed had produced some fringe items and was knocking at the door for an NHL license. There were food issues and other sets, too.  Kraft was producing a food promotion set for Kraft and Jell-O products in Canada. Upper Deck was producing a McDonald’s set in Canada, which is the license that Tim Hortons has now. They also produced an NHLPA-licensed set called Be A Player, which included an autograph in every pack. Another big seller for a brief time that year was a set of NHL POGs from the World POG Federation. Panini was producing an NHL sticker book and stickers which sold well in Canada and Europe but did not do as well in the United States, a market that had not warmed up to stickers yet. There was also a Kitchener, Ontario-based company called Slapshot that produced junior hockey cards, as well as prospect sets from Signature Rookies and Classic. One promoter told the Calgary Herald in November of 1994 that the work stoppages “have devastated an already depressed business.”  In Alberta, hockey accounted for about 80% of store sales. At the time of the hockey lockout, I was the editor of Canadian Sportscard Collector and was also contracted to write some card backs. I went into a lot of shops and attended a lot of shows. I remember one shop owner closing his doors in the Ottawa area that year. He said he had to invest so much money into hockey and baseball to carry at least a few boxes of every product that he couldn’t afford the inventory needed to compete. He also said that he didn’t have the counter space to carry every item he wanted to. Another shop in Michigan that I visited had the same problem. Hockey was a huge seller in his shop, and he struggled to stock hockey and baseball products. Plus, he carried every NFL product and NBA product, as the Lions and Pistons were both popular at the time and driving sales. Because I was based in the Niagara area at that time, I also frequented shops and shows in the Buffalo area. They were also hit hard, but they had the popularity of the Bills to help them weather the storm. Before the lockout, there were a number of monthly shows at small hotels and community centers on both sides of the border that were put on hold and never came back. The decline in interest in the hockey card market was noticeable was at a pair of big shows. The October Montreal show saw attendance take a hit. The hardcore vintage and diehard collectors were there, and the autograph list of retired Montreal Canadiens and local stars who had played for other teams was good.  However, the vibe of the show and the feeling on the floor was downright depressing. First of all, the baseball strike hit Montreal harder than any other city and market. It ripped out the potential for a World Series from what was the best and hottest team in baseball. Olympic Stadium, at the same Olympic Park complex, stood somewhat-less-than-majestically behind the Maurice Richard Arena, where the show took place. Just seeing the stadium was a stark reminder that what had once been one of the best sports cities in North America had, at that time, no professional sports. The Canadiens were locked out. The Expos were on strike. The Alouettes had folded and would not return for a couple years, leaving only memories of Johnny Rodgers, Jimmy Jones, Tom Cousineau, Junior Ah You, and other Montreal football legends.  The city and its collectors had a blanket of depression thrown over them. It was a far cry from the same show from the previous year, when the Canadiens were the defending Stanley Cup champions, Patrick Roy was the most celebrated hero of the generation, and the excitement around the Expos was gaining momentum and was bringing the city back to the Gary Carter-Andre Dawson-Tim Raines era. The dealers in 1994 were there on the show floor with little to no crowds at their tables. Stacks of hockey and baseball wax boxes gathered dust. The autograph lineups drew enthusiastic collectors and fans, but the turnout was smaller than usual. That show was almost like a turning point in the city and in the entire province of Quebec. The sports card market would not be the same for about the next quarter century. Like in every other city, it wasn’t until COVID that things really blossomed into what it had been before 1994. The next big show that year was the Sport Card and Memorabilia Expo in Toronto. It was more of the same, yet even more pronounced. There was still excitement around the Maple Leafs, who in 1993 made their best Stanley Cup playoff run since winning their last Stanley Cup in 1967. But that excitement was temporarily deflated. The Blue Jays had been drawing four million fans per year and had won back-to-back World Series. They would not have made the post-season that year, as the New York Yankees were running away with the division and the wild card was a long shot. But there was still a buzz about the National League Expos, as all baseball fans in Canada wanted the World Series to stay in Canada. There were even conspiracy theories floating around in Canada that Bud Selig and Donald Fehr wanted the season cancelled because it would be better for baseball to lose a World Series than have a third straight in Canada. It wasn’t the first ridiculous sports conspiracy theory, and it was certainly not the last. The attendance at the 1994 Toronto show was a little better than half of what it had been in years past. Like in Montreal, the hardcore collectors were there with their want lists. Sales of new wax boxes were flat, but stronger than they were in Montreal. The number of collectors who travelled to Toronto from the United States, most notably from Buffalo, Boston and Detroit, was way down. The corporate booths were still there, but on a much smaller scale. About 30 miles away along the QEW, Hamilton was hosting the “4-on-4 Challenge”. It was a four-team tournament of four-on-four hockey featuring the locked out stars. Team Ontario, Team Quebec, Team Western Canada and Team USA played a three-day tournament on the same weekend as the Expo. Patrick Roy, Luc Robitaille, Brett Hull, Doug Gilmour, Joe Sakic and a number of top NHL stars took part in the tournament. The teams wore NHLPA logo uniforms. The tournament raised more than a half million dollars for Ronald McDonald Children’s Charities of Canada and minor hockey associations throughout the country. Wayne Gretzky, meanwhile, was organizing a barnstorming tour of Europe. He joined forces with IMG to create the Ninety-Nine All-Stars Team which spent the first two weeks of December touring Norway, Finland, Sweden and Germany. The 4-on-4 Challenge and the Ninety-Nine All-Stars also found their way onto hockey cards. The Be A Player brand, which started as an NHLPA project with Upper Deck, featured many photos from the tournament. Also included in the 1994-95 Be A Player set was a 19-card insert set called Wayne Gretzky’s 99 All-Stars. The set features photography from the December, 1994 games. Meanwhile at Canadian Sportscard Collector magazine, it seemed like there was a continual daily discussion with my co-worker and close friend Baron Bedeksy about the situation. Who are we going to put on the cover? Our 50th issue fell in November, 1994. We needed to come up with something a little bit different for the issue that would be for sale at the Expo, which was the biggest opportunity of the year to showcase our magazine. At that time, the 1993 seven game semi-final series between the Leafs and the Los Angeles Kings was still talked about. It was one of the greatest NHL playoff series ever. One of the hockey card licensing rules was that fighting was not allowed on cards. In that series, Wendel Clark and Marty McSorley dropped the mitts and had one of the most epic fights in NHL playoff history. Bruce Bennett Studios sent us a great image from the fight. Maybe the card companies couldn’t put fighting on their cards, but we could put it on the cover. The headline was “Why you won’t see this on an NHL hockey card”. During the lockout, we also focused on some future stars. Brett Lindros, the younger brother of Eric Lindros, was a highly touted junior star with the Kingston Frontenacs of the Ontario Hockey League. He had been drafted ninth overall by the New York Islanders. Lindros was destroying junior hockey. In 26 games with Kingston, he had 24 goals and 23 assists for 47 points. Putting him on one of our covers was a slam dunk. Many said he would be just as good as his older brother. He joined the Islanders when the lockout ended. Concussions put an early end to his career. He played only 51 NHL games and scored just two goals. He was a player that many collectors had invested in. Injuries turned him into one of the biggest busts in hockey card history. Pinnacle already had Eric Lindros under contract as a spokesman. Brett spent more than half the 1993-94 season with the Canadian National Team before returning to Kingston. His time with the national team in Canada opened the door for a special insert card in 1993-94 Pinnacle of the Lindros brothers. The other junior cover we did was Jeff O’Neill. He was pictured in his Hartford Whalers jersey from the NHL Draft. The headline was “The Real Deal”. O’Neill had been drafted fifth overall and was in the midst of his second straight monster year with the Guelph Storm of the OHL. O’Neill had a very good NHL career with Hartford, Carolina and Toronto. He is a very popular media personality in Canada and especially in Toronto. He is a Toronto sports radio co-host and is a commentator on Leafs TV broadcasts. He is also on The Sports Network in Canada as a hockey analyst. He is usually on the TSN show as part of their panel of experts from his home office. Behind him on the wall on every episode, several times a week on national TV in Canada, is a framed cover of Canadian Sportscard Collector. I have never met Jeff O’Neill, though several years ago a friend of mine got him to sign a copy of the magazine for me. But seeing that issue on his wall, when I was the one who decided to put him on the cover, picked the photo, and came up with the headline, is pretty cool. I hope I get to meet him some day so I can tell him about what went into that piece of memorabilia on his wall. In January, 1995, the puck dropped and play resumed. The lockout was over.

Sports Collectors Daily,"With Canton Calling, a Look at Adam Vinatieri’s 1997 Pacific Philadelphia Rookie Card",https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/adam-vinatieris-1997-pacific-philadelphia-rookie-card/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 01:30:18 +0000","Only one company put New England's young kicker in its trading card set. Now, Adam Vinatieri's lone rookie card is one of the most sought after of the era.","November 25, 2024 By Horacio Ruiz  He’s the NFL’s all-time leading scorer and a four-time Super Bowl champion. If you’re looking to digest the Adam Vinatieri rookie card checklist, though, it won’t take long. A guy who could soon have a bust in Canton has just one, from a company that no longer exists.  That might tell you how long ago it was. If you think you can pick one up for a buck or two, though, you’re in for a surprise. In his first year of Hall of Fame eligibility, Vinatieri now has an opportunity to become the first ever first-ballot kicker to be inducted. Last week, Vinatieri was one of 25 Modern-Day semifinalists announced by the Pro Football Hall of Fame. While Vinatieri needs to go through two more rounds of cuts, he appears to be a favorite for this year’s class. He is the NFL’s all-time leading scorer, having passed the last kicker inducted into the Hall of Fame, Morten Andersen. Vinatieri was an integral part of the New England Patriots dynasty during the first half of the Tom Brady era, appearing in four Super Bowls and winning three. But Vinatieri made a name for himself by being clutch in high-pressure situations. He was a weapon his teammates could rely on in close games.  Embed from Getty Images During the 2001-02 AFC Divisional Playoffs, Vinatieri kicked the game-tying and game-winning field goals for the Patriots in blizzard-like conditions. Later in those playoffs, as New England marched towards its first title, Vinatieri kicked the game-winning field goal as time expired in Super Bowl XXXVI. Vinatieri would do it again two years later, kicking a game-winning 41-yard field goal in Super Bowl XXXVIII with four seconds remaining as the Patriots claimed their second title in three years. After ten years in New England, Vinatieri signed with the Indianapolis Colts, where he helped win Super Bowl XLI in his first season with the franchise. Embed from Getty Images Vinatieri retired after the 2019 season, and he remains the all-time leader in career field goals made, field goals attempted, consecutive field goals made, and most combined regular-season and postseason games played. There is a valid argument for calling him the greatest placekicker ever. For football card collectors, especially those who focus on Hall of Fame rookie cards, now might be a good time to look at Vinatieri. While Vinatieri started his NFL career as an undrafted free agent in 1996, his lone rookie card (no parallels) is found in the 1997 Pacific Philadelphia football set. Vinatieri is the key card in the set because it was released in May 1997 – too soon to feature the recent draft class and too late to issue any “true” rookie cards. It’s a humble start for a guy who turned out to be an all-time great but something the long defunct Pacific made a habit of doing (see Kurt Warner). Rodney Harrison, a teammate of Vinatieri’s in New England, also has a rookie card in the ’97 Pacific Philadelphia set. He was named a Hall of Fame semifinalist this year after being one of 15 finalists last year. Card #199 shows Vinatieri just after a kickoff, with the Patriots logo in the bottom right corner and his name in gold foil. The back of the card highlights his rookie campaign and highlights from his college career at South Dakota State.  The back discusses his college and pro career to that point.
 PSA has graded the Vinatieri rookie 370 times, with 95 Gem Mint 10s and 151 Mint 9s. Beckett has graded the card 145 times, with one Pristine 10 and 41 Gem Mint 9.5s. Raw cards on eBay are selling for between $50 and $70. The most recent PSA 10 sold for $417 and the most recent PSA 9 sold for $135. It would be two more years before additional cards of Vinatieri would arrive in packs, inside the Triumph set from Collectors Edge. There are no guarantees this will be the year Vinatieri gets inducted. Hall of Fame voting can be unpredictable and, at times, political. But Vinatieri is poised to become the fifth-ever placekicker inducted into the Hall of Fame. Being a semifinalist in his first season of eligibility bodes well for his future chances.

Sports Collectors Daily,Collectors’ Night in NYC Brings Out the Best,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/collectors-night-event-nyc/,"Tue, 26 Nov 2024 01:29:29 +0000","The sixth edition of Collectors Night brought an opportunity for collectors to expand their knowledge, hear stories and see some outstanding memorabilia.","November 25, 2024 By David Seideman  Two blocks from Rockefeller Center’s Christmas tree, the euphoria at a bar upstairs matched the season’s Yuletide spirit. On a November evening in New York, BC Vintage was hosting its sixth Collectors Exchange event. Company founders Chris Brigandi and Chris Caserta invited hobby heavyweights in various memorabilia categories to share insights and stories. About 50 collectors, some traveling long distances, were on hand. Leading off was Andrew Eckert, the director of business operations at Fanatics Live & Fanatics Collect.  Since relaunching PWCC through Fanatics Collect four months ago, the company has been selling 10,000 to 12,000 cards per week. Eckert also touted Fanatics Live, the company’s livestreaming arm where box breaks are conducted by sellers who offer spots in everything from $75 boxes to those that sell for thousands. 2024 Topps Chrome Update breaks with collectors looking for MLB Debut Patch cards–like the well publicized Paul Skenes— has been popular.   “You have his MLB Debut Patch worn on the field in his first game, a pinnacle moment,” Eckart said. “Then you take that patch and he autographs it. Skeenes has become the de facto best chase card in the hobby.” Brigandi asked him what the primary goal is for the company that will eventually own licenses for the NFL and NBA as well as the Topps Company that it now owns.  “Fanatics wants to connect the ecosystem of different kinds of collectors, from the live collector to the pure Topps collectors, through our synergy. It’s the power of all these things.” Since serving as Notre Dame’s Fighting Irish equipment manager in college, Eckhart has become a fervid collector of his alma mater.  He owns every style of the school’s jersey ever worn— 250 in all. Eckhart brought a a green jersey with a blue stripe on the sleeve worn just one game by a punter in 1983, which he bought from a local collector in South Bend.  Each of his four vintage paper ballots for the Heisman Trophy was mailed out to 100 journalists before the digital age, including one from 1956 bearing Hall of Famer Paul Hornung’s name.  On top of that, he asked each living Notre Dame coach for a handwritten play. Lou Holtz complied with a reverse play, detailed by x’s and o’s, that enabled Rocket Ismail to score a touchdown. Khyber Oser, the director of vintage memorabilia and photography at Goldin, co-wrote with Henry Yee, PSA/DNA’s photo authenticator and uber collector Marshall Fogel, the 2002 book that established the “Type” system.  Type 1 original photos of popular sports card images have skyrocketed in value. Original Sports Illustrated photos are some of the hardest to find. Oser showed a 1969 Type 1 photo of Celtics Hall of Famer John Havlicek that graced an SI cover.  As graded magazines gain traction in the hobby, he believes that such photos will attract broader interest (that photo, colorized by SI, is on the auction market now).  “There’s so much more to photos than cards,” Oser said. “They were used for magazines, posters. premiums. postcards. and programs. Babe Ruth photos were on pinbacks (buttons). His underwear box is a Charles Conlon photo. He and other master photographers had secondary usage. Photos are fine art and tell stories. This crossover is what makes photography even more interesting.” Osser held up a Type 1 photo of Mantle’s 1950s M114 Baseball Magazine premium. “If you own the premium, you might want the photo,” he said.  Brigandi shared with Oser and the guests a perfect example of his philosophy.  He acquired a striking 1926 barnstorming poster of Babe Ruth at Oscawana Lake in upstate New York. He was examining with a magnifying glass a Type 1 photo of Babe Ruth giving a trophy to a boy in a baseball uniform.  The trophy had Oscawana Lake stamped on it, making the photo and poster an ideal pair.  In April CCG bought James Spence Authentication to gain a foothold in the autograph business.  The company already authenticated coins, comic books, currency, audio visual games, currency, and sports and non-sports cards. JSA’s founder is still on the job, though.  “I am still authenticating,” Spence said. “I am not playing golf.”  Spence said about 35% of the company’s authentication work is baseball related but the company does everything, including political, entertainment, music and world leaders.  Since Spence launched JSA 19 years ago, he says he has authenticated over one million autographs, including tens of thousands of baseballs. Spence still hand signs the company’s letters of authenticity for virtually everything that has significant value. When it came time to play stump the authenticator, Spence was up the task.  A Cy Young signed ball was quickly rejected. “The ink is way too fresh,” he said. “The ink hasn’t cured or sunk into the leather. The formation is bad. It doesn’t have the sharpness spontaneity. One dead giveaway had nothing to do with the signature itself, though. The printing on the official National League baseball dated to the decade after Young had died in 1955. “This is an outright forgery,” Spence exclaimed. He noted that the three companies whose certification stickers had been applied to the ball had all been banned from eBay.  To someone not familiar with the memorabilia market or autographs in general, it could have been a disastrous purchase.  “This is absolutely authentic,” Spence said after eying a 1968 Jackie Robinson signed check. “I had the pleasure of authenticating every single check when Rachel (Jackie’s widow) sold them to Lelands in the 1990s. She had folders for all of them.” Even a check that has cleared doesn’t necessarily mean the signature is real.  For example, checks from former MLB Players Association chief Marvin Miller many other corporate type checks are stamped.  Many wives and family members of players have also been endorse them.  Thurman Munson, Billy Martin, and Reggie Jackson fit this category; Spence explained. A Babe Ruth signed ball with quote marks around “Babe” was a big whiff.  To save time, Ruth stopped using quote marks around his first name when signing around in 1928 and this ball was from a later period.  The autograph was also off center, another warning sign.  “He hit a sweet spot on 97 percent of all balls.,” Spence said. And there had been other autographs on the ball.  “There’s an abrasion on the north panel,” Spence observed. “Someone tried to turn this into a single-signed ball.” The night’s cleanup hitter for show-and-tell was super collector, Kevin Cohen, who dropped every jaw in the room. His two best pieces, naturally, involved Ruth.  An autographed Ruth on a creamy Harridge ball was authenticated by JSA and also graded a PSA 8. “You can see the autograph clear across the room,” he declared.  Brigandi said it was easily a six-figure baseball. Equally amazing was letterhead from a building where Ruth once lived. He signed it twice, and PSA encapsulated the autographs with a gem mint grade 10. “This shows you’re a true collector,” Brigandi joked.  “An investor would have cut this in half and sold one to pay for the other.” Cohen’s collecting philosophy is simple: “Eye appeal is the first thing. I have yet to lose on quality.  I have batted .1000.  And I never regret paying extra. I buy less.  One, two or three items per year.” The two least valuable show-and-tell items were the most poignant. Spence had brought along the 1968 Topps Mickey Mantle he pulled from a pack at a candy store back that year. After having Mantle sign it in 1990, Spence kept it in his wallet until it became thoroughly wrinkled. It was the first autographed card CCG authenticated when it bought Spence’s company. Spence then shared his Little League baseball from Englewood, NJ in 1970. when his dad was the coach.  Looking at the names, he ruefully recalled a teammate who was stabbed to death in town at age 15. Another name was Warren Moore, a rap music pioneer. The autograph guru’s parting gift was a pearl of wisdom. “If he is still alive, have your father sign a baseball,” he said. My father, who passed away suddenly in 2005, and I were best friends. We attended countless baseball games together in several cities and I dragged him to card shows. One of my prized possessions is a foul ball he caught at Ebbets Field and dated “7/44.”  It never occurred to me to have him sign it. What a great idea that would have been.

Sports Collectors Daily,1908-09 Ogden Pugilists and Wrestlers a Landmark Combat Set,https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/1908-09-ogden-pugilists-and-wrestlers-a-landmark-combat-set/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 23:43:33 +0000","The Ogden Pugilists and Wrestlers set includes stars, a high number series, and a legendary rookie card.","November 25, 2024 By Anson Whaley  When it comes to early boxing card sets, few are as collectible as the 1908-09 Ogden Pugilists and Wrestlers set. No, these aren’t the earliest cards depicting the sport. There are several 19th century boxing sets that hold more prestige and value. Other sets, too, were released around the same time as this one. In particular, the T219 Champions, T220 Prizefighters, and T225 Prize Fight series’ were all distributed just afterwards and are popular targets. But there are several reasons why this foreign set is a landmark release that is attainable to collectors. While the majority of UK cigarette cards didn’t hit the market until the 1920s and 1930s, there are still a large number of sets available before that time. The 1908-09 Ogden Pugilists and Wrestlers set is one of those. Ogden’s, a famous cigarette brand in the UK, actually distributed several boxing series’, starting in 1901 and lasting into the 1920s. However, their 1908-09 Pugilists and Wrestlers set might be the most popular of those releases. The set is broken up into two series’. The first series was issued in 1908 and features cards No. 1-50. A shorter (and rarer) second series was distributed in 1909 for cards No. 51-75. It is worth pointing out that part of the reason the first series cards are seen more often is that some were actually reprinted in 1909 as well. While cards No. 1-25 are only believed to have been printed in 1908, cards No. 26-50 were also printed into 1909 (these have a strong white back as opposed to ones more off-white in color). The cards’ appearance is almost Allen & Ginter Champions-like in nature. Fronts feature color lithographs of subjects against all white backgrounds, similar to those popular American-issued N28 and N29 multi-sport cards that preceded them by about 30 years. There are three things in particular that make these cards highly collectible, even in addition to the outstanding artwork. First, the cards are somewhat easy to find. While American collectors were probably not too familiar with them in the pre-internet days, they are now found online quite easily. eBay is a great starting point for these cards, yes. But vintage dealers online from the UK, or even America, are good places to look, too. You are not too likely to stumble upon them at your local card shop. These are, after all, boxing cards more than a century year old. Still, online shopping makes finding them much easier. eBay often has a few hundred listings available. The cards, too, are pretty affordable. I’ll cover cost a bit later, but the majority of this set can be built quite reasonably. Finally, the checklist includes fighters from many years up until that point. Ogden didn’t just include current boxers. The roster goes all the way back to the days of bare knuckle fighters in the 19th century. The set is headlined by plenty of Hall of Famers and stars, including John Sullivan, James Jeffries, Joe Gans, Sam Langford, and more. And in addition to those, true to the name of the set, cards of early wrestlers are included, too. The highlights there are early cards of Hall of Famers and early champions Frank Gotch and Georges Hackenschmidt. If you’re building the set, don’t underestimate the wrestling subset. Several of those cards are desirable and Gotch’s card is one of the most valuable in either series. As if all of that isn’t enough, the set also includes a pair of key rookie cards.  Baseball card collectors have been drawn to the set in recent years by the presence of Abe Attell. Attell was famously a conspirator in the 1919 World Series scandal involving the Chicago White Sox. While Attell has plenty of other boxing cards, this one is important as it is viewed as his rookie. The real headliner, however, is the card of Hall of Famer Jack Johnson. Similar to Attell’s, while other Johnson cards command interest, this one has the added benefit of being a rookie card. Johnson, for the record, does have at least one other rookie. That one is found in James Jeffries’ 1909 playing card set, as I wrote a while back. But this one not only pictures Johnson on his own, it also comes in a more traditional card set. Of the two, his Ogden card is by more desirable to most collectors. A final note here is that the cards bear a strong resemblance to another boxing set that Ogden released a few years later in 1915. While the checklist is different, the cards can easily appear to be in the same set. The 1915 Ogden Boxers cards have similar fronts and even feature the same sorts of images — boxer headshots. The have the same Ogden’s Cigarettes title at the top and the same capital letter font for the names at the bottom. They could easily be mistaken for a third series of sorts. However, they are easily separated by the backs. Even though the backs also have a similar style, the 1915 cards are titled ‘Boxers’ instead of ‘Pugilists and Wrestlers.’ That set is also not nearly as heavily traded as it contains fewer stars than the earlier Pugilists and Wrestlers issue. As mentioned earlier, the cards aren’t too difficult to find if you know where to look online. However, finding them out ‘in the wild’ in person is a much more difficult task. While they are not scarce, they can be tricky to find at shops or even card shows. Prices, however, are often collector friendly. If interested in acquiring a set, a collector’s best bet is to buy the cards in lots. While individual commons from the first series often are sold in the $5-$10 range, in lots, it is possible to find them at times for closer to $2-$3 a card in lesser condition. The stars, of course, are a bit more. Cards, too, in the higher-numbered second series usually often are closer to $10-$15. But even the most expensive cards can fit into many collector budgets. Attell’s aforementioned card is still a relative bargain, usually starting around $25. The card of Gotch the wrestler is typically the second most valuable card, starting around $50-$100. Johnson’s rookie, of course, is the most valuable. And while nicer examples are not cheap, low-grade raw examples can be found for as little as $150-$250. Complete sets, particularly with both series’, are rare. However, on occasion you can find them available. Complete first series’ are more readily seen than the second series with Johnson’s rookie and the high-numbered Gotch card often pulled out and sold separately. There are usually a few hundred listings for the 1908-09 Ogden Pugilists and Wrestlers on eBay.

Sports Collectors Daily,"5 Early Roki Sasaki Cards to Consider, Hottest Auctions",https://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/5-early-roki-sasaki-cards-to-consider/,"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 05:12:09 +0000","As MLB and collectors await his arrival, here's a look at some of the more popular early Roki Sasaki baseball cards.","November 24, 2024 By Brendan Cross  The talent pipeline between Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan and Major League Baseball continues to bear fruit. Roki Sasaki, a 23-year-old pitching phenom from the Chiba Lotte Marines, will be posted by his team and will sign a contract with an MLB team prior to the 2025 season.  Who he will be playing for is yet to be determined, but interest in Sasaki’s earliest baseball cards has been heating up with teams lining up to try and sign him.  Sasaki did not complete six seasons in the NPB, which means he is entering the MLB as an amateur and is not eligible to sign a contract to the tune of Yoshinobu Yamamoto’s 12-year $365 million pact with the Los Angeles Dodgers last December. According to a Baseball America article by J.J. Cooper, Sasaki will essentially be signing a minor league contract and will not reach arbitration until his third season in the major leagues. Shohei Ohtani also took this route when he signed with the Angels prior to the 2018 season. To call Sasaki the Paul Skenes of Japan is not the best comparison. Yes, the Japanese fireballer has a triple-digit fastball and is only six months older than Skenes. But the lanky 6’2” righthander has a great command, a filthy splitter and a wipeout slider that is more Jacob deGrom than it is Paul Skenes. Regardless of those or any other comparisons, Sasaki is on his way to the majors and is already the most talked about free agent pitcher available. Is Sasaki as good of a pitcher as Ohtani or Yamamoto, or maybe Kodai Senga or Shota Imanaga? Consider that he made his debut at the age of 19 in 2021 and was immediately a dominant pitcher. In 2022, he pitched a perfect game with 19 strikeouts, which tied the NPB record. In that game, he set a new NPB record by fanning 13 in a row. In his next start, he went eight perfect innings but was pulled before the ninth due to pitch count concerns. In 2023, the world had a chance to see Sasaki on a big stage. In the World Baseball Classic, he pitched 7.2 innings and struck out 11. In the semi-final against a strong Mexican team, Sasaki averaged 100.5 mph with his fastball. The obvious impact that Sasaki will have on the hobby is that he will be one of the most sought after rookies in 2025. He is not the only high-profile rookie who will have his Major League baseball card debut next year, but he will be in high demand. Sales of Sasaki’s Japanese cards and those produced in conjunction with the World Baseball Classic have skyrocketed since late October. Over 500 listings sold on eBay November 9 when news of his pending arrival heated up. Ten cards have sold for $1,000 or more this month on the platform. Sasaki’s earliest trading cards date back to 2020, as he was featured in several top Japanese sports card sets from brands like BBM and Calbee. Here’s a handful of Sasaki’s best NPB and pre-MLB cards. 2020 BBM 1st Version #104

Collectors seem to consider this to be Sasaki’s best NPB card to own. It’s the flagship equivalent to what will eventually be his 2025 Topps Series 1 or Series 2 rookie card and is his first professional card.  BBM began producing cards for the NPB in 1991. PSA 10 versions of the card have been selling for $400 and up while raw copies are pushing north of $100. There are facsimile autographed versions as well. 2020 Calbee #94  Another leading card brand in Japan, this 2020 Calbee base card features the high leg kick of Sasaki while the card design itself has rounded corners. It may not be as sought after by collectors when compared to the BBM counterpart, but visually it’s a must add to any budding Sasaki collection. PSA 10 copies have moved close to $200 with nice raw copies less than half of that. 2021 Topps Chrome NPB #194 
Topps got into the NPB card game with a 2021 Topps Chrome set that featured a few future MLB players such as Seiya Suzuki, Shota Imanaga and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, along with Sasaki. The 2021 Topps MLB chrome set featured the same classic chrome design. It’s Sasaki’s first true Topps card and will surely continue to be a grail card in many collections. Along with the base version, a full range of parallels from Refractor to the 1/1 SuperFractor make these some of the best Sasaki cards to consider. There are no recent sales of numbered versions of this card, but a base PSA 10 sold for $168 on November 14. 2022 Bowman NPB Chrome #133 
In 2022, Topps released a Bowman NPB product featuring paper and chrome cards. This product has an equally large parallel rainbow to build and chase as the 2021 Topps Chrome NPB product. I love the large stride that is captured by Sasaki in this card, large enough to go off the card on both sides. There is also something special about Sasaki having a Bowman card. While he is an NPB professional in this card, as far as the MLB is concerned, he is essentially a prospect. A PSA 10 version of this card sold for $73 on November 14, making it nearly $100 cheaper than its Topps Chrome NPB counterpart. 2023 Topps Series 2 World Baseball Classic #WBC-34

The World Baseball Classic subset in 2023 Topps Series 2 is a highly collectible insert set that features stars who participated in the most recent world tournament. Sasaki was overshadowed by Shohei Ohtani’s performance both on the mound and at the dish, but it was the first time the international stage got to see Sasaki pitch, and he did not disappoint. Base versions of this card are selling for between $8-$10 dollars while numbered parallels will fetch significantly more. Topps also produced a standalone set for the last WBC and you can find Sasaki there, too. Card #21 has a base card and an image variation with each having multiple parallel versions.

The black jerseys have broad horizontal crimson stripes with white borders running around the chest and back and around each sleeve. The front of the jersey features a new alternate logo depicting a G inside a roundel with a lightning bolt stretching across and forming the crossbar. “GUELPH” is written out in the roundel above the bolt, while “STORM” is written out below.

The shoulders of the jersey also have a new logo that was first seen in the May trademark filing. It’s a stylized S, with the top half swirling around a puck and the bottom half turning into a lightning bolt. This logo was also at centre ice at the Sleeman Centre in Guelph for the Storm’s annual Pink the Rink night, which was held on November 16. Both new logos were created by late designer Keith Flynn of Flynnagain Productions when the Storm underwent a redesign in 2017. The numbers on the back and sleeves of the new jersey are white with crimson and metallic silver outlines, while names on the back are one-colour white. The jersey will be paired with black helmets, black gloves and black socks with the same crimson and white stripes found on the sleeves and chest. Merchandise with the new logos is now available through the Storm’s online shop. Replica jerseys are not available, though, “due to league-wide shipping issues.” The last time the Storm had an alternate jersey was in the 2010-11 season, when they wore a retro design from the 1951-52 season honoring the Biltmore Mad Hatters. Named for the Biltmore Hat Factory in Guelph, the team won the city’s first Memorial Cup in 1952 with a team that featured four future Hockey Hall of Fame inductees."

The ECHL affiliates of the Minnesota Wild based in Coralville, Iowa, are celebrating their home state’s proud tradition of pork production on Saturday, November 30, when they host the Bloomington Bison on “Crispy Bacon Night.” And the themed uniforms that the Heartlanders will wear for the game are something else. The Heartlanders unveiled the uniforms on their social media channels on Wednesday, November 27, calling them “horrendously perfect.” The jerseys, pants and socks combine to give the overall effect of a pig farmer wearing denim overalls. The jersey itself has a pink and grey plaid pattern on the sleeves and the upper chest for the farmer’s collared shirt. The denim overalls cover most of the chest and back. On the front of the jersey, the Heartlanders’ primary logo sits on the pocket of the overalls in the middle of the chest. Several strips of bacon poke out of that same pocket. The shoulders of the jersey depict the straps and buckles of the overalls. Sponsor logos are overlaid on the shoulders and the right chest. The pants and socks both have a blue denim pattern, completing the overalls look, with darker pockets on the back of the pants. The numbers on the back and sleeves are pink with black outlines and set in the Heartlanders’ usual font. Nameplates are black with white lettering. Under the number on the back, a pink curly pig’s tail pokes out from the overalls. According to the Heartlanders, there are more pigs (23 million) in Iowa than people (4 million), so a pork-and-bacon-themed night is a perfect fit. Along with the jerseys, the Heartlanders will be handing out thundersticks designed to look like bacon strips, and they’ll host a bacon-themed pregame party at the nearby Hyatt Hotel Exhibit Hall. Your Crispy Bacon experience doesn’t end when you walk in the door… in fact, it’s just beginning and will carry over into the game, with specialty concessions, in-game bacon activities, and pork eating contests.  This is sure to be be one of the most unique nights in Heartlanders history.  Game-worn jerseys are being auctioned off through Dash, with bids closing at 7:45 p.m. CT on Saturday. Puck drop between the Heartlanders and Bison is set for 6 p.m. CT Saturday at the Xtream Arena in Coralville. If you want to see these jerseys in person, tickets are still available through the Heartlanders’ website."

Blueberries are on this year's Thanksgiving table! pic.twitter.com/353QACAseF Surprisingly, the Detroit Lions are not one of them, as they will instead wear their standard silver helmets, Honolulu blue home jerseys and Honolulu blue pants when they host the Chicago Bears on Thursday afternoon. This will mark the fourth appearance for this combination since the Lions unveiled new uniforms this offseason, including victories over the Los Angeles Rams on Sept. 8, Tennessee Titans on Oct. 27 and Jacksonville Jaguars on Nov. 17. It’s worth noting they still have the throwback uniform at their disposal, though they may be saving it for a late-season NFC North matchup, just like they did during the 2021 and 2022 seasons. dressin' up for the holiday 👔#NYGvsDAL | @AveryDennison pic.twitter.com/GE9aRUlCB5 The Dallas Cowboys, meanwhile, will wear their 1960s throwback uniforms – which feature white helmets, blue jerseys with stars on the shoulders and white pants – for the third straight Thanksgiving Day game when they host the New York Giants.  This look, which mimics their original design, was originally worn every Thanksgiving from 2004 until the NFL implemented its one-helmet rule in 2013. It then returned for a Thanksgiving victory over the Giants in 2022, as well as last year’s win over the Washington Commanders. Throwback threads for Thanksgiving 🦃 pic.twitter.com/KgAQwBC1Fl Finally, the Miami Dolphins will wear the road version of their 1966 throwback uniforms, which are complete with a traditional striping pattern on the sleeves and a vintage logo on the sides of their helmets, when they travel to Green Bay to take on the Packers. The Dolphins are 2-3 in the road version of their throwback uniforms since they were added to the rotation in 2019, though this will mark just the time they’re being worn away from home, joining a loss at the Pittsburgh Steelers that season. It will also mark the Dolphins’ second time wearing throwback uniforms on Thanksgiving Day, as they wore a similar design during a blowout victory over the Cowboys in 2003.

There’s just certain things that go together – the turkey, the family, tradition and football.” Madden, who passed away in 2021 at the age of 85, went 103-32-7 as the head coach of the Oakland Raiders from 1969-78. He led the franchise to eight playoff appearances, including a 32-14 win over the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bow XI. After he retired from coaching, Madden ventured into broadcasting and served as the color analyst for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. He notably called 20 Thanksgiving Day games during his career, which also saw him become the namesake of EA Sports’ NFL video game. The league also honored Madden in 2022 by painting his signature on the 25-yard line on Thanksgiving Day, while players wore a helmet decal that depicted the iconic image of him with his fist in the air as he was carried off the field following the aforementioned Super Bowl victory."

The team posted a message to fans on their website and social media channels on Tuesday, November 26. In it, they say they are launching “a deliberate process through which we will seek out, listen to, and reflect on input about our team name from fans, supporters, and a group of advisors assembled to reflect a diverse range of voices and perspectives.” We appreciate you pushing us to be the best we can be.  To learn more about our process and share your thoughts, please visit: https://t.co/2Ae5eamAnI pic.twitter.com/pfuBI1XMUp We want to assure you that we have heard your feedback and are actively listening. We share your high expectations, and together, we will build a storied club that reflects the essence of the beautiful game and the character of our dynamic city. The “BOS Nation” moniker was originally chosen in part because the letters could be rearranged to spell “Bostonian.” “It starts with ‘Bostonian’ — those nine letters that make up that word are so meaningful to those of us that come from there,” controlling owner Jennifer Epstein told CBS in October. “When you rearrange those letters you get BOS Nation, and that was very intentional. This team is fan-centric, fans first, and our new identity is made up of the diverse communities that live in our strong city and have a love — or will soon have a love — of the beautiful game.” The team also launched two wordmark logos at the time, both of which used a color scheme of green and black with pink accents. It was unclear at the time if these were intended to appear on kits or if another crest would be forthcoming. This commitment remains clear: to create a Club that represents the strength, diversity, and passion of this community, and that starts with the team’s name. Here’s how we’re leading the charge: • Hosting Dedicated Forums and Opportunities to Listen: Engaging with fans, women’s sports advocates, former players, and Boston leaders. We’ve already begun hosting sessions and welcome suggestions for groups and individuals we should include here. • Assembling Brand Advisors:  We’ve identified a diverse group of voices to guide and shape our future and welcome additional nominations here. • Listening to Your Feedback: We have read, archived, and are now studying, all feedback provided to date. We welcome you to continue to share your thoughts through this quick form. No matter what the name ends up being, Boston’s NWSL franchise is slated to begin play in the 2026 season. They’ll play their home games at White Stadium, a 10,519-seat facility in historic Franklin Park that recently underwent a $30-million renovation. The team’s ownership group includes Hollywood actor/producer/director Elizabeth Banks and Team USA Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman. No related stories."

The Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) and Puma announced the new deal on Wednesday, November 27. The contract is effective January 1, 2025, and formally brings to an end the FPF’s partnership with Nike, who had been producing kits for Portugal since 1997. The deal with Puma covers all of Portugal’s men’s, women’s and youth national teams, along with the FPF’s futsal, beach football and E-Sports teams. “Signing a top-tier national team was one of our priorities in football and I am very excited to welcome a team as popular as Portugal to the Puma Family,” said Puma CEO Arne Freundt in the company’s press release. “Given the large number of fans all over the world and the great potential of the next generation of this squad, we are looking forward to the upcoming big tournaments such as the 2026 World Cup.” Portugal is also one of three host nations for the 2030 FIFA World Cup, along with Spain and Morocco. While Puma has never made kits for Portugal before, the company did partner with legendary Portuguese player Eusébio in the 1960s. Known as “O Rei” (“The King”), Eusébio and Puma collaborated on the iconic Puma King football boot. Eusébio was the top scorer in the 1966 FIFA World Cup, in which Portugal finished third. “We were attracted to PUMA because of the way in which they engage with the fans and tell the unique story of every team they work with,” said FPF president Fernando Gomes in the press release. “We look forward to creating an exciting range of products with them which will resonate with our large fan base all over the world.” During their time with Nike, Portugal won the 2016 European Championship and the 2018-19 UEFA Nations League. Their best showing at a FIFA World Cup during that stretch was a fourth-place finish in 2006. Puma will unveil the first of its new FPF products in early 2025."

On Thursday, November 21, the Guinea Football Federation (Feguifoot) lodged a formal complaint with the Confederation of African Football (CAF) over their men’s national team’s 1-0 loss to Tanzania two days before. That win vaulted Tanzania to second place in Group H of the 2025 African Cup of Nations qualification round — one point ahead of Guinea — and secured their spot in the tournament finals, to be held from December 21, 2025, to January 18, 2026, in Morocco. Feguifoot contends that Tanzanian substitute Ibrahim Ame was listed as number 24 on the official teamsheet for the match, but when he entered the game in the 73rd minute, Ame was wearing number 26 on his shirt. “Therefore … the player in question was not eligible to take part in the match,” Feguifoot’s press release reads (translated to English by Google). “By bringing this player into the game in the 73rd minute with this number 26, Tanzania therefore used an unqualified player.” “The situation was all the more serious because the absence of a listed number was combined with the absence of a name on the jersey, making it de facto impossible to verify the player’s identity,” they add. Feguifoot has asked the CAF to award the win and the three points to Guinea, which would mean they would qualify for the AFCON finals instead of Tanzania. Tanzania scored their goal in the 61st minute of the match, before Ame came on as a substitute. The Tanzanian Football Federation (TFF) responded on their Facebook page, saying their players “were checked by the opposing team and the Commissioner where they were allowed to play” (translated to English by Google). “(The) TFF does not have any information from the Confederation of African Football (CAF) that Ame’s participation in the match was illegal.” Feguifoot’s release also alleges that the kickoff time for the game — which was held in Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania — was unfairly moved ahead three hours, forcing players to play in extreme heat with only 48 hours’ notice of the change. It also noted that the match commissioner and security officer were both from Kenya, a country that borders Tanzania. Both nations are also part of the Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations (CECAFA) Zonal Union. The CAF has yet to make a ruling on the formal complaint."

Coming soon to Milan Puskar Stadium 👀 pic.twitter.com/lfWGg27Pd8 A gold Flying “WV” will still be prominently featured at the 50-yard line, just like it has been since the 1997 season, when West Virginia moved away from the state outline and a smaller Flying “WV” at midfield. However, the Mountaineers have replaced the wordmarks in the navy blue end zones and the yard-line numbers with their current typeface, which was introduced in 2019, while two parallel stripes also flank the wordmarks. The stripes are reminiscent of the pants stripes on West Virginia’s uniforms, which were revealed prior to this season. The stripes were a staple under Hall of Fame head coach Don Nehlen from 1980-93 and were used on their “Country Roads” alternate uniforms in 2022 and 2023. Lastly, the out-of-bounds area behind the end zones and down the sidelines to the designated team areas at the 25-yard line is now navy blue. The sidelines and out-of-bounds area behind the end zones have been white since 1988. This marks the first update to the turf at Milan Puskar Stadium since 2016, when – according to our friend Ethan Dimitroff of the Mountaineer Uniform Database — West Virginia increased the size of the Flying “WV” and changed the placement of the Big XII logos to the 25-yard lines.

In doing so, however, the Chargers may have accidentally revealed their plans to unveil a navy blue alternate helmet – which would be worn with their navy blue Color Rush uniforms – ahead of next season. The Chargers have paired their navy blue Color Rush uniforms, which feature a single-color lightning bolt on the shoulders and pants, with their standard white helmets since their current uniform design was unveiled in 2020. They simply swap the powder blue and gold lightning bolt decals, powder blue numbers and gold facemasks for navy blue and gold lightning bolt decals, navy blue numbers and navy blue facemasks to complete the look. dark mode activated pic.twitter.com/K4a1qez9Dl The reason for this is the NFL’s one-helmet rule, though the league has since relaxed that rule, allowing teams to introduce a second or third shell to their closet. The Chargers are among a handful of teams that have not yet taken advantage it. But if the promotional photos that were shared on social media by the Chargers and the skate club are any indication, they could soon have a navy blue helmet with single-color lightning bolt, gold numbers and navy blue facemask at their disposal. That said, a closer inspection of the photoshoot suggests the navy blue helmet is nothing more than a display piece from the Chargers’ facility, as it is a Riddell Speed with interior padding that is consistent with full-size collectible helmets. There’s also the presence of a large white warning sticker on the back, which typically states, “This replica helmet is for display only. It is not designed or intended for use as a protective helmet. Do not wear this helmet.” You can also see the sticker on the inside. Compare those features to the white helmet, which is an authentic Vicis Zero2 and includes other details such as the Chargers’ front and back bumpers, as well as the American flag, NFL shield and a warning label that lists the potential dangers of playing football. Now, that’s not to say the Chargers won’t eventually unveil a navy blue alternate helmet. After all, they scrapped their royal blue Color Rush uniforms this season – and, if you’re going to add another helmet, you might as well maximize the amount of times it can be worn each season. But given the information we shared above, it would be a stretch to constitute this as a leak at this time. Of course, we’ll keep you posted anything changes, seeing as we’ve been on top of the alternate and throwback helmet news for the last two seasons.

In July 2024, Leicester City announced it had signed a sponsorship deal — one of the most valuable in its history, the club said at the time — with BC.Game, an online cryptocurrency gaming platform. The site’s logo has appeared on the front of the Leicester City men’s first team jerseys since the 2024-25 Premier League season began in August. But BC.Game’s financial health has been seriously questioned lately. According to iGamingBusiness, bankruptcy petitions were filed in October against the site’s former owner, Blockdance, and its current parent company, Small House, in Curaçao, the Caribbean island nation where BC.Game is licensed. These petitions were filed by The Foundation for the Representation of Victims of Online Gaming and allege Small House has failed to pay out more than $2 million in player winnings since acquiring the site in February 2024. In a statement dated November 21, 2024, BC.Game says the allegations “lack substantive evidence and fail to demonstrate any violations by our platform.” The allegations lack sufficient supporting evidence, with many claims based solely on unverified statements. Our internal investigations have revealed discrepancies in the cases cited by the plaintiffs, with most accusations lacking a clear legal or technical basis. We affirm that BC.GAME has adhered to industry compliance standards in all relevant operations. The statement also raises concerns about lawyers’ conduct in the case and inconsistencies in the case evidence. For their part, Leicester City also released a statement of support for BC.Game: “We have been and continue to be in regular discussions with BC.Game with regard to an active legal case in Curacao. BC.Game have provided the Club with the strongest assurances that they are actively appealing this case, and that the process which has been initiated in Curacao is administrative in nature and has not arisen due to any concerns with their financial standing. “BC.Game have further assured us that they have no issues with liquidity and that they remain fully committed to meeting their ongoing contractual and financial obligations, including to the Club, and that this case will not impact on BC.Game’s continuing international operations.” Should BC.Game not be able to fulfill their deal with Leicester City, it wouldn’t be the first time in recent memory that a cryptocurrency firm has had to terminate a sponsorship contract early. Late in the 2022-23 season, Italian clubs AS Roma and Inter Milan both dropped their front-of-shirt sponsor, blockchain company DigitalBits, over missed contract payments. AC Milan played in blank shirts for a few games before securing streaming service Paramount+ as a new sponsor for the final match of the Serie A season and the UEFA Champions League final. AS Roma, meanwhile, played the rest of the season with the initials “SPQR” on their shirts. The acronym stands for “Senatus PopulusQue Romanus” (“The Senate and the People of Rome”) and it also “appears on Roman currency, at the end of documents made public by an inscription in stone or metal, and in dedications of monuments and public and civil works,” according to Wikipedia. The full phrase “appears in Roman political, legal, and historical literature.”"

The team released a branding guide to explain the colors (the namesake fish and a summer sunrise over Lake Michigan), primary mark (an aggressive fish defending its territory) and ancillary elements (baseball stitches that look like seagulls, Milwaukee’s “People’s Flag,” and the year of the team’s founding). The new brand has been a long time coming. “The Nook Nation alternate brand has been years in the making,” Chinooks GM Eric Snodgrass said in a statement. “We wanted an alternate and fresh look that we could use on occasions through the off-season and during the summer while still keeping our classic branding as our primary look. From the different unique elements in the logos to the new color palette, we think the new brand will be a great representation of our fan base in the Northshore and the Milwaukee metro area.”  Per the team, the Chinooks fanbase has called itself by the nickname Nook Nation since 2013.    The fish in the logo is an updated version of the chinook (a kind of salmon) reflected in the team’s original logo. The Nook Nation brand will be seen on the fields of Northwoods League teams across the upper midwest beginning in May 2025."

The Federación Mexicana de Futbol (FMF) announced on Friday, November 22, that they had extended their kit contract with German sportswear giant Adidas for another 10 years, “seeking to continue building memorable stories alongside the players; but above all, with the help of the fans,” according to a press release (translated to English by Google). “For the FMF it is an honor that adidas continues to be part of our history for 10 more years. This collaboration is based on shared values ​​to which adidas has shown a deep commitment, such as respect for our culture, traditions and passion for soccer. We are sure that the renewal will continue to inspire generations of Mexicans to proudly wear the colors of our National Team,” said FMF executive president Ivar Sisniega. “For adidas, being on the side of Mexican soccer has always been important; being part of the process of achieving success is becoming increasingly important today, and in this sense, we are happy to continue being part of this path. We are convinced that the triumphs will come and will be memories that will be close to the hearts of soccer fans forever, not just for the next ten years,” added Adidas Mexico general manager Jorge Dionne. The new contract will cover the 2026, 2030 and 2034 FIFA World Cups. The FMF first partnered with Adidas in 1984, and that contract lasted until 1990. Mexico kits were then produced by various companies like Umbro, ABA Sport, Garcis and Atletica until 2003, when the FMF signed a contract with Nike. In 2007, Mexico partnered up with Adidas once again, and that relationship that lasted ever since.

The new look maintains the popular bee character, a staple in the minor league baseball landscape since 2006, while updating the typography and adding some alternate identities. The new type, which is included in the primary logo and the interlocking cap logo, is meant to allude to the sting of a bee. The interlocking SL cap logo pre-dates the Bees in Salt Lake City, with previous teams in the city like the Gulls and the Trappers using a version of the baseball custom in the 1970s and ’80s. New alternate identities pay tribute to the state of Utah, including one that features the state outline with the word Bees set in a descending staircase that evokes a classic logo from the team’s parent club, the Los Angeles Angels. Another alternate pays homage to the Beehive State with a beehive icon. If you’ve driven through Utah, you’ll know this symbol from the state’s highway signs. Yet another alternate sets pair of crossed bats within a honeycomb, with icons of a baseball and the state of Utah set opposite the letters S and L. The new Bees look pays tribute to teams from the early 20th century with a recreation of a bee illustration on uniforms from the 1920s. The team unveiled a series of wordmarks derived from their new custom typography. The Bees, affiliates of the Los Angeles Angels in the International League, played their final game at Smith’s Ballpark September 22. Next season the team will play in South Jordan, about 20 miles south Salt Lake City, at brand-new Daybreak Field."

About two weeks after the conclusion of the 2024 Korean Series in late October, the KBO League team based in Daejeon, South Korea, unveiled a new suite of logos and uniforms for 2025. While the orange remains in their colour palette from previous seasons, it is now complemented by a dark shade of navy blue instead of black.

Both identities were created by designer Matthew Wolff. The wordmarks include one in cursive script and one in all caps. Both were “developed with the motif of an eagle’s beak and talons,” the team said on social media. The cursive script—used in the primary logo and on both the white home and orange alternate uniforms—is “a modern reinterpretation of the logo from the championship days,” when the Eagles won their only Korean Series in 1999. Also included in the new suite is an eagle head logo with lightning bolts in the neck. This logo doesn’t appear on the Eagles’ new uniforms, but it is used on their website, on team merchandise, and on a flag that was used in the photo shoots for the new uniforms. The Eagles’ white home uniforms feature the scripted wordmark in one-colour orange, while the front number is navy blue. The corporate wordmark of the Hanwha Group — a worldwide conglomerate based in Korea that deals in everything from energy to finance — appears in orange on the left shoulder. A single orange stripe runs down each side of the pants. The grey away uniforms have slightly darker grey pinstripes and a navy blue all-caps wordmark on the front, along with an orange front number. A navy blue stripe runs down each side of the pants. The Eagles also unveiled two alternate jerseys, one orange and one navy blue. The orange one has a navy blue script wordmark and a white front number, while the navy blue one has a white all-caps wordmark and a white front number. The navy alternate is also the only one where the unveiling photos showed a clear view of the back; in this case, the player name is one-colour white, while the number is one-colour orange. The Eagles’ social media announcement pictured all four jerseys with the same cap or batting helmet, which has a navy blue base and an orange script “E” on the front. Along with the Eagles and Twins, Wolff has done design work for Major League Soccer’s Chicago Fire and Los Angeles Football Club; New York/New Jersey Gotham FC, Racing Louisville, San Diego Wave FC and Angel City FC of the National Women’s Soccer League; and USL clubs like Louisville City, Union Omaha and FC Tulsa. He also worked on the typography as part of the rebranding of the National Basketball Association’s Los Angeles Clippers, which was unveiled in February 2024. The Hanwha Eagles joined the KBO League in 1986 as the Binggrae Eagles, as Binggrae was the name of Hanwha’s confectionary branch. They changed their name in 1993 when Binggrae separated from the Hanwha conglomerate. They won their only Korean Series championship in 1999 but have been runners-up five times (1988, 1989, 1991, 1992, 2006)."

Michigan players tried to plant an ""M""  flag on the ""Block O"" after a stunning 13-10 victory against No. 2 Ohio State on Saturday. Several Buckeyes left the post-game tradition of singing ""Carmen Ohio"" to quite literally meet the Wolverines at midfield. Per the Ohio State Police, ""multiple officers representing Ohio and Michigan used pepper spray.""  Following the game, officers from multiple law enforcement agencies assisted in breaking up an on-field altercation. During the scuffle, multiple officers representing Ohio and Michigan deployed pepper spray. OSUPD is the lead agency for games & will continue to investigate. ""I don't know all the details of it, but I know these guys were looking to put a flag on our field and our guys were not going to let that happen,"" Day said. ""We're embarrassed of the fact we lost, but there are some prideful guys on our team that weren't going to let that happen.""  The ugly scene marred the latest upset that will be etched into The Game rivalry lore, but it is a distraction from the main talking point. Michigan planted the same flag at Ohio Stadium two years after a 45-23 victory on Nov. 26, 2022, but that was a top-five team celebrating its first win in The Shoe since 2000. This was without question the Buckeyes' most embarrassing loss to the Wolverines over the last four years.  The post-game fight is a distraction from the newly posed psychological test for Ohio State (10-2, 7-2), which lost the most important game of the season and now has to prepare for a run in the first 12-team College Football Playoff.  Day – now 1-4 vs. Michigan – was left without an answer to what comes next after a loss in an all-in game against the Wolverines. Maybe that is because he simply does not have an answer for Michigan.  ""I don't know,"" Day said. ""We're fresh off The Game. I don't really have the answer to that. We're very disappointed. Never thought this would happen right here.""  To be fair, few people did. The Buckeyes were three-score favorites. Michigan quarterback Davis Warren was 9 of 16 for 62 yards and two second-half interceptions to Ohio State standouts Caleb Downs and Jack Sawyer. That line alone would indicate a Buckeyes' win.  Who had a 10-10 game at half? The Wolverines shutting out Ohio State in the second half? An upset that resembled the 14-9 shocker on Nov. 23, 1996 that was part of the lineage of John Cooper losses to inferior Michigan teams? And we're talking about planting a flag at midfield?  What about the game plan? Ohio State continued to try to hammer at a Michigan run defense that featured future first-round picks Mason Graham and Kenneth Grant. Day seems hyper-obsessed with showing how tough the Buckeyes are in these big-game environments, especially against Notre Dame and Michigan. Ohio State had 26 carries for 77 yards. It was an imperfect balance with Will Howard – who was 19 of 33 for 175 yards, one TD and two costly interceptions. Jayden Fielding missed two field goals.  ""When we end up throwing 33 times out of 59 — more passes than runs — you can't just abandon the run.,"" Day said. ""You have to be able to control the ball.""  ""The turnovers, the rushing yards, you miss opportunities like those two field goals, yeah, it's going to cost you a game like this,"" he said. ""Every yard matters. Every point matters.""  Michigan (7-5, 5-4) chipped away three-yards-at-a-time in 20-degree temperatures with Kalel Mulllings, who had 32 carries for 116 yards and a touchdown. He helped set up the game-winning field goal with a 27-yard run on third-and-6. Then, Mullings had some choice words for the Buckeyes afterward in a post-game interview with Fox's Jenny Taft.  ""At the end of the day they have to learn how to lose, man,” Mullings said. “We had 60 minutes, four quarters to do all that fighting. Now people want to talk and fight. That's bad for the game. Classless, in my opinion."" This is an easy trap for Ohio State to fall into in order to find some explanation – any explanation –  for the inability to take back control of a rivalry the Buckeyes have dominated for most of the 21st century. Ohio State is 17-7 against Michigan since 2000, but there was a fall-back each of the last three years.  You cannot blame players having the flu, former Michigan assistant Connor Stalions stealing signs, a late interception by former Ohio State quarterback Kyle McCord or a post-game brawl. Michigan won the game. They planted a figurative flag at this point that the Buckeyes have not been able to tear down. In the end, Day will take the blame, and he accepted that afterward.  ""Everybody wants to win this game in the worst way, and nobody wants to win it more than we do,"" Day said. ""It's our No. 1 goal every year. When you don't do that, that's disappointment and frustration.""   Now the challenge. Ohio State still is going to the College Football Playoff. The Big Ten championship is gone, but the chance to host a first-round home game is in the cards. The Buckeyes are good enough to win a national championship – but that will depend on the psyche of the team and the ability to block out the highly-toxic noise in Columbus about the failures against Michigan.  This was supposed to be the year. The transfer portal spree that landed Howard, Quinshon Judkins and Caleb Downs. The hiring of UCLA coach Chip Kelly as the new offensive coordinator. A barely bowl-eligible Michigan team? This should not have happened. That game matters more than anything else, and we are about to find out just how much when Ohio State returns to the field.  Texas went to the playoff without beating Oklahoma last year. But this is Ohio State-Michigan, and with all apologies to the Red River Rivalry, this one means a lot more.  How else could you explain Howard and Cody Simon apologizing to the media afterward for the loss. Simon fought back tears.  ""I don't really know what it's going to look like, but this hurts,"" Simon said. ""We have to come together as a team.""  Howard also fought back tears and it was short in his response. He had no comment about the post-game fight. He was one of the few who at least addressed what is next. He will start thinking about that Sunday.  ""We're a two-loss team, we're going to make the playoff and we're going to make a run, but this one hurts,"" Howard said. ""It hurts.""  When asked a variation of the question and doubled down.  ""I just said we're going to regroup, go into the playoffs and make a run,"" Howard said.   Start talking about that instead of planting a flag. The sooner the better.  Bill Bender graduated from Ohio University in 2002 and started at The Sporting News as a fantasy football writer in 2007.

However, memorable clashes between the Reds and the Citizens aren't exclusive to this current golden rivalry the two clubs find themselves involved in. Here are five absolutely fantastic fixtures pitting Liverpool against Man City, determined by renowned footballing publication FourFourTwo back in 2021. MORE: All the latest Man City news | Premier League schedule for 2024/25 | Latest Premier League top scorer rankings Brendan Rodgers' second game in charge of the Anfield club saw him debut a 17-year-old Raheem Sterling for a relentless display against the club he'd later go on to join. Martin Skrtel opening the scoring only to botch a back pass for Carlos Tevez to clinch a late draw in a thrilling contest that also featured a Pepe Reina-induced goal for Yaya Toure and a trademark highlight-reel free-kick from Luis Suarez. In the same calendar year, Craig Bellamy was the hero as City twice took the lead in this semi-final second leg. The draw was enough for Steven Gerrard's penalty in a 1-0 first-leg win at the Etihad to send the Reds to their first Wembley final since 1996. Though they won the League Cup that year with a penalty shoot-out win in the final over Cardiff City, it would prove to be Kenny Dalglish's final piece of silverware in charge of the club. Over 40 years ago, in the first season to feature three points for a win rather than two, the mighty Liverpool were struggling in the wake of goalkeeper Ray Clemence's departure. Replacement Bruce Grobelaar had a game to forget here, as did Phil Thompson who lost the captain's armband as a result. As big a win as it was for City, it was also the turning point for the European Cup holders who after making changes and switching skippers, would rise from mid-table around the festive period to capture the league title. This was a pivotal one, as Sergio Aguero and Leroy Sane scored either side of Roberto Firmino's equaliser to begin the reeling-in of the seven-points-clear Reds in the second half of the 2018-19 campaign. With 18 wins from the back 19 fixtures, City would go on to beat Liverpool to the title that season while Jurgen Klopp had to settle for the Champions League trophy and finally ending the Reds' domestic league drought the following season. A year prior, it was a seven-goal thriller with Liverpool 18 points behind City and thus, just going for it here. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Firmino, Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah scored in style for the hosts while Sane added to goalkeeper Loris Karius'  reverse highlight reel before Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gundogan netted late to give Reds fans serious jitters. ""This does not f***ing slip now"". Many fans need no more description of this all-timer contest than that, but the fateful words of Steven Gerrard and what happened to the Reds' seemingly certain league triumph against Chelsea soon after was preceded by some elite-tier action.

The Reds are comfortably top of the Premier League as we head towards the halfway stage, eight points above defending champions City, who are enduring a six-game winless run in all competitions. Pep Guardiola's men, more tellingly, lost five games in a row before the sixth — a draw against Feyenoord in the UEFA Champions League — no doubt feels like a defeat considering they blew a 3-0 lead in the final 20 minutes. MORE: All the latest Man City news | Premier League schedule for 2024/25 | Latest Premier League top scorer rankings But while Liverpool manager Arne Slot — who, as fate would have it, was previously the Feyenoord coach — is quickly eradicating all fears he could end up as the David Moyes to Jurgen Klopp's Sir Alex Ferguson, he still has a tough act to follow in one key area. Klopp is currently, and could remain for some time, the most successful manager to ever oppose Guardiola teams. The two battled wits both in Liverpool vs. City fixtures for many years, and briefly before that when they coached Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich, respectively, in the mid-2010s. MORE: All the latest Liverpool news | Premier League schedule for 2024/25 | Latest Premier League top scorer rankings Klopp was able to get the better of Pep on 12 occasions — five more than famous Guardiola rival Jose Mourinho. Four well-known coaches achieved it four times, and four other big names bested the Catalan three times. And if you study the losses column, you'll further appreciate how difficult it has been to beat a Barcelona, Bayern or City side managed by Guardiola. Nonetheless, Slot can join a few others, including Ange Postecoglou, in getting a win over the all-time great this weekend with so many factors going for Liverpool and against the Mancunians. And with Guardiola confirming he'll be in charge for at least another two seasons following the current campaign, Slot has a real chance of breaking into the top five (or even creating a clear-cut top three) if he keeps up his good work so far.

The third-year wideout leads the NFL in yards per reception, logging a ridiculous 23.3 average per catch. Despite it being Week 13, the Cincinnati product has already set career-high marks in yards (629) and touchdown receptions (four) despite recording only 27 receptions. Ahead of the Week 13 matchup against the New England Patriots, Pierce is listed as questionable on the team's injury report due to a foot injury. Here's the latest update on his status for Week 13. Despite being listed as questionable, Pierce is expected to play in Sunday's game against the Patriots, according to Stephen Holder of ESPN. During the week, Pierce failed to practice both Wednesday and Thursday. However, he returned to full practice on Friday, which is typically a good sign that he'll have a chance to play. The Colts will be without their best receiver, Josh Downs, who suffered a shoulder injury during the Week 12 loss against the Detroit Lions. The Colts will also have Michael Pittman Jr. available as he deals with several injuries, most specifically a back injury he suffered about two months ago.

The longtime rivals have played 118 times in their history, beginning in 1894 and playing in almost every season while the two teams were in the Big 12. However, when the Aggies left for the SEC in 2012, it marked the temporary end of the rivalry. Now that Texas has joined Texas A&M in the SEC, the rivalry is back, as the two teams will play every year in their regular season finale. The first game since 2011 is set to be a good one, as both schools are fighting for a spot in the SEC championship game in a de facto playoff game. To ratchet up the hype, College GameDay will be live from College Station earlier in the day. STREAM: Watch Texas vs. Texas A&M live with Fubo (free trial) The 10-1 Longhorns are led by Quinn Ewers, who has 2,089 passing yards, 23 touchdowns, and eight interceptions in nine games this year. Texas also has a strong backfield tandem of Tre Wisner and Jaydon Blue, while Gunnar Helm, Isaiah Bond, and Matthew Golden lead the passing game. For the 8-3 Aggies, the running game is the strength of the offense, as running backs Le'Veon Moss and Amari Daniels have combined for over 1,400 rushing yards. Meanwhile, quarterback Marcel Reed took over as the starter midseason, and the duel threat provides a tough matchup for the Longhorns' defense. This game is crucial for College Football Playoff positioning, as the winner will meet Georgia in the SEC championship game. Texas would likely clinch a spot in the Playoff with a win regardless, but a loss would mean the Longhorns will sweat it out when the 12-team CFP field is announced. Meanwhile, Texas A&M can't make the playoff with a loss, so its lone path to the postseason is through winning the SEC.

Pep Guardiola's side are on their worst ever run of form during his near-decade-long tenure, without a win in their last six across all competitions. That run includes five consecutive defeats followed by a midweek draw against Feyenoord in the Champions League that probably felt like a loss, with City 3-0 up with 73 minutes on the clock. The blown lead against current Liverpool manager Arne Slot's former employers will serve as a particularly large boost for the Dutchman's confidence that his style and the Reds' in-form players will inflict further damage to City. Their 2-0 win over Real Madrid on Wednesday certainly underlined the impressive nature of their form this season. A home victory would extend the lead between the two to 11 points, and furthermore would leave the titleholders mired in a scrap for positioning with as many as nine other teams in a tight top half. The Sporting News looks at the latest team news and predicted lineups for this fixture at Anfield. MORE: All the latest Man City news | Premier League schedule for 2024/25 | Latest Premier League top scorer rankings Both goalkeeper Alisson and forward Diogo Jota are nearing returns from thigh and abdominal injuries, respectively, but Slot has confirmed that neither has much chance of being back in time for the Premier League crunch clash with City. Trent Alexander-Arnold is back in training and, having sat out the win over Madrid, he could well return to the lineup given the excellent Conor Bradley appeared to suffer a muscle issue towards the end of that game. The Reds' other main concern is around Ibrahima Konate, who seemed to hurt himself with the last act of the match as he prevented Endrick from running through on goal. The centre-back will face tests on the problem. Federico Chiesa, meanwhile, is still only partaking in partial training sessions en route to what would be just his fourth appearance for the club he joined in the summer from Juventus, so the Italian will not be ready for the weekend. Slot will also be without Konstantinos Tsimikas after the left-back injured his ankle in training, ruling one of the club's better performers in recent games out of two crucial contests this week. Liverpool predicted lineup (4-3-3, right to left): Kelleher (GK) — Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson — Jones, Gravenberch, Mac Allister — Salah, Nunez, Diaz Injured: Alisson (thigh), Jota (abdomen), Chiesa (undisclosed), Tsimikas (ankle), Konate (undisclosed), Bradley (muscle)Suspended: None MORE: All the latest Liverpool news | Premier League schedule for 2024/25 | Latest Premier League top scorer rankings A key part of City's recent struggles has been multiple injuries, and top of the list is Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, who'll be fortunate to see any more action this season. Mateo Kovacic is out until Christmas or just before, courtesy of an injury picked up on international duty, ruling out the team's best stand-in option for the Spaniard, while Oscar Bobb's leg fracture will delay the start of his season until the new year. Defender John Stones is out indefinitely with a foot injury, but Jeremy Doku's quadriceps muscle complaint may be resolved in time for him to feature at Anfield and Ruben Dias could also return from a calf problem that has kept him out of City's recent rotten run. When asked on Friday about the latest on Doku, Dias and any other late injury news, Guardiola simply answered: ""we will see"".

Edwards reigned as IBF champion after beating Moruti Mthalane in April 2021. He defended the belt four times before being stopped in a thrilling encounter with pound-for-pound superstar Jesse 'Bam' Rodriguez last December. A comeback win against Adrian Curiel paved the way for this meeting with a very familiar foe in Yafai. After claiming a win over Yafai in the amateurs, Edwards and his rival were both added to the Team GB podium squad. However, it was Yafai who became the favourite of the coaching set-up. Edwards soon grew frustrated and turned pro, while Yafai rode the wave to two Olympic games, winning gold in Tokyo. That shared history is amplified further by older brothers Charlie Edwards and Kal Yafai, each former champions who never met during their world-ruling prime. Whoever prevails in this attempt to settle a decade of simmering familial feuding will win the WBC interim title at 112 pounds and earn a shot at the full champion: hard-hitting Japanese star Kenshiro Teraji.

His UCF tenure will end after four years at 28-24. Malzahn will be FSU’s primary play caller, a role held by Mike Norvell. So this marks a distinct shift for Norvell, who has shaken up his staff in the wake of a 2-9 season that concludes tonight against Florida.

Social media responded to the news by pitching a return to the Knights for national championship-winning coach Scott Frost. “Hey I know it’s a long shot but let’s bring in frosty baby,” said former Frost recruit and current Birmingham Stallions receiver Marlon Williams. “Does history repeat itself at UCF?” asked Rivals’ National Recruiting Director Adam Gorney with a GIF of Frost on UCF’s sidelines. “Gus Malzahn resigns at UCF.

Stephen Curry is still in his prime. So is Andrew Wiggins. Draymond Green is anchoring them on both ends per usual and their young talent pool is elite.” “But Curry, 36, and Green, 34, are nearing 40 years old. Their championship window, which is still open, won’t remain that way forever."" ""That’s why they should reunite with a couple of former teammates to win a historic championship in the twilight of their careers.” “Curry has a style of play that could enable him to still average 20-plus points per night and continue being an elite marksman from outside at 40.” “Durant’s unselfish approach, coupled with his size and feel for the game would make him another aging superstar who could still be an effective, low-usage scorer.”  “The same goes for Thompson, who doesn’t need to dribble to catch fire. So long as Green remains agile, he could still make sound reads and distribute to those three.” “With a slew of youthful defensive specialists around them and one more potent scorer to serve as a failsafe for the injury-prone Curry, Durant, and Thompson, Golden State could realistically win one more championship five years from now.” “If the opportunity presents itself, the Warriors’ big four could be the first unit to run the table in such a fashion and would make for entertainment value unlike anything the NBA world has seen before.” The Warriors secured two titles with Durant, Curry, Green, and Thompson running the show. The organization defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers twice before falling to the Toronto Raptors in the 2019 finals.  Following the devastating end to the 2018-19 season, Durant joined the Brooklyn Nets during free agency, lowering Golden State’s chances of dominating the NBA in the future.  Surprisingly, the Warriors returned to the finals in 2022 and took down the Boston Celtics in six games to win their sixth championship in franchise history.  However, after a miserable showing in the No. 9 vs. No. 10 Western Conference Play-In game last season, Thompson inked a deal with the Dallas Mavericks in July, officially ending the Warriors' dynasty. Will the Warriors’ Big 4 reunite for a final farewell tour in a few years? Perhaps, but the four studs appear to be focused on doing whatever it takes to achieve success in the present.

The influential Brazil centre-back won his race to be fit for Saturday's trip to West Ham after limping out of the impressive 5-1 UEFA Champions League win over Sporting CP in midweek. Once again, Gabriel showed his prowess when attacking set-pieces by heading home an early opener from Bukayo Saka's right-wing corner. Arsenal rode a five-goal first half explosion to victory against West Ham. 💥Watch ALL FIVE of their goals ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/bmKWXsb4Oc That set in motion a frantic first half, which ended with Arsenal 5-2 in front. Not only was the interval the end of the goalscoring, it was also the end of Gabriel's participation. Speaking after the match, Mikel Arteta confirmed a recurrence of the issue that forced the 26-year-old off in Lisbon, as opposed to any side effects from being clattered by West Ham goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski for the penalty that Saka dispatched for the Gunners' fifth goal. MORE: All the latest Arsenal news | Premier League schedule for 2024/25 | Latest Premier League top scorer rankings ""It was related to the previous injury that he had in Lisbon,"" Arteta said. ""Obviously he did great to be part of that but with the result and the niggle that he's feeling we decided to take him off."" Victory moved Arsenal to within five points of Liverpool at the summit. The leaders face champions Manchester City at Anfield on Sunday. All of the title favourites have already been hit by injury problems this season and Gabriel is not Arteta's only fresh concern coming out of the West Ham game.  Riccardo Calafiori hobbled off to be replaced by Oleksandr Zinchenko at left-back, while Jorginho started at the base of the midfield following late withdrawals from Mikel Merino (knee) and Thomas Partey (muscular). Nevertheless, Arteta was heartened by the performances put in by Jakub Kiwior and his other injury replacements with United's visit to Emirates Stadium on the horizon. ""We had an issue with Gabby and then we had an issue with Ricci as well,"" he added. ""Yesterday, we lost Thomas and Mikel and Myles [Lewis-Skelly], which was very bad news. ""What I'm really happy about is Jakub has to come in and does really well. Oleks the same. Jorginho I thought was exceptional today. ""That's the level.

Malzahn resigned from the Knights and has accepted an offensive coordinator job under FSU’s Mike Norvell in Tallahassee, per ESPN’s Pete Thamel. “Sources: UCF head coach Gus Malzahn is resigning to become the new offensive coordinator at Florida State, sources told ESPN. His UCF tenure will end after four years at 28-24. Malzahn will be FSU’s primary play caller, a role held by Mike Norvell. So this marks a distinct shift for Norvell, who has shaken up his staff in the wake of a 2-9 season that concludes tonight against Florida. The move comes in the wake of two uneven seasons for Malzahn at UCF, as they went 6-7 last year and struggled this season in going 4-8,” Thamel tweeted. Malzahn’s resignation comes a day after UCF lost to Utah in Week 14 to move to 4-8 in 2024. While Malzahn wasn’t likely to be fired just yet, the 59-year-old may just be traumatized after being let go, perhaps prematurely, by Auburn. The Orlando Sentinel’s Mike Bianchi relayed that Malzahn was likely going to be on the hot seat throughout the 2024 season but still expected him to return. “Unless there is a sudden change of heart from Malzahn himself or UCF’s administration, I’m assuming the coach will get one more season to fix a broken program that is moving in the wrong direction,” Bianchi wrote. “UCF lost eight of its last nine games this season and has a 5-13 conference record in two seasons since joining the Big 12, The Gus Bus is obviously stuck in reverse, and the question is can Malzahn get it into gear and move it forward in 2025? “Athletic Director Terry Mohajir has publicly supported him, but such endorsements often come with a quick expiration date. If UCF doesn’t show significant improvement next year, Mohajir will have no choice but to make a change. The financial stakes – in the form of booster donations, NIL contributions and ticket sales – are too high to keep losing.” Things change quickly in college football. Malzahn knows that, and he found himself a lower-pressure job with a more decorated program.

During the Week 12 loss against the Detroit Lions, Richardson ran the ball and wound up lowering his shoulder into a tackle from Brian Branch. After reviewing the play throughout the week, the league seemingly felt Richardson initiated contact with his helmet, which led to a $22,511 fine for unnecessary roughness — specifically lowering his helmet. The NFL fined #Colts QB Anthony Richardson $22,511 for unnecessary roughness (use of the helmet) — lowering his head into #Lions DB Brian Branch last week. pic.twitter.com/mJF5NuqiM7 While there was certainly some helmet-to-helmet contact, it's a bit interesting the league decided to fine Richardson for this when there have been far more egregious plays that have been swept under the rug. That includes this one from Week 1 when Richardson was slammed to the ground by a Houston Texans defender. There was no penalty or fine afterward. Reminder: Not a penalty, or fine. https://t.co/UrkG1PgJEI pic.twitter.com/dF7gvZIc9r Either way, Richardson will have to open up the checkbook before the Colts visit the New England Patriots in Week 13.

Ohio State vs. Michigan lived up to the hype once again Saturday, despite the Wolverines coming in at 6-5 amid a lost season. After a game-winning field goal from Dominic Zvada, Michigan walked away with a 13-10 victory, likely ending the Buckeyes' bid for a Big Ten title. Ohio State head coach Ryan Day, who's led his team to success in most other matchups, continued to struggle against Michigan.  What is Day's updated record against the Wolverines? Here's what to know about the Ohio State coach's career woes against the defending national champions. MORE: Updated Big Ten championship scenarios After Saturday's loss, Day now holds a 1-4 record against Michigan. He has a 44-1 record against the rest of the Big Ten.  Michigan's win also marked the fourth consecutive Buckeyes loss to the Wolverines.  Ryan Day looks on following the loss to Michigan pic.twitter.com/ZlrVeyfTOU Ohio State's loss opened the door for either Penn State or Indiana to claim a spot in the Big Ten championship game. If the Buckeyes had come away with a win over the Wolverines, they would have locked in a matchup against Oregon in the conference title game. Here's a look at each of Day's career matchups against the Wolverines. MORE: Ohio State, Michigan players fight after Wolverines' Week 14 victory Defense defined most of Saturday's matchup, as it remained a low-scoring game heading into the fourth quarter.  Although the Buckeyes struck first with a 29-yard field goal in the first quarter, quarterback Will Howard was picked off in the second quarter, which set up an easy touchdown from Michigan running back Kalel Mullings. Soon after, the Wolverines followed that with field goal of their own. MICHIGAN PICKS OFF WILL HOWARD 😱The @UMichFootball defenese takes it right back! pic.twitter.com/jB3gbtC39s Buckeyes kicker Jayden Fielding missed a 38-yard field goal about halfway through the second quarter as well, as interceptions and missed kicks wound up becoming a theme for Ohio State's offense. HE MISSED IT 😱Ohio State misses the field goal and Michigan remains on top pic.twitter.com/RvZArWyS7u The Buckeyes were able to knot the game at 10 before halftime, and their defense kept them in the game through a significant chunk of the second half. But once again, Howard was picked off toward the end of the third quarter, and on Ohio State's next drive, Fielding missed a 34-yard field goal. HE MISSED ANOTHER FIELD GOAL 🤯THE GAME REMAINS TIED IN COLUMBUS 😱 pic.twitter.com/670BRoU5yi Ultimately, either one of those short field goals going through for Ohio State could have changed the game's final result. Instead, turnovers and missed opportunities haunted Day and the Buckeyes, as they allowed a game-winning field goal drive to Michigan late in the game. MICHIGAN TAKES THE LEAD WITH 45 SECONDS LEFT 😱@UMichFootball(brought to you by @ATTBusiness #ATTBusiness #NextLevelNetwork) pic.twitter.com/DWzkCc9wnd MORE: What Ohio State's loss to Michigan means for Big Ten As his struggles against Michigan continued, and with Ohio State now ending its regular season with a 10-2 record, Day's hot seat could be growing hotter. A Buckeyes coaching change could soon become a more realistic possibility, but the team would have to pay a buyout to fire Day. According to USA Today's College Football Head Coach Salaries database, Day would be owed around $37.2 million by Ohio State if he was fired. He's currently the fifth-highest paid head coach in college football. Daniel Mader joined Sporting News as an editorial intern in 2024 following his graduation from Penn State University.

If Day’s program loses in the College Football Playoff, which the Buckeyes are still expected to make, the consensus is that he will be fired in the offseason. “If Ryan Day doesn't win the national title this year, he should be fired. Not make the title game, not make the semis, win it,” CBS Sports’ Shehan Jeyarajah wrote in the aftermath of the unfathomable Week 14 upset. The Athletic’s Stewart Mandel doesn’t think Day will be spared by anything and compared the loss to Kentucky’s Round of 64 loss to Oakland during this past March Madness tournament. “This feels like Ryan Day's equivalent of John Calipari losing to Oakland. Whether it's by his choice or someone else's, the guy is going to need an exit plan after this. There's no coming back from it,” Mandel wrote. Not only did Day’s team lose, but they prompted a brawl against Wolverines players after planting the Michigan flag at midfield. Day responded by condoning the brawl. ""I don’t know all the details, but I know these guys were looking to put a flag on our field and we’re not going to let that happen,” Day said postgame. Day came into the season having recruited a $20 million NIL-valuated roster, complete with multiple NFL-bound receivers and one of the best running backs on the transfer market, Quinshon Judkins. Ultimately, though, relying on Kansas State transfer Will Howard may cost him this season. Day isn’t going out without a fight. But his Buckeyes need more than just fight as they enter the College Football Playoff; they need wins unless they want a change at head coach next season.

It becomes even more advantageous during the latter weeks of the NFL season. In the fall and winter winter, the climate in Orchard Park, N.Y. can make things difficult for visiting teams, especially those from warmer areas. Such will be the case Sunday when the Bills welcome the 49ers to Highmark Stadium for a ""Sunday Night Football"" showdown.

On Sunday night, temperatures will dip into the low 20s with a 51% chance of rain. Snow showers are expected throughout the weekend in the Buffalo area. The playing surface should not be impacted too much, but it is worth noting that Highmark Stadium's field is not heated. The forecast calls for a low of 23 degrees Sunday night. With wind speeds of five to 10 miles per hour, the temperature could feel slightly colder than what the reading calls for.

Learn the Secrets of Advanced Betting,https://sportsweez.com/what-is-a-trebles-bet/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 11:28:41 +0000","A trebles bet is not just another random term in the world of sports betting. It’s the betting equivalent of putting all your eggs in three carefully chosen baskets, hoping each pays off in cascading glory. Unlike your typical single bet, where one outcome makes or breaks your day, a trebles bet rolls the dice [&#8230;]","A trebles bet is not just another random term in the world of sports betting. It’s the betting equivalent of putting all your eggs in three carefully chosen baskets, hoping each pays off in cascading glory. Unlike your typical single bet, where one outcome makes or breaks your day, a trebles bet rolls the dice three times, multiplying your potential winnings in a way that feels almost magical—but it’s not magic. It’s strategy, risk, and a dash of guts. Imagine this: it’s Saturday, and the football lineup has your favorite teams ready to clash. You spot three matches with juicy odds and outcomes you feel confident about. Maybe Manchester United is on fire, Arsenal is showing championship form, and Chelsea is just looking solid. Instead of betting separately on each team to win their respective matches, you combine these three predictions into one powerful trebles bet. Now, you’re not just rooting for one team; you’re living and dying by the collective success of all three. Here’s the kicker—your initial stake works harder than a lone wolf bet ever could. Let’s say you place $10 on a trebles bet with three selections, each with odds of 2.0. If the first bet wins, your $10 doubles to $20, which then rolls over to the second bet, turning it into $40 if that wins, and finally to $80 if the third selection also hits. That’s $80 from a mere $10 bet! But—here’s the catch—all three outcomes need to be perfect. One loss? Game over. It’s the ultimate all-or-nothing approach. Some people swear by trebles betting because of the high-risk, high-reward dynamic. You’re essentially wagering your confidence across multiple events, and that creates this electric feeling of anticipation. It’s like betting on a domino rally, knowing the smallest wobble can ruin everything, but also knowing the rush when they all fall perfectly in place is unmatched. The beauty of trebles bets isn’t just in the potential payout. It’s in the strategy. This isn’t a scatter-gun approach to betting where you pick random teams or outcomes. You need to know your stuff. Are you diving into football stats? Tracking player injuries? Noticing patterns in underdog victories? A trebles bet rewards the sharp bettor who can combine knowledge with intuition. It’s like building a house of cards. Patience and precision are everything. But let’s not sugarcoat it—trebles betting can burn you faster than you realize. Many novice bettors fall into the trap of overestimating their knowledge or getting seduced by big potential payouts. Remember, the risk is amplified with each selection. If even one of your three choices fails to deliver, the whole bet collapses. For casual bettors, trebles might seem daunting, but for those who thrive on calculated risks, it’s like the Holy Grail of betting. A real-life example helps make this concrete. Let’s say you place a trebles bet on these outcomes: You wager $10. If Manchester United wins, your $10 turns into $25. Then Arsenal wins, taking that $25 to $45. Finally, Chelsea pulls off the draw, turning your $45 into a massive $135. That’s over ten times your original stake. But if even one of these results doesn’t go your way? You lose the entire $10. It’s a razor’s edge between triumph and despair. Trebles bets are often the playground of intermediate to advanced bettors who’ve got a decent grasp of the sport they’re betting on. They understand how to spot value in odds and how to hedge their risk elsewhere, if needed. Sure, there’s always luck involved, but successful trebles betting feels less like blind luck and more like threading a needle while riding a roller coaster. If you’re thinking about diving into trebles betting, start small. Experiment with low stakes while you get the hang of spotting value. Track your wins and losses meticulously, and resist the urge to bet with your heart instead of your head. And always remember: the higher the odds, the lower the probability. Trebles betting is exhilarating, but it’s no place for reckless gambling. So, what’s the secret to trebles bets? Confidence, preparation, and knowing when to walk away. It’s not for the faint of heart, but for those who love a challenge and the thrill of multiplied odds, there’s nothing quite like it. Play smart, and you might just hit the jackpot."

Sports Weez,What Is a Bet Builder? Simplified Guide to Betting Smart,https://sportsweez.com/what-is-a-bet-builder/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 11:26:13 +0000",A Bet Builder is the holy grail of personalized betting. It’s that perfect tool that turns a standard sports wager into a customized masterpiece crafted entirely by you. Imagine you&#8217;re watching your favorite soccer team play this weekend—let’s say it’s Arsenal vs. Manchester United—and you’ve got a hunch about everything from who’s scoring to how [&#8230;],"A Bet Builder is the holy grail of personalized betting. It’s that perfect tool that turns a standard sports wager into a customized masterpiece crafted entirely by you. Imagine you’re watching your favorite soccer team play this weekend—let’s say it’s Arsenal vs. Manchester United—and you’ve got a hunch about everything from who’s scoring to how many corners are happening. A Bet Builder lets you pack all those predictions into a single bet, creating a one-of-a-kind ticket with skyrocketing odds. Here’s the magic: you’re not stuck with boring, one-dimensional bets anymore. Traditionally, betting meant picking one outcome—like which team wins, maybe the total goals, or the halftime result. But a Bet Builder throws open the doors to creative possibilities. You can combine markets like “Both Teams to Score,” “Over 2.5 Goals,” “Bukayo Saka to Score Anytime,” and even “Total Match Cards Over 3.5” into one compact bet. The more selections you add, the higher the potential payout—but, and here’s the kicker, every single part of the bet needs to hit for you to cash in. This feature works brilliantly for people who know the sport inside out and feel like they’ve got a crystal ball about how a match will unfold. It’s as if you’re assembling your dream scenario—like Lego blocks for gamblers. For example, if you’ve been watching Manchester United’s erratic form lately and know they’re good for a defensive lapse, you could build a bet like this: Marcus Rashford to Score Anytime, Over 9.5 Total Corners, and Arsenal to Win. Boom. Now, you’re rooting for multiple layers of action instead of just sitting there, biting your nails over a single outcome. But don’t be fooled into thinking this is easy money. Bet Builders are risky. You’re essentially linking multiple predictions, and one wrong turn—say, Rashford misses an easy tap-in or the referee decides to keep his cards in his pocket—and your bet is toast. This is why it’s often referred to as a “high-risk, high-reward” style of betting. It’s not for the faint-hearted, but for the thrill-seekers who want that adrenaline-pumping, multi-faceted action. What makes Bet Builders especially exciting is their versatility across sports. While they started as a staple for soccer betting, they’ve expanded into basketball, tennis, American football, and even niche sports. Fancy a basketball game? You could combine “Steph Curry Over 30.5 Points,” “Golden State Warriors to Win,” and “Total Team Assists Over 20” into one glorious bet. Tennis, you say? Build a bet on “Rafael Nadal to Win, Over 9.5 Total Aces, and Second Set Over 10.5 Games.” The options are almost limitless. Here’s where it gets even better: Bet Builders are incredibly user-friendly. Most online sportsbooks now have dedicated sections for them, with a sleek interface where you can toggle through markets and see your odds update in real time. Platforms like Bet365 and FanDuel lead the charge, offering intuitive Bet Builder tools that even a first-timer can figure out. And let’s not forget the thrill of seeing those odds stack up with each added prediction—nothing beats the dopamine rush of watching your custom odds climb higher and higher. A word of advice, though: don’t go wild stacking every prediction under the sun. The allure of massive odds is strong, but a ticket with ten legs (selections) is more likely to crash than a house of cards in a hurricane. Stick to what you genuinely believe will happen, and don’t throw in “fun” picks just for the thrill. It’s called betting smart for a reason. In the end, a Bet Builder is more than just a betting tool—it’s an experience. It transforms passive viewing into edge-of-your-seat excitement, where every corner, shot, and card matters. You’re not just watching the game; you’re living it, predicting its twists and turns like a modern-day sports oracle. And when it all comes together and your custom bet hits? That’s the stuff legends are made of."
Sports Weez,Gambling vs Betting: Key Differences You Need to Know,https://sportsweez.com/gambling-vs-betting/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 11:13:36 +0000","Gambling and betting—two words often tossed around interchangeably—aren’t quite the same, even though they walk hand-in-hand through the thrilling world of chance.

They’re like cousins at a family gathering: closely related, but with distinct personalities. If you’ve ever found yourself wondering where one ends and the other begins, buckle up. This ride’s about to get interesting. Let’s cut to the chase: gambling is the umbrella, while betting is a snug, specific corner under it. Gambling encompasses a wide variety of activities, from slot machines winking at you with promises of jackpots, to rolling dice in high-stakes games, to buying lottery tickets in the hopes of becoming a millionaire overnight. It’s an expansive, unpredictable universe where the outcome often relies solely on luck. You’re playing against the house, the odds, or even fate itself. Betting, on the other hand, has a bit more swagger and calculation. Think of it as gambling’s more disciplined sibling. Betting is essentially wagering on an event where the outcome may be uncertain, but you’re making an educated guess. Whether it’s betting on your favorite sports team, the outcome of a horse race, or even quirky things like which celebrity might name their baby after a fruit next, betting feels like it has strategy baked into it. Sure, there’s risk, but it’s not just blind chance—it’s an informed roll of the dice. Now, here’s where the plot thickens. If you’ve ever been at a sports bar during the Super Bowl, you’ve probably witnessed the betting frenzy firsthand. That guy yelling at the TV about a missed touchdown? He isn’t just upset about the game—he’s likely got a few bucks riding on the result. That’s the charm of betting; it’s rooted in something tangible. Unlike a slot machine, where you’re up against cold, calculated algorithms, betting lets you rely on knowledge, gut feelings, or pure fandom. But don’t let betting fool you into thinking it’s risk-free. If gambling is a wild roller-coaster, betting is a slick poker game. Both can clean out your wallet if you’re not careful. Gambling often seduces with its glitz and glamour—casinos are built to dazzle, after all. The sights, the sounds, the free drinks—they’re not just perks; they’re part of the plan to keep you playing. Betting, however, hooks you with the illusion of control. Think you know your football stats better than anyone? Put your money where your mouth is. Spoiler alert: the universe doesn’t always care about your research. There’s also a cultural twist to this. Gambling carries a certain mystique, often seen as a high-stakes affair tied to smoky poker rooms or bustling Vegas floors. Betting, meanwhile, has gone mainstream, with legalized sports betting apps making it feel as casual as scrolling through social media. One feels larger than life, while the other is woven into everyday conversations. Still, at the heart of it, both gambling and betting tap into the same primal urge: the thrill of risk. Humans love to gamble in every sense, whether it’s with money, emotions, or life decisions. It’s about the high of the unknown—the “what if” that keeps us coming back for more. And while betting may feel more calculated, let’s be honest, it’s still a gamble. So, what’s the takeaway here? If you’re venturing into this world of risks and rewards, know thyself. Are you here for the adrenaline rush of a high-stakes poker game, or do you fancy yourself a sports genius who can outsmart the odds-makers? One isn’t inherently better than the other; they just cater to different vibes. Gambling is for the dreamers, the “all or nothing” folks who are ready to spin the wheel of fortune. Betting? That’s for the tacticians, the ones who like to believe they’re playing with their heads, not just their hearts. At the end of the day, whether you’re spinning slots or analyzing game stats, the key difference between gambling and betting boils down to your mindset and approach. Both are thrilling, risky, and capable of delivering sky-high rewards—or devastating losses. The real question is: how much are you willing to risk, and what kind of thrill are you chasing?"
Sports Weez,Courtside Betting Secrets: How to Outplay the Odds Live!,https://sportsweez.com/courtside-betting/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 11:12:11 +0000","Courtside betting isn’t just a game-changer; it’s the adrenaline-fueled arena where the sharpest bettors thrive.

You’re not just a spectator—you’re part of the game, exploiting every split-second advantage. This is the realm [&#8230;]","Courtside betting isn’t just a game-changer; it’s the adrenaline-fueled arena where the sharpest bettors thrive. Imagine this: you’re sitting courtside, watching the sweat drip from players as they fight tooth and nail, milliseconds ahead of the TV broadcast. You’re not just a spectator—you’re part of the game, exploiting every split-second advantage. This is the realm of courtside betting, and if you’re not in it, you’re playing catch-up. Let me paint the scene for you. A friend of mine once got last-minute tickets to an NBA game. Courtside seats, the holy grail for any sports fan. While the rest of us marveled at his luck, he was busy doing something far more interesting. Every time a buzzer-beater landed or a turnover flipped possession, he was glued to his phone. Not texting, not tweeting—betting. By the time the game ended, he’d walked out with more than just memories. He’d turned those seats into a personal ATM. So, what’s the secret sauce? It’s simple: speed, strategy, and the ability to read the game like a seasoned coach. When you’re courtside, you have access to real-time information that online bettors sitting at home can only dream of. TV broadcasts? They’re lagging behind, often by as much as 5–10 seconds. That’s an eternity in sports, where a single play can flip the odds. Courtside bettors capitalize on that delay, placing wagers on outcomes before sportsbooks adjust. It’s like seeing the cards before your opponent plays them. But don’t think it’s all easy money. The sportsbooks know courtside betting exists, and they’re not going to hand over their profits without a fight. They’ll suspend betting during critical moments or tighten the odds faster than you can refresh your screen. That’s where your strategy comes in. First rule: know your game inside and out. If you’re courtside at a basketball game, you better understand the players, the coaches, and the momentum swings. Courtside betting isn’t for casual fans; it’s for those who can feel the energy of the game and predict what comes next. For example, a player who’s gassed after back-to-back possessions might miss an easy free throw. A team that just nailed two three-pointers is probably going to lean on that hot hand for their next possession. Second rule: pick your moments. The beauty of courtside betting is the sheer number of opportunities it gives you. Live bets are dynamic, constantly shifting with the game’s flow. Don’t rush to place bets on every play; instead, wait for those moments where the odds misalign with reality. A team down by 10 in the first quarter? Odds might undervalue them, but if you know their second-half performance is killer, that’s your window. Finally, there’s the human element. Being courtside gives you access to the players’ body language, interactions, and emotions in a way TV never could. A star player arguing with the ref might signal frustration, or a bench player warming up could indicate an impending substitution. These subtle cues give you an edge—a way to predict the unpredictable. Of course, like any form of betting, courtside wagering isn’t without risks. You’re going to lose some bets, no matter how sharp you are. But that’s part of the thrill. The key is managing your bankroll, staying disciplined, and not letting the highs or lows cloud your judgment. So, how do you get started if courtside tickets are out of reach? You don’t have to be physically in the arena to benefit from courtside betting principles. Follow live streams or faster data sources and practice reading the flow of the game. And if you ever do land those golden tickets, treat them as more than a chance to brush shoulders with the elite. They’re your shot at mastering the art of courtside betting and outplaying the odds in real time. Every game has its players, and every bet has its bettors. But courtside? That’s where the real players show up."
Sports Weez,Bookmaker Odds Explained: A Simple Guide for Beginners,https://sportsweez.com/bookmaker-odds-explained/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 11:07:33 +0000","Bookmaker odds can seem like a bewildering mix of numbers and symbols if you’re new to sports betting, but trust me, it’s not rocket science once you get the hang of it.

Odds are the lifeblood of betting. They determine how much you could win, reflect the probability of an event happening, and even reveal subtle insights into what bookmakers think about a game or race. Let’s strip away the mystery and break it down into bite-sized pieces. Imagine this: You’re eyeing a horse race. The bookmaker offers odds of 5/1 on a horse named Lucky Shot. What does that mean? It’s shorthand for “you’ll win $5 for every $1 you bet,” plus you get your original stake back if you win. That’s fractional odds, which are super common in the UK. They’re simple enough, but they can look intimidating when the numbers balloon, like 25/7. Thankfully, other formats exist, like decimal odds, which are more popular in Europe and growing in the US. With decimal odds, the math becomes ridiculously easy. If Lucky Shot’s odds are 6.0, all you do is multiply your stake by the odds. Bet $10? You get $60 if you win. And yes, that includes your original stake. Clean and straightforward. But what about American odds, also known as moneyline odds? They flip the script entirely. Positive odds like +500 show how much profit you’d make on a $100 bet, while negative odds like -200 tell you how much you need to bet to win $100. Here’s the kicker: odds aren’t just payout calculators—they’re windows into probabilities. Bookmakers use complex algorithms to estimate how likely an event is to occur. Let’s say a team has odds of 2.0 in decimal form. This implies a 50% chance of winning, calculated as 1 divided by the odds (1/2.0 = 0.5). For fractional odds like 5/1, it’s 1/(5+1) = 0.166, or about 16.7%. This is called the implied probability, and it’s a crucial piece of the betting puzzle. But don’t be fooled into thinking bookmakers offer a direct reflection of reality. Odds include a profit margin—often called the overround—that tilts things in the bookmaker’s favor. If you sum up the implied probabilities of all possible outcomes in a match, they usually exceed 100%. That extra percentage is their edge, ensuring they come out ahead in the long run. It’s like playing blackjack against a house with a loaded deck. You can win, but the odds aren’t naturally stacked in your favor. Now, what about those swings in odds you see leading up to a big event? That’s the market talking. Odds shift based on factors like injuries, weather, or even a flood of bets on one side. It’s not just the bookmaker adjusting for new information—it’s also a strategy to balance their books and minimize risk. If too much money flows to one outcome, the bookmaker risks a massive payout if it hits, so they tweak the odds to encourage bets on the other side. Knowing how to interpret and use odds is where the fun—and strategy—comes in. Are you spotting value? This is when the odds offered by the bookmaker suggest a lower probability than you believe to be true. For example, if a bookmaker gives odds of 4.0 (25% implied probability) on a team you think has a 40% chance of winning, you’ve found a value bet. These golden opportunities don’t come around often, but hunting for them is half the thrill. At the end of the day, understanding odds is about leveling the playing field. The more you grasp how bookmakers calculate and adjust them, the better your chances of finding those edges that make betting exciting. So whether you’re diving into football, tennis, or even esports, remember this: the odds aren’t just numbers—they’re a map to smarter betting. Grab your compass and start exploring."

It’s the high-risk, high-reward adrenaline rush of the betting world, where a single goal can either send you into ecstasy or leave you clutching your ticket in despair. But let’s be honest—there’s something intoxicating about nailing a prediction down to the exact score. It’s not just betting; it’s clairvoyance with a payday. The key to succeeding in correct score betting is recognizing that it’s not just about luck. Sure, luck plays its part, but if you rely solely on fortune, you might as well flip a coin. The real magic lies in strategy, research, and understanding the beautiful game in a way most bettors don’t. You need to be part analyst, part psychologist, and part mathematician to come out ahead in this tricky market. Start with the basics: Know your teams inside out. Look at their form, not just in terms of wins and losses, but how they score and concede goals. A team like Manchester City might crush weaker opposition with a flurry of goals, while a defensive powerhouse like Atletico Madrid thrives on 1-0 wins. Patterns matter. Study the head-to-head history, too—some matchups consistently produce high-scoring thrillers, while others are more subdued. Then there’s the all-important factor of context. Is it a league game or a cup final? Is one team desperate for points, while the other is comfortably mid-table with nothing to play for? Even weather conditions can sway a game’s flow. A rainy day might favor a scrappy 1-1 draw rather than an explosive 4-3 shootout. Every detail counts when you’re narrowing your bet down to a single scoreline. Here’s a pro tip most casual bettors overlook: Focus on the likely rather than the flashy. Betting on a 5-4 thriller might offer sky-high odds, but how often do you see a score like that? Instead, target common outcomes like 1-0, 2-1, or 1-1, especially in games where defenses are solid and attackers are clinical but not wasteful. Sure, the payouts may not be as jaw-dropping, but they’re still lucrative enough to be worth your time. Now, let’s talk bankroll management—because no matter how confident you feel about a prediction, putting all your eggs in one basket is a recipe for disaster. Correct score betting is volatile by nature. Even the savviest punters only win a fraction of the time. Spread your bets wisely, perhaps placing smaller wagers on multiple plausible outcomes for the same game. This hedging strategy can mitigate losses and keep your bankroll intact for future wagers. Another insider trick? Leverage in-play betting. Watching a game unfold can provide critical insights you simply can’t predict beforehand. A team starting the game aggressively might indicate they’ll score early, while a defensive setup could hint at a low-scoring affair. Adjust your bets based on the flow of the match to improve your chances of landing that golden scoreline. And let’s not forget the psychological side of things. Betting on the correct score can mess with your head if you’re not careful. It’s easy to get caught up in “near-misses”—that painful 2-1 bet when the game ends 3-1—or let a big loss push you into chasing your money. The trick is to stay cool and stick to your game plan, win or lose. Emotional betting is sloppy betting, and that’s a quick ticket to losing it all. Of course, there’s a seductive thrill in chasing underdog scorelines with astronomical odds. Who doesn’t dream of hitting the jackpot with a bold 4-2 prediction in a Champions League clash? But these long shots should be treated like a lottery ticket: fun, exciting, but not something you rely on for consistent winnings. Keep your ambitions grounded in probabilities, not pipe dreams. Finally, don’t underestimate the value of technology. Use stats and data from trusted sources to inform your bets. Advanced metrics like xG (expected goals) can help you gauge a team’s offensive and defensive tendencies more accurately than traditional stats. Combine this with tools that track betting trends to understand where the smart money is going. The more informed you are, the better your odds of winning big. Correct score betting isn’t easy, but that’s what makes it so rewarding. The thrill of getting it right, of outsmarting the bookies, is unmatched. If you approach it with discipline, patience, and a solid strategy, you can turn the odds in your favor. Just remember, this game is a marathon, not a sprint. Celebrate the wins, learn from the losses, and keep chasing that perfect scoreline—it’s out there waiting for you."
Sports Weez,Why Shots on Target Betting is Perfect for Football Fans,https://sportsweez.com/shots-on-target-betting/,"Sat, 30 Nov 2024 10:59:49 +0000","Football betting has come a long way from just picking winners and losers.

If you’re a true fan who spends matchday shouting at the screen about how your team “just needs to shoot,” shots on target betting might be your calling. It’s not only an exciting way to engage with the game, but it also rewards those of us who obsess over stats and know the ins and outs of players’ performances. So, let’s talk about why this type of betting could become your favorite—and why it’s a perfect fit for football fanatics. First things first: what is shots on target betting? It’s exactly what it sounds like. You’re betting on how many shots on target will be recorded in a game, by a specific player, or even across an entire team. For those who aren’t stat nerds, a shot on target is any effort that would have gone into the net if it weren’t for a save by the goalkeeper or a defensive block. Simple enough, right? Now, here’s why it’s a thrill. Shots on target bets don’t care about who wins or loses the match. You could bet on a striker to have at least three shots on target, and whether their team gets smashed 4–0 or pulls off a miraculous win, your bet still holds as long as they hit their target quota. For fans tired of nail-biting over final scores, this opens up a whole new world of stress-free excitement. Imagine this scenario: you’re watching Manchester United play Liverpool. You’ve got a bet on Mo Salah to have over 2.5 shots on target. You don’t care about the result anymore—every time Salah gets the ball near the box, you’re on the edge of your seat. A curling attempt from outside the box? Yes, please! A rapid-fire volley after a corner? Even better. It’s like turning every attacking move into your personal mini-game within the match. What makes shots on target betting so special is how it rewards football knowledge. Casual fans might not think twice about how often Kevin De Bruyne shoots or how Bruno Fernandes loves a speculative effort from distance, but seasoned fans know these details like the back of their hand. You’ve seen Harry Kane hit five shots on goal against Burnley or noticed how Jack Grealish’s positioning guarantees at least a couple of decent chances every game. This inside knowledge is pure gold when it comes to placing these bets. Another big appeal? Flexibility. Shots on target betting offers a variety of options to suit your preferences. Want to back a specific player? Go for it. Want to bet on a team as a whole to have over eight shots on target? It’s all yours. Feeling particularly bold? Combine it with other bets in an accumulator and watch the potential winnings soar. It’s not about predicting a winner anymore—it’s about knowing the rhythm of the game, the patterns of play, and the habits of the players. One of the best parts about shots on target betting is that it keeps even the dullest games interesting. Picture this: a drab, goalless stalemate between two mid-table sides. Normally, you’d be counting down the minutes, hoping the final whistle comes quickly. But if you’ve got a bet riding on someone like Ivan Toney or Ollie Watkins to hit a shot on target, every moment suddenly has stakes. A breakaway in the 85th minute could turn your boring game into an unforgettable winner. Let’s not ignore the tactical side, either. Modern football is dominated by data—xG (expected goals), possession stats, heat maps, you name it. Managers have favorite strategies, and players have tendencies. If you know a team plays high-pressing football and forces their opposition into mistakes, you can predict more shots on target. Conversely, a deep-lying defensive team might make it hard for the opposition to rack up too many clean strikes. Understanding this layer of the game gives you an edge over casual bettors. Of course, no betting discussion is complete without mentioning discipline. It’s easy to get carried away when your favorite player is involved, but always remember: stats over sentiment. Cristiano Ronaldo may be a legend, but is he averaging enough shots on target lately to justify a bet? If the numbers say yes, go for it. If not, save your money. Betting smart is always more satisfying than betting blindly. Ultimately, shots on target betting isn’t just a wager—it’s an invitation to immerse yourself in the intricacies of the sport. It’s for the fans who yell, “Take the shot!” during every attack, the ones who analyze every match like a scout, and the dreamers who believe every counterattack is a chance for greatness. It’s the perfect blend of passion, strategy, and adrenaline. So, the next time your team lines up for kickoff, why not make every shot count?"

<h1>Canucks Triumph Over Bruins, Thanks to DeBrusk's Stellar Return and Lankinen's Impenetrable Guard</h1>
<p>In a riveting display of skill and strategy, the <a href=""https://21sports.com/petterssons-power-play-prowess-propels-canucks-over-flames/"">Vancouver Canucks</a> clinched a 2-0 victory against the <a href=""https://21sports.com/pastrnaks-late-strike-seals-bruins-thrilling-comeback-victory-over-blues/"">Boston Bruins</a> on a chilly Tuesday night. The Canucks were powered by Jake DeBrusk's impressive power-play goal and Kevin Lankinen's formidable guard with 32 saves.</p>
<h2>DeBrusk's Exciting Homecoming</h2>
<p>Returning to Boston after seven seasons, DeBrusk, now a Canucks' star, reminded the Bruins what they're missing. He skillfully poked a rebound 5:53 into the second period, marking his third goal in two games and his 16th point in November alone. DeBrusk had recently shown his prowess by scoring twice and assisting once in a narrow 4-3 victory against Ottawa on Saturday.</p>
<h2>Lankinen's Unyielding Defense</h2>
<p>Lankinen's exceptional performance was a critical part of the Canucks' victory. He impressively blocked 13 shots in the second period, followed by another 11 in the third. With about 25 seconds left on the clock, he masterfully thwarted Brad Marchand's attempt to sneak the puck through, securing his second shutout of the season.</p>
<h2>Canucks' Noteworthy Achievements</h2>
<p>The Canucks were also buoyed by the return of forward Brock Boeser, who had been sidelined for seven games due to an upper-body injury sustained on November 7. The team celebrated their eighth consecutive road victory and improved their record to 5-2-2 when they score first. DeBrusk's hot streak continued with him racking up five points in his last five games.</p>
<h3>Bruins Struggle Under Interim Leadership</h3>
<p>The Bruins, now led by interim coach Joe Sacco after Jim Montgomery's recent firing, fell to 2-1. They struggled to make a mark during the game, being held shotless during their fourth power play, which was met with audible frustration from the home crowd.</p>
<h3>Key Game Moments and Stats</h3>
<p>The game's pivotal moment came when Boeser was penalized for interference midway through the third period. However, the Canucks turned the tables and dominated the next two minutes, leaving the Bruins scoreless. In terms of stats, Vancouver outperformed Boston in hits (30-29) and blocked shots (26-11).</p>
<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
<p>The Canucks are set to face off against Pittsburgh on Wednesday night, while the Bruins will be visiting the New York Islanders. The thrilling season continues, and hockey fans are eagerly awaiting the results.</p>

MacKenzie Weegar demonstrated some impressive playmaking skills with three assists.</p>
<h2>Jonathan Huberdeau Achieves Milestone, Dustin Wolf Shines Between the Pipes</h2>
<p>Jonathan Huberdeau, another star for the Flames, hit a significant milestone by bagging his 500th career assist. In the net, Dustin Wolf stood tall, blocking 27 shots, marking his third consecutive victory.</p>
<p>For the Rangers, Alexis Lafreniere and Will Cuylle found the back of the net in a quick succession of just 16 seconds in the second period.

<h3>Key Play: Zary's Game-Changing Goal</h3>
<p>The game-changing moment came at 10:34 of the third period when Zary, who had been active on the ice throughout the game, shrugged off a challenge from Kaapo Kakko. He managed to lift the puck over Shesterkin, scoring what would be the game-winning goal.</p>

<p>The Flames showcased their best first period of the season, outshooting the Rangers 20-5. Despite this, they held only a slim one-goal lead heading into the second period. Their power play, which had been lackluster in November, came alive and produced an essential goal for the second game in a row.</p>
<p>The Rangers, on the other hand, relied heavily on their goalkeeper Shesterkin to keep them in the game. Their progress was hindered by four penalties within the first 29 minutes, stalling their momentum.</p>

<p>The Flames achieved a feat of 20-plus shots in the first period for the first time since October 25, 2022, when they registered a similar number against Pittsburgh.</p>
<h2>What's Next for Flames and Rangers?</h2>
<p>The Flames will be looking to continue their winning streak at home against the Minnesota Wild on Saturday. The Rangers will conclude their four-game road trip on the same day, facing off against the Edmonton Oilers.</p>

This tied him with Mike Liut's franchise record.</p>
<h2>Standout Performances</h2>

<h1>Colorado Avalanche Triumphs Over Washington Capitals in Nail-Biting Encounter</h1>
<h2>Miles Wood Fires Avalanche to Victory</h2>
<p>In an electrifying Thursday night showdown, Colorado Avalanche clinched a tight 2-1 win over <a href=""https://21sports.com/capitals-dominate-avalanche-in-thrilling-5-2-victory-a-night-of-twists-and-triumphs/"">Washington Capitals</a>, with Miles Wood playing the hero as his third-period goal became the decider. Mikko Rantanen, another Avalanche star, also found the net, marking the team's fifth victory in their last six outings.</p>
<h2>Alexandar Georgiev Continues Winning Streak</h2>
<p>Alexandar Georgiev, the formidable Avalanche goaltender, demonstrated his mettle with an awe-inspiring performance that saw him repel 29 shots. This marked his fourth consecutive win after returning from an upper-body injury that sidelined him for two games.</p>
<h2>Capitals Feel the Absence of Ovechkin</h2>
<p>For the Capitals, it was Pierre-Luc Dubois who scored, but the team's winning spree came to an abrupt end, halting at three victories. Logan Thompson, the Capitals goalkeeper, experienced his maiden regulation loss of the season with 25 saves. Earlier, the team was dealt a significant blow as Alex Ovechkin, their superstar, was ruled out for four to six weeks due to a broken left fibula, sustained during their Monday clash against Utah.</p>
<h3>Avalanche's Takeaways</h3>
<p>Despite Nathan MacKinnon failing to score for the second time in three games — both against the Capitals — Rantanen maintained his impressive form, securing points in five of his last six games.</p>
<h3>Capitals' Takeaways</h3>
<p>Without Ovechkin's presence, the Capitals found it difficult to generate momentum offensively. Their usually effective power play, often energized by their captain, went 0 for 2.</p>
<h2>Key Moment of the Match</h2>
<p>The defining moment came just 3:29 into the third period when Wood, positioned at the front of the net, deflected Cale Makar's point shot, sending it past Thompson for the lead.</p>
<h2>Crucial Statistic</h2>
<p>A telling statistic dating back to the 2021-22 season reveals that the Capitals have a dismal 4-14 record without <a href=""https://21sports.com/ovechkins-decisive-strike-propels-capitals-to-victory-over-predators/"">Ovechkin</a> in the team. At the time of his injury, the captain was leading the league with 15 goals, only 27 short of Wayne Gretzky's record.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>The Avalanche is set to square off against the reigning Stanley Cup champions, Florida, on Saturday, while the Capitals will host New Jersey.</p>

<h1>Golden Knights Prevail Over Senators in Hard-Fought Match</h1>
<p>In a hockey game that kept fans on the edge of their seats, the Vegas Golden Knights claimed victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/tkachuks-overtime-magic-propels-senators-to-victory-over-bruins/"">Ottawa Senators</a> with a nail-biting 3-2 score on Thursday night. Ilya Samsonov, who had let in 10 goals over his last two games, bounced back with a remarkable performance, pulling off 38 saves.</p>
<h2>Samsonov's Key Saves Halt Senators' Attack</h2>
<p>Despite the Senators' aggressive play, Samsonov held strong, making crucial saves against formidable players like Josh Norris, David Perron, Tim Stutzle, and Brady Tkachuk. The Senators (8-10-1) find themselves trapped in a four-game losing streak, having scored just two goals throughout their last three games.</p>
<h2>Golden Knights Gain the Upper Hand</h2>
<p>In the initial phase of the game, the Golden Knights (12-6-2) seized control when Linus Ullmark made a spectacular diving save but failed to reposition quickly enough. This left Jack Eichel with an unhindered shot to the net, marking his sixth goal this season. Brett Howden extended their lead to 2-0 in the mid-second period, slipping a goal past Ullmark, who had 29 saves in the game.</p>
<h3>Sensational Third-Period Action</h3>
<p>Adam Gaudette managed to get one past Samsonov 7:17 into the third period, narrowing the lead. However, the Senators' joy was short-lived as Pavel Dorofeyev restored the two-goal lead just two minutes later. Drake Batherson kept the Senators' hopes alive, scoring a goal off a Jake Sanderson rebound with a little over seven minutes left. Despite the Senators outshooting the Golden Knights 18-5 in the third period, they fell short of a comeback.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways and Statistics</h2>
<p>A recurring issue for the Senators has been their habit of conceding the first goal, which has led to eight consecutive losses and a dismal 1-9-1 record when they let in the first goal. On the other hand, the Golden Knights capitalized on an ill-timed Ottawa line change, delivering a swift counter-strike leading to Howden's goal. The Golden Knights have an impressive 12-1-1 track record against the Senators since their entry into the league in 2017.</p>
<h3>What's Next for Both Teams?</h3>
<p>Looking ahead, the Senators are gearing up to host the Vancouver Canucks on Saturday night, while the Golden Knights prepare to face off against the Montreal Canadiens on Saturday afternoon.</p>

<h2>Jesper Bratt's Stellar Performance</h2>
<p>Jesper Bratt emerged as the star of the night, scoring twice and assisting another, aiding the <a href=""https://21sports.com/devils-break-panthers-winning-streak-in-nhl-showdown/"">New Jersey Devils</a> in their 4-2 victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/necas-last-minute-heroics-propel-hurricanes-to-seventh-consecutive-victory-over-persistent-flyers/"">Carolina Hurricanes</a> on Thursday. The match saw an impressive display from Devils' defenseman Dougie Hamilton, who seized the lead for the team, 3-2, with just 9:25 left on the clock. This happened after Carolina's Andrei Svechnikov evened the score 12 seconds into the final period.</p>
<p>Bratt managed his tenth goal of the season and his second in the game during a power play, which happened with 5:55 left on the clock. This goal marked the fourth for the Devils. The opening score for Carolina came from Jack Roslovic at 8:43 into the first, but Bratt quickly evened it out with 5:15 remaining in the same period.</p>
<h2>Highlights and Key Players</h2>

<p>The Devils' victory was also supported by Jacob Markstrom's 20 saves, while Spencer Martin of the Hurricanes managed 17.</p>
<h2>New Jersey's Takeaways and Carolina's Setback</h2>
<p>Jack Hughes, with three assists under his belt, maintained his robust performance for New Jersey. He is currently second on the team with 25 points, including eight goals.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Hurricanes announced on the same day that veteran goaltender Frederik Andersen is scheduled for knee surgery and will be absent for the next eight to 12 weeks. Andersen, with a record of 3-1-0 this season, will be sorely missed, as Martin fell to a 1-2-0 record.</p>
<h3>Crucial Moments and Stats</h3>
<p>A key moment in the game was when Markstrom denied all seven shots aimed by Carolina in the second period, maintaining it as a one-goal contest. The Devils showed their home prowess with a record of 5-3-2, and an impressive 8-4-0 on the road.</p>

<h1>A Nail-biting Victory for Detroit Red Wings against New York Islanders</h1>
<p>In a thrilling showdown, <a href=""https://21sports.com/lucas-raymond-inks-lucrative-eight-year-contract-with-detroit-red-wings/"">Lucas Raymond</a>'s incredible goal in the final seconds helped the Detroit Red Wings to a 2-1 victory over the <a href=""https://21sports.com/islanders-thrilling-rally-overcoming-penguins-in-post-regulation-showdown/"">New York Islanders</a> on Thursday evening. Jonatan Berggren's crucial equalizer also played a pivotal role in breaking Detroit's run of three consecutive losses. The Red Wings' goaltender, Alex Lyon, displayed a remarkable performance with 22 saves.</p>
<p>For the Islanders, the only ray of hope came from Simon Holmstrom, who managed to score the sole goal for his team, unable to reverse their pattern of losses with five out of their last six games ending in defeat. Despite a valiant effort with 29 saves, Islanders' goalie Ilya Sorokin couldn't prevent the defeat.</p>
<h2>The Turning Points of the Game</h2>
<p>Holmstrom sparked the Islanders' spirits by scoring the first goal of the match at 5:51 of the first period, marking his third goal of the season. However, Berggren, with just 4:46 left in the game, managed to level the score with his third goal of the season. The decisive moment came when Raymond, with a skillful assist from Dylan Larkin, netted the puck from the left circle, beating Sorokin's glove with just 51 seconds to spare.</p>
<h3>Key Takeaways from the Game</h3>
<p>The Islanders, despite having the league's worst penalty-kill entering the game, successfully thwarted three power plays from the Red Wings, who boast the second-best power play in the league. Sorokin was instrumental in this, making six crucial saves.</p>
<p>In contrast, Raymond, who had an impressive tally of 31 goals last season, ended his scoring drought with a game-winning goal in the final minute, providing a much-needed boost to the Red Wings.</p>
<h2>Flashback and Key Statistics</h2>
<p>Recalling the teams' first encounter last month, which saw the Red Wings triumph with a 1-0 victory thanks to Patrick Kane's first-period goal, it seemed history might repeat itself with Holmstrom's early goal. However, the Red Wings turned the tide with two goals in the final five minutes of the game.</p>
<p>A noteworthy stat from the game revolves around the Red Wings' knack for comebacks last season, boasting an 11-24-3 record when trailing after two periods. This season, however, they had a 0-8-0 record when down after two periods, a statistic they managed to overturn with their late rally in this game.</p>
<h3>What's Next for the Teams?</h3>
<p>Looking forward, the Islanders will be hosting St. Louis on Saturday, while the Red Wings will welcome Boston to their home ground.</p>

Amid this football frenzy, Tavia’s call to uphold local traditions forms a heartwarming counterbalance, reminding everyone of the magic that exists beyond the stadium lights. This harmony between sports and community traditions is what makes Kansas City truly special, linking every touchdown and every breathtaking display of lights into a beautifully woven story. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Witnessing the jubilation surrounding the Chiefs aligns perfectly with the Hunt family spirit, as they embrace not just the celebrations inherent in a sports victory, but also the rituals that foster togetherness. Tavia Hunt’s affectionate nod to the Plaza Lights is about forming connections and the aesthetics of holiday cheer. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad In their last game against the Raiders, the Chiefs did what they are known to do the best. They edged out the Raiders with a 19-17 win in this epic Black Friday showdown and gave the perfect Thanksgiving gift to their fans and family. Patrick Mahomes also added another milestone to his career during the same game as he became the fastest QB to reach 100 wins. And boy that isn’t an easy record to make! It wasn’t easy for the Chiefs as well to seal their victory as they were struggling in the red zone. Despite the struggles and the hardships, Mahomes’ leadership and gritty defensive effort kept things from falling apart. For the Raiders, their rookie tight end Brock Bowers completely stole the show, even if it was a loss. He racked up 140 receiving yards and a touchdown. His explosive plays helped in keeping the game competitive but it all ended in a loss for the team. With the loss, the Raiders now fall at 2-10, despite their flashes of potential hinting for some better days ahead. Let the world know your perspective.

I’m going to the other team.” Man, UCF just ain’t having it this year. The Knights end the season with a disappointing 4-8 run, and it’s kind of wild when you think about it because Gus Malzahn probably had one of the strongest run games in the country. This entire KJ Jefferson and RJ Harvey pairing is dangerous and can easily bring in points for the Knights. So what even happened? Think about it: it’s not like UCF had a tough schedule, and Gus Malzahn had a lot on his shoulders. You know the worst part about all of this? This entire 4-8 reminds us of another team that was standing on this exact fate last season. Now, it is hilarious that the team we talked about right now, a 4-star commit from there, is now laughing at what Gus Malzahn has decided to do. Buffs commit Christian Hudson took to his Instagram story to share the latest report of Malzahn resigning from UCF with the caption; “Wow”. This entire situation is hilarious. The season affected the HC so badly that he decided to de-rank himself and take the offensive coordinator post at the Seminoles. USA Today via Reuters Dec 2, 2023; Charlotte, NC, USA; Florida State Seminoles head coach Mike Norvell looks on during the fourth quarter against the Louisville Cardinals at Bank of America Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Jim Dedmon-USA TODAY Sports You know what’s worse? The fact that the Seminoles have done WORSE than UCF this season. Dude, Mike Norvell and Co. are 2-9 this year. Imagine that. Now will this Malzahn hiring do anything good for Florida State? ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Well, from the play calling and the decision-making we saw him do with the Knights, it doesn’t look like Florida State will gain a lot from this hiring. Malzahn will be taking Norvell’s job of play calling from the 2025 season and we will have to wait and watch how it pans out. Now the question is, why did Malzahn decide to do this? Well, short and simple answer: he was going to be on a hot seat in 2025. It was either “get fired” or “resign,” and he chose the smart way out of this mess. Another thing we would love to point out is that with the season ending, there is a high chance that Norvell could end up losing his job as well. He has done pretty much nothing this season and we might end up seeing a familiar coach at the HC spot on the Seminoles. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Okay, this might sound like some wild fan theory so put on your tin foil hats. Deion Sanders. The Buffs are on a 9-win season and no one out there could’ve thought that this was possible. After the entire 4-8 fiasco last year, people were quick to label Deion Sanders and Co. as a “playing for click” team. Did Gus Malzahn just jump from the frying pan into the fire with Florida State's 2-9 record? Debate Now see, one of the BIGGEST Coach Prime hater, Paul Finebaum, changed his perspective about Deion. Finebaum agreed that he was wrong to call Deion Sanders “Hollywood” but he also suggested another idea. “Deion couldn’t even get a call from Florida State a couple of years ago. But to be fair, what had he done then? Right, he’s now one of the hottest coaches in the country,” Finebaum mentioned back on ESPN. Now is this a good idea? ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Well, if Coach Prime manages to bring in the same magic for the Seminoles then yes it could work but this is just a theory. See, for Deion Sanders to work and show his full potential, you have to hand him over the entire program, and pretty sure Florida State won’t do that. Colorado had faith and that paid off with a $100 million jackpot.  Let the world know your perspective.

Erin Andrews, the renowned sports journalist, recently found herself caught in this web during a seemingly simple phone call while ordering a smoothie. This innocent act drew sharp reactions from social media, leading her to rally back with her signature blend of humor and honesty.  The essence of the drama unraveled during a chat on her podcast, “Calm Down with Erin and Charissa,” where her co-host, Charissa Thompson, playfully called her out. “On the phone with me, while you were ordering a smoothie,” Charissa stated. Andrews, owning up to the moment, replied, “I agree with all of these comments and concerns.” Among the critics, one notable naysayer, @bobthebuilder63, didn’t hold back. He deemed her phone interaction “rude.“ Andrews, not missing a beat, quipped back, “I’m not Yammering. I am speaking quietly, whispering in my hand.” And honestly, who hasn’t been in a similar situation, trying to balance life’s hectic pace with the need to stay connected? With a candid shrug, she confessed, “I feel like I’ve let America down, so I will take responsibility and say I gotta clean up my act.”  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Erin’s light-hearted approach transformed a minor controversy into a relatable moment, showcasing the tightrope walked by those in the spotlight. No matter how insignificant it may seem, the expectations placed upon public figures can morph any action—like ordering a smoothie—into a public affair.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad However, the smoothie saga was just the tip of the iceberg. Erin soon switched gears to tackle the unsettling reality of privacy breaches that often permeate her world. In a revealing segment, she recounted a disappointing exchange with a salesman who crossed several lines. “Hey, I got this and this and this. Let me know if you’re interested,” the salesman texted, seemingly unaware of her busy life. You can almost hear the exasperation in her voice when she said, “First of all, Hi guys, On Sundays…I can’t get back to you.” As the texts piled up, Andrews recounted her breaking point. After his sixth message, she finally replied, “Hey, I’m sorry. I’m working on a game right now. I can’t get back to you.” The audacity continued when the salesman fired back with, “Hey, just out of curiosity, what game are you working on?” That was it for her. Andrews and Charissa shared a frustrated laugh, exclaiming, “No, enough.” This exchange underscores a troubling truth: the line between professionalism and personal boundaries can often blur, leaving individuals feeling vulnerable. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Adding fuel to the fire, Andrews then recounted another eyebrow-raising incident that unfolded during a game broadcast. After acknowledging the heat’s toll on her from long hours on the sidelines, a curious fan postulated about her appearance, saying, “Erin Andrews, you look so great, you have this glow. What’re you using?” Her witty response was cutting: “It’s called sweat…I need a shower.” Just when she thought the conversation would end there, someone chimed in with a cringe-worthy remark, suggesting, “It’s hot flashes.” The irritation was palpable as she snapped back, “Shut the—shut up! It’s outside for five hours, enough!” Do public figures like Erin Andrews deserve more privacy, or is scrutiny part of the job? Debate Throughout these trials, Andrews has turned uncomfortable moments into opportunities for connection. In an age where every action is magnified under the spotlight, her approach—infused with humor and vulnerability—invites us all to reflect on the sometimes challenging dance of public life. Whether discussing smoothies or sweat, Andrews proves that behind the polished exterior is a genuine voice speaking out. Let the world know your perspective.

Leave it alone guys. Ryan Day single-handedly made OSU have one of the best seasons this year but also one of the worst endings of this year. You call this the team that is supposed to win the national championship? Boy, oh boy, is it a bad day to be an OSU fan. Losing 13-10 to a washed-up Michigan team had to be the worst thing on your resume. With this loss, Ryan Day has managed to secure one thing; The Hoosiers game for the Buckeyes is their national championship game. Whatever comes after that is just a joke. While Jim Harbaugh has left Sherrone Moore to fend for himself, it’s good to see that his children are still here to take Michigan’s side. Back on his Instagram story, James Harbaugh, Jim’s son, took a jab at OSU. James shared a clip with the caption; “Ohio State players fighting after they lose… Where was that during the game?” Well, he ain’t wrong. During the entire showdown, Day’s offense had nothing on the Michigan defensive line. But somehow, they have the energy to brawl. Wild. Keep in mind that going into this rivalry game, Moore was severely handicapped. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Michigan didn’t even have Colston Loveland on the turf because of his injury. This alone makes the entire Michigan run game invalid as Davis Warner has no one to connect with. And yet the Wolverines managed to bring in 172 rushing yards against a team that has been doing quite well on the defense. Even Jim’s daughter had taken to her Instagram story early on to shout out the Wolverines, and it looks like it paid off well. Not only does this loss bring OSU down from their 2nd spot in the CFP, but it also shatters Day’s hope of playing in the Big 10 title game. If Hoosiers or Penn State win their games today, there is no shot OSU is making it. But let’s skip past that and talk about something serious. While whatever James said is all fun and games, this entire fight thing is not a good look for Michigan football. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Did Ryan Day's OSU choke under pressure, or was Michigan just too strong this time? Debate The entire “brawl” broke out in the first place because Derrick Moore from the Wolverines thought it would be an amazing idea to plant the Michigan flag on the OSU field. Yeah, any person with an above-average IQ can guess that this is not a good move. This entire thing caused a massive fight to break out on the gridiron. Kind of reminiscent of the entire fight that happened during the Michigan v Michigan State game. But here is the thing; the outcome will not be good. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad There is a high chance Moore could face a suspension or other players can also face one as well. The police got involved last time. We still gotta wait and see what decision the Big 10 decides to take for this entire debacle.  Let the world know your perspective.

Copyright: xJakubxPorzyckix originalFilename:porzycki-f1grandp230618_npPEu.jpg Is 2024 going to be the last year for Sergio Perez driving for Red Bull Racing in Formula 1? Checo’s struggles throughout the season have been well documented, and by no means he looked like a driver who could support Max Verstappen. Red Bull might have clinched the driver’s championship, but they are not in contention when it comes to the Constructor’s title. Star power is certainly good to have, but it amounts to nothing if it can’t function as a unit, and right now Perez does seem to be the odd one out. It has to be noted that Perez signed a two-year contract extension with Red Bull back in June. While there’s an air of uncertainty surrounding Checo’s future with the team, he is optimistic that he will weather this storm. “There’s a reason why we extended my contract during the year, and the team has everything… So we’re working really hard as a team to come through and get back into a much better season than the one that we just had.” He was quoted saying on Formula 1’s official website. Well, optimism alone cannot guarantee a driver his seat at the top level of racing. And going by Sergio Perez’s Sprint performance in Qatar, he certainly is testing the patience of the Red Bull Racing team. After a dull sprint qualifying outing on Friday, Perez had to start the Sprint race from the pit lane. But as the light went green, he wasn’t quick on gas. Rather, his race car groggily made a launch. Franco Calopinto, who was behind Perez, seized the opportunity and made an easy pass starting from the pit lane itself. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad via Imago PEREZ Sergio (mex), Red Bull Racing RB18, portrait VERSTAPPEN Max (ned), Red Bull Racing RB18, portrait HORNER Christian (gbr), Team Principal of Red Bull Racing, portrait during the Formula 1 Grand Prix de Monaco 2022, 7th round of the 2022 FIA Formula One World Championship, WM, Weltmeisterschaft on the Circuit de Monaco, from May 27 to 29, 2022 in Monte-Carlo, Monaco – F1 – MONACO GRAND PRIX 2022 – Race DPPI/Panoramic PUBLICATIONxNOTxINxFRAxITAxBEL 00122019__B3_0343 Needless to say, Perez will need a mighty big improvement in the qualifying and the main event. However, the fans weren’t sold on giving him another chance and highlighted how this was just one of his regular errors that Red Bull would turn a blind eye to after the end of the race weekend. Perez started the 2024 season on a high. With four podium finishes in the first five races, he looked to be the real deal. But as F1 shifted to Europe, his team suddenly started to struggle to find speed. And as the season is slowly edging towards its conclusion, his performances have plummeted. He has scored just three points in the last three Grand Prix, and it’s just hard to imagine that Red Bull is willing to put up with this. Reacting to his blunder in Qatar, a fan replied, “Every week is like a new rock bottom now for him, lol.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad “Anything regarding the drivers… We have drivers under contract, and we have drivers with options that remain between the company and the drivers involved.” This was Red Bull team boss Christian Horner’s response to questions about Perez’s future with the team. 252 points is the current difference between Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez, but despite the clear evidence, it seems like Red Bull is willing to give Checo another opportunity. Making a hypothetical claim, this race fan sarcastically wrote, “I’ve seen enough; give Checo another 2-year extension. Red Bull, probably.” Is Sergio Perez's time at Red Bull Racing running out, or can he still turn it around? Debate Interestingly, Perez is among the highest-paid drivers in the F1 paddock. His annual salary is reported to be around $14 million, which excludes bonuses and other variables. But is the cream worth it when his team’s fans are turned up against him? He certainly has become meme material for the rival camps, and they torment him on social media after his mistakes on the track. He certainly has managed to let this trolling and criticism get to his head, but for how long? “If i’m in his shoes, doesn’t matter how much money i’m making i will just retire from F1 after that moment,” a user on Reddit added. Is there a possibility that Sergio Perez is intentionally trying to jeopardize Red Bull racing? It is indeed hard to say for certain. But, going by this fan’s theory, it looks like Checo has accepted his fate, knowing that he is probably going to be out of the seat for 2025. “Either he knows his seat is gone or that he’ll be fired when his contract runs out.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad American F1 fans, on the other hand, made the most of this blunder by Checo and pitched a hilarious proposal. RCR’s star driver Kyle Busch has also lost his mojo, and his performances in 2024 were perhaps the worst of his racing career. Like Perez, Rowdy was also rumored to jump ships at the end of 2024. And going by this race fan’s comments, he just might be Red Bull’s next driver. “Rumor has Kyle Busch has been in talks with Red Bull, totally a rumor that i just made up but how awesome would that be.” What are your thoughts on Sergio Perez and his situation at Red Bull? Does he deserve another shot, or does the team need to find his replacement? Let the world know your perspective.

Especially as the Kansas City Chiefs barely edged out the Las Vegas Raiders in a thrilling 19-17 face-off! But amidst the fierce competition and adrenaline-packed moments? The real talk stemmed not just from the game itself, but from the playful banter and camaraderie among the top reporting talents. Enter Charissa Thompson, who took to Instagram post-game to celebrate Chiefs’ star Chris Jones with a cheeky shoutout. “Appreciate you #95 Funny Bunny 😂.” The moment captured the essence of postgame joy. A light-hearted expression of admiration for a player who didn’t just show up but truly delivered! From a lively field at Arrowhead Stadium, this interaction reflects the deeper connections that form within the sports world. But the fun didn’t stop there. Erin Andrews, Charissa’s long-time friend, chimed in with a cheeky comment. “How Much Do You Love Chris Jones?” Erin’s playful jab brought a spark of friendly rivalry into the mix. And that highlighted the dynamics of camaraderie and competition that characterize the lives of sports reporters. Now, let’s snap back to the gridiron’s heart and highlight Chris Jones, the man of the hour. His performance against the Raiders was nothing short of spectacular. With three solid tackles, he proved himself a linchpin for the Chiefs’ defense. Speaking to Charissa post-game, Jones mentioned how critical the energy from the crowd was, stating, “The center snapped the ball without the quarterback being ready, and we were able to recover.” This wasn’t merely luck; it showcased the sheer power of team spirit along with the advantage of home-field noise, which riled up the fans into a thunderous backdrop that disrupted the Raiders’ offense. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad What’s fascinating here is the concept termed the “Chris Jones effect.” This notion is a nod to how his leadership influences the game and galvanizes the home crowd into a frenzy that can alter game outcomes. As the festive atmosphere filled Arrowhead, Jones seemed to embody that spirit, surely vindicated by Thompson’s playful shoutout.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad But, my friends, if you thought the highlights ended at the game, think again! Just days before, Thompson had seamlessly transitioned from covering a snowy spectacle in Cleveland to the primetime action with the Chiefs. During a cold, exhilarating match between the Browns and Steelers, she and her crew dove joyfully into the winter wonderland, celebrating the electrifying energy of the moment, where they flung snowballs and made snow angels like a bunch of kids in the yard.  Now, here’s where it gets interesting! Andrews found herself secretly wishing for the same opportunity. When the two sat down on their “Calm Down with Erin and Charissa” podcast, Erin opened up about her feelings of jealousy, reminiscing about the fun her friend had in the snow. “I was so jealous that you were working a game like this,” she said. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Thompson’s take? “The snow made everything ten times more fun,” she insisted, her voice laced with delight as they recapped the playful chaos of slippery slides and merry snowball fights. Erin couldn’t help but admire it all, sipping her drink while wishing she’d been right there, shaping memorable moments among the snowflakes too.  Did Chris Jones' performance prove he's the real MVP for the Chiefs this season? Debate As the season rolls on and the playoffs approach, Thompson, Andrews, and Jones remind us that there’s far more to football than just passing yards and touchdowns. With laughter echoing through the stadium and banter spirited away in podcast studios? The NFL is as much about the laughs and heartfelt moments shared among its stars and reporters.

I feel like Islam, Oliveira, and me are the top three in the lightweight division right now because Charles has beaten everyone in the top 15.” He went on to praise both Makhachev and Oliveira, adding, “But when I become champion, I’d like to defend my title against Charles because our first fight was pretty close, and a lot of people think it was close.

A bunch of Bama athletes who have been under the heavy watch include Bray Hubbard, a 6-foot-2 sophomore, who has been under the shadow of other frontline defensive backs so far. The game against the Tigers hands him a great chance to show the world what he brings to the table. The kid has a convincing stat to back up the expectation floating around him. Hubbard amassed a total of 44 tackles, two pass deflections, two interceptions, and one forced fumble so afraid in the season. Before he adds a lot of value to his resume after today’s finish at Bryant-Denny stadium, let’s take you through the brief life map of this Crimson Tide safety. We know how much the fans have been mad at Kalen DeBoer’s Alabama after they blew up their slim playoff hope with an upset loss over Oklahoma Sooners last week. They have literally nothing to lose in this Iron Bowl except Kalen DeBoer’s million-dollar job. But Alabama football is not just about a single season. They will revamp for sure not immediately, but definitely. That’s when, Bray Hubbard, the young adult will be the guy to turn your head to. He’s a player to bet a dime for. Hubbard is living his second season with the Crimson Tide. He’s a former four-star athlete in the 2023 class from Ocean Springs, Mississippi. Within a very short span, he’s already making a name for himself and earning the trust of the veterans, including coach Kalen DeBoer, who picked him up as Keon Sabb’s replacement during the crucial Tennessee game. A few weeks back, he recorded seven tackles and the first-ever interception of his career against the Missouri Tigers, stealing the players of the week tag in late October. He was also rated the highest grade SEC safety from week 9. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad       A post shared by Brayson Hubbard (@bhub___5)  Mr. Mississippi football had an early start to his career at Ocean Springs High School. After spending some productive years under the school banner, the prodigy received a ton of offers from big leagues like Alabama, FAU, Mississippi State, Tulane, and more. The kid has a loving family as his rock solid, the foundation of a top-tier career and a healthy, happy life. Although he lost his mother in his early teens, Hubbard has since been carrying her essence with him. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Can Bray Hubbard be the savior Alabama needs, or is he just another overhyped prospect? Debate Brayson Hubbard made a unique gesture in the memory of his mum. He took special permission from coach Saban to wear a pink headband to games. His mother, Courtney, had died of cancer when the kid was in his seventh grade. The loving lady, a responsible school teacher, and an affectionate mother made a permanent void in his son’s life. ‘‘I want to make her smile every game. I want to make her happy no matter what,’‘ Hubbard said in a local media outlet while discussing his pink band obsession. The athlete said he loves to wear the band, as it was his mum’s favorite. Even before Nick Saban signed the Mississippi native, fans started to visualize the champ taking off his helmet and the band and shaking the opponent’s hand after clinching a gusty win with his mother smiling from above. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad If you, in case wonder about the root of his on-point athletic sense and the impromptu skills, it’s in his blood. Yes, you heard it right. Father Mark Hubbard has served 15 long years as the OSHS Athletics director. He had also a high-yielding tenure as OSHS’s head boys’ basketball coach. He had entirely changed the trajectory of Ocean Springs football, taking it through a slew of improvements. He stepped away from the year in late 2022 with a heart full of cherished memories. Brayson was under his dad’s scrutiny during his high school days. Now he expanded the horizon, he had his legendary father cheering from the gallery or home during any game. The time is almost there. Hubbard is getting out of his Newbee’s cocoon. Soon, you can see him on the top. Roll boy, it’s your time to shine! Let the world know your perspective.

The dismissal of Matt Eberflus marks a significant departure from the franchise’s traditionally conservative approach, signaling perhaps a long-overdue embrace of change. Former Los Angeles coach Sean McVay had a powerful message for Caleb Williams and the Bears regarding their interim new coach, Thomas Brown. On Saturday, Jourdan Rodrigue posted this on his X account. McVay praised Brown, saying, “He has always been a guy that had incredible command.” He added that Brown “commands respect by the way he handles himself—and he gives it back.” Those are some pretty strong words! It sounds like he’s ready to reciprocate everything that comes his way. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Here is part of Sean McVay’s lengthy comments today on former Rams RBs/TEs and asst. head coach Thomas Brown, who he also played against in high school. Brown became the Bears’ interim HC today: pic.twitter.com/tTvYGscqkU — Jourdan Rodrigue (@JourdanRodrigue) November 29, 2024 Expand Tweet  He also mentioned that Thomas has a lot of respect for Coach Eberflus. He said the guys would follow his lead, which would show in the next game, but what’s the deal with this new coach drama? Matt Eberflus, the Chicago Bears’ head coach for three years, was fired on Friday. The team fired him after they suffered six consecutive losses, three of which were nail-biters. This leaves the Bears with a disappointing 4-8 record for the season. In a statement, Poles mentioned that they informed Matt of their decision to pursue a new leadership direction for the team after discussions with Chairman George McCuskey and President-CEO Kevin Warren. They acknowledged Matt’s dedication and professionalism, wishing him and his family well. Did the Bears make the right call firing Eberflus mid-season, or was it a hasty decision? Debate Eberflus was dismissed shortly after a final press conference where he said, “Everything will go on as normal,” followed by comments about preparing for the upcoming game against the 49ers. However, his position was already shaky. After starting his coaching career with a win against the 49ers, Eberflus’s record has since dropped to 13-32. His firing came after a narrow 23-20 defeat to the Detroit Lions. Thomas Brown, who was the pass game coordinator, will take over as the interim head coach for the team. This could be a great opportunity for him to showcase his skills, as he’s also viewed as a potential coaching candidate for 2025. But hold on! What if Caleb Williams was the ultimate plot twist in Matt Eberflus’s story? The drama is heating up, and you won’t want to miss it! Sean’s strong message to Caleb Williams highlights the frustration Bears fans feel about the communication issues between Williams and coach Eberflus. Williams admitted, “I don’t have a direct line to the coach. When calls come in, it takes time to get aligned.” While he’s trying hard to step up as a leader, his overzealous approach is adding more pressure to a team that’s already struggling. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Caleb only caught five of fifteen passes for thirty-four yards in a difficult contest against Detroit. His options were severely constrained by the Lions’ tight-man coverage. This game felt like a rerun of his previous struggles with Shane Waldron, following a respectable overtime showing against Minnesota in Week 12. This situation brought to light a coach who put his team’s quarterback in a difficult situation both before and after the game. With the old HC’s exit, Thomas Brown now faces the task of fixing the Bears’ past errors and bringing them back to life.   ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad    Let the world know your perspective.

   Charles Woodson is one of the select few members to be enshrined in both the Pro Football and College Football Hall of Fame. He is the most recent defensive player to win the Heisman Trophy, having starred for Michigan in 1997. His historic Heisman campaign has been much-discussed recently since the trend of offensive players winning the award could be in danger of ending this year, and former NFL head coach Jon Gruden recently compared one player’s stellar start to his career to that of Woodson’s. Gruden had the honor of drafting Woodson out of Michigan with the fourth overall pick when he was the head coach of the Oakland Raiders in 1998. He recently shared on X that “He could do everything on a football field. When I watch Travis Hunter, I see the same kind of clutch game changer.” We drafted Charles Woodson number four overall. He could do everything on a football field. When I watch Travis Hunter, I see the same kind of clutch game changer.pic.twitter.com/H8GCg5MZTj — Jon Gruden (@BarstoolGruden) November 30, 2024  Hunter is making weekly headlines due to being a two-way star like Woodson, but few have ever shined on both sides of the ball like Hunter is for Colorado. Hunter has 92 receptions for 1,152 yards and 14 touchdowns on offense. He has a rushing touchdown, 31 tackles, and four interceptions on defense. Woodson was a star when he stepped into the NFL and made the Pro Bowl in his first four seasons, including winning Defensive Rookie of the Year and making the first-team All-Pro three times. It’s an honor for any player to be compared to a legend like Woodson, and Hunter has the ability to become the transcendent star Woodson was."

Both the #Giants and #Raiders have been eliminated from playoff contention pic.twitter.com/4q98htQiEF — FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) November 30, 2024  They’re now 2-10 for the season and will battle for the first two picks in the upcoming edition of the NFL Draft. The Giants might have a new General Manager, as some believe Joe Schoen will be let go at the end of the season. Whoever takes over will have an opportunity to hit the reset button, most likely with Colorado star QB Shedeur Sanders at the helm. Brian Daboll will also most likely be let go. The Raiders, on the other hand, will also look to find their new franchise quarterback. If Sanders is gone by the time they’re on the clock, they might pivot to Cam Ward. Whether Antonio Pierce will be there to coach him next season remains to be seen. These two teams entered the season as dark horses to make the playoffs, but that was never the case. They’ve free-fallen over the past two months or so, and judging by the current picture, winning another game this season isn’t in their best interests. This was a tough blow for the fans, but like we’ve seen multiple times, sometimes a team is just one player away from turning the entire franchise around."

   The Las Vegas Raiders were the last team to beat the Kansas City Chiefs at home. That happened almost one year ago. Notably, they were pretty close to doing the same thing on Friday night. Then, a botched snap in the game’s final play prevented them from scoring a potential game-winning field goal. It was hard to explain how the Raiders failed to get a play off, and HC Antonio Pierce believes there was more to it. When asked about the loss, the Raiders coach claimed that the miscommunication came because the players heard a whistle on the sidelines (via Vic Tafur). Antonio Pierce said ""we heard a whistle on our sideline"" on the last play of the game. Team will send a video to the league for review. — Vic Tafur (@VicTafur) November 30, 2024  He added that the team would evaluate the situation and send a video to the league. The fans have argued that the referees have favored the Chiefs for years. Usually, that’s what happens with winning teams; they get most of the 50-50 calls to go their way. Then again, given what Pierce said may have happened, it could be a bit of a stretch. The Chiefs have now won 14 games by one possession, some of which have come down to the wire, catching several lucky breaks. They haven’t looked as sharp this season as they’ve been in the past, and some believe they will finally lose in the playoffs. Nevertheless, people have been saying that about them for two years now, and both previous campaigns ended in the same way: with Patrick Mahomes hoisting the Vince Lombardi trophy."

   Former 3-time National Champion Urban Meyer has favored his new role as a broadcaster for FOX Sports, appearing weekly on their “Big Noon Kickoff” pregame show. Meyer’s character has been questioned plenty of times due to his rocky divorce from the Jacksonville Jaguars and the details that emerged in the fallout, but his new coworkers seem to have taken to him quite well, especially on Saturday morning when he brought NFL Hall of Famer and former Michigan Heisman Trophy winner Charles Woodson a funny gift. A clip from “Big Noon Kickoff” is going viral of Meyer gifting Woodson a beer from the Saucy brand called “Stealing Signs.” Meyer is keeping the Ohio State and Michigan rivalry fresh by giving Woodson a beer. Urban Meyer gives Charles Woodson a Saucy brew works ‘sign stealing’ beer. 🤣🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/i3xiSUK9rL — FFBuck (@FFbuckCLE) November 30, 2024  The crowd behind them on the Ohio State campus loved it, as Meyer brought the team a national championship and couldn’t let Michigan’s recent sign-stealing scandal go unmentioned. Michigan notably won a title last year under Jim Harbaugh, who was suspended three games for assistant Connor Stalions taping opponents without their knowledge. Michigan has won the last three meetings with Ohio State. Michigan won’t have a chance to repeat as national champions this year, while Ohio State is looking like the potential best team in the country and has a legitimate shot at winning another natty. It’s great to see Meyer having a good time with his fellow hosts. There is no word yet on whether Woodson enjoyed the beer."

   Being a great NBA player doesn’t necessarily mean a player would be a great NBA coach. The same goes for the other way around. Some players weren’t meant to coach, and others just don’t want to. At least, not in the pros. Notably, that seems to be the case with Carmelo Anthony. In the latest edition of his “7 PM in Brooklyn” podcast, the legendary forward admitted that he would only like to coach a high school program. The guys see Rondo being an NBA coach someday, but what about themselves? Melo: ""I would take over a high school program … I'd rather put my passion into high school."" Shump: ""I'd wanna take a job in player development."" pic.twitter.com/TxjtP06YsN — 7PM in Brooklyn (@7PMinBrooklyn) November 30, 2024  That makes sense for someone like Melo. He had multiple go-to moves, outstanding footwork, and knew all the tricks as a scorer. He’s also passed the torch and his knowledge to his son, Kiyan, so he knows how to reach out to the next generation. Anthony doesn’t get enough credit for his career. People also seem to forget how different he was as a player when he first entered the league. Melo was a high-flying dunker who made the most of his athleticism to get to his spots. Once that quick burst faded away, he evolved into a strong, bully-ball, spot-up shooter. He had an innate gift for scoring but also had to work tirelessly on his craft to develop ways to stay relevant. Hopefully, he’ll have the opportunity to share his knowledge and expertise with the next generation of hoopers."

   It didn’t take long before LaMelo Ball proved to be a unique NBA player. He took the league by storm right out of the gate. His flashy moves and passes and his unconscious shot-making, which some claimed wouldn’t translate to the pros, made him one of the finest entertainers in the game. That was at an all-time high this season. Unfortunately, once again, injuries may have gotten the best of him. According to a report by Marc J. Spears, the Charlotte Hornets announced that Ball would be re-evaluated in two weeks after being diagnosed with a left calf strain. Hornets say LaMelo Ball has been diagnosed with a left calf strain. He will be reevaluated two weeks from the date the injury occurred on 11/27. Additionally, further evaluation of Tre Mann’s low back soreness has been diagnosed as disc irritation. — Marc J. Spears (@MarcJSpears) November 30, 2024  Calf injuries are tricky; some might lead to more serious ailments. Given the Hornets’ subpar record and Ball’s history of injuries, they would be wise to err on the side of caution here. Ball has missed plenty of time during his young career. Just like his older brother, Lonzo, he can’t seem to stay healthy. Some believe that has a lot to do with the reportedly faulty BBB shoes his father, LaVar, had them wearing earlier in their careers. Ball dropped the then-defunct brand to sign with Puma but struggled to shake off those woes. Despite his team’s disappointing record, Ball played like an All-Star starter this season, averaging 31.1 points, 5.4 rebounds, 6.9 assists, 1.1 steals, and 4.7 three-pointers per game. Hopefully, this won’t be a long-term issue or lead to more injuries, as the game is always better when he is on the court."

   The Tampa Bay Buccaneers mercifully ended a four-game losing streak last week by taking down the New York Giants. They will look to keep things rolling when they face the Carolina Panthers on Sunday. Tampa is fighting for its playoff lives at 5-6, and even though Carolina has been playing better recently, one recent stat shows why Baker could have a big game on Sunday. ProFootballFocus shared on X that Mayfield ranks second in the NFL with 2,424 passing yards from a clean pocket. He’ll be facing a Panthers defense that applies pressure at the lowest rate in the league. Baker Mayfield is primed for a big game against Carolina's pass rush Mayfield ranks 2nd in the NFL with 2,424 passing yards from a clean pocket. He'll be facing a Panthers defense that applies pressure at the lowest rate in the league, giving Mayfield ample time to pick apart pic.twitter.com/d7nYITAB0X — PFF TB Buccaneers (@PFF_Buccaneers) November 29, 2024  The Giants game was Baker’s first of the year without a touchdown pass, and last season, Baker threw just one touchdown in two games against the Panthers. Tampa only scored 30 points in the two wins over Carolina last year, so Baker could be due for a big performance against his former team. The Bucs are only one game back in the NFC South behind the Atlanta Falcons and two behind the Washington Commanders in the Wild Card race. The Bucs’ remaining schedule is highly favorable. They have two games against the Panthers and matchups with the Dallas Cowboys, New Orleans Saints, Las Vegas Raiders, and Los Angeles Chargers. Even though Carolina struggles to rush the passer, the Bucs can’t take this game lightly. The Panthers just narrowly missed extending their win streak to three games last week against the Kansas City Chiefs before losing on a last-second field goal. Getting back to .500 is the Bucs’ first step in firmly reclaiming the NFC South title."

   The Los Angeles Lakers have gone up and down this season. They’re currently 11-8 and in the sixth spot in the Western Conference. Unfortunately, most of those wins have come against not-so-great teams. They have left some serious doubt when they’ve gone against winning teams, and they don’t seem to be a championship-caliber team right now. With that in mind, former NBA champion Kendrick Perkins argued that this might be LeBron James’ final season in the NBA (via Legion Hoops). “It’s looking like this just might be Bron’s last season.” — @KendrickPerkins pic.twitter.com/EAoQM94eaE — Legion Hoops (@LegionHoops) November 30, 2024  Perkins played with LeBron, so perhaps he knows something the rest of us don’t. James has been as good as always this season, averaging 22.3 points, 8.2 rebounds, and 9.1 assists per game on 49% from the floor. Then again, his recent hiatus from social media made it seem that he’s not enjoying this time as much as he used to. Even so, it’s not like he has anything left to prove. He keeps breaking records almost nightly, and if someone still doesn’t think he’s the GOAT, that’s not likely to change any time soon. James fan or not, everybody has to admit that what he’s doing at this age is remarkable. And if he decides to ride into the sunset while still playing at a high level, so be it; he’s earned the right to choose how he goes."

   The New Orleans Pelicans continue to struggle. Injuries have hit them hard, and with the Western Conference so stacked, they might not be able to recover from this. That’s why the Pelicans might be aggressive sellers at the trade deadline. With that in mind, Evan Sidery of Forbes Sports reports that C.J. McCollum has emerged as a likely trade candidate. He’s currently making $33.3 million this season and about to make $30.7 million in the final year of his deal next season. Sidery adds that the market for Brandon Ingram remains “non-existent.” CJ McCollum is a trade candidate to monitor for teams as Brandon Ingram’s market remains nonexistent. McCollum makes $33.3 million before becoming a $30.7 million expiring contract in 2025-26. The Pelicans are likely to pivot towards a reset year amidst their awful 4-16 start. pic.twitter.com/ycB0VxC5Yt — Evan Sidery (@esidery) November 30, 2024  He also reports that the Pelicans will likely pivot towards a rebuild after starting the season with four wins in 20 games. McCollum is a proven veteran. He can play on and off the ball, and while he’s not a traditional playmaker, he can handle point guard duties during stretches. He can also score from all three levels, giving any contending team a big boost. Finding someone who can fit his steep salary on their books will be easier said than done. Ingram is reportedly looking to get a max contract extension, and the market seems to be drying out for him. He’s struggled with injuries, and he’s also left plenty to be desired in crucial moments. The Pelicans have a lot of talent, but it doesn’t mean much when they can’t seem to stay healthy at the same time."

With that in mind, Shane Steichen’s team made four roster moves ahead of Sunday’s clash with the New England Patriots.

He’s made three appearances this season in his second stint with the organization after playing one game as a rookie in 2023, and he’s a candidate to be back to the practice squad at some point. Mafi, on the other hand, has already played for this team. He was elevated in Weeks 11 and 12 and played both times. He joined the team’s practice squad in August after spending his rookie season with the New England Patriots. A former first-round pick out of UCLA, he made 17 appearances (five starts) last season. Glowinski joined the practice squad less than two weeks ago. He had already played for the team for four years, between 2018 and 2021.

After observing the rest of Austin’s entertaining pre-match conference, Sandro heads to the dressing room to get ready for his first training session with the Southern League Premier Division Central club — more than two years after he last played competitive football. ‘I think I can do it,’ jokes the 35-year-old as he ambles on to the 4G pitch in near-freezing temperatures, the last player to join the group following a massage and his own interview commitments. ‘He just said to me, “Have you got any gloves?” Austin said as he follows Sandro out of the tunnel. ‘I said, “No, get out there”.’      Former Tottenham and Brazil midfielder Sandro signed for Harborough Town on November 5       Sandro spoke to Mail Sport this week ahead of his first appearance in the FA Cup since 2016      Sandro played in 106 first-team games for Spurs between 2010 and 2014, scoring three goals But if his late arrival, massage and gloves request appear to paint the ex-Premier League star as a prima donna, that could not be further from reality. No, this is a man who has come out of retirement to play for free for the seventh-tier Midlands club in the biggest match in their history — Sunday’s FA Cup second-round tie at Reading. And all as a goodwill gesture following a chance meeting with Tottenham season ticket-holder Austin in a hospitality box earlier this season. ‘It’s a funny story,’ starts Sandro, who later poses for pictures with a replica of the FA Cup, which Austin was given when Harborough — who had never previously gone past the second qualifying round — reached the first-round proper. ‘I work for Tottenham at home games, talking to the fans. Mitch was in the restaurant and was saying, “Sandro, you look good, you should play for my team.” I said, “Yeah, why not, man, let’s go.” It was just like that.’ Sandro looks as trim as ever and signed for the Bees on November 5, but was banned from playing for two matches, having been sent off in his last pro appearance, for Belenenses in Portugal’s top flight in April 2022. He is, though, eligible to make his debut on Sunday for the lowest-ranked club left in the world’s oldest cup competition. ‘I thought I was finished and that I was never going to play again,’ Sandro says. ‘It is so magical for me after two years of just watching football and missing it. ‘Now I have an opportunity to express myself again in one tackle, one header. I used to play against Reading in the Premier League and now I am going to face them in the FA Cup.      His shock move to Harborough came more than 12 months after he had retired from football      Sandro pictured training with his team-mates ahead of Sunday’s FA Cup clash with Reading      As well as winning 17 senior caps for Brazil, Sandro played at the Olympic Games in 2012   ‘To be part of this and to enjoy myself and try to help them, it is just what I want. I know they are living the dream — and I am living the dream as well.’ Sandro’s retirement U-turn is perhaps the most eccentric act yet in a life that has been full of them. Famously, he became hooked on darts after moving to Tottenham for £8million from Internacional in Brazil in 2010, striking up an unlikely friendship with former world finalist Bobby George. When Mail Sport interviewed him at his home in Essex in 2012, he stunned our reporter by singing and strumming his guitar to Coldplay and the Black Eyed Peas. Twelve years on, Sandro breaks into song again when asked what tune he performed in front of Harborough’s players for his initiation. ‘Nossa, nossa, assim voce me mata,’ he sings tunefully in his native tongue. ‘In Brazil, it is a good song,’ Sandro says. If his dressing-room singing helped him integrate into the Harborough squad, so too did his attitude at training on Wednesday night, when he could be heard celebrating every tackle won by a team-mate in the small-sided games. That is not to say, though, that Sandro was not apprehensive about playing again after so long out of the game. ‘When I said yes to playing, I needed to start to run because I was just doing strength work in the gym, not running,’ he admits. ‘My body wasn’t ready to go again after two years. ‘I was back in Brazil last week and I called my friends and said, “You have to help me out here because I have a game coming up.” So we arranged a seven-a-side with friends and it was good.’      Sandro has refused to be paid by Harborough – even rejecting offers to cover his expenses   The next match he plays will be at Reading, where Sandro played for Tottenham in the Premier League in 2012, when he enjoyed a 3-1 win, thanks to two goals from Jermain Defoe and one from Gareth Bale. ‘Gareth, I always said that he was the best player I played with. He could do everything, anything,’ says Sandro, who spends most of his time in Portugal and has completed his UEFA B Licence as he bids to become a manager. Sandro also played alongside Brazilian superstars Ronaldinho, Neymar and Ronaldo, who he calls ‘Phenomenon’, during his 17-cap international career. ‘I enjoyed my time and I want to enjoy it again.’ His enjoyment could only be topped if Harborough — who have won two promotions in three seasons — beat Reading and are drawn away at Spurs in the third round. ‘How amazing that would be,’ he says, with another huge grin. ‘If that happens, count me in.’ Your email address will not be published.

Ahead of Sunday’s visit of Aston Villa, Colwill has also credited Enzo Maresca for turning the club into immediate top-four contenders. Having only lost to Manchester City and Liverpool this term, the Blues centre back went as far as saying Maresca has removed the ‘question mark’ which was previously hanging over Chelsea. Colwill has been ever-present in Chelsea’s defence this campaign and when discussing their attack led by Nicolas Jackson, he said: ‘I would be scared to play against us. The way we break teams down and create so many chances on goal is amazing. It’s no shock.   ‘When you are playing really good football, teams are going to change to try and hurt you. We just have to keep adapting to it, keep playing our football and keep winning games. Villa is the perfect opportunity for us to go out there and put on a show for the fans and win the game. ‘It’s due to the manager. He’s come in and given us that confidence. He’s set us up amazingly. We’re going into games and, it’s fair to say, we’re battering most teams. We’re playing really good football.  People are not looking at us with a question mark anymore. They know we’re going to play good football and try to win games. That is what we have been doing.’      Levi Colwill says he would be ‘scared’ to play Chelsea if he was a member of an opposing team      The Blues climbed up to third in the Premier League after beating Leicester 2-1 at the King Power      Colwill has been ever-present in Enzo Maresca’s A team that has contested matches in the Premier League Colwill was speaking to reporters after Chelsea’s Conference League win in Heidenheim on Thursday. On Maresca giving him the opportunity in central defence in his A team, the 21-year-old Englishman continued: ‘There is nothing more I could ask for. The gaffer has given me that trust, for me to play my best football on the pitch, and I have got no excuses.’ Asked if he is happier at centre back than left back, where he has previously been used, he added: ‘Definitely. I will happily play anywhere for the team, but I like to be put in the position where I can play my football, show my skills and be able to show everyone what I can do.  ‘That is what I have been doing this season because of the manager. I’m hoping it carries on.’ Colwill is currently living at home with his parents – and his XL bully Stormz – as he said: ’It’s worth it. I could not complain one bit about living at home.

Saka was instrumental for the Gunners as they ran riot in the London derby, with his corner finding Gabriel who duly headed home after just ten minutes to put the visitors in front. The England international then set up Leandro Trossard for Arsenal’s second, as the Belgian converted from close range to finish off a well-worked move.   Just minutes later Saka had a golden opportunity to get his name on the scoresheet when the referee pointed to the spot after he was brought down by Lucas Paqueta after again breaking through the Hammers’ defence Though it initially appeared he would step to take the penalty, Saka unselfishly handed the ball to captain Martin Odegaard, who sent Lukasz Fabianski the wrong way to secure his first goal of the season. Kai Havertz made it four shortly after, but West Ham proved they were not prepared to lay down and threatened to mount a comeback with quick-fire goals from Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Emerson Palmieri.      Jamie Redknapp hailed Bukayo Saka’s performance as Arsenal ran riot against West Ham      Saka was instrumental as the Gunners netted five times in the first half at the London Stadium      The 23-year-old netted a penalty on the brink of half-time and contributed a pair of assists Those hopes were quickly dashed however, as the referee again awarded Mikel Arteta’s side a spot-kick on the brink of half-time. This time Saka did step up, and he subsequently continued his exemplary record from 12 yards to make it 5-2 to the Gunners. Arsenal showcased their game management in the second half to maintain the scoreline and move back into second in the Premier League table following a recent dip in form. The man-of-the-match winning performance saw Saka take his tally of assists to ten for the season from just 12 appearances, and Redknapp insisted having a player of his quality would be a ‘dream’ for any team to have at their disposal. ‘He’s an incredible role model,’ Redknapp said on Sky Sports. ‘So intelligent. Eloquent, knows the game inside out. He comes across as a fine young man It must be a dream for any manager.  ‘The job that he’s doing and the improvement he’s making every day is frightening.  ‘He can score goals he can make goals, he’s got great desire, he runs in behind, he’s so difficult to defend against.’      The current record for a single campaign is 20, jointly held by Thierry Henry(pictured) and Kevin De Bruyne      But former Arsenal star Theo Walcott insisted Saka is capable of breaking the record      Since making his league debut in 2019, Saka has recorded 52 assists in 182 appearances for Arsenal   The current record for most assists in a single Premier League campaign is shared by Thierry Henry and Kevin De Bruyne, who both registered 20 in the 2002-03 and 2019-20 seasons respectively. Theo Walcott added that Saka has what it takes to break the record and hailed the 23-year-old’s maturity. ‘He’s on his way with a long part of the season without his partner in crime Odegaard,’ he said.  ‘It’s incredible stats. He’s just playing with confidence. The smile on his face when he speaks about Man united, he’s already speaking about Man United!  ‘He’s always up for the challenge. At such a tender age he’s so experienced. He’s making that position his own.  ‘It’s incredible to be that involved at this stage in the season, to stay consistently fit as well.’ Arsenal play host to United next weekend, with the club still undefeated in all competitions since Erik ten Hag was sacked last month.  Your email address will not be published.

Before their 23-20 victory over the Chicago Bears on Thanksgiving, Lions running back Jahmyr Gibbs shared a photo on his Instagram story which showed teammate Jermar Jefferson stood in front of a whiteboard filled with specific plays. Fans were quick to spot that the whiteboard was filled with specific offensive plays, though it is unclear whether Detroit actually uses any of them in-game or not.   Regardless, Gibbs, 22, risked exposing team secrets by posting the photo on Instagram – and Campbell was unaware of it up until a press conference on Saturday. The Lions coach was told by a reporter in that press conference about his player’s actions, which appeared to leave him both stunned and furious in equal measure. When told about Gibbs’ apparent leak on social media and asked if he needs to remind him to be smart about posting online, Campbell said: ‘Oh, I didn’t know that. I did not know that.

Did not know that.’ Before swiftly leaving the press conference, he added: ‘Yeah, I’d rather our stuff not be out there. Thanks.’ Gibbs is currently in his second season with the Lions after being selected with the 12th overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft. The former Alabama college star has been a crucial member of Campbell’s offense in 2024, recording a total of 973 rushing yards and 11 total touchdowns so far, both of which rank in the top five in the NFL.  He has helped Detroit flex its muscles as a major Super Bowl contender by winning 11 of their 12 regular-season fixtures, with the only slip-up coming against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 2. Next up for the Lions is a huge showdown with the Green Bay Packers at Ford Field next Thursday.  Your email address will not be published.

Come Sunday night, when the Bills take on the San Francisco 49ers at a snowy Highmark Stadium, it will have been 420 days since Milano suited up for game. The former All-Pro has been out since the Bills faced the Jaguars in London last season and his return is a huge boost for the Super Bowl hopefuls.   Milano missed Buffalo’s first 11 games of the NFL season after suffering a bicep tear back in mid-August. It came after the key defensive weapon suffered a season-ending leg injury against Jacksonville.  The Bills have also elevated quarterback Mike White and tight end Zach Davidson from the practice squad, with defensive tackle DeWayne Carter downgraded to out. San Francisco, meanwhile, has been boosted by the news that Brock Purdy is set to return for their potentially season-defining game against the Bills.      Matt Milano is this weekend set to play his first game for the Buffalo Bills since October 2023       The former All-Pro has been out since the Bills faced the Jaguars in London last season  Buffalo’s Highmark Stadium is caked in snow just a day before this Sunday’s showdown against the San Francisco 49ers.  Temperatures had already fallen below freezing by Saturday afternoon, with up to 4ft of snow expected before Sunday’s NFL clash. But Buffalo was already painted white a day earlier as the weather turned brutal in Western New York. Footage and pictures from Orchard Park showed the area around Highmark Stadium covered in snow, with visibility very limited and cars battling slushy roads. Ahead of Sunday’s game, the Bills put a call out for volunteers to help clear the stadium in anticipation of the winter snow. ‘The rate of pay will be $20 per hour with food and hot beverages provided,’ the team said.

Plus, Arsenal want a player with a €100 million price tag and Chelsea face a battle to land boyhood Blue Patrick Dorgu. There’s plenty to cover, so let’s jump right in. Ruben Amorim has decided that Marcus Rashford does not suit his system at Man Utd and he is, therefore, on the transfer list. To replace him, Man Utd could bring in a standout player from the Eredivisie – even though Erik ten Hag is now gone! Arsenal are among the many clubs keen on Dortmund youngster Jamie Gittens – but he has a €100m price tag. He continued his good form against Bayern in Der Klassiker and showed that he would be perfect for the Gunners. On Friday, it was claimed that Chelsea were leading the race for Serie A sensation Patrick Dorgu, but now Man Utd are also in the race. Barcelona slumped to another shock LaLiga result, once again illustrating their unhealthy dependence on Lamine Yamal. Finally, let’s finish up with some more transfer news from around the world. Douglas Luiz could be Man City’s wildcard Rodri replacement. Joshua Zirkzee is ready to leave Man Utd for Serie A. RB Leipzig’s dire run of results is threatening to push Benjamin Sesko to Arsenal – but there’s a major concern for the Gunners. Several clubs are enquiring about Chelsea defender Benoit Badiashile ahead of January. Carlo Ancelotti has accepted that Vinicius Jr will have to make way for Kylian Mbappe. But why is the Frenchman still underperforming? Emmanuel Petit has a bizarre explanation… Real Madrid are not only interested in Trent Alexander-Arnold but also in another Liverpool star. Lastly, Arsenal are facing a major, major fight if they want to stand a chance of signing Omar Marmoush. Your email address will not be published.

After winning a penalty after being brought down following a darting run into the box late in the second half, Obi-Martin stepped up to take the resulting spot kick and duly converted to give United the lead.

By opening the scoring Obi-Martin took his tally to 37 goals in the U18 Premier League, marking a new record in the competition. Obi-Martin’s stock has continued to rise since United were able to prize the Danish youth international from Arsenal this summer.

During his time at the Gunners, Obi-Martin scored a record-breaking 32 goals in just 20 appearances for the Gunners’ Under-18 side.  His return last season was the most ever scored by an Arsenal player at that level in a single campaign, beating the previous record held by Folarin Balogun. Last season Obi-Martin scored ten goals in one game for Arsenal Under-16s against Liverpool.  He also hit seven goals for the Under-18s against Norwich and scored five against West Ham.  Your email address will not be published.

The winger scored from the penalty spot and set up three more in a crazy first half that saw seven goals before the break for the only the fourth time in Premier League history. Arsenal have now picked up three wins in the last week, also scoring five past Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League, as they put behind them a poor run of just two victories in their previous seven games.   ‘Definitely, the last three games, we’ve been back, back to our best, back to our best way of playing,’ said Saka. ‘We’re fluid, we’re dynamic and you can see the movements, the rotations, everything looks good. We need to continue like this, we played three good games but we know in this league it’s not enough.’ Arsenal’s win moved them up to second in the Premier League table and manager Mikel Arteta said it means his side can now enjoy watching the huge title clash between Liverpool and Manchester City on Sunday afternoon. ‘We have got some momentum, we have some flow back and a real determination,’ said Arteta. ‘Three wins in a row is great. We are going to enjoy tonight and watch a beautiful game of football tomorrow.      Bukayo Saka warned Arsenal’s title rivals that the Gunners are ‘back to our best’       The Gunners romped to a 5-2 win at West Ham and move up to second in the table ‘The first half was crazy,’ added Arteta, whose side raced into a 4-0 lead after 34 minutes before West Ham struck twice in quick succession only for Saka to slot home a fifth before half-time. ‘It was a spectacular first 30 minutes, straight away how much the team wanted it.’ Coming off the back of their thumping 5-1 win against Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League in midweek, this result saw Arsenal became only the third English top-flight side to score five goals in five different away games in a calendar year after Sunderland in 1892 and Manchester City in 1937. West Ham, meanwhile, crashed back down to earth after their shock win at Newcastle on Monday night. Under-pressure manager Julen Lopetegui watched on from the director’s box as he served his touchline ban and felt that Arsenal’s first goal, scored by Gabriel from a corner, should have been disallowed for a push on Lucas Paqueta at the near post. He also questioned the decision to award Arsenal their second penalty when goalkeeper Lukas Fabianski punched Gabriel in the head. ‘We are very frustrated,’ said Lopetegui. ‘We are at home and despite playing against one of the best teams in the world, we can and have to do better. ‘It was a very, very strange first half. We didn’t deserve two goals and they didn’t deserve to score five. Their first one was a set piece that we prepared but, in my opinion, it is a very clear foul. If it’s not a foul, we have to review in my opinion about the rules. ‘After we have to do better with the second and third goal. The fifth goal, before half-time, killed the match.      Mikel Arteta insists his title-chasing side have ‘momentum’ after a third consecutive win  ‘It wasn’t a penalty.

Douglas Luiz is enduring a difficult time at Juventus and is already looking for a way out, according to Italian media. The Brazilian has become a hotly debated player in Turin and beyond. Luiz was signed by Juventus in the summer as part of a strange deal that saw the Bianconeri part with €50 million and two players to help Aston Villa balance the books. The Premier League side needed to raise funds and agreed to let their star midfielder depart for about half of what they had demanded in the January window. The transfer has so far not worked out for any of the players involved.  Premier League top scorers 2024/25 – Saka strikes before Salah faces Haaland Samuel Iling-Junior and Enzo Barrenechea were immediately sent out on loan by Aston Villa, while Luiz has endured a tough time in Serie A. The 26-year-old did not leave a particularly positive impression in pre-season and failed to grasp the few opportunities he was given by coach Thiago Motta. He gave away penalties in back-to-back games against Leipzig and Cagliari and soon thereafter suffered an injury that has now kept him out for over a month. According to Gazzetta dello Sport, Juventus are open to a January transfer and the player is ‘looking for a club.’ The potential availability of Luiz will have put Premier League sides on red alert given that he was one of the best midfielders in the division prior to his departure for Turin. One club definitely in the market for a midfielder are Man City. Rodri is out for the season and the Cityzens are scouring the market for potential January reinforcements. On the face of it, Luiz does not seem a like-for-like replacement for the Ballon d’Or winner and, after all, that is the kind of player City are targeting. Rodri is the glue that held Pep Guardiola’s side together and the Premier League champions want another player just like that. Despite this, Luiz could actually be a wildcard Rodri replacement should other targets prove unattainable, such as Martin Zubimendi who has always been reluctant to leave boyhood club Real Sociedad. Luiz is not a defensive midfielder in the traditional sense, but neither is Rodri in Guardiola’s system. City push up so high during games to squeeze the opposition that the Spaniard regularly finds himself in and around the opposition box similar to Luiz. The Brazilian has experience in every conceivable midfield role and, of course, he was previously on the books at City but never played a competitive match due to work permit issues, which obviously won’t be a problem anymore.  Premier League most assists – Saka runaway leader after West Ham spectacle The Athletic’s JJ Bull has pointed out an interesting bit of information regarding City’s fragility without Rodri: the Spaniard is the only player in the side who seems capable of fouling, thereby stopping the counter-attacks that the team is so vulnerable to. In recent years, Rodri has, by quite some distance, carried out the most fouls of any Man City player and if we look at the Premier League statistics for last season, we see that Luiz actually committed more fouls for Villa (51 – the 10th most in the league) than Rodri (41). Luiz is a much more mobile player than Mateo Kovacic and Ilkay Gundogan and more robust and tenacious than Rico Lewis and Matheus Nunes, potentially making him a more suitable replacement for Rodri than he would seem at first glance. Data analytics firm SciSports seems to agree as they give Luiz a good Club Fit rating of 78 for Man City, which is a better score than his current side Juventus and ex-club Aston Villa boast. There is a compelling case to be made that Luiz, when fit, could be a viable Rodri replacement. Your email address will not be published.

The Bears fell to a 23-20 loss against Detroit after a last-play mishap that saw Caleb Williams throw downfield as the play clock hit zero – despite Chicago still having a timeout to use. It was the latest in a number of disappointments this season – and it proved the final straw for the Bears hierarchy, who fired Eberflus earlier this week.   He became the first ever Bears head coach to be fired mid-season and now details have begun to emerge about Eberflus’ downfall. According to the Athletic, the coach urged the team to ‘stick together’ in a post-game speech to his players. But, instead, the locker room was described as ‘ugly’ and ‘frustrated’ with a ‘lot of yelling’ as tempers frayed over more ‘bad time-management and decision-making.’      The Bears locker room turned ‘ugly’ after Matt Eberflus’ final game in charge against the Lions      Team captain Jaylon Johnson (L) is said to have gone ‘crazy’ following the loss to Detroit       With rookie Caleb Williams at quarterback, the Bears have lost six consecutive games Team captain Jaylon Johnson is said to have gone ‘crazy’, with another player telling the Athletic that the cornerback was ’emotional and p****d but rightfully so’. It’s said that Johnson’s fury was primarily aimed in Eberflus’ direction and he was not the only person to voice their annoyance. A number of figures were reportedly ‘furious’, with one staff member branding their frustration ‘an accumulation of this season’. According to the Athletic, emotions ran so high that the head coach left the locker room immediately after the outbursts. Eberflus was fired with the Bears sitting bottom of the NFC North with a 4-8 record. Chicago has lost all of its past six games. But reports claim that frustrations with the coaching staff had been ‘bubbling’ since the offseason, when new offensive coordinator Shane Waldron began to alter Chicago’s run game. Some team leaders, it’s said, felt Waldron’s system was not helping the development of rookie QB Williams. ‘Where they messed up was with Shane and making him the coordinator to begin with,’ one player told The Athletic. The Bears fired Waldron on November 12 – he was the first Bears’ offensive coordinator fired during the season, too  Your email address will not be published.
